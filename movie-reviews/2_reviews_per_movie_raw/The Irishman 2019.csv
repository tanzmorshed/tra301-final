","The last 5 minutes of the movie explain everything. 2 things:<br/><br/>1- The photo of his daughter and Jimmy. These 2 persons are these ones that he loves the most. It reminds him how he lost them both. Frank killed his best friend and he lost his daughter after she understood he did it.<br/><br/>2- The door half open at 1 minute before the end. Jimmy used to let the door of his bedroom open because he trusted Frank. Frank broke the trust and as a result he could never talk to his daughter again. This door represent the trust, and show that trust must never be broken. Trust is even more important than love because without trust there can be no real love.<br/><br/>Great movie, great actors, congratulations Mr Scorsese."
"Jeremy_Urquhart","10","1035","1381","8 November 2019"," It's brilliant, but best to go in with as few expectations as possible
","When I love a movie as much as I loved The Irishman, I feel torn. On one hand, I want to review it and rave about it and try to convince others to see it. But then on the other hand, I realise that doing so could set expectations too high, which could then lead to some people getting disappointed (this happens a lot with horror movies that get hyped at film festivals and then rejected by disappointed wide audiences, like with The Witch, It Follows, and Hereditary).<br/><br/>So that leaves me in a tricky situation, and I'll compromise by praising the film as much as I can without overhyping, whilst also making vague comments that won't be specific enough to ruin what the film has to offer (because yes: it's a Scorsese film. He has an incredibly varied filmography when you break down just what he's made over the last half-century, and so you're never going to get exactly what you'd expect).<br/><br/>Okay, acting: phenomenal. Besides Goodfellas, Pesci's best performance ever. This is the best De Niro's been since Cape Fear. This is the best Al Pacino has been in at least three decades. These men are old, and all accomplished and wealthy enough to retire happily at this point, but thankfully they all agreed to not only star in this movie, but commit themselves 100%. No one's phoning it in here. While the supporting cast are uniformly solid, these three steal the show and I hope all get Oscar nominations come awards season.<br/><br/>Scorsese, to no one's surprise, directs brilliantly throughout, making every scene purposeful and captivating. The movie is long, but deservedly so. The various pay-offs towards the film's conclusion would not hit nearly as hard if the film didn't spend so long building character, suspense, and emotion.<br/><br/>As crude as it might sound, this movie- at about the halfway point- made me forget how badly I needed to use the theatre's restroom. At a certain point, I accepted that I couldn't miss a second, and leaving the room for even a moment was totally out of the question.<br/><br/>If you can see this at a cinema, and can handle three and a half hours without a toilet or snack break (no intermission!), then by all means, watch it on a big screen, because it's beautiful and ultimately the best way to experience a film of this scope and spectacle. But it'll be on Netflix soon, and perhaps some would prefer to watch it in the comfort of their own home, where snack/toilet breaks are possible.<br/><br/>Whatever you do, make sure you ultimately watch it. Films like this don't come around too often, and this is such a perfect swan-song for this talented group that I doubt we'll see these legends together again.<br/><br/>It's bittersweet, but if this is Scorsese's, De Niro's, Pacino's and Pesci's farewell to the crime genre, then it's an amazing note to go out on."

","I don't know where to start on this one other than thanking Netflix for being the only distributor to fund this movie so we could see Big screen legends take their last big swing. The set and screen is smaller than I liked it to be, it being released on a streaming site but it's better than never seeing it.<br/><br/>It's not a flawless movie and I wouldn't necessarily call it a masterpiece or something new and innovative. But for an old genre gangsta flick it's easily one of the best ones out there.<br/><br/>The plot is a lot like Godfather 2 from De Niros perspective but that's all there is. It is more grounded and far too subtle compared to Goodfellas. And that's a good thing considering the age of the lead actors in the movie. But that doesn't mean its dull, gray and dreary because it isn't. It is surprisingly humorous, has some very serious scenes and doesn't shy away from giving us a blast of nostalgia every now and then.<br/><br/>The cinematography is quite different from the usual modern movies we are accustomed to. It doesn't have an overabundance of Wes Anderson symmetric shots or Roger Deakins like Wide angle shots. The film was shot in a very old timey way with the camera pans and edits. The editing in the movie is great and the score is fitting. Technical aspects considered it isn't innovative or something jawdropping, but that was never supposed to be the main focus of the movie.<br/><br/>The main focus for me was absolutely the acting. And why wouldn't it be with a cast like this? Al Pacino and Robert De Niro for the 1st time on screen together since Heat. Joe Pesci and De Niro since Goodfellas. Joe Pesci coming out of retirement and Martin Scorsese directing all these legends on screen together! If this doesn't get you excited for this film then I'm afraid nothing will.<br/><br/>Speaking of acting my god do they act! Robert De Niro gives his best performance in his older age with this. Joaquin Phoenix was a top contender for best Actor Oscar and I agreed with that but after watching THE IRISHMAN everything changed. Robert De Niro basically steals his Oscar like a gangsta and gives the best performance of the year so far. Old Bobby here still giving top notch actors a run for their money and the guy is 76 years old!<br/><br/>When was the last time you saw Al Pacino give a really good performance? Well that's exactly what he does here and it feels so good to see him find his glory days. He is his usual shouty self but shines better when he tones it down and let expressions speak.<br/><br/>And boy have I missed Joe Pesci over the years and don't worry he's still intense as usual. And that's weird considering he is extremely toned down in this movie. If you're looking for a violent Joe Pesci like he was in Goodfellas you'll be disappointed. But if you're looking for an intimidating Pesci with a huge presence then you're in the right place.<br/><br/>Harvey Keitel is in the movie for a very short time but he did his job fantastically. Ray Romano was a surprising standout and I can't believe how he kept up on the same plane as some of these industry legends. He doesn't really have a bigger role and basically gets lost as the film progresses but he made the most of his screentime.<br/><br/>The film is 3hours and 30 minutes long but it never felt that long honestly. The first 2 hours went by a breeze but the 3rd hour was unapologetically slow. It felt a bit dragged on during the final hour and felt it was skipping ahead at the same time. it wasn't boring in any way but felt it could've been handled better. The CGI de-aging is so good that after a while you get confused how old the lead actors actually are. This is the best de-aging tech I've ever seen honestly.<br/><br/>Despite it being slow in the latter end it still is a fantastic film. It doesn't set out to do something different, it doesn't try to set it aside from the herd. Scorsese did what he does best and made the movie he wanted to make. Its more of a last big hurrah for these living legends than something out to be a flawless masterpiece. It will most likely be the last of its kind and also the last collaboration of Scorsese with these acting legends. Considering the time we are in this might as well be the last Scorsese film, it most definitely is the last Joe Pesci appearance in a movie and the last good mobster hit with genre legends like Al Pacino and De Niro. So enjoy it while you can and savor it. Remember this movie 10 years from now and rejoice that you were alive to witness something truly fantastic. THE IRISHMAN is a farewell for most of these legends and a loveletter to the genre. It's the last of its kind and it went out in true mobster style."

","You have to be absolutely out of your mind to legitimately think that this is Scorcese at his best and ignore all the flaws in this movie. Yes, I get it, he made a lot of great movies in his time, but this isn't one of them.<br/><br/>A scene early on with Deniro beating someone up sums up the movie pretty well. The random no-name actor getting beat up is the only one exhibiting any emotion, as Deniro's character and his daughter sleepwalk their way through the scene like most of the cast does through most other scenes. It can be a bit hard to tell though since the camera zooms out so far that you can hardly see their faces, probably in an effort to avoid using the piss poor de-aging effects during an ""action"" scene, but it doesn't much matter because it's still close enough that we can see Deniro noticeably physically struggling to get through the scene. It looks awful and its depressing to see Deniro like this and to realize that Scorcese thought this scene was ok like this (why would they not have just used a stand-in here?), and this is pretty much how the movie feels in general.<br/><br/>This is a very noticeably weak effort from Scorcese. Most of the characters are wooden and just seem bored to be there. Pesci and Deniro are shockingly lifeless here. Pacino seems to be the only one giving any effort, but even his performance only comes off like a pale imitation of his old self.<br/><br/>Again, the de-aging effects are very weak and it's pretty jarring to see the flashback version of Deniro's character be referred to as if he's a young man (Pesci even calls him KID), but still looks like he's about 50.<br/><br/>There are a ton of side characters introduced, most of which disappear immediately after their introductions and serve no real purpose. Likewise there are many vestigial scenes that serve no purpose to advance either plot or character.<br/><br/>The plot is of course your typical gangster fare that we've seen from Scorcese so many times already. Guy gets into a life of crime, rises in the ranks, gets rich and lives it up, and then everything comes crashing down because he and everyone else he knows are absolutely terrible people, blah blah blah, we've seen it all before, but you know, you take something more recent of his like The Wolf of Wall Street and even though it uses that same old formula it still manages to be interesting because the characters have such personality and style and they keep your eyes glued to the conflict even though you already know exactly where it's going.<br/><br/>Here? Not so much. The Irishman is an absolutely unremarkable mobster story with completely forgettable characters that don't seem at all interested in their roles and some production values and cinematography that the so-called king of cinema should be embarrassed to be associated with, and let me tell you, you people defending this weak excuse for a film aren't doing Scorcese or ""cinema"" any favors by blindly swallowing this crap and acting like it's the greatest thing you've ever seen. If you're so willing to suck down any product, no matter how bad, just because it has a big time famous name attached to it than you're really no better than the popcorn action movies and fans that you're so quick to condemn.<br/><br/>As someone who's seen every Scorcese film before this, this is a 5/10 AT BEST and I will never pretend otherwise just because he did a lot of great films in the past."
"pedroborges-90881","6","50","67","30 May 2020"," Good but also boring
","Great acting, very good cinematography and we all know that Scorsese is a amazing director, but the movie is very long, and feels very long, a lot of great movies are very long and they are great, like Lawrence of Arabia and Schindler's List for example, they are classics and in my opinion The Irishman is not going to enter in this category.<br/><br/>Also the de-aging CGI is not convincing, and why putting those contact lens in De Niro eyes, when Scorsese made The Aviator he didn't put contact lens on Dicaprio, in Casino, De Niro didn't look anything like the character he was playing, it was unnecessary, probably Netflix fault.<br/><br/>The most positive point of the film was Joe Pesci performance, he is very contained but can also show that he is a very dangerous person, very different than the roles he played in others Scorsese's films, which are also great, and some other movies he starred during his career.<br/><br/>Looks like we never going to have a great movie with De Niro and Pacino playing two real old guys with a lot of screen time together, and i'm not saying that a lot of screen time together is necessarily better, for example in Righteous Kill they also have a lot screen time, but that movie was bad, in Heat they have only one scene together, two if you counting their confront in the end, but that famous scene in Heat was extremely well written, acted and with perfect timing, but this is for another review."

","I was able to attend the NYC premiere this afternoon. Now that I've gotten over the shock of seeing so many celebrities, I'm able to happily to say that this movie, while being quite long, deserves to be remembered as one of Scorsese's great films.<br/><br/>The Irishman reminds me a bit of Tarantino's recent hit Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, both because it's a period piece and also because you need to know a little history to understand the direction of the narrative. The movie, while following Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) as the titular character, revolves around Teamsters union boss James Riddle Hoffa (played with intense and hilarious fervor by Al Pacino). Fortunately Frank goes to great lengths to narrate the story for the audience and provides a healthy dose of context for those of us not from the Kennedy era. The main thing you need to know going in is that Jimmy Hoffa had mob ties, and that he vanished in 1975 and was presumed murdered by mob bosses for being ""uncooperative"".<br/><br/>The movie unfolds over four acts, told over several decades by Frank Sheeran. In act one, Frank is introduced as a WWII veteran who is stuck driving food delivery trucks in and around Philadelphia. He has the bright idea to steal some of the steaks that he's delivering, and sell them to local mobster Felix ""Skinny Razor"" DiTullio (Bobby Cannavale). Eventually his brazen willingness to break the law catches the eye of Italian mob boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), who happens to be a mobster on a national level. His calm demeanor is both comical yet terrifying. A soon to be classic line encompasses Bufalino perfectly: ""You might be demonstrating a failure to show appreciation."" Under his mentorship, Frank becomes a ruthless action man for the italian mob and explains with rather entertaining dispassion how he does his job properly. In act two, Russell introduces Frank to Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the outspoken and fearless president of the National Teamsters Union. Their relationship grows and Hoffa becomes Frank's second mentor. Together they use intimidation and bribery to gain influence until the election of John Kennedy, who subsequently appoints his brother Bobby Kennedy as Attorney General and immediately goes after Hoffa.<br/><br/>The first two and a half hours are the most fun, and in particular the end of act three is some of the most tense and dramatic storytelling that I have had the pleasure of seeing in recent memory. At a dinner celebration for Frank (who eventually becomes a Teamster boss himself), tensions between Hoffa, Bufalino and the other mobsters reaches a breaking point, and the decision is made to make Hoffa disappear. But in a gut wrenching twist, Frank is the one tasked to do the job. In a beautiful display of cinematography over a thirty-minute buildup, Scorsese forces the viewer to the edge of their seats with the dread of what's about to happen. Robert De Niro's performance in these moments is master class; the inner conflict is all the more apparent thanks all of the time we spent watching Frank being raised by Bufalino and Hoffa in equal measure. I plan to watch this part of the film again, probably with a notepad.<br/><br/>Getting away from the plot a bit, the movie is actually surprisingly funny. In one particular scene, someone insults an older Bufalino at a dinner reception. He and Frank exchange glances, and the frame suddenly cuts to a hotel bed covered in guns. Frank then narrates with excess detail and hilarious dispassion the ideal weapon for a public assassination. Moments like these are littered throughout the film and keep it from getting too bogged down in it's violence. It's impressive how quickly jokes fly, given the disproportionate amount of people getting shot point blank in the head. But anyone who has seen Scorsese's Goodfellas or The Departed will feel right at home.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie is definitely Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. De Niro was de-aged with apparently exorbitantly priced CGI, as he is supposed to be younger than both Pacino and Pesci. While it's fairly obvious, I was never too distracted to not enjoy what was unfolding onscreen. Plus he's kind of made a career of holding one scowling facial expression, so that probably was a little easier to edit. Al Pacino is a riot as Hoffa, and is certainly one of the most arrogant, over-the-top characters that Pacino has played in awhile. Pesci as Bufalino is chilling, and it's fun to seem him as the boss in this gangster movie after being a junior-level mobster in Goodfellas so many years ago. The mentorship between De Niro's character and both Pacino and Pesci is amazingly entertaining.<br/><br/>The only thing keeping me from calling this movie perfect is it's length. Three hours and (almost) thirty minutes is a very long time, and while occurring infrequently the movie does drag a bit. This is most apparent in the fourth act where Frank introspects during his final years, and attempts to achieve reconciliation for all the murders he's committed. It doesn't really offer any closure or seem necessary to wrapping up the narrative.<br/><br/>Ultimately that doesn't even come close to making me not recommend seeing The Irishman. There's a reason Martin Scorsese will forever be known for his gangster movies. Combining comedy, violence, brotherhood and drama, he has created a formula that continues to work. The fact that he continues to make excellent movies at 76 years old blows my mind. Well done."
"keelhaul-80856","5","293","450","2 December 2019"," I love Scorsese and all the great mobster flicks, but this one is OVERRATED...
","I love all the films of this genre-- Casino, Once Upon a Time in America, Goodfellas, Godfather, Mean Streets, Scarface, The Departed, Carlito's Way, Taxi Driver, etc. Scorsese makes some awesome epics, and I like a wide variety of other directors and their films in this vein. However, I find the hype and the hooplah around this one to fall a bit flat. I am sure I will receive some hate for this opinion, but this movie is nowhere near the level of Goodfellas or Scarface.<br/><br/>1) The Run Time= I am fine with a 3.5 hour movie, but it needs to be great enough to fill that amount of time. I mean, at least 60-75% of it should be amazing. This movie is WAY TOO LONG for no reason. I can think of about 5 scenes that could be cut or condensed that did nothing to further the plot.<br/><br/>2) The Aging and De-Aging of Actors= This was actually very distracting from the movie, and made me laugh in several scenes. Was this really NECESSARY? It seemed cheap and corny, and it really takes away from the movie instead of helping it. Wouldn't it be better to just get younger actors to play the really young scenes of DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino, etc??? No one is buying the age of these guys, even with CGI technology and effects. It ruined the belief of the moment.<br/><br/>3) Pesci looked 139 years old throughout the movie, even in scenes where he is supposed to be young.<br/><br/>4) Harvey Keitel's talent and presence was greatly wasted, as I barely remember anything that he did or said.<br/><br/>5) The Women= the ladies are mentioned at the start of the film by name, and then become completely irrelevant to anything that goes on for 3 hours. They were extremely underdeveloped. This was one thing that complimented Goodfellas well- Ray Liotta's wife was always in the mix, or screwing something up, or threatening to kill him, etc.<br/><br/>6) Lack of Suspense or Action= This movie became very run-of-the-mill boring after an hour or so. Nothing surprised me, nothing was exciting, and the action is so neutered and far between that I forgot I was watching a gangster flick. I can still remember Pesci stabbing a guy in the throat with a pen in Casino, or Scarface's last stand, or the beatings given out in Goodfellas. This movie barely had ANY MEMORABLE SCENES that stand out. The only great ones were a couple of really quick and realistic shootings of guys on the street or in an eatery by DeNiro.<br/><br/>7) Pacino as Hoffa= He doesn't even resemble Hoffa at all, and neither do other people portraying certain characters. Robert Kennedy comes to mind as well.<br/><br/>This is a decent movie, with great production values, classic actors, a legendary director, and nostalgic music with a great soundtrack. However, I just think a 8 or 9 rating is BS for this project. EVERYONE IS SIMPLY SAYING WHAT THEY ARE TOLD TO SAY, just like every other overhyped movie or author or artist. It is a good movie, but far from a masterpiece, or Scorsese's crowning achievement, despite what everyone says.<br/><br/>Scarface, Goodfellas, Godfather, Departed= all light years beyond this movie, and with a shorter run time. This film needed to be tightened up and given some better scenes. It is interesting, but overbloated and overhyped due to the cast and director-- which can do no wrong in the minds of the average critic or average joe."
"CarsonTrent","6","1262","2033","27 November 2019"," Weak by any standard but by Scorsese it's very
","Sadly a sub-par effort from one of my all time favorite directors. The story is weak (by Scorsese standard) and overly stretched. I can understand the appeal to revisit his trademark Italian gangster genre one more time, but this one feels unnecessary. The also trademark Scorsese humor is in-existent (except for the painting walls bit). De Niro looks disoriented, in the worst physical (hunched over almost the whole movie) and acting shape ever and out of place. Not very surprising, either. He spent the better part of the last 15 to 20 years doing mock impressions of himself which after the novelty faded ended him up in a series of quite dubious productions. That's a very long time to lower the bar and obviously takes its toll.<br/><br/>The De-aging technique is unconvincing when the actors move. Their faces look animated, fake. There is little and uninspired music. Keitel looks fantastic but is underused. Pacino kinda overacts on occasion. Pesci looks fantastic and is in top form acting-wise but he's also in a supporting role (he's the best part of the movie) so he doesn't have a big impact on the movie. Romano is in top form but his part is also small.<br/><br/>The movie is slow, linear, extremely long, predictable (how often have we seen the Hoffa story on screen? a superior version starring Nicholson comes to mind) and dull. There isn't much going on action-wise. A lot of innuendo and he said they said, but aside some quite dull hit-jobs where de Niro is supposed to be in his prime but moves like a 75 year old the story is quite static. The dialog is stale. Stunts are weak to say the least (Pacino's double excessively hiding his face when he hits the floor in a fight and obviously wearing a wig and body padding, and the store owner more than obviously throwing himself through the window of the store while De Niro clumsily mimics hitting him around come to mind, rendering those scenes borderline laughable). Colors, interiors, costumes are all in shades of beige. Camera work is rigid. Plus the Hoffa story is old news to begin with, there are so many insane things going on right now and would translate better to the screen in 2019. The edgy fast paced crazy energy of the more recent Wolf of Wall Street (not to mention his earlier masterpieces Casino, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets or Goodfellas etc) seems that of a different director.<br/><br/>All in all the weakest film in Scorsese's portfolio and not above a 6 stars out of 10 by any standard (I'm inclined to be lenient mainly because he managed to bring Pesci out of retirement for this. But by Scorsese standard it's well below that). It's more of a self-indulgent piece of nostalgia best left unmentioned when it's all said and done. And I'm hopeful that Marty will surprise us with more of his best work in the future and we can sweep this one under the rug."
"theojhyman","6","1309","2140","13 October 2019"," Long, boring and disappointing
","While this is De Niro's best performance in years, and it's great to see Pesci back on screen, this film is strangely subdued and slow, and not half as entertaining or engrossing as either Goodfellas or Casino were. Unfortunately, this films seems to reflect a Scorsese who is aging, or perhaps the fault lies with the freedom that Netflix gave him, when a lot of editing could have been done to tighten this film up. Even if you're watching this on Netflix in say 3 x 70 minute sessions, not much really happens in this time to make it compelling enough to want to stay till the end. It's a strange film because it bares the distinct marks and style of a Scorsese film but is nowhere near as memorable as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull or The Departed (and perhaps Di Caprio and Damon would have been a better fit, rather than de-aging the actors via CGI). It could also be that the script just isn't as good as most of his previous films. I can't recommend this to many of my friends as I know they simply won't sit through this, unless they are hardcore De Niro or Scorsese fans."

Watching Robert DeNero in this film is almost sad. He plays the part of a guy in his prime, but the CGI face doesn't work. It looks animated at times and his body moves like a very old man ... even for DeNero's age of mid 70's.
The grocery sceen where DeNero beats up the store owner is just embarrassing to watch.
Joe Pesci comes out of retirement for this one and shines. He has a stare that burns a hole through you.
Al Pacino as the flamboyant Jimmy Hoffa works well.
Harvey's Keitel in a small mob boss roll is solid too.
But the editing is not together ... the movis drags ... and the fellas in the film unfortunately are just too old to pull this off convincingly.
It's too bad this wasn't made 25 years ago, it would have probably worked.

"rizzaxc","6","609","1034","10 November 2019"," Disappointing by Scorsese standards
","First off, let me set this straight that I'm not repeled by long or slow films. However, The Irishman is at the very least 30-40 minutes too long, and the suspense sometimes is killed off by characters dragging the scene too much. The biggest offender would be the second last arc which I'm not gonna spoil.<br/><br/>Secondly, for such a slow film you'd expect the pay off to be worth it, but it isn't. The message of the film is revealed very early on, and it's very obvious where this particular plot line is going to. These 2 factors (slow pace and obvious plotline) make the film feels particularly unrewarding to me.<br/><br/>Third is the lack of the 'wow' factor, which is disappointing for such a godlike cast and crew. There is not a single memorable scene or line that stands out for me, despite the actors all doing a phenomenal job. And no, I don't really mind the CGI, even though it's not the best thing since sliced bread. The music is not memorable either, even though it can be an artistic choice to make the film feels more grounded and unglamorous.<br/><br/>So where does this leave us? Personally I don't think this is a bad film, but it feels disappointing with such a big roster. Don't expect this to be the film to watch with friends over, as it's pretty (unneccessarily) lengthy and the undertone is meant to be a heavy one."

","Peoples are losing their minds over the sainted director, forgetting the movie. Sure, it's well made, fascinating history. But it's second nature for De Niro, and Pacino overreaches at times. The third reel is repetitive over the decline of the De Niro character. Would be a better movie at 2hr 30. In fact, I thought it had ended about then, but it meandered on another hour."
"okaikat","2","634","1114","28 November 2019"," What a mess of a movie
","I cannot fathom two things: how this movie cost so much to produce, and why they wasted so much money doing so. This movie like watching a documentary about a political campaign that never ends. Seriously, save yourself 3 hours of the most boring and monotonous mash up ever. There is virtually no action or incentive to keep watching. It's 90% people talking at tables with lines like ""Who said that?! oh he said that?!"" or ""Ok, well you talk to him Frank!"" and then Frank talks to him, and then Frank talks to the other guys, and then Frank talks to him, and rinse and repeat. Occasionally a few seconds are spared for shooting someone in the head and then that's it. You are constantly left searching for a reason to keep watching, but it never comes.<br/><br/>The acting is not even that good either. With the exception of De Niro and Joe Pesci, it seemed a little awkward. Al Pacino walks, talks and acts funny. They may have de-aged faces but the postures are very out of sync with their ages for almost all the actors. There was a scene where De Niro beats up a grocery guy that looked more like a rehearsal rather than an actual scene. I'm shocked they let it pass. I only laughed at one scene that had to do with ears and that's it (which is why I give this 2 stars instead of 1).<br/><br/>I also gotta say that the ending was so anti-climactic and long-winded that after the movie I seriously sat there for a moment and contemplated why I wasted all this time on this hyped up monstrosity. Everyone claiming this is a masterpiece is either paid to say so or are saying so because of all the fancy names attached to this title. Or maybe they think they're being hip acting like this was worth a damn, I don't know. What I do know is that this is a complete disaster of a film and a waste of your valuable time."

","I love Scorsese's films, but this was one, is just one too many. It lacked tight editing, scenes lingered far too long to make artistic points. The technology of that allowed the actors to be made younger was not impressive given the actors could not move as if they were younger. The one scene that made this point, was when De Niro's character roughs up a corner grocer for shoving his daughter. The scene is difficult to watch given De Niro seemed to struggle as much with his own lack of mobility to carry off the fight scene realistically despite having the willing and compliant younger actor. Al Pacino's character looked nothing like Hoffa. Yes the acting was good in general, but the story was just too drawn out and slow and the characters were just not that interesting to hold your attention. As a man of 58, the hardest fact is recognizing the increasing limitation as we age, this movie opens with De Niro's character in an assisted care facility. It is where this movie should have stayed. The Actors and Directors are all legends, but this movie only took away from some of their carrier luster."

","Is it just me, or is Robert DeNiro once again portraying the mindless and aging FBI honcho Robert Mueller from SNL fame in this lengthy biographical film????? He sure runs like a 76 year old man so why no stunt double for DeNiro?<br/><br/>Pacino isn't playing Jimmy Hoffa. Every time he opens his loud mouth, Al Pacino is just playing himself. In fact a VERY OLD looking 79 year old over-the-hill version of Al Pacino. Sad. Terribly sad. Jimmy Hoffa is rolling over in his grave or he is breaking through 20 tons of concrete to stop a has been like Pacino ruin his reputation.<br/><br/>Mrs. Shullivan and I were anticipating another long awaited Martin Scorsese 1960's-1970's period masterpiece crime film, but instead what we disappointedly sat through was an over-hyped, (too) lengthy quasi biography on just one of the many here say storylines on the 1975 sudden and mysterious disappearance of former union Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>This film version of the missing Jimmy Hoffa focuses on three main characters, Hoffa played by Al Pacino, mob boss Russell Bufalino played by Joe Pesci, and the underling stuck in the middle of Hoffa and Bufalino, teamster labour leader Frank Sheeran, played by Robert DeNiro.<br/><br/>THE GOOD:
Make no mistake, without actor Joe Pesci's strong but silent type mobster boss performance this film would have been most likely rated nothing more than a Grade B film with more than half of the finished product still sitting on the cutting room floor. Unlike the previous Scorsese directed mob films where Joe Pesci plays a raging out of control mobster maniac, in this biographical film Pesci plays a silent, very controlled, smart and resourceful mobster fixer who doesn't say much, but when he does, you better listen. I felt Pesci's strong performance and especially his one-on-one interactions with his underling Frank Sheeran kept the flame from going out on this otherwise forgettable and over rated film. Pesci played a similar role (crime boss) in the 1993 film, one of my all time favorite crime films, ""A Bronx Tale"", which also co-starred Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palminteri.<br/><br/>THE BAD:
Why did Scorsese have the now 76 year old DeNiro and the now 79 year old Pacino play their respective characters Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) and Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) from their early days in the 1960's through to the year Sheeran actually died of cancer in 2003? The film would have transitioned much better through the five (5) decades of this biographical story line if two different actors had played a younger version of Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Off the top of my head I could see Milo Ventimiglia playing the younger Frank Sheeran and Michael Chiklis playing the younger Jimmy Hoffa during the 1960's scenes and then transitioning to the (past their freshness date) Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino playing the much older versions of their characters.<br/><br/>THE UGLY:
The film it's way too loooooong and boring. I understand that NetFlix has to fill in 24 hours per day for their millions of subscribers but to just fill in with extended and continuous chatty scenes that were just wasted minutes as were the smoke breaks alongside the highways and motels, ENOUGH ALREADY!<br/><br/>Sadly, I rate it a dismal 2 out of 10.

","The De-aging effect in the first half of the movie was very distracting and not really hiding well the old age of the main cast. Deniro, Pacino and Pesci all move and talk like old people...perhaps because they are old and some cgi can't fully hide that fact. The 2nd half of the movie on the other hand felt much more natural as the characters got older (no more distracting de-aging effect) and both the story and direction became A class. Scorsese did a great job creating tension and everyone else involved (actors, camera work etc.) gave their best.

","The CGI faces create a soulless effect. It never feels like a real film, just a digital recreation where computerized characters are pretending to be DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci. They basically robbed us of the reunion by experimenting with a technique that fails so badly we know never to do that. The tragedy is this was not a time to experiment. They hang the entire picture on the believability of the de-aging, and it doesn't work for a second. It's egregious, bizarre, and will age horribly for the simple reason it's not registering as acting because computer programmers are doing the acting via mouseclicks. For Marty, a purest of cinema, to have this little respect for the purity of performance marks this as hypocrisy how he trashes blockbuster film. This is the theme park ride. This is a greatest hits tour through his oeuvre. This is uncanny directorial valley. I'm certain in 2050, you would get these old actors recreated exactly like this. That is our soulless future. Why rush to it? And the sad thing is, the cast were all there, and we will never get to see what they did. Clearly everyone is in denial and reviewing Scorsese's other works and pretending the emperor's wardrobe is just wonderful. When critics talk about the last half hour being a conscientious meditative coda on the gangster epic? Well sure, because they finally showed him acting.

As such, and knowing that I have a tendency to sometimes exceed the number of allowed characters, I'd like to add just a couple of small things.<br/><br/>First, the sets and costuming were near perfection. Every SINGLE piece of clothing which the characters wore, down to cuff-links, handbags, hair pins and shoes were of the era. That kind of meticulous detail can only bode well for a film. If the creators care enough about the small details, imagine what they do with the big ones.<br/><br/>Secondly, in many films now, where there is a well-known and varied cast, you find that the screen time each devotes in comparison to the film run time, really leaves a little to be desired. That is not the case here. Almost every second of every scene is filled with one or more of these masterful actors, actually acting. Performing. Pulling you in to the world they are creating. All, without the need of heavy CGI or filler. As Hoffa might say: they get right down to brass tacks - and, pardon the pun, deliver.<br/><br/>DeNiro, Pacino, Pesci, Keitel. Enough said.

It's not entirely clear why this happens other than to remind us who the movie's about, or that no one else actually matters...<br/><br/>And yet, backed by the usual Scorsese jukebox of vintage rock/soul tunes while peppered with rushed bouts of ultra-violence, we learn even less about the doomed union leader than in Danny DeVito's limp Jack Nicholson as HOFFA biopic: proof that the man's legacy has nothing to do with his story, because he obviously doesn't have one worth telling, or watching."

Acting is capable but never noteworthy or memorable and it genuinely feels like it should have been made in the mid to late 90's when De Niro and Pacino were at the top of their game, because there is an undeniable sense of limitation due to their age. The story is far from gripping and poorly paced, it never really raises any intrigue or interest surrounding the disappearance of Hoffa. I personally would recommend Danny De Vito's ""Hoffa"" starring Jack Nicholson, a far superior film about Jimmy Hoffa and his disappearance.

"joesiegel","9","11","16","1 April 2020"," A mafia movie that takes the time to talk about different topics in life
","Martin Scorsese grew up making gangster movies, for over 40 years he became the mainstay of modern gangster movies, along with Coppola marked a before and after in the genre, Scorsese immortalized gangster movies with Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino, films full of moral dilemmas, corrupt and proud characters and the typical final act of the film of the descent into misery. The Irishman brings all these elements together in a more existentialist and reflective way, despite being a movie about the mafia it feels more two-dimensional than most crime movies, especially because it is a very personal story told by Scorsese himself, unlike most mafia movies, The Irishman takes time to reflect on the passage of time, repentance, devotion, loyalty, and oblivion, all these doubts drown Scorsese and the main actors of the film who they have reached old age and are reflecting on their own lives.<br/><br/>The Irishman has all the features of the Scorsese cinema, long shots, sharp and precise dialogues and dynamic camera movements, every time there is a shooting Scorsese manages to make it look more stylized than the previous one, we all know that the scenes of the Scorsese movies where the violence overflows are excellent, except for the scene of Frank kicking a man in the wax, De Niro's performance is quite disappointing considering that he is a 78-year-old man playing someone in his thirties. Like any Scorsese film, the story is marked by one betrayal after another, the mafia world is not the best to trust other people, loyalty is ephemeral, except that of Russel and Frank that is maintained until the end, when someone makes mistakes the mafia has no other solution than death, Frank was on the verge of making mistakes on multiple occasions but Russel was always there to rescue him as a sign of his true loyalty.<br/><br/>The Irishman has an unconventional epilogue for the Scorsese films, we are used to seeing a spiral descent by the characters into madness or misery, or in both directions as is the case with Goodfellas. The Irishman for his part presents a reflective, emotional, sad and cold epilogue, Frank is alone in an old age telling us his story but continues to remain faithful to his ideals, this is demonstrated when he prefers not to tell the police about Jimmy Hoffa even after that all the mafia he knew is dead, that is his loyalty to his religion, the mafia.<br/><br/>There are several peculiar scenes in this epilogue filled with a strong emotional charge, the ending leaves a strange feeling of mixed feelings, nostalgia, euphoria or confusion, but above all satisfied when seeing a film that refreshes the current cinema as only Scorsese could have done."

I mean so slow I had to write my first review on IMDb. There were some beautiful scenes when it came to the dialogue I.e the fish scene but because the actors in this movie are so old they are not able to do anything else other than just sit in a room and talk. I would say 3 hours of this movie is just Talking heads and the other half hour of this movie is people getting shot in the head. Marty is my favorite director but I'm not going to sugar coat this movie like everyone else seems to be doing. There needed to be a lot more cut from the movie and I'm not just talking about plot there are ungodly pauses where the actors Bob/Joe/Al are just staring off into space. This movie takes slow burn to a whole new level, Tarkovsky would even feel like this movie is paced terribly because there was so much that didn't matter.

"cyamo","3","119","237","28 November 2019"," The long good-bye
","By the time we got to the wood chipper spewing out body bits, I had my metaphor for The Irishman - it was as if Scorsese had taken Goodfellas, Casino, Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, and The Sopranos, put them all into an industrial sized shredder, and concocted this bloody blob of a film.
Long gone are the young Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone of Godfather II, (and the much ballyhooed ""de-aging"" effect doesn't bring them back.) But they are replaced by an Al Pacino who morphed into John Turturro and a Robert De Niro who has deteriorated into a sad parody of his former self. Who would have thought that Joe Pesci would be the shining star of this acting troika, but he has the one decent performance in this dreadful picture.
I didn't read the book the film is based on but the script is terrible. One example of many is Frank Sheeran's (De Niro in the title role) daughter character, played by Anna Paquin as an adult. She seems to be the only one of the four daughters and two wives who suspects that daddy may be a monster. Although she has hardly any lines, we can tell she hates him by the many repetitive scenes of her giving Frank death-ray stares. And it makes this cold-blooded killer feel really bad (calling Tony and Meadow Soprano! But at least Meadow had dialogue, a personality, and a nuanced relationship with her father.)
And speaking of dialogue, the various conversations between De Niro and Pacino (Jimmy Hoffa) and/or Pesci (a gangster whose name I've already forgotten) are beyond absurd in the nonsensical, elliptical way they speak as they keep putting out hits on their rivals.
While I'm passing out the raspberries, Robbie Robertson's musical score seems like it was written for another film entirely. But at least they used In the Still of the Night a couple of times and don't miss the short bit of Steve Van Zandt playing Jerry Vale singing Al di La in the mandatory night club scene.
And perhaps the final insult is that after three and a half hours of this mess, Frankie, we hardly knew ye."

The build-up to this event was amazing and long. You really witnessed how cold-blooded and loyal to Russ was Frank in that moment. The aftermath felt as if it was somebody else that caught Hoffa.<br/><br/>The ending was also very emotional. Frank is alone and old, has nobody to talk to, and even the pastor does not really like him as he has no remorse towards what he did in his past. Frank shops for his casket and his location for his upcoming eternal rest in his wheelchair.<br/><br/>Side note - the scene when a shop owner shoves Frank's daughter and Frank comes back to beat the piss out of him was great in itself, but the filming was pretty bad as it looked like a fight straight out of a 1930's flick (shockingly obvious it was a fake fight)."

Even his most recent jobs, such as The Wolf of Wall Street and Boardwalk Empire are memorable. So, when The Irishman was announced I was hyped.<br/><br/>I logged in my Netflix account a few days after the release date, and I started watching it. A lot of people said that the movie is too long, 3 hours and a half are in fact way above the average, and my suggestion would be to pick a day where you don't have anything to do and enjoy it. I never felt bored and even if, especially in the end, you may feel the weight of its length, there is always something going on screen. It is just another way to tell the story. Nowadays cinema is too fast, sometimes we need this old style storytelling, that takes his time to develop characters and events in the proper way. Unfortunately the attention span decreased a lot from the audience and speaking with friends and colleagues, a lot of them were not able to watch it all at once. A real shame, because this movie need to be tasted slowly and you need to appreciate every single gradient of the story. Very well curated and very dynamic.<br/><br/>The other big critic is the CGI used to rejuvenate actors. I have to tell that critiques are not completely wrong on this. The work done is... decent, but not perfect. For example, I did not understand why they needed to edit so heavily De Niro's eyes while he was young. And you can see that even if they are young, the movement from actors it is slower than expected. There, even the most advanced technology cannot do much. Anyway, I think that too much importance was given to this aspect of the movie, this is not the reason why you are watching this movie, it is not a Marvel movie, so even if special effects are not perfect, you can easily forgive them.<br/><br/>Even if the movie is well done, we are not at the same level of big classic such as Goodfellas. Don't get me wrong, I liked how Scorsese portrayed the mob during the 70's, and also the rise and the fall of the Irishman, but when you have setted the standard so high with your previous movies, it is difficult to do better. Scorsese is a Master and we are lucky enough to see him alive and to keep producing and directing this kind of productions, even if they are not trending anymore in the mainstream cinema. Sometimes is good to have a reminder how cinema used to be."

","The Irishman is one of the best stories put to film in years. Al Pacino looked in his prime. De Niro Pesci and everyone else is as good as youd expect. The cgi deaging is revolutionary. Truly seamless. The 3.5 hour runtime is heavily felt, but totally worth it<br/><br/>
To that, I say bravo to Marty Scorsese"
"areatw","9","8","11","4 April 2020"," I get the criticism, but I thought it was excellent
","As someone who loves (most of) Martin Scorsese's work and especially his old gangster films, 'The Irishman' was always going to be a must-see for me. As I usually do when seeing a movie, I went into this without watching the trailer and with as little knowledge or expectations about the story/film as possible, and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>'The Irishman' is excellent, another masterwork by Scorsese and up there with my favourite gangster films, though probably not quite on the same level as the likes of 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas'. It looks fantastic with great cinematography and some smart use of CGI for anti-ageing effects. I really enjoyed the storyline, which has depth yet is relatively easy to follow, and the characters are very convincing.<br/><br/>If it has any flaws they are certainly very minor and did not affect my enjoyment of the film. I would normally tend to agree with the criticism of the excessive length - nobody want to sit staring at a screen for three-and-a-half hours - but I'm prepared to make an exception for 'The Irishman' as it held my interest throughout. A fantastic film and another Scorsese classic."

","All the bad reviews are 100% true and accurate. At 46, Of course I've always loved Scors., & ALL these actors. But this was just a horrid waste. Senseless, no need. But, mind-boggling as to why he didn't use any number of dozens of terrific actors in their 30s-40s to portray the guys in the early years. The ENTIRE film was so difficult to sit through. It certainly cheapens The Godfather's, Goodfellas, Casino, Raging Bull, etc. All these guys in their late 60's-early 80's, omg it's sad & pathetic. Sry, NOT sry. I just watched silly Jack&Jill- Pacino cracked me up. Dirty Grandpa w/ DeNiro & Zac Effron..stupid but hysterical. The film w/DeNiro & Anne Hathaway where he plays a retired intern was charming. HOWEVER, too bad they didn't realize they had no business doing another gangster flick!! SHAME. I'd DEF Recommend skipping. You're not missing anything. I promise."
"kylerobertsiscool","8","161","331","18 October 2019"," Several Oscar nominations incoming
","The Irishman is another outstanding Scorsese film. De Niro gives one of his best performances in years. His narration is spot on and he makes us genuinely feel for Frank Sheeran. I believe his first Oscar nomination for years is inbound. Pesci is also great in a somewhat reserved role, but it's Al Pacino that really shines in this film. He gives his typical loudmouth performance and should be considered the favourite for best supporting actor, in my book. The film has a good pace to it. The nearly three and a half hour runtime flies by... for the most part. Midway through the second act, things can get a little slow but by no means is it boring. Perhaps it's the kind of film you watch on Netflix rather see it in cinema. The character development overall is excellent. We get a good grasp of every character by the end of the film due to the run time. However, we don't hear a huge chunk of information regarding Frank's Irish background. It is merely mentioned with one or two references. I personally had no issue with the de-aging. I think it's done really well. At no point was I distracted or thought it looked unrealistic. The ending and/or final act as a whole is conclusive. You leave the cinema with a smile on your face. I see a best picture nomination incoming for The Irishman. You should check it out when it comes to Netflix November 27. 9/10"
"Mengedegna","10","191","400","28 September 2019"," A Master Class in Film-making
","Seen this afternoon at the NYFF.<br/><br/>This film will doubtless go down as ""The Godfather"" of its generation, with Pacino and De Niro both on hand to assure continuity. Neither of them has done anything remotely as brilliant as this in decades, and the great revelation of the film, Joe Pesci, hasn't done anything at all. It has taken Scorsese's alchemy, back at its peak, to bring the three of them together in ways that surpass the sum of their considerable parts.<br/><br/>Although (or because?) much of the film concerns the bleakness of old age, each of them, Scorsese included, is here restored to his astonishing peak capacity: the film's dirty little secret is that much of its substance concerns the process of human subsidence and movement toward the grave (some -- many -- more expeditiously than others, of course, with titles accompanying the first appearance of so many of the minor characters to tell us , laconically, in which appalling way this was accomplished), its principals seem to have discovered the fountain that restores, if not their youth, at least their youthful talents and energy, albeit with a world-weariness that we should all heed.<br/><br/>Don't worry about the film's amazing length -- it goes by at warp speed, and if if not for slowing down of its own accord (and logic) in its final half hour, you may feel deprived by how swiftly it is dispatched.<br/><br/>The professional reviews. out today, make much of the digital ""de-aging"" that allows the principals to be portrayed in early and late middle age, as well as closer to their natural ages. I confess that I don't see a problem with this, nor, I suspect, will most viewers. Under Maestro Scorsese's baton, all of them are fully convincing at each of these phases of life.<br/><br/>Interestingly, it is De Niro (who played the young Vito Corleone) to whom the elegiac moments, poignantly and all-too-realistically portrayed, are given, whereas it is Pacino, to whom those unforgettable solo moments as the middle-aged Don were given, whose role here ends as it began -- in the total intoxication and lack of self-awareness of the powerful and unscrupulous. Pesci's self-awareness and watchful, controlling understanding of the realities of power, obviates the need for introspection -- he never wavers in his understanding of where the chess pieces stand on the board, and how they must, inevitably, be moved, and only fleetingly does he seem to perceive the cost of all that. Far more than his past scenery-chomping roles for Scorsese and others, Pesci's character here is, in this sense, the most terrifying figure in the film.<br/><br/>The political messages are oblique (history unfolds largely in the background, on TV sets), but the core Scorsese message about the utter corruption of American life and the impossibility of combating this -- if only because the alleged watchdogs, up to and including Presidents, are , in turn, so easily corrupted -- comes through loud and clear. It's hardly an original message, but Scorsese (like Coppola before him) dissects these dynamics with exquisite precision. The message for our current politics couldn't be clearer, or scarier.<br/><br/>Mention must be made of the flawless ensemble cast which backs up these principals, including the amazing women, who play such important, but background roles. (In mob films, as in Catfish Row in the great revival of ""Porgy and Bess"" now at the Metropolitan Opera, ""a woman is a sometime thing."" )<br/><br/>I feel privileged to have been present at one of the first public screenings of a film that will certainly join the pantheon. But I must get back to see it again and again, such is the richness contained in almost every frame and sequence."

"irishjenna","1","99","201","28 November 2019"," Is this a joke?
","So I'm to suspend disbelief that with CGI Deniro is supposed to be a 30 year old man, Pesci refers to him as ""kid"" in one scene. Huh? Though the CGI was good enough to make him look like he was maybe in his mid 50s in the face, his body movements were definitely that of a geriatric. And what, Pesci and Pacino were supposed to be in their 40s? Cause this was the age of the real life people these actors were portraying in the 1950s. Hogwash! They couldn't just get younger actors, could they?<br/><br/>Look, I'm not a die hard Deniro or Pacino fan. I'm not even a gangster movie fan, I love Scarface and The Departed and that's pretty much it. Both of those movies had long run times, though not nearly as long as this one, but they were entertaining and easy to sit through. Not quite an hour into this film and I was checking the time. Maybe that affects my rating as well, since this isn't my genre, though the CGI takes this movie way down in notches regardless of the types of films you like.<br/><br/>Not to say this is necessarily a 1 Star film, but I needed to curb all the 10 star ratings that go on about how this is the best movie ever. Not even close!"

","You choose a film based on the recognition of your favorite producer and actors, entering the theatre fantasizing the fantastic mobster story you are about to watch and trat your soul for at least a week with the top notch masterpiece once again created by the artistic mind of Scorsese. You are sitting on your seat getting amazed by the great make up and the location sets and great performance of Robert DeNiro for the the first 15 mins, nevertheless the excitement and admiration begins to fade as the story becomes dull and does not add much original twist to a classic mobster story. The personal life of the main characters such as the divorce or the daughters seem to be intended to bring a humane sensation to the story however it seems to have massively failed. Peggy does not bring much of a loving touch to the story I'm afraid.<br/><br/>In summary the film was a let down by movie legends."

To the point that I watched, it was a boring retread of a formula. Maybe worse.

","""The Irishman"" is based on a book published in 2018 about the life of Frank Sheeran who the author claims murdered Jimmy Hoffa. A new book penned by a Harvard law professor implies another individual killed the labor leader. Should this conflicting information dissuade you from watching ""The Irishman""? Not necessarily. However, ""The Irishman"" fails on so many other levels: Poorly written script, too many directors, unsatisfactory editing, verbose acting, histrionic acting by Pacino (as usual), and unnecessary voice-over narration.<br/><br/>The only good thing about ""The Irishman"" is the super-talented Brit, Stephen Graham, who out acts everyone in the very short time he is on screen. Hopefully, someone will put his scenes up on YouTube so no one will not have to suffer through watching the entire movie.<br/><br/>Where to begin?
1. The Voice-over Narration. The movie begins with De Niro's character in an old age home telling ""his story."" A great script does not need voice-over narration. And because voice-over narration is used in ""The Irishman,"" the movie is not visceral. And because the movie is not visceral, the viewer has to convert the screenwriter's words into feelings. That is not why we go to the movies - to do the screenwriter's job. So, because the writer didn't do his job, you'll have to process everything De Niro says (while at the same time watching the movie) as he talks over everyone's scenes.<br/><br/>2. Balloons informing us who very minor characters are, and when and how they died. Who is the idiot who thought this was a good idea? Now the viewer has to process two things: 1. The Voice-over narration. 2. Reading unnecessary balloons filled with unnecessary information.<br/><br/>3. The Acting. Both De Niro and Pacino sound, gesture, and emote like they have in every other movie they've been in. De Niro and Pacino both could learn a thing or two from Stephen Graham on how to become and sound like the character in the script they signed onto to play.<br/><br/>4. The CGI used to make the actors appear younger. What moron came up with this idea? I can just imagine the powers that be sitting around saying, ""Hey, salaries for Pacino, Pesci, and De Niro will be greater if we don't use actors to play them as young men. What do you mean? We'll use CGI to make them appear younger. What will the audience think about that? F the audience."" The CGI used on the faces of Pacino, Pesci, and De Niro is HIGHLY distracting to the viewer and should not have been used. Meaning, viewers are not idiots. Well, some are. You can't get away with fooling us, or satisfying us with this type of CGI. What's the matter, are De Niro and Pacino too irritable and restless in their old age to sit in a chair several hours for makeup?<br/><br/>5. The movie is over 3 hours long. This movie is not a movie worth 3-plus hours of anyone's time. It is unnecessarily too long. Unlike James Cameron's ""Titanic,"" the 3-plus hours of ""The Irishman"" does not make the story richer or more memorable. It just makes it unbearable too long.<br/><br/>6. The movie has no plot. It's just De Niro's character reminiscing. A movie CAN do both. This movie does not.<br/><br/>7. The director clearly was not directing the movie. A director should never allow his ""buddy"" actors to interfere with his job by allowing said ""buddy"" actors to direct a scene. By the same token, actors should respect their director and allow him to do his job unencumbered by the actor's opinions, appraisals, or judgements. Actors are not screenwriters. They should respect the director and stay in their lane. No one wants a nurse going into the operating room to operate.<br/><br/>Bottom line, ""The Irishman"" offers nothing new to the Mob movies genre. Couple that with unimaginative acting, distracting CGI and balloons, disjointed directing, and that should tell you to skip the unnecessary telling of a man who may or may not have killed Jimmy Hoffa."

Why didn't Scorsese just use different actors to play characters who are supposed to be four decades younger???? That is four decades younger!

Stephen Graham and Joe Pesci were very impressive, also the actor who portrayed 'Fat' Tony Selerno was very good as well. Overall I gave this a 5 out of 10.

But it is entertaining enough. The Departed, Casino, Goodfellas, Hoffa, The Godfather films, Blood in Blood Out. I enjoy the early Bogart and Cagney movies as well. Edmond O'Brien was a favorite of mine too. Sigh... then there is this.. this three and a half hour THING..<br/><br/>Putting aside the ridiculous CGI that looked like nothing but a bunch of gratuitous botox injections, this film sucked in virtually every aspect besides production. 165 million for THIS??? De Niro and Pacino played themselves yet again (is there a record for doing this sort of thing?) The script was soooooo poor. My God! How many times can these characters go back and forth while saying THE SAME THING AND NOT PROGRESSING THE PLOT! Was there a plot?? De Niro must be the most overrated actor in recent memory. The scene where he stomps on a grocer's hand had me in tears. He looked like a geriatric who was desperately trying not to lose his balance. Scorsese is definitely partially to blame for this. How that entire scene did not fall to the cutting room floor is beyond me. De Niro has the same acting style since the 80s. Eyebrows up, corners of the mouth up. Eyebrows up, corners of the mouth down. Then he lowers his eyebrows and does the same thing. He laughs the same way as well. This is acting? I already mentioned that Pacino was Pacino in this. Good God was he ever. He was 100% Pacino and 0% Hoffa which equates to PaSTINKO! Aren't these actors supposed to actually TRY to be like the characters they are portraying? Hoffa was a real person. There is plenty of footage of the man talking, interviews, etc. What were Pacino and Scorsese thinking? Scorsese just lets Pacino HAM it up scene after scene after scene. Pacino is another actor who I find overrated as hell. He did some decent work in the 70s but he has also coasted since And Justice For All. The man just yells and looks bizarrely awkward while doing it. Staring off into space while bug eyed. Three and a half hours of this. Boring scenes, boring dialogue ""Did you talk to him? He did that? Talk to him again. Set up a meeting. You think so? Yeah. I dunno. You really think so? I dunno. Lets think about it. I thought about it. Really? Yeah. I think so."" And on.. and on.. and on.... Was Scorsese on a mission to murder the Mob genre with this? These cats need to retire. Just call it a career.. Quite honestly this was extremely painful to sit through. I had to break this thing up into three parts. This film offers nothing but a bunch of boring scenes and an awkward geriatric clown trying to pass himself off as Jimmy Hoffa. Shame on you Marty. You let this happen.<br/><br/>Hoffa was done already. Danny De Vito directed Jack Nicholson in 1992. You want a real glimpse of how Hoffa actually talked and acted like? Watch that instead. Why was the Irishman even made? The answer is anybody's guess. AVOID AVOID AVOID... unless you need to get a good nap in immediately."

I wonder if all these mob-praising movies by Scorsese were heavily sponsored by mafia - this is the only explanation for all the crap about romantics of the mob that was put on the screen.

","Let me start of by saying I am a massive fan of the genre, scorcese and all the actors involved. The movie is filled to the brim with incredibly talented actors. So I expected a lot. Maybe too much. It's a scorcese mafia film after all.<br/><br/>So? unfortunately, it is a massive disappointment to me. The first hour especially is absolutely terrible. Like some student film maker tried to copy scorcese and put every cliche of gangster movies in there.<br/><br/>And why is everyone completely ignoring tha godawful CGI/fake faces? The lips and movement was so off that it distracted me the entire time. The uncanny valley was so obvious it hurt my eyes. They even gave them plastic, cgi ears lol. De Niro walks around with a VERY obvious senior body, he cant even stand straight with his arched back etc. So when he pretends to be a young gangster it just looks so weird. The way he walks. The way his face is placed on his head, it sorta looks like a badly photoshopped bobble head...I don't even know how old he was supposed to be early on. Even with the terrible CGI he looked at least 60/70.. just with a plastic face. It was so damn confusing and annoying. Not to mention his obviously senior arms/body etc. I know the story, I know Sheerans age and Hoffa etc but in the movie I was always and constantly confused about their age etc<br/><br/>Then there was the incredibly distracting music constantly. It almost always felt out of place and was so loud it distracted from the conversation going on. This was especially a problem early on during the young de niro scenes. Later on they tone down the loud background music<br/><br/>Then the story, after the first hour it felt like the movie was finally picking off. We got a lot less cgi and more of the story. But then absolutely nothing happens. This is one of the most interesting mobster / union stories out there and they managed to make it boring and eventless.<br/><br/>Everyone seems to love de Niros character Sheeran which makes zero sense to me at all. Pesci (Bufalino) sees him working on a truck and is immediately interested in becoming his friend and helping him. Why would a made man decide this random truck driver is so special? For the rest of the movie Pescis character covers for De Niro with everything and starts to act like de niros older brother. A big change from his usual role as the loveable psycho. Even calls de Niro his son this one time. But I have no idea what the age difference is supposed to be between the two. Aside from starting to ""paint houses"", which he does later on, there is no reason for De Niro to be so well respected and loved by everyone. They never show why he is so popular..<br/><br/>Pacino did some of the best acting in the show. But even with him they could have used another actor for Hoffa<br/><br/>Listen I love it when a movie is long. Give me a movie that's 4 to 6 hours I still won't complain, the longer the better to me. But with this movie, I don't understand what happened to the time. They have 3 and a half hours to tell this story and they spend 20 minutes max with the actual story of Hoffa, the rest was just empty filler.<br/><br/>After what happens to Hoffa (I mean is that even spoilable?) There is an full half hour of absolutely nothing. We have de Niro acting all sad about his daughter refusing to talk to him. It's never made clear why she hates him so much. Ok so she reads about dad in the papers, kids don't care about that. They dont fear their parents because others say so. They hate their parents because of how their parents are. But the film shows us none of that despite really focusing on that relationship extensively.<br/><br/>I wish they had picked another actor for De Niros role. He is too old. The cgi was extremely distracting and left a very bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the movie. Even the way ""young"" de niro walked drove me crazy.. his young scenes annoyed me so damn much. It was never clear how old he was and he always looked very old so it was very jarring that they were suddenly in the past, then the future then the past again etc. CGI De Niro not only looks plastic, he looks like a hunchback trying to walk straight. Like someone put a coat hanger on the back of his jacket and there is a crane raising him from the ground to make him appear to stand straight.<br/><br/>In the end this movie is one of the biggest disappointments ever to me. They took the most fascinating story and made it boring and nonsensical. I can't believe they took a story this great, used all the best actors and had the best mafia movie filmmaker and still turned it into such a massive mess.<br/><br/>Truly a shame. And the critics and others reviewing it so highly makes me question the legitimacy of many of the reviews here. I get the critics being pretentious. But the audience isn't swayed as easily usually. Maybe they're all in some sort of collective denial.<br/><br/>In the end you have a decent movie with terrible CGI, some great acting and some acting ruined by CGI, super old men pretending to be youngsters, a decent story that we barely get to see. An anti climactic ending. This could have been the movie of the decade. Instead it's a forgettable flick with tons of major names attached to it. A decade from.now people will still be talking about goodfellas but I doubt anyone will talk about this movie..<br/><br/>The only way they can save this movie and make it watchable in the future is to fix the disgustingly bad CGI and tone down the annoying music. If they have some scenes flushing out the relationship between Frank Sheeran (de niro) his daughter, Bufalino (pesci) and Hoffa (pacino) that would give a lot.more perspective. From watching the movie there is nothing that explains why both Bufalino and Hoffa are so enamoured by this Irish hitman. I am not sure but I guess sheeran played a big role on the story, which might explain why everyone loves him and respects him so much. Why his daughter hates him for no good reason other than his life as a hitman (if his daughter hates him in real life I imagine he did a lot more to his family than just being a hitman for a job). I mean, at one point Hoffa is calling his people all kinds of names, while yelling etc. Then Sheeran/pacino is offended and walks out, only for Hoffa to run after him to tell him how much he loves him and how he wasn't talking to him, how he would never disrespect him like that. In another scene there is this guy who is introducing Sheeran to Hoffa and the guy is like ""omg, this Sheeran guy is the best, a natural leader, everyone loves him, I'd let him.have my wife if he wanted!!"".<br/><br/>It also needed more plot. a bit of drama. It needed for things to happen not just the murder of one or two random people that we saw for 2 minutes on screen.<br/><br/>Anyway I can rant on for hours..I was so excited for this. I guess the hype and expectations made the disappointment a lot worse."

","So Scorcese comes in with guns blazing: Marvel isn't cinema and he's the authority on what's cinema and not. Fellow mobster movie auteur Coppola weighs in, goes one step further: Marvel is vile. After such boisterous, vain comments, one expects that Scorcese has something big in his pocket. What he has however is a .38, it takes three and a half hour of shooting to bore the viewer to death.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, the movie isn't strictly bad on its own. But whatever it has comes from the big name actors, even if they play the roles they have already played at least a dozen times before this in much better movies. You have seen their better performances and in fact in, much better Scorcese mob movies. The latter half of the movie especially is a slog but I guess they thought ""it's Netflix, just put in all the film we shot without editing"". It drags on and on as if there's something in reserve to warrant the build up. It never comes.<br/><br/>And mostly it's due to the anemic story: It's as if the scenario was written by a deep learning machine which was fed mobster movies, it's like a composite of those. Every scene you saw somewhere else before and definitely better, and towards the finale it's as generic as it goes. Even if it's an adaptation, Scorcese should have realized this story didn't need a movie, especially not one as long as Titanic.<br/><br/>But here's the issue: He has been long sipping his bread in the wine of his Mobster Cinematic Universe, a continuous barrage of gangster movies that ended up repeating itself the most in this one. If he thinks this is his magnum opus, featuring his star-studded cast to the point that big names get like two-liner cameos, I'm concerned for him. As a matter of fact, I'm really more than a little concerned for Scorcese. It's what it is."

A pretty simple plot is dragged out over the course of 3 and a half hours, fleshed out with mind numbing dialogue, which is only broken up with occasional 'jokes', which are just as the stupid as the audience for laughing at them.<br/><br/>Scorsese repeats pretty much everything in this film, from the performances of the actors, to the one liners, aswell as the camera moves. The steadicam loop that is used over and over again, gets nearly as boring as De Niro's performance as he uses the same expression for the 1000th time.<br/><br/>This film has Netflix producers written all over it. ""Lets get Marty and De Niro back together again"". I should have known better than to sit through this dross (only hoping it would get better) from De Niro's movie choices over the last few years.

And 3.5 hour time is overbearing, since you have to listen to monologue from either Al Pacino or Joe Pesci and character that DeNiro is staying on sidelines. He is suppose to be main character however he plays a guy who listens and then sometimes does things that lowlife bosses are impressed with.

","Based on the rest home recollections of a geriatric former gangster, 'The Irishman' adds another long-winded chapter to Scorcese's collection of mob potboilers. As far as authenticity is concerned, Frank Sheeran was renowned for being a liar and drunk - and neither his former associates nor FBI investigators believed his boasts of being a mob hit-man. Instead they remember him as a minor thug who would never have been entrusted with serious matters like the claimed killing of his pal Jimmy Hoffa. In the film's far-fetched version of this notorious crime, Hoffa's son observed Sheeran as the last person in his father's company, but somehow this goon never appeared on the FBI's radar as a suspect.<br/><br/>An elderly De Niro is unconvincingly rendered into youthful middle age by CGI, as Scorcese trudges through Sheeran's catalogue of imaginary murders with the energy of an accountant filling out a tax return. The actor pastes a stone-faced 'tough guy' expression on his face as his crime boss (Joe Pesci) instructs him to eliminate rats and rivals in obscure code phrases such as ""painting houses"". This jargon was also invented by Sheeran in order to make him look like an insider, although the Gotti tapes revealed genuine mobsters use simpler terminology like: ""Whack the bum"".<br/><br/>The film's final act depicts Sheeran in an elder care facility, revealing the retired hoodlum as an empty husk, devoid of empathy or insight. 'The Irishman' is just as formulaic as the superhero schlock Scorcese has recently criticized, but the Oscar babble is already deafening. The only question raised by this tired movie is why a veteran film-maker remains fascinated by the violence, cowardice and greed of these dismal lowlifes."

If you've seen your Coppola and Scorsese mafia flicks before, you've seen it all. Yes, the CGI doesn't really work, but that's not even the main issue with the film. The exploration of loyalty, friendship, family, etc. has been done in so many of these films - I kept thinking about the scene between De Niro and Ray Liotta in the diner and Liotta's Voice Over in Goodfellas, which basically sums it all up.

The story is vanilla and the editor decided to take a vacation. So much of the film is filler that I strongly contemplated leaving about 2/3 into it.

"joebloggscity","6","57","118","12 November 2019"," Legends back on form, yet it just doesn't all add up for me
","It's a return to the tried & trusted formula for some of the greats of cinematic history. Scorcese directs in his familiar field of Italian American mafia & gangster life, and with Pacino, De Niro, Pesci and Harvey Keital all leading the film this is one of the most stellar casts of any film in many a year (if not ever). Ably assisted by more recent star names like Stephen Graham & Bobby Cannavale, it all bodes well.<br/><br/>For me, De Niro and Pesci are giving their best roles for many years, possibly could be Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>Yet I feel this just doesn't fully add up. So much good to say, in terms of direction, style, fashion, humour and realism but was quite self-indulgent, and Pacino was just faxing in the same shouty role he has done for years. The film is almost 3.5 hours long, and it feels like it, it could have been shortened without any loss.<br/><br/>The storyline drags, and I only found it at its best in two areas. One was the relationship between De Niro's character and his daughter Peggy, and then the last hour as all came together. However, there's a lot to get to these points, and I was engrossed yet not always engaged. It's a slow burn gangster film, more about corruption centring round union man Jimmy Hoffa. Maybe Americans will find this more appealing than non-Americans, as they can relate & understand the full underlying politics relating to the characters.<br/><br/>There is a lot of good to say, and Scorcese will have another hit on his hands. Recently he has criticised tent-pole films like the Marvel films for not being cinema, which is churlish. Cinema is a wide cross-section of story telling. Thankfully there is still room for films like 'The Irishman' but in truth I think it could have been just so much better. Not disappointing, just not a classic for me."

"Bertaut","7","45","91","25 November 2019"," Far too long, but the existential and eschatological elements make up for it
","Based on the 2004 book by <a href=""/name/nm3153307/"">Charles Brandt</a>, ""I Heard You Paint Houses"": Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran and the Inside Story of the Mafia, the Teamsters, and the Last Ride of Jimmy Hoffa, written for the screen by <a href=""/name/nm0001873/"">Steven Zaillian</a>, and directed by <a href=""/name/nm0000217/"">Martin Scorsese</a>, The Irishman is about aging, loss, taking stock, regret. To a certain extent, it is to the gangster genre what <a href=""/title/tt0049730/"">The Searchers (1956)</a> was to the classic western. One of the best-reviewed films in years, although I certainly don't disagree that it has (many) masterful elements, I felt it's just too long. Shorten it by just 20 minutes in the mid-section and you have a masterpiece. Now, don't get me wrong, I have no problem with long films - I'm a fan of pictures such as <a href=""/title/tt0071562/"">The Godfather: Part II (1974)</a>, <a href=""/title/tt0087843/"">Once Upon a Time in America (1984)</a>, <a href=""/title/tt0099348/"">Dances with Wolves (1990)</a>, <a href=""/title/tt0478304/"">The Tree of Life (2011)</a>, <a href=""/title/tt0072021/"">Potop (1974)</a>, and <a href=""/title/tt0111341/"">Sátántangó (1994)</a> (all 442 minutes of it). However, such length has to be narratively justified, and I just felt that in The Irishman, it wasn't, with the film's 206 minutes occasionally feeling padded and (dare I say it) self-indulgent. Nevertheless, the acting is universally superb, the directing is more contemplative than we've seen from Scorsese in a while, <a href=""/name/nm0774817/"">Thelma Schoonmaker</a>'s editing is predictably awesome, and <a href=""/name/nm0006509/"">Rodrigo Prieto</a>'s cinematography is flawless.<br/><br/>The film opens in 2003 as we meet an elderly Frank Sheeran (<a href=""/name/nm0000134/"">Robert De Niro</a>) living in a nursing home and close to death. Wanting to go with something of a clear conscience, he begins speaking about his time as the go-to hitman for the Bufalino crime family in Pennsylvania. In 1954, Sheeran becomes friends with family patriarch Russell Bufalino (<a href=""/name/nm0000582/"">Joe Pesci</a>), and soon, Bufalino has him carrying out various hits. Loyal to the family, and adept at his job, Sheeran quickly moves up the underworld ladder, and Bufalino introduces him to Jimmy Hoffa (<a href=""/name/nm0000199/"">Al Pacino</a>). The president of the Mob-funded Teamsters union, Hoffa is facing federal investigation and is struggling to deal with rising teamster Anthony ""Pro"" Provenzano (<a href=""/name/nm0334318/"">Stephen Graham</a>). Bufalino wants Sheeran to babysit the volatile, unpredictable, and confrontational Hoffa and try to keep him out of trouble. Hoffa and Sheeran hit it off, and soon Sheeran is Hoffa's unofficial bodyguard. However, as the years go by, Hoffa continues to antagonise his Mob backers, and some of them soon come to see him as more of a liability than an asset.<br/><br/>Originally set at Paramount, when The Irishman's budget started pushing $150m before shooting had even begun, the studio dropped it. Then came Netflix, who not only put up the money, they also offered Scorsese a near unheard-of degree of creative control. Netflix's involvement is an interesting situation because here you have a film that simply could not have been made through the modern studio system (at least not in its current form). Many are predicting that streaming services such as Netflix will ultimately destroy the cinema industry entirely, but in this case, it's hard for a cinephile not to celebrate their salvaging such an ambitious and auteur-driven film. It was a great PR move, sure (and they really, really want a Best Picture winner in their catalogue), but it was also a massive financial risk. In terms of the real-life background to the film's narrative, most historians dismiss Sheeran's account of how important he was to the Bufalino family, maintaining he was a low-level goon with a drinking problem who was never assigned to any important task. Indeed, several of his claims have been explicitly proven as fabrications, and several people who knew him have stated he did none of the things he claimed.<br/><br/>Irrespective of this, however, The Irishman is a film written in regret. Much of this is tied up in Sheeran's daughter Peggy (played by <a href=""/name/nm3932432/"">Lucy Gallina</a> as a child and <a href=""/name/nm0001593/"">Anna Paquin</a> as an adult). An almost completely wordless role, Peggy is introduced in a scene in which she watches her father viciously beat the grocer for whom she works because he pushed her, a scene which speaks to his sociopathy if not necessarily his psychopathology. The impression of him which this gives her is something Sheeran spends much of the rest of the film trying to ameliorate.<br/><br/>Another important thematic element is that as each gangster appears for the first time, a subtitle tells us who they are, and lists the date of their deaths and how they were murdered. There's no better illustration of just how concerned the film is with the nature of transience - every single one of these guys is a colossus in their own mind, and each deems themselves invincible (as do we all when young). Yet none of them make it out of life alive. In the film's last act, this theme is distilled down to its very essence, essentially positing that the only important thing you leave behind is your relationships with other people, and Sheeran has badly mismanaged his, resulting in him sitting alone in a nursing home at Christmas. In <a href=""/title/tt0099685/"">Goodfellas (1990)</a> and <a href=""/title/tt0112641/"">Casino (1995)</a>, the protagonists lose their wealth, possessions, and status, but in The Irishman, the loss is more existential - Sheeran loses his soul.<br/><br/>As the violence settles and the zingers dry up, the film's last act is remarkably bleak in a way that the last acts of GoodFellas and Casino aren't, and as we watch Sheeran sitting in that nursing home, taking stock, spelling out his regrets, reminiscing about his actions as a young man, it's impossible not to see the meta dimension - Scorsese himself looking back on his career, remembering the classics of yesteryear, keenly aware that old-age is stalking him.<br/><br/>In terms of the acting, the closest we get to a poor performance is Pacino, who portrays Hoffa as if he was playing, well, Al Pacino. Look at footage of the real Hoffa, then watch both The Irishman and <a href=""/title/tt0104427/"">Hoffa (1992)</a> in which <a href=""/name/nm0000197/"">Jack Nicholson</a> plays the character, and tell me who gives the more authentic performance. Don't get me wrong, Pacino is fun (I would gladly watch an entire film composed of nothing but him and Stephen Graham insulting one another), and most of the laughs come from his over-the-top antics, but it's not an especially accurate depiction of the real man. As for De Niro, this is his first not-phoned-in performance in decades, and he imbues the character with real interiority and complex psychology, without diluting the inherent inhumanity. However, the real standout performance is Pesci, although those looking for the fireworks of Tommy DeVito or Nicky Santoro will be disappointed, as this is literally the inverse of such performances. Bufalino is quiet, calm, considered, highly intelligent, but cold and sociopathic, the kind of man who wouldn't beat your head in, but would order someone else to do so without a second thought.<br/><br/>If the film has a single problem, it's the runtime. As mentioned above, the last act is devastating; there's little tension as such, but there sure is pathos. However, by the time we got to this point, I was starting to feel the film had outstayed its welcome, when I should have been the most heavily invested in the story. This has been a recurrent problem in recent Scorsese films, but this is the first time he's strayed from over-long into self-indulgence. The film simply doesn't warrant this length; whole scenes could easily be removed without compromising the story, character beats, or emotion.<br/><br/>Another problem, albeit a smaller one, concerns the digital de-aging. It's a little jolting at first, but easy to get used to. What stood out, however, was the tired bodies beneath those de-aged faces. This is most notable in the scene where Sheeran beats up Peggy's boss. Except the beating is pathetic - the kicks are about five miles away from the man's face and De Niro's exhausted stomps wouldn't flatten a wet cardboard box. It's a shame as, it's a good scene, but the lack of correlation between face and body is undeniably jarring. Another issue is one that has cropped up in all of Scorsese's Mob films - glorification. Obviously, The Irishman is about the toxic masculinity of this world and the lonely endgame (if one even gets to the endgame), but much as was the case with the (frankly stomach-churning) softening of Jordan Belfort in <a href=""/title/tt0993846/"">The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)</a>, Scorsese runs a very real risk of glamorising what he claims to be condemning.<br/><br/>For me, The Irishman was a very good movie, but not the masterpiece many have felt it to be. But that's just me, and I can certainly recognise and celebrate such ambitious filmmaking, especially coming at a time when more and more it feels like films are being made by committees rather than by artists. Arguably Scorsese's most eschatological film, certainly since <a href=""/title/tt0119485/"">Kundun (1997)</a>, The Irishman is the story of how one man lost his soul, and, by extension how the world for which he lost it, dehumanises and degrades those who participate in its rites. Although Sheeran is brought down by old-age, abandonment, and the merciless nature of human existence, Scorsese refuses to afford him an easy out - he made his choices, and he must now live, and die, with the consequences."

"dale-51649","2","26","49","28 November 2019"," Good acting ruined by revisionist history in a fantasy of what mob men were like
","Robert De Niro is my favorite actor, and as usual he does a good job. Unfortunately it's the writing that falls short.
The movie jumps around in time, but much of it is set in the 1950s, and the high quality filming shows few, if any, anachronisms as far as the cars, settings, clothing or designs. Showing De Niro at different ages also didn't bother me much, except he looked like a very stiff 60 year old. The sets may say 1952, but the script writing screams 2019. It's a shame because with the money spent they could have made a great film with an accurate portrayal of life and people at the time. Instead they show PC revisionist history of the worst kind, and miss a tremendous opportunity to make an accurate historical piece.
The scene that totally lost me was one in which Dinero learns that his daughter was shoved by a grocer. She is sulking when he arrives home, and when he asks his wife what is wrong with the kid she tells him the guy shoved her. His daughter doesn't say much, but does nod her head when asked if it's true. She doesn't have a scratch on her.
In the next scene, Dinero returns to the market with his daughter by the hand, and beats the grocer to a pulp. He kicks him in the face and gives his hand a crush injury. . He severely injures and humiliates the man , kicking him into the street , beating the man like an animal without asking a single question..
The movie is set at a time when the power dynamic between adults and kids was completely different. In the 1950s De Niro would have more likely whipped his daughter for annoying the adult if he heard about it,
Let me tell you what life was REALLY like in that era for kids:
In the early 1960s when I was 6 years old, I was allowed to walk alone to the ""liquor store"" on the corner to buy candy. When in the store, I saw a girl my age telling her cowboy grandfather she wanted candy for the kids back home, and he insisted ""no, they get ice cream, they will throw candy all over the yard"". She was crying when they left the store.
When I went out front a few minutes later, she was screaming her head off , and her cowboy grandfather had whipped her with a belt , which was still doubled in his hand. I knew what that was like, nearly all kids of that era did, including, probably especially, the kids of mob guys. I felt bad, embarassed for her, for me, I even paradoxically felt guilt.
THIS was he REAL 50s, THE ""GREATEST GENERATION"". Scorsese is old enough to know it, he should show it to us, least we forget it. To see portrayal of his ""hit man"" as a 2019 Dad is absurd , instead of what most ""Dads"" were like at that time. It's revisionist history of the worst type. Younger people have no idea, and many adults don't remember, or more accurately chose not to. Other anachronisms include the daughter refusing to thank her dad's friend for a money gift, and willful disobediance didn't occur much back then. Also, grown men didn't wear pajamas, in the 1960s I only saw that on TV.
I heard a crimes division guy in a documentary complain that Hollywood's portrayal of these mob guys as caring family men is ridiculous. They were sociopathic killers and generally made bad husbands and fathers. To show anybody , especially a mob guy , vigilante splat a man without knowing what happened in that era is bad history and bad for society. If we don't remember our history, we will repeat something worse."

","After anticipating this like a madman for nearly a decade, I'm glad to confirm that all my hopes and dreams came true and it's a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The storytelling structure is mostly in the same vein as GoodFellas and Casino, but with much more room to breathe (which makes sense when you consider the runtime). Less needle drops, more contemplation. Many brilliant scenes, some very intense moments, an insane amount of hilarious moments... and of course Scorsese directs the absolute hell out of it.<br/><br/>Frank Sheeran, while being a bit of an enigma, is easily the most introspective Scorsese mob character ever. And the final 30 minutes or so are an aftermath we've never seen before in a Scorsese crime film.<br/><br/>And De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci are all absolutely brilliant. The talk of De Niro being internal and Pacino being external was kind of right, but De Niro also has many funny, charismatic, and noticeably intense moments. Arguably his best moment comes in what may be the most awkward phone conversation in the history of film. Pacino, as you'd expect, nails all of the Hoffa speeches but also has rarely been this funny. And flawlessly portrays Hoffa's desperation (or... brazen lack thereof). Pesci is nowhere near the ""go f- your mother mode"" many were probably expecting. He's kind of the wise old man of the movie, while also being an ice cold mob boss. If he stays in retirement after this, it'll certainly be one of the GOAT swan songs. The film heavily relies on Sheeran's relationship with both Hoffa and Bufalino, and it wouldn't succeed nearly as well as it does without these three actors.<br/><br/>Stephen Graham, Bobby Cannavale, and the legend Harvey Keitel are the only other cast members that really get a chance to shine... and they all bring it with limited screentime.<br/><br/>And enough can't be said about Thelma's editing here. The film somehow flies by while also feeling like a lifetime... Frank's lifetime. I'm not sure the power of the final act would hit quite as hard if you weren't somewhat exhausted by everything that came before it.<br/><br/>The culmination of many careers, and a film for the ages."

","The Irishman isn't a bad movie. Actually, it's beautifully made and, from a narrow filmmaking perspective, it is flawless. However, something is missing from this movie--something which isn't missing from Scorsese's early gems such as Taxi Driver, After Hours, or Casino--namely: ""mission."" The Irishman lacks mission. For over three hours I was floored with spectacular cinematography and state-of-the-art acting by De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino. But once the credits hit the screen, I felt cheated, shortchanged. The Irishman is well-made, but it is easily forgettable. I cannot think of a single scene or theme that has stuck with me from this whole visual epic. It somehow feels like a watered-down version of another movie which got lost somewhere."

"JRodFilms","3","34","69","20 November 2019"," I Heard You Paint Houses (2019)
","The Irishman, the highly anticipated film from Martin Scorsese which reunites actors Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino for the first time in decades, in this adaptation of the book I Heard You Paint Houses which recounts the final days of Jimmy Hoffas life and the connection Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran had to Hoffas disappearance.<br/><br/>There are at least two moments in the film where Robert Deniro's charcter Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran mentions how young people of today dont know much about Jimmy Hoffa other than the fact that he dissapeared. And I am definitely in that category and that is how I will be approaching this review.<br/><br/>The name Jimmy Hoffa was etched into popular culture as being a notable figure who went missing. I have not done any research on the topic, nor watched or remember previous films on the subject of Jimmy Hoffa, so this story was able to shed some light on Hoffa, who was the head of the Teamsters, and how he was basically the most important figure of the American worker next to the President.<br/><br/>The story is told through 3 different timelines. The film begins with an elderly Sheeran telling the audience his story, which then shifts to the present with DeNiro and Pesci on a road trip to Detroit. During their roadtrip, Sheeran recollects the first time he met Bufalino and then shifts to the past to when he began his life of crime.<br/><br/>Like other gangster films of the past there are many players and characters to come and go as the film progresses. These films are telling stories that span decades, so even if the viewer is confused or not really know what is going on, you can view it and compare it to gangster films of the past.<br/><br/>And in that regard. I feel The Irishman just cant compare to other films that were told better. Goodfellas, Casino, The Godfather Alot of the times while watching this I felt I had already seen it before. Which is how some people feel about Casino being another version of Goodfellas.<br/><br/>And I guess I was expecting something as epic as those films, but nothing ever comes close.<br/><br/>My opinion may be unpopular, but wait for Netflix. And hearing the hefty pricetag on this film, I just couldn't see it on the screen. It really didnt feel cinematic at all. When I went home I had to do a double feature of Goodfellas and Casino just to remind myself that Gangster movies can be a plethora of things: exciting funny and sad. The Irishman is mostly a slog and in time wont be remembered like other classics."

","Stylish, empty and overlong Martin Scorsese's Irishman is one long conversation featuring an exhausted looking Robert DiNero, a frail Joe Pesce and an over the top Al Pacino in a bad toupee. It's like watching the Marx Bros. in Go West, rusty ghosts of the past.<br/><br/>The Irishman follows the career of close Jimmy Hoffa confidant and mobbed up hitman Frank Sheehan. Tied in with some of the greatest hits Scorsese provides a score card of casualties to buttress his film with historical fact and with snippets borrowed from the usual suspects, MeanStreets, Taxi Driver, Good Fellas, Casino. It is a veritable senior citizen version of Good Fellas.<br/><br/>DiNero has not been able to carry a two hour film in twenty years and here we are asked to endure over three with a doughy and somewhat distorted Bobby looking old from the outset, his movements creaky, his delivery half hearted. A scene where he beats a grocer takes on an almost laughable WWE look as he huffs and puffs through some rage of yesteryear. Pacino starts well but wears thin. You just look at Joe Pesce and worry about his health. The wives wear loud clothes are vapid and loyal. The only energized and enthusiastic performance is delivered by Bo Dietl as union flunky Joe Glimco.<br/><br/>Scorsese does apply lipstick on this hippo with a certain flair as his camera sweeps in on crane shots and he tracks more than Max Ophuls employing an excess of wide angle framing in order to showcase his nostalgic recreation while employing his signature aid of pop music and Fellini like mugs. It all leads however to DiNero's dense monotone narration and one close up after the next of tired old men in tough guy conversation a decade or two past their prime as actors. The Irishman is one stale bore."

"criscrossin","8","4","5","14 April 2020"," Wondeful film with interesting special effects
","I liked the movie. Almost everybody did. One of the top and probably the last of the super-acts of the giants of our era- Scorcese himself, directing De Nero, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci- who apparently came out of retirement for this gem and all the others. The pace starts slowly and gets you involved and engrossed in the career of Mob hitman and his Progress in the crime scene of the period in America.
It's done in a nostalgic style, flashback upon flashbacks unfolding the important hits and milestones of De Nero's character , who was a driver at the begining and a chance meeting with Pesci's character puts him in the road to notoriety and in limelight. He is now reminiscing from an old age home, where the government agents still want to find out from him the details of his kills. Specially of Hoffa, the mega boss and friend. It's painted a broad sweep of many decades and thrown light of different aspects of politics and crime, intermingling with each other. Scorsese style, not just slam bang action. Sometimes it feels like a docu drama, where you are almost at the middle of it, but nobody can see you. So you don't loose interest.
Acting, music, dialogues all are stupendous. A bit sepia toned.
The special effects which change the countenances of all the senior characters over the years are spellbinding. Sometimes you are left wondering if they somehow computed de nero to look such young. It's unbelievable. But sometimes that looks too tenuous. I feel the new tech is still to be perfected. But it has tremendous potential.
Great movie. Don't know when something similar will come again, or ever at all."

"haroldareynoldsIV","9","29","58","30 November 2019"," A Movie to Appreciate for Unappreciated Reasons
","In the past ten years, I have had to sit through some of the most average films that were garnering Oscar-attention to try to see what the fuss was all about. I would sit there with an open-mind trying to see, or extract, what exactly was so good about these ""hyped"" movies.<br/><br/>Take just the last year or two for instance. As I peered hard into stuff like Roma, A Star is Born, or 3 Billboards, and similar stuff, it was like searching for a grain of sand in a field of tall grass to find what was so ""classic"" or special about them, compared to my four decades of watching and rewatching true greats and classics. By the time I got done, the best I could do was shrug and say, ""I guess"" (guess it was decent). But the truth was that none of these movies satisfied. The best you could say was that one or two scenes were good or that it was ""artistic"", but that doesn't mean much when there is no plot and it's just visual scenery.<br/><br/>So the thing with the Irishman is it is understandable this movie will not be for people who don't like to sit through long movies at about 3 and a half hours long. So it will get it's fair share of casual movie-goer criticisms. However, when you really read these reviews, one thing almost all of them have in common is that they are very superficial. Nobody is arguing the merits of the actual true story, how good the acting was, or how good the director was. They are just stressing CGI effects of deaging, the actors are too old (I don't understand this one since Hoffa has been normally shown historically in photos to be at least in his 50s in most news coverage when telling his story, and that is fairly old), or that the movie is too long. Some are just dullards with short attention spans who even admit they only watched the first half hour or so and are trying to critique an epic story that unfolds, which is just dumb. So the criticisms are actually shallow and perfunctory.<br/><br/>Now, here is the experience that I got. I went into it unbiased and with relatively low expectations. First off, the lengthy run time scared me a little, and I thought I may be in for a snoozer. But let me tell you right off the bat that within the first half hour I knew I was watching a vintage Scorcese movie due to the style, the editing, the music, and the top notch acting performances. That, first and foremost, got my attention, and then before I knew it an hour and twenty minutes had gone by and I had held in my need to use the bathroom, it was that compelling and riveting; I didn't want to miss one line or one scene because every single scene (and there were many with so many cuts and edits) was imperative to the story.<br/><br/>Unlike in most of the years of the past decade, I truly felt like I was watching a true movie that I didn't need to squint at to try to extrapolate some level of quality that wasn't actually there to try to justify the warranting of critical acclaim and Oscar-buzz talk. It was unforced and naturally immersive, and this is something to really appreciate these days imo.<br/><br/>To be naturally taken in by a good story with great acting, with surprise elements (such as the repeated inclusion of historical events like the JFK victory, the Bay of Pigs and Castro, how the mafia had casino investments in Cuba, Kennedy's assassination, Bobby Kennedy as Attorney General going after the mob despite the fact that the mob was one of the reasons why Kennedy won in the first place, and subsequently even the Nixon years) was a true pleasure each and every scene. While the glass-half-empty people can criticize the deaging CGI, nobody can argue for one minute that all 3 lead actors were at least good, and this is not to mention all of the solid supporting characters (I mean to have Harvey Keitel as like a secondary character in a movie like this is a luxury with his menacing glare and wise-guy presence).<br/><br/>Best of all, this is all based on a true story so all of these people really existed, and I would be lying if I told you I didn't laugh several times throughout the film, including at the screen stoppage and captions that revealed when and how many of the side characters eventually died (which was usually something like ""1981, 8 shots to the head"" or ""1980 six gunshots to the back of the head""), or the conversation in the car that extends and Pacino asks Sally Bags what he knows about fish (""Have you ever even caught a fish?""). Being real people and based on true historical events is an incredibly understated asset of this film. Even the road movie aspect of it, how it is in the present day and they are driving through Pennsylvania and stopping for smoke breaks for Pesci's wife on their way to Ohio I found to be pleasingly realistic.<br/><br/>For most of the movie, especially Pesci, it doesn't feel like the actors are acting at all. Sometimes DeNiro had some forced scenes, and Pacino always goes over the top at times, but overall the acting was just excellent.<br/><br/>Even though I fell asleep at 5am about halfway through the movie on the first night it was released, which was already way past my usual sleep time, I still couldn't wait to finish it the next day. But I'll be honest, I thought it was going to get boring since it had slowed down in the middle a little bit. But later in the day I returned to pick up where I had left off and I was in for a big surprise as to the rest of it.<br/><br/>Reminding me slightly of the Aviator, the ending of the movie goes into DeNiro's/Sheeran's later life and old age, as well as Pesci's. These scenes were all gold and well done, surprisingly, I truly appreciated the maturity and realism with which Scorcese constructed this portion of the movie and its scenes and themes. I don't understand some critics who saw this part as Scorcese himself as atoning for his violent movies at all, although that's a fine interpretation if that works and perhaps it has some truth to it. Instead, what I saw was the humanity of this gangster (gangsters including Pesci) being shown to the audience as he struggles with ailments and immobility. I'm not going to lie, but personally, I was immersed and saddened by this final half an hour.<br/><br/>Sure this guy was a killing SOB, but in old age, I really felt bad for him. I'm not sure what exactly that means. It's not that there haven't been other movies or shows that didn't make you feel bad for the villain. But one thing it did mean is that Scorcese made this movie more soulful and emotional than it really needed to be, he ended it with that, and that will probably make it ultimately memorable in a unique way. Anyone who shut the movie off in the first 30 minutes or halfway through doesn't deserve to catch the final 30 minutes because they don't have the depth to access and appreciate such raw material and emotional truths about life anyway.<br/><br/>I was just appreciative that I finally got to see a real movie about real people, who weren't overly glamourized as say in The Wolf of Wall Street, or as boringly evolved as in the Aviator. I got to see a truly good movie that easily deserves its Award-buzz without feeling like I was trying to find a piece of sand in a tall field of grass, and for that, I'm appreciative."

Their age was a problem, despite ""a custom three-camera rig and extensive digital de-aging visual effects (that) were used to make De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci appear younger in many of the film's flashbacks"". De Niro's age was particularly on display; he looked like a jittery old man not the young man who's daughter he was standing up for.<br/><br/>This was less of an issue for Pacino and Pesci because their roles were different.<br/><br/>Quite apart from age, I find it difficult now to watch a De Niro on film without seeing his foul-mouthed, disgusting anti-Trump rants.

","I've seen Scorsese's classic: The Departed, Goodfellas, Casino, Wolf of Wall Street, Ragin Bull, Taxi Driver, etc. This movie 'The Irishman' isn't in the same league as the his other movies, it's not even the same sport.<br/><br/>Some may think a rating of one star is harsh but given the director, the actors, the massive budget, this is hugely underwhelming. A massive failure to deliver on the hype.<br/><br/>The movie started off as a story about a hitman played by Robert De Niro. I think the main character was suppose to be a very interesting person but for me he wasn't. Al Pacino's character (Jimmy Hoffa) comes in to the movie about an hour in and I was more interested in his story than anything else. After Hoffa's inevitable disappearance there's another hour of old men shuffling about in prison, picking out caskets, where they are going to get buried, etc. It turned in to a snoozefest.<br/><br/>The CGI was hyped up about how these guys were made to look younger and older. It was suppose to be amazing - It's not. It's jarring as hell. There's this strange blue eye effect going on that I couldn't quite understand. Despite changes to their faces they still move around like geriatrics. There's one scene De Niro is beating someone up and it's hilarious because he can barely stamp on the guys hand properly. Keep in mind De Niro is in his mid 70s and it shows in the body language. They should've used younger actors.<br/><br/>When the end credit came up I was like 'what the fudge?! That's it?!'

"liberalareblowhacks","6","17","32","1 December 2019"," A pretty good movie, but no Scorsese masterpiece
","Since there are already countless long and drawn-out reviews of this film, I won't subject you to another one. I'll just hand it to you straight. This movie for me definitely had its good gangster moments, but most of it was a sad reminder of an era that will never be again. I'll just focus on the main three actors since, let's be honest, nobody really cares about anybody else here. From a political standpoint, I think DeNiro has been acting like a lowlife degenerate for his blatant disrespect to the President. I left that part aside and remained very objective while viewing the film. I only mentioned that because I don't want any negative review on his performance to be automatically attributed to that, like I know is the case with many others. Had this been 15 or 20 years ago he may have delivered one of the best performances of his career. Here, his age shows... and shows BIG TIME. The de-aging effect really didn't bother me. Watching DeNiro's physicality made his age abundantly clear and it many times distracted from the character's age during that period of time. DeNiro, like his cohorts, moved very stiff in many scenes, almost like he was in physical pain. Nothing about his portrayal was smooth or graceful, even during the character's younger years. Pacino suffered from many of the same issues. I actually think he was horribly miscast here and didn't even look the part. Maybe I'm a bit biased because the 1992 Hoffa movie with Jack Nicholson is one of my favorites; Nicholson gives an A+ performance of Hoffa in that one and looks just like him. Pacino does a lot of yelling and cussing at people here, most of which comes off as laughable before it does intimidating. They could have used him more effectively in another role here, as Hoffa he most certainly is not. It was nice to see Pesci onscreen again, although if you go into this expecting to see the hotheaded maniac of old from the Goodfellas and Casino days, you are going to be sorely disappointed. He plays a more reserved and reflective gangster here, although his menace is still very abundant. I think he did the best job out of the three main actors, although that's not saying all that much to his credit.<br/><br/>The Irishman is an okay way to kill a boring afternoon, but I don't think it's one that people will be falling over themselves to re-watch. There are a lot of characters to keep track of and the movie had flashbacks of flashbacks, if that makes any sense. I would recommend that anyone who is entirely unfamiliar with the Hoffa story go watch the 1992 version with Nicholson first. Its plot is a bit more simplified and easier to navigate. Then give this one a try. I agree with many of the other posters about the general feeling of depression that permeates the aura of this film. Not because of anything in the plot. But because we, as lovers of the gangster genre, are very much aware that this was probably the last time at bat for the three main actors. Even if they did make another one down the road, it definitely wouldn't be for the better. It would be nice to take these three guys and freeze them in time to the 1995 versions of themselves and keep making these films forever. Reality dictates otherwise and it's quite a shame to watch these guys playing dollar store versions of what they used to be. Time waits on no one. We're all gonna get there some day as well. Hopefully."

","""The Irishman"" is really a great film. When the viewer watches a movie with 3h 29min running time and does not stop or take a nap it is an indication that the film is attractive and holds the attention. The screenplay is excellent, disclosing in flashbacks the life of the gangster Frank Sheeran performed by Robert De Niro. Martin Scorsese is certainly one of the best directors of Mafia films. The cast with the veteran Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel is the indication of maybe the best in the genre in the contemporary world. The effects in the make-up are amazing and it is hard to know who they are in the present days. In the end, ""The Irishman"" is certainly one of the best (if not the best) production by Netflix.

"tmacchallenger","10","51","113","28 October 2019"," Horrifically Enthralling
","This movie was a different animal then Scorsese's other gangster films. Something about it was disturbing that after viewing I still can't quite put my finger on. It's hard and not really fair to compare Irishman right away to Goodfellas and Casino, which I've seen a hundred times each. I will say that after subsequent viewings, that even if I don't like it better then those two films, the Irishman is better then The Departed, Mean Streets, and Gangs of New York imo.<br/><br/>During the Wolf of Wall Street (which I don't count as a real gangster film as great as it was), I kept checking my watch because I was having such a good time I didn't want it to end. The Irishman took on a different form of enjoyment where I never once looked at the time because I was so absorbed with what I was watching. The first hour reminded me of Goodfellas, the second hour kind of reminded me of Gangs of New York because of Scorsese giving us another history lesson about America's underbelly, and the last part of the film reminded me a bit of Casino with an undertone that felt to me like a horror movie. Even though we know what's coming to Hoffa, it doesn't make it any less disturbing to watch when we see it.<br/><br/>I never watched any of Scorsese's religious movies like Silence so I can't give an opinion about comparing the ending of the Irishman to the tone of those films. I'll just say I felt like I was attending a bittersweet funeral at the end.<br/><br/>Enough has already been said about how great the actors were so I'll just end my review by stating that Stephan Graham was another standout besides the other three main stars. He more then held his own and brought an eclectic, elictrifying mix of comedy and toughness to the story. An excellent villain in a movie full of bad guys.<br/><br/>I hope others enjoy the movie as much as I had.

Robert DeNiro is one of the main characters who is supposed to be a tough hit man, but he moves and walks around like the very old man he is in real life. They also put blue contact lenses in his eyes which didn't look natural at all. Pesci and Pacino are o.k. in their roles, but very average performers in this movie.

However, this didn't ruin my experience at all.<br/><br/>I think that what makes Scorsese so great it's that, despite his age and his long career as a filmmaker, he's still making movies as good as the ones he made 30 or 40 years ago (can't say the same about Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, Ridley Scott or other directors that were once great), and I'm sure that he is not going to stop very soon.<br/><br/>After Parasite, The Irishman is by far my second favorite film in a year that has been great for cinema, and I can't encourage you enough to watch it, as long as you know what you're going for."

"reaver80808-552-7999","6","10","17","2 December 2019"," Stylish, classy, but indulgent and LONG
","The Irishman is a beautifully shot, terrifically acted movie. It's reminiscent of these fine actor's earlier gangster epics, but it is not without it's issues. Some of which are glaring.<br/><br/>Firstly, and most noticeably is the running time. Don't get me wrong. I have no issues with attention span. In my view a movie can be as long as it wants. So long as it fills that time well. The Irishman could have easily been reined-in by 45 minutes at least, without ever hurting the plot or feel of the movie. Sadly, I found myself clock watching on a few occasions in it's three and a half hour run time, and my partner...well she fell asleep at two hours twenty.
As an example, almost an hour of the movie is essentially De Niro going ""you gotta calm down, Jimmy"" and Al Pacino replying ""I won't calm down, Franky"". We get it already, he's stubborn, the mob are annoyed.
It is still watchable at this length, (if you have some grit) which is testament to those involved, but it's pushing it and pushing it hard. At times feeling over indulgent. I imagine it would have suffered harsher reviews, had it been a cinema release. The comfort of your own couch, bathroom and access to coffee goes a long way here.<br/><br/>The other issue for me, was the use of Pacino and particularly De Niro, in portraying their characters younger selves. I can't help but feel it would have been more effective to use younger actors of a similar appearance to portray these characters in their earlier years. I have the utmost respect for everyone involved in this, but there comes a point when you have to accept that these guys are no spring chickens. There is some skilled use of makeup (CGI?), but no amount of makeup could hide Pacino's aging posture. He is pushing 80 after all. Yet Here at stages in the movie, Pacino is supposed to be Jimmy Hoffa in his 50's and 60's, possibly even younger.
Worse still, De Niro's character Frank Sheeran is frequently referred to as ""kid"", yet even with makeup/effects/hair dye he appears to be in his 50's or 60's. Not bad for a guy pushing towards eighty, right?... Not so great when you consider the reality that Sheeran was in his mid twenties when he met Russel Bufalino and began working for the mob. No amount of 'Just For Men' is pulling that illusion off.<br/><br/>Negatives aside, the scenery, attention to detail, costumes and cinematography are all excellent, as is the acting by everyone involved. And, even if you already know the history surrounding Hoffa and the unions, it's still a fairly compelling story.
I found it watchable and enjoyed it in part, but I feel it would have had a lot more impact at a shorter run time. I would have easily given this 8 or 9 out of 10, had it cut to the chase a bit sooner and maybe not leaned so heavily on the makeup team."

Clearly, this is not one of Scorsese's best work (it's not even in his top 100 for that matter) and it fell flat. Over half of the people that died in this story were not killed on screen. They would freeze the frame and tell you how and when they died. For those that DID die on screen, there was no build-up, no flare...Nothing. Just a surprise Pop-Pop-Pop to the back of the head and the movie moved on. This was just an utterly boring piece of crap, much like what Robert DeNiro has become in real life.

Yes there is still a place for this sort of thing but sadly that place will be a quiet dusty corner of history as this falls well short in terms of story & relevance. Of course film critics will lap it up & fawn over Scorsese' greatness but length of film does not equal great movie & Scorsese should have left at least an hour or more on the cutting room floor.

But getting mob-type genre back in play in 2020 needs a bit of a twist and taste for the different audiences. 3' 24"" is outrageously long and slow even for the fanatics.
I watched it on Netflix and it took 2 days to go through the movie.
Very slow character development, which is absolutely not necessary, as we as audiences are already trained in this genre.
If you don't like this mob-type genre and these actors, there is almost no chance you would watch this movie or you 'd drop it after half an hour.
Only plus is the good acting of course and the great directing but...if you are new to this genre, start from the classics!

","If you can't get by an actor's politics to watch a movie then suit yourself. I certainly don't believe in Deniro's liberal world view. But that's not going to stop me from watching a movie he happens to be in unless the movie itself is political propaganda, which is not the case here. There is no denying the virtuosity of certain actors and watching Deniro, Pacino, Pesci and Keitel all together in one epic film was a rare treat. It's like a renaissance painting in which DaVinci, Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Titian all had a hand. In a thousand years, are the politics of those artists going to matter one fig when it comes to appreciating their creations? What's striking and engrossing about this film is the arc of the narrative that ends where we all know our own lives will end but don't want to think about it: old, infirm, possibly alone, facing our mortality and the possible consequences of our choices in life. We, as men, can empathize somewhat with Sheeran as he tries to justify his life's choices to his estranged Daughter as his attempt to protect his family from the horrors of the world. We observe Deniro as he is preparing for his own end. We watch Sheeran's attempt at confession as a Catholic priest incredulously tries to evoke repentance from a man who is so morally callous that he cannot even summon the remorse needed to save his own soul. The priest is left with no option but to fudge a loophole that he hopes will gain his supplicant absolution, but probably won't. In the end, we watch voyeuristically as Sheeran is reduced to selecting his own coffin. It is due to Deniro's virtuosity that Sheeran seems simultaneously both disturbed and matter-of-fact as he does so. In the end, we see Sheeran, alone, in a nursing home contemplating his past and its consequences. And we find ourselves wondering if Sheeran, on some level, is us."

"matthew-turner37","10","21","42","29 November 2019"," A Profoundly Moving Tale of Loyalty, Betrayal, and Guilt
","Scorsese's mob films (I'll lump Wolf of Wall Street in with them) are harshly critical of organized crime and the destruction these criminals bring down on everyone around them. However, those sequences when the world comes crashing down around the main characters are explosive and fast, never leaving enough time for reflection on the crimes committed and the lives ruined. 'The Irishman' takes the time to focus on the guilt-ridden aftermath. That focus turns the film into a profoundly moving piece.<br/><br/>I will first say that the otherwise masterful editing is weak in the opening 45 minutes. The film inter-cuts too often between the establishing scenes and events that take place much later. Without any context, these edits struck me as awkward and pointless. This is a nothing complaint, just don't be too worried if the opening feels a little odd.<br/><br/>The foundation of the film is the moral struggle of De Niro's Frank Sheeran. Sheeran is both a trusted associate of the mob and a trusted friend of Jimmy Hoffa's teamster union. The tensions between Hoffa and the mob place Sheeran in the middle of two stubborn and powerful forces. De Niro's acting is subtle beyond belief. Sheeran is a cold hard professional, and any melodrama from the character would be a misstep. The film itself effortlessly sidesteps any cheap emotional frills where they easily could have surfaced. Nevertheless, we can always see into Sheeran's head and understand the moral questions he is facing.<br/><br/>The aftermath of the struggle is where 'The Irishman' shines though. We see what happens to these men in old age. Powerful mobsters don't often die of natural causes. Throughout the film, we are greeted with slightly comical blurbs telling how and when various mobsters died (often via violence). But what about those who live to see 80. These men didn't build lives to last, and so we see them limp on to deeply depressing deaths.<br/><br/>That is the point of 'The Irishman.' Even when mobsters live, they live only to see that their lives were pathetic. It is a reflection on the price that a mob life inflicts on those who live it, and those around them. That makes this the ultimate mob film. The sense of fun that lasted to the final scenes of 'Goodfellas' is overridden by somber reflection. There cannot be anything but a depressing ending."

"lp-27434","3","8","13","20 December 2019"," Greatly anticipated but totally disappointing
","I'm a huge fan of Scorcese, DeNiro, Pacino, etc. but was disappointed in this collaboration.<br/><br/>This story of how Jimmy Hoffa intrigued me since I was a kid and I believe out of all the theories of how Hoffa died, this is the most believable. I dont necessarily agree that the movie went too long but there were way too many 1-scene characters that only muddied the flow of the story. But it was still a good storyline.<br/><br/>The acting on the other hand was my biggest disappointment. First, they should have played this like GF2, with younger actors portraying the older. As good as DeNiro can be, he was not believable as a young man, just watch him throw a handgun let alone a punch. Pacino was just okay, but I thought Pesci and Harvey Kaitel were very good and was pleasantly surprised at Ray Romano's acting. Most of the supporter characters had either poor lines or bad direction.<br/><br/>The scene where JFK died was a stereotypical scene, but totally unbelievable since the people watching the television newscasts were truly pissed at the Kennedy family for letting them down after the election. Should have been written differently to be believable. That was just a simple example of the writing being poor but the directing was not much better.<br/><br/>Hopefully this isn't Scorsese's swan song."
"mxsuba26","1","8","13","15 December 2019"," Should be called ""Goodfellas in Depends Diapers""
","Very very very long film. Horribly depressing story of a labor racketeer/hitman for the mob with ties to Jimmy Hoffa, (if anyone actually remembers Hoffa) who is telling his story from present day in an assisted living facility where he is wheelchair bound. There are no likable main or even secondary characters in the entire film. All of the old mafia movie standard actors are recycled in this film hopefully for one last time - Pacino, DeNiro, Kietel, and many more and are far far too old to have been in this regardless of the makeup, girdles and hair color. Should have had much younger actors portray these geezers in the first part of the movie which is set in the 1950's and 1960's. Even in the beginning of the film where the DeNiro (noticeably overweight) character is supposed to be about 40, you can see that he has trouble walking normally since he is really in his 70's. The actresses playing their wives are far too young for these geriatric actors. Their daughters could easily be their grand daughters. It is a dull film that relies on the many of the techniques that were successful in Goodfellas and Casino but does not work well in this. Too many dumb scenes of Pacino (Hoffa) shoveling ice cream into his mouth and complaining about his cronies coming 15 minutes late to a meeting. Explains why it went to Netflix so fast."
"pudlzd","6","8","13","1 December 2019"," Way too long and boring

From start till the end the movie is brilliant, slower than usual Scorsese flicks, but brilliantly done. The editing of the movie is terrific and it will never bore, it movies at a slow pace, its poetic and story is just outstanding.
Al Pacino was the standout performance for me, he gave a mind blowing performance, probably the best performance of the year.
Joe Pesci was unbelievably good, especially considering Goodfellas, Casino and Raging Bull, he was really different.
Robert De Niro was mesmerizing, just outstanding, especially in the last 30 minutes he was insane.

10/10 The last of its kind Masterpiece, cinema at its finest."
"jaredpahl","10","6","9","4 April 2020"," The Resurrection of Classic Cinema.
","In the year 2000, Martin Scorsese appeared alongside Roger Ebert to discuss his picks for the top ten best movies of the 1990s. At number four, Scorsese chose Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, Eyes Wide Shut. He said of it, ""I cherish the film because it puts you in the authoritative hands of an old master, with a style that flies in the face of every modern convention."" Those words hold truth. It seems the very best movies are the auteur pictures. The ones with a guiding hand that shakes you in your seat, directs you through the story, and pummels you with images of power and grace. And that is how I would describe Scorsese's own film, 2019's The Irishman. This sprawling mob epic/ intimate character examination/ eulogy to a lost film era, is a gift. Through all three and a half hours of The Irishman, I was awash in a kind of deep gratitude. I had the surreal sensation of witnessing an all-time classic reveal itself before my eyes. It was like discovering The Godfather in 1972 or Goodfellas in 1990. I felt the warm truth the actors brought, and the ultra-confident hands of a filmmaker who may one day be recognized as the greatest artist of the medium. The Irishman is Scorsese's Eyes Wide Shut; a master director 's masterpiece, a towering beacon from another era, somehow, gloriously existing in this one.<br/><br/>The most apt descriptor of the Irishman may not be the first thing to come to mind when you look at the pieces involved. For all its small time thugs, cozy interiors, and countless scenes of meetings, phone conversations and casual dinners, The Irishman is an epic. Epics seem to come to Hollywood in waves. For every boom time (1920s, 1960s, 2000s), there are long droughts where nary a single movie is made that can rightfully claim the title. We are in the middle of such a drought. Many movies are overblown and overlong, but none truly epic. The Irishman, which has gotten plenty of ire for its daunting three and half hour runtime, is one of the only true epics if its decade. And not just because of its length. The story of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a supposed mob hitman and crucial cog in the rise and fall of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) seems very much of a piece with Scorsese's other, smaller mob movies, Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed. Those films teem with energy, but they don't match The Irishman for scope. Here is an adapted screenplay by Steve Zaillian that traces the breadth of the Golden years of American crime and filters it through the eyes of a handful of characters. Following Frank from the end of World War II to the beginning of the 21st century, Zaillian and Scorsese create a story that feels enormous. The script somehow manages to weave together a slew of major world events into Frank's story a la Forrest Gump, but in a way that feels real and inevitable. This movie is huge. Scorsese holds nothing back; no idea, no bit of color, no set piece or character moment. It's all in there. Yes, The Irishman is very long, and it feels long. It should. This is a journey. The film sweeps you along for its entirety. The sumptuous technical craft and storytelling involvement make it next to impossible to tear yourself away from its embrace. You savor every single moment of The Irishman. It's a feast. The canvas is enormous and every inch of it is painted with exquisite detail.<br/><br/>The Irishman is cast like a film lover's ultimate fantasy. The epic crime drama is populated with many of the finest character actors working, as well as a few inspired outsiders, and it stars three of the all-time titans of the industry. But fantasy this is not. What's better is not just that this film exists, for real, in our time, but that everyone is at the very top of their games. Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran roars back into the world of acting after a long hiatus as a human cartoon character. His Sheeran is an extremely tricky challenge for an actor. He is asked to play a man who is a bit of a dolt, but is still racked with unrecognized guilt. It's an internalized performance if ever there was one. DeNiro plays it absolutely right. He doesn't command the screen like we know he can, but instead wisely chooses a weak, almost bashful, but kind of charming naÃ¯vetÃ©. The heavy lifting comes from the supporting players. Specifically, the two other legends brought back from the cinematic grave, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. Pacino plays Jimmy Hoffa in a towering performance worthy to stand alongside the very best of his legendary career. His entrance in the film brings a thunderbolt of classic acting energy. If any living actor understands the power of commanding theatricality on screen, it must be Pacino. His Hoffa is a shining example of the tremendous power of acting joie de vivre. The beating heart of The Irishman is, however, Joe Pesci. His very appearance is a shock, having been retired from acting for 20 years, but almost more shocking is his unprecedentedly subtle brilliance as Frank Sheehan's mob mentor, Russell Bufalino. He is far away from the volatile goons on which he made his name. Here Pesci is relaxed, sagely, and world weary. His presence onscreen is awesome in an almost religious sense. It's literally like watching someone rise from the dead, wiser and more ethereal than before.<br/><br/>Who knew this was possible? Who knew these legends who seemed to have faded away into history long ago, still had this intensity, this sensitivity, this skill? Maybe they never lost it. How lucky are we, then, to have gotten this showcase script for them to shine in? The Irishman's detractors have hid behind certain ""controversial"" elements, such as the CGI de-aging used to assist the actors in portraying their younger selves, the film's length, or its distribution on Netflix. None of these trivial hang ups negate what Martin Scorsese and his collaborators have done with The Irishman. This is a classic that will hang in the annals of film history. A film to stand alongside The Godfather, Goodfellas, and the other greats of the genre. The simple fact that it exists brings me immense joy. The fact that it is a perfectly crafted piece of art, overflowing with meaning and themes and personal connections to its auteur brings me something else entirely. This is why I watch movies, why I never allow myself to get too discouraged by modern sensibilities. Because the masters are always a spark of inspiration away from returning to glory. Don't lose hope, there is still room for new classics.<br/><br/>98/100"

","As Scorsese once again returns to familiar territory of the gangster epic one would expect some diminishing returns; the film's deep structure is substantially similar to Goodfellas and Casino. Add in that the main actors are Scorsese mainstays and there was a real chance of this being warmed over hash. Instead, the similarities to earlier films works in the film's favor as Scorsese continues to hone the form. The intertext content causes us to re-examine the prior works.<br/><br/>The film is as much about examining a life lived as the inner working of the mob. The story is told in retrospective and the script repeatedly meanders in the way an old man does. De Niro and Scorsese both lean into Frank telling the story (it is a quasi confession) and this allows for a strong sense of time passing; of a life filled with ill fated choices and regret. At 3 hours and change the film is long but the length is for a rich fullness. This is a wonderfully comprehensive film.<br/><br/>Scorsese handles the special effects well. The film has some nonlinear editing that helps sell the de-aging. The visual effect themselves are quite good; I was surprised to learn that no make up was used for the three main actors. I had thought it was a blend of practical and CGI work. Even on the basic level of technique this is a interesting film.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of the film is Pesci. It is not only good to see him again but his performance is a masterwork of icy understatement and malice. I don't know if it is a better performance than Goodfellas-the two characters are so different!-but I loved that Pesci choose to be restrained and controlled here. It acts as irony within the film and within his career.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films of the year."

Wasting money and time on showing the actors as younger didn't work as their age still showed through especially in their movements - DeNiro kicking someone as a middle aged man looked very much like an old DeNiro kicking someone. I didn't feel any raw emotion throughout the entire 3+ hours even at the most important or meaningful parts of the movie. DeNiro was fine and his usual solid self but not sure what was so Oscar worthy about his performance. The movie itself to me at least became exactly what Franks daughter did the entire movie in being quiet without much emotion."

","Watched at LFF 2019 Closing Night Gala.<br/><br/>Well, those three and a half hours flew by graciously. This is a hefty, meaty film. De Niro, Pacino & Pesci - ALL phenomenal. Pacino especially stole the show for me. What Martin Scorsese accomplishes here is something of a cross between GoodFellas and The Wolf of Wall Street, with sprinklings of the rest of his work throughout.<br/><br/>The de-aging (which seems to be the talk at the moment) is pretty solid. Once you adjust your eyes, you forget it's even there. I will say though, the actors are old now, and they clearly don't move like they used to. So it's not so much the 'younger skin' that would be a giveaway, but the way in which the actors move and carry themselves.<br/><br/>It is a long film. But not once did I feel like it was outstaying its welcome. The last hour and a half was particularly enjoyable for me - there were some real nice moments between several characters. The script is juicy, with a mix of hilarity, preciseness, and even a little poignancy.<br/><br/>It may be the post-film hype talking here, but I think The Irishman is Scorsese's best. It's certainly my favourite piece from him. It feels like a farewell. We'll see how that fares when I rewatch next month on its official release."

","I think it's strange that some people think this movie is overrated, or even worse, rating it anything lesser than a seven. I agree that Martin Scorsese made better movies but to say this one is bad is just ridiculous. If you like the mobster genre you will like this one as well. It's a story worth to be told, as most of the people (at least the older generation) know all the characters from newspaper headlines, books or movies. The Irishman is long, very long, but I wasn't bored for one second, and for that alone it's already an achievement. I think this movie is worth all the nominations it got, the make up is the only thing that could have been better. But what to say about the cast? Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, those are all names that always deliver, certainly in Mafia related movies. The rest of the cast was also perfect for this movie. To me Martin Scorsese is the master in this genre. Every mob movie he made is a delight to watch and so is The Irishman."
"anthonydapiii","8","2","2","8 May 2020"," Scorsese Masterpiece
","I love the basis of when this film takes place and it's even cooler because I live in the Philadelphia area.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese does an amazing job of making this filmmaking match the storytelling. Some of my favorite parts were interactions between Frank and his daughter - especially when they were eating breakfast after he killed someone on a mission the night prior and the wide angle lens makes it feel close. It's as though Frank's daughter knew what was going on, but since there was nothing said, the filmmaking fills the silence void.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film with a great film crew and cast."
"wavecat13","8","2","2","6 May 2020"," More than just a mafia tale
","This has to be the last hurrah for the great De Niro and Pesci, doing another Scorsese flick together. Here they are not always believably playing young(ish) men some of the time. It is interesting to see Ray Romano playing a smooth lawyer. If this was just a gangster flick, it would not be a great one, but it is memorable because it is more than that. This is a tale about morality and loyalty. It presents the life story of a decent, loyal guy, a devoted family man and trustworthy buddy - who is also a crook and a cold-blooded killer, a Mafia operative and hit man, a guy who would shoot a friend in the face or the back if it was called for. The long ending and slow start recall the films of an earlier era, as does the prolonged presentation of the Jimmy Hoffa story."
"linamorenog","8","2","2","4 May 2020"," Greats of Gangster films play age inappropriate roles
","I have the greatest respect for Mr. Scorsese. I adore that he brought the band together of Gangster Film Greats: Deniro, Pacino and Pesci. Even the supporting cast are heavyweights: Paquin, Keitel, and Romano. The casting was a great business choice; it surely got us all to watch, didn't it?<br/><br/>However, this film was seriously miscast for the story. The roles these guys were playing belonged to actors 30 years younger than they are; and in the case of ""The Kid"" Deniro: 50 years younger than him; and even though Scorsese tried to overcome this issue with technology, the 30 years gap is simply too hard to breach. I wonder... why is this subject being blatantly ignored? Can you imagine how the public would be up in arms if women played roles written for someone 30 years younger? Would that movie receive even one Oscar nomination? On this year alone, 2020, I have watched several films where women in their 20s portray characters in their 30s, and good luck finding a movie with actresses in their 40s or 50s.<br/><br/>On a positive note: This movie is very well researched. For me, to see this on Netflix was the best venue possible. I watched it twice. The first time, I watched the full movie over 2 days, and the second time, on my computer with the occasional split-screen while I googled the names and delved deeper into the stories of the Chicago Mafia characters, the government guys who ended up in the Nixon impeachment hearings, the Bay of Pigs, etc. I loved it."

I believe this movie takes the extra half an hour a goodfellas didn't or any other mob movie it shows the regret and conflict Frank has about his past how it ruined his relationships with his family and he didn't just have it all gold rings and lavish meals for most mobsters it was max 10 years of glory to then die Inbetween forty foot high concrete walls and this movie shows that.

","The Irishman is much, much more than a ""mafia movie"". It is a lens into the US culture in the second half of the twentieth century and, probably, one of the most definitive lenses.<br/><br/>Reuniting De Niro, Pacino and Pesci was certainly an amazing feat but if you're expecting another Godfather or Goodfellas, forget it. This movie is not an insight into the mafia and its various manifestations but juxtaposes three different elements, each of which in its own right could easily justify (and in some cases has) a one or two part series.<br/><br/>Scorsese and his team very effectively intertwine the mafia, the Teamsters and the Kennedy clan into a bubbling cauldron that spits out some interesting overspill, such as the line ""if they can do that to Kennedy, then......."".<br/><br/>At 3.5 hours long you might think this is a long movie but it really does not feel like that, it is so well made. Granted some of the earlier scenes can get a little confusing as we move from very old Frank, to old (middle-aged?) Frank to ""young"" Frank (still old De Niro) but get that past that and you have a fascinating movie that steers you towards answers to some of the fascinating mysteries that define the Kennedy/Nixon era."

","""The Irishman""
or
""Hit the snooze""<br/><br/>The problem in ""The Irishman"" is not in the acting; Pesci, DeNiro, and Pacino are all top form. The problem is not in the story itself, as the behind the scenes of Jimmy Hoffa and his cronies is an excellent premise. Where Irish falters is in screenplay and execution in direction. Bits and pieces of Scorcese's brilliance are there, but unfortunately they are few and far between. The soundtrack is brilliant as it matches the period, but there's little in terms of relating with the characters and the plot. The pacing is so bad and the characters are so one note, for at least the first 90 minutes, that you feel left out. The next 60 minutes move at a blistering pace, enjoyable at best, and the last 30 minutes are wasted on drawn out dialogue that leads to a far less desirable ending than expected. When Pesci is in, generally the film shines. Pacino and Deniro are best when they do not share the screen, as seen in ""Heat,"" and ""Righteous Kill."" The Irishman is a wasted opportunity, and if you feel the need to see a film about Jimmy Hoffa, catch ""Hoffa"" with Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito.<br/><br/>6/10"
"diffguy","8","2","2","2 December 2019"," JOE FRIGGIN PESCI
","Scorsese probably thinks he made a better film than he actually has. The Irishman is excellent, but there are several superfluous scenes that shouldn't have made the cut. For example, Frank Sheeran's phone call to Jo Hoffa that was essentially two minutes of mumbling dialogue that had no consequences or importance. Scorsese just likes being complete, even if it weakens the film. Especially the last 30 minutes that proceeded the final Hoffa scene, which in itself was anticlimactic. Could have made the Hoffa house 10 minutes of tension, arguing, moral quandaries, and betrayal, but NOPE. Just a little BOOP, and we move on. But seriously, the last 30 minutes post-Hoffa could have been 8 minutes max.<br/><br/>Al Pacino was as good as he has ever been. He played Jimmy Hoffa with a lot of gusto and attitude that made him believable, yet surprisingly powerful in the face of major crime families. Reminded me a lot of Scarface with his energy here, though far less of a psychopath.<br/><br/>DeNiro was unfortunately the weakest of the three. His acting was excellent, but it was also a role we've essentially seen him play before. He plays Frank Sheeran hard and cold, but loves his friends (Hoffa and Russell) to death, which was key to getting us to connect with this mass murderer. Very good on that component. However, the major problem with his role was he wasn't in a position of power. DeNiro shines stronger than any actor when given lines that display a powerful role, but Sheeran was essentially an attack dog, following orders, asking permission for much of the film. The role didn't allow him to show the full range of his acting prowess, was kind of disappointing. Still good though.<br/><br/>PESCI was unreal. Incredibly, this is Pesci's best role of his life. When Russell Buffalino starts talking, you frequently forget you're watching a film. Just enthralling to watch him on screen. It feels like you're a fly on the wall watching a true mobster do business. And this role is so unique for him. Gentle, and kind, and rational, yet hardened and cruel. Seriously deserves an oscar for this one."

Every actor here did extremely well Robert DeNiro Joe Pesci and even Stephen Graham did extremely well fitting in with the Hollywood legends but for me Al Pacino was amazing and although him and DeNiro between them haven't done much in years shows they still got it in them under the right director.

Thirdly, the 3 1/2 hours running time seemed longer than that. Long films are fine, if they're good, if they move along and if they are interesting.

"more-13","6","17","35","29 November 2019"," the uncanny valley is strong in this one
","Let's start with this. The 3 main characters younger facial reconstruction is just deep down in the uncanny valley. Especially De Niro's. I found it really hard not to get sucked out of the movie every time they're on screen. I get it that the film's appeal relies a lot on their casting. But i'd have rather had less emblematic actors doing the job without CGI makeup and with classic makeup for the scene in which they're older. Scorsese is a huge name enough to not have to cast these 3 as the main characters too. They could have played smaller roles and left some room for the next ""them"".
The CGI is sometimes very good and sometimes it's botched. When you're focused on that kind of stuff you cannot help yourself from watching the blurry chins, the hair lines that don't match, etc.
When you've seen several Pacino and De Niro movies you are used their younger body shapes and moves, and in this movie they just don't match. They move like older people, you can definitely feel it.
This is why I think traditional cinema should stay away from CGI and that kind of trick.<br/><br/>De Niro and Pacino just play too much a parody of themselves. It's like they were polyvalent actors when they were young and lost it by being typecast way too many times. This has a tendency to suck the audience out of the movie too : when you think ""oh De niro is doing the De Niro inverted smile again"" instead of just staying in the movie's flow. Don't get me wrong : they do the job really well, but it's like watching a brand new movie about someone saving the world, and BAM : it's Bruce Willis, and he's making jokes. BTW Pesci nailed it, he didn't ""Pesci in Goodfellas""-ed his role. All the other actors are just top notch, with some very pleasant surprises, such as Stephen Graham as a mafia boss.<br/><br/>Scorsese does the job. Like always. Although he rested on his laurels and did almost not take any risk. There are very few directing stunts compared to his other works. But that's ok, it looks it was the point of the movie : stay classic. Or maybe... knowing that there would be a huge CGI work on the movie he chose not to make any complex camera shot. Maybe the veeeery academic frame compositions were just a way to make the CGI work easier.<br/><br/>The editing isn't perfect. Some cuts just don't match. And it's not some Nouvelle Vague effects, those are supposed to be obvious enough to create their effect. It's just details, such as body position or stuff like this, and it sucks you out of the movie too.
That's a lot of stuff that breaks the flow of the movie and make it hard to follow.<br/><br/>The OST is efficient. Same trick as in his other ""historical"" movies : using music as a time marker.<br/><br/>So nopes. Definitely not his best work. Still my favorite director."
"JohnRayPeterson","8","8","14","1 December 2019"," How can you go wrong with Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino and Pesci?
","First, if you haven't noticed, it's a three and a half hours long movie, so make sure you pee before the movie starts, especially if you've bought one of those supersize soft drinks with your popcorn. That being said, the movie is not fast paced but it will be over faster than you might think; or not, but it did for me. The one short sentence IMDb storyline ""A mob hitman recalls his involvement with the slaying of Jimmy Hoffa"" is to the point and there's little more to it than that, but it's a Scorcese movie so it doesn't require much more.<br/><br/>Scorsese can deliver a mobster movie like no one else. There are actual real life characters and facts to season this dish of a movie, as the director loves to do, and he has a well deserved reputation for doing that. What this movie has, no previous ones by Scorsese do, to the best of my memory, is seeing the characters over a very long period of time, from early start in their life of crime, to their death. The special effects to the physical appearances of De Niro, Pesci and Pacino are noteworthy, very, and is of course what was needed to make the movie believable. All three main actors delivered performances equal to what you'd expect, perhaps one of Pesci's best in my opinion, perhaps.<br/><br/>Aside from the main three, there was a big cast with many actors we are all familiar with and that's always a plus. I noticed that Ray Romano continues to depart from his stand-up comedy and sitcom characters, in this movie, as he has with his role in the series 'Get Shorty' and I hope he continues to do that. Harvey Keitel's short and few scenes demonstrate how and why he has had success with his career (I'm a fan).<br/><br/>Finally I will leave you with a personal experience this movie gave me; it might just be something some of you will feel as well, just some of you; when it was all said and done, I felt old, it's the only way I can describe it, but please don't let that deter you from watching it."
"eelen-seth","7","27","61","30 October 2019"," Prodigious and astonishing, but not without flaws.
","The Irishman is supposed to be THE film for Netflix. With a $160 million budget and this year's most wanted de-aging technique (ref. Gemini Man), legendary director Martin Scorsese's long awaited new film has a lot of eyes and hungry fans to please. It's definitely made to be seen on a streaming platform, but with a 209 minute runtime, will this be a hit for Netflix?<br/><br/>A mob hitman, Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran (Robert De Niro), is a man with a lot on his mind. The former labor union high official and hitman, learned to kill serving in Italy during World War II. Recalling his possible involvement with the disappearance of his life-long friend, Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the former president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.<br/><br/>Scorsese's mobster tale is a classic in the making. But it isn't flawless. The well known director makes some interesting choices to tell The Irishman's story. We see old Frank in a retirement home, sharing the events of his life with the audience, just like grandpa used to do when visiting on a Sunday afternoon. We go back and forth in time, sometimes up to 40 years back. With the use of de-aging VFX, we see De Niro and co.'s faces through an Instagram-filter, to make them look 40 years younger. It's not a bad technique of visual effects, and it's important to tell the story, but it doesn't work as well as you'd hope it would. Especially in the very first scene, you notice how flawed the technique is when wrinkles are ironed out of Pesci and De Niro's faces, yet when zooming in on their hands you can clearly tell their real age.<br/><br/>Blue-contacts-wearing De Niro, gives a typical calm and collected De Niro-performance. He's a good actor, and his more nuanced work in this film is near the end when he gets to work with more emotional material. A very touching note to end the film on. Joe Pesci, who plays Russell Bufalino, knocks it out of the park. His comeback to the big screen is powerful, captivating and career-defining. But the one actor I didn't expect to like as much as I did, is Al Pacino. His performance as Jimmy Hoffa is both spiritual and worthy of every award coming award season. It was like as if he was possessed by the outrageous Hoffa himself - memorable and uncanny.<br/><br/>What bothered me throughout the film, was the use of music. I don't mind a piece of music to distinguish certain parts in a story from another, especially when you're going through so many different decades, but Scorsese uses so much music here, sometimes unsuitable to what's happening on screen, it takes away the power of the event. Robbie Robertson's score however, was delightful. Steven Zaillian's screenplay, based on Charles Brandt's book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"", is strong when it wants to be and reminded me of Tarantino's heavy dialogue work, but is mostly inconsistent in pacing and engagement. The film is three and a half hours long, you're going to have some slower bits, but at least hold your audience's attention. The jokes rarely land, but I'd like to say humour is subjective. I feel like some of you might absolutely love most of the script's boffolas, it just didn't land with me.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is substantial. From under-utilised Oscar winner Anna Paquin (as Peggy Sheeran) to celebrated Hollywood star cameos such as Harvey Keitel - everyone gets a little screen time in what's already packed as it is. But a lot doesn't get discussed. The families behind these powerful leaders barely have anything to do and just sit around as extras. Although, an unrecognisable Stephen Graham makes a long lasting impression as Hoffa's nemesis, mob boss Anthony Provenzano.<br/><br/>The Irishman is like watching a compilation of Scorsese's oeuvre. It's prodigious and astonishing, but not without flaws. This beautifully crafted film is quite small in scope compared to its running time, with perfect production design and the mighty incredible performances make it worth sitting through to the very end. The fact Scorsese decided not to release this piece of work as a mini-series, but as a full length feature film, shows confidence and a little bit of cockiness."
"movieman6-413-929510","8","11","21","30 November 2019"," Scorsese brings back the old Mafia crime movie feeling with his new movie.
","The Irishman is a new crime biography directed by Martin Scorsese, the director of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas.<br/><br/>The film is about the hit man of the Mafia Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) about the missing and later murder case of the American trade union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The two were lifelong friends and the judicial authorities suspect that Frank knows more about the disappearance and death of Jimmy Hoffa. During this trial, Frank looks back at his life on all the decisions and actions that he has made in his private and criminal life.<br/><br/>With this film, Martin Scorsese manages to put down a mafia crime film again, just like the earlier ones were made. As he did with his older crime films such as Goodfellas and Casino. Scorsese also allows the different story lines of the film to run through and past each other in a good way. This way you get a better idea as a viewer how the characters feel or what they think about certain situations they are experiencing. Because of this good way of telling the story of the film you do not notice that the film actually lasts three and a half hours, because once you are in the story, time flies by.<br/><br/>Thanks to special effects, they have also succeeded in rejuvenating or aging the cast. After getting used to how the cast looks rejuvenated or outdated, it soon comes across as if you are watching an older film of the actors when they were really young. Because of the appropriate film sets and clothing of the cast, the film also looks realistic as if you went back in time with the characters.<br/><br/>The acting work is also done well. The cast consists of a star cast of Oscar winning actors. It's great to see this talent under the direction of Martin Scorsese. Robert DeNiro has played a good major role in this film since The Intern movie of 2015 as a mafia gangster with whom he used to become known as an actor. Since the 2015 film Danny Collins, Al Pacino has again played a good larger role in this film. This is also the first time he has been in a Scorsese film. It's nice to see these two film talents working together on a film. Actor Joe Pesci even returned from his retirement for this film, because since 2010 he has not been featured in films. Despite having been out of the film world for a long time, he still knows how to deliver good acting as a mafia boss. He is a bit quieter and quieter for this role, but he still shows that he can be a danger to his enemies."

","Sub out Pacino for an actor in his prime then give it a re-edit to tighten things up and it's probably an 8.<br/><br/>Pacino was at his worst. There were some scenes were they could not hide how decrepit he is. He seem to be in poor physical condition. At times he was struggling to keep his left eye open. He was shouting all of the time. Just a miserable performance. He's a bad Saturday Night Live skit come to life.<br/><br/>DeNiro was better than Pacino and in good shape but they could not hide the fact that he's an old man so some of his scenes looked ridiculous. These type of roles have a high floor for DeNiro so he's always solid in them.<br/><br/>Everyone else in film was good. Outside of Pacino solid performances all around but the film lacked polish as if it was rushed through the editing process."
"AlsExGal","7","7","12","14 December 2019"," Somewhat like Goodfellas - Reprise
","Scorsese is never going to match that film in my opinion. It was the pinnacle of his career. The soundtrack, pace, edittng, acting were all just marvelous. And it gave you a look into the mob from ""the working mobster's"" point of view that made all similar mob movies look like garbage, before and after.<br/><br/>The Irishman is definitely worth your time, telling the story of mobster Frank Sheeran (De Niro) from his point of view, as he talks about how he befriended and ultimately executed James Hoffa. Realize that this is an unproven theory based on Sheeran's deathbed confession. Of course, how are you going to lose when Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci reunite with Scorsese. I'm not sure Pacino has ever worked with Scorsese before, but he's the pro he always was as Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>Since Pesci has been retired from acting for twenty years, the thing that struck me was how OLD he looked. It is actually jarring. He plays De Niro's brother in ""Raging Bull"", and a protege a generation younger than him in ""Goodfellas"", but here he is his elder! And then I look it up and Pesci is actually De Niro's age! So, leaving all of that aside, you get the great performances you'd expect, and the intimate viewpoint and story will hold your interest through the long running time. It is just very similar to Goodfellas in technique, and that is not a bad thing except it seemed like I had seen this film before.<br/><br/>The one unique thing about it? You get to see these mobsters as they get to very old age and have a chance to reflect and maybe have some regrets. In Goodfellas, the main character is in his late 30s when circumstances force him out of the mob.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it if you have ever liked anything that the actors or that Scorsese have done before."

Totally opposite of how great the movie Goodfellas or The Departed was. Robert de Niro, and Joe Pesci did very uninspiring portrayals of their characters. And Al Pacino was terrible as his portrayal of Jimmy Hoffa. The actor Stephen Graham, who played Tony Provenzano, would have made a much better Hoffa.

"jacksonhendrix","9","14","29","6 December 2019"," A lot of Idiots in This Review Section
","Spoiler alert! This is not Goodfellas. Anybody who went into watching this film anticipating that it would behold any similarities to Goodfellas was setting themselves up for disappointment. To refer to this movie as anything lesser than great is disrespectful, and demonstrates an utter intellectual inability to recognize story depth. If you are looking for easy and mindless entertainment, don't bother watching this film: it is laced with methodical story telling, prolonged character development, and various deeper meanings. This movie was not to reminisce previous Scorsese ""Mob Movies"". This movie was intended to stand on its own. The story may not contain a similar amount of action when compared to his previous works; however, his ability to embed deeper meaning within a biographical piece is remarkable.<br/><br/>the movie is slow and methodical in portraying the life story of Frank Sheeran. While Goodfellas focused primarily on the chaotic lifestyles of mobster, The Irishman focuses on how this lifestyle can destroy relationships, ruin lives, and precipitate nothing but sorrow for those involved once they reach old age. This cannot only be applied to those characters in the movie, but also to people in general. Frank Sheeran personifies an individual that gradually coaxes through life obeying what others tell him do, which ultimately leaves him miserable and dying with nothing but notoriety and regret. His relationship with Hoffa represents morality and the person he desperately wishes he was, while his relationship with Russ represents the person he currently is and will have to deal with the consequences of. In my strong opinion, this movie not only entertainingly portrays the unfamiliar story of Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa, but also serves to provide an introspection on life.<br/><br/>Al Pacino and Joe Pesci deliver brilliant performances, as they both masterfully compliment De Niro's quiet-spoken approach."
"Richie-67-485852","6","14","29","28 November 2019"," THE OVERBLOWN
","I like movies with this theme. Crime, mafia, illusions of power, gang-wars and the lessons learned when reviewing this life-style. It entertains because the vast majority of people at large do not actually act like this or do the things as depicted and the rest of society is drawn into seeing it rather than ever doing it. The Godfather broke some good ground as did Goodfellas, Casino and Kill the Irishman and some of the oldies prior like Al Capone with Rod Steiger, The Untouchables and even the Black Hand or Pay or Die with so many others too. They all follow the same theme of bad guys getting away with what they do, the rise and fall of power, what that money, fame and power buys and how those that live this life all end up i.e. dead. Now saying all that, the hype with this film was/is the stars who have established themselves with the Director and with that a marketing blitz took-off. As presented, who can find fault? What remained is to watch the movie and be entertained. However, seeing old actors trying to capture past successes only goes so far and Scorsese did not break any new ground here either. What we have is seeing the same old Pacino, Pepsi and De Niro replicating what worked for them but it is old, tired and all covered by now. One system that I use to judge movies on that many fail is this: Is this a movie you would see again? Does it have memorable scenes? Is it a comeback experience? The fact is either it is this type of movie or it is not. Once you have seen this movie assuming you didn't get bored you will not visit it again. I don't like it when things are presented larger than life (hype) and then I go in believing this and get let down. This is that case too. All concerned got very well-paid upfront and now they want to capture the costs and then some proving it was a fun and profitable romp at the viewers expense? There are many ways to kill time this be one of them. It is not bad nor very good"

Sometimes it helps to cast a less culturally ubiquitous actor, so that the character can outshine the performer. The real joy in this slog is Joe Pesci, who is terrific playing a very different kind of person than you're used to with him. So glad he came out of retirement for it. The CGI aging and de-aging is remarkable, but what would have been really good was to cast actors aged appropriately for their younger days, and age them with makeup. Sure, it's not the De Niro/Pacino star power, but it would have been a much better movie.<br/><br/>The Irishman is dragged down by stunt casting. And, I predict that it won't help at the box office.

We know that young men become old and we know that families are collateral damage which was a fairly unexplored opportunity which writers didn't do well with.<br/><br/>Ironic that DeNiro has become a bit of an activist himself later in life, there's nothing more belittling than a privileged actor telling us how to think.<br/><br/>One nice observation from the film is how easily trade unions are corrupted from within, all around the western world. They do not have the same checks and balances that state and federal governments have, watching this on the big screen was an educative silver lining."

I'm not sure if Steven Zaillian was bored and had nothing better to do than write a never-ending screenplay, as I feel an amateur writer could've assembled a better and more coherent script. Editing towards the end even got lazy. Scorsese's camera work was great, and the attention to detail in the production sets and costumes was incredible. But what stood out for me were the outstanding performances by De Niro, Pacino and the rest of the all-star greats, but Pesci stole the show. Great to see him out of retirement for this one.

"JosephJohnMurray","9","5","8","29 January 2020"," Another Scorsese Masterpiece
","In the current year, one could easily be forgiven for having difficulty in giving The Irishman the time of day. Clocking in at three and a half hours long, the type of filmmaking on display here could be argued to be a relic of a bygone era that typically would not connect with modern audiences, which is likely the only reason that Scorsese was forced to seek out funding from a company that goes against all of his beliefs on how Cinema should be viewed.
In this digital age, Western audiences are evidently attracted to more succinct and easily digestible movies that have more in common with episodes of TV than lengthy film epics like Raging Bull, The Godfather and The Deer Hunter. Most people seek movies that they can give somewhere between 1% and 50% of their attention to (allowing them to give the other 50%-99% to their phones) and a film is only considered to be good if it can catch enough of their attention to compete with the limitless entertainment machine in the hands of consumers. This is, of course, with the exception of the big Hollywood franchises including the MCU, Star Wars, etc. and big scale television shows such as Game of Thrones, which people cannot help but give up all the time in the world for. While the emotional impact of these products are certainly not to be disregarded as many Film snobs would have you believe, they rarely are able to produce a nuanced exploration of the human condition that delves deeper than surface level. This is precisely what Martin Scorsese was referring to when saying that these are not 'films', but another, highly significant form of entertainment, that has more in common with Disneyland than The Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>A film like 'The Irishman' was therefore destined to fail with mainstream audiences. Ditching all of the excess and pulpy entertainment on display in The Wolf of Wall Street, that provided a truly thrilling experience like no other and pleased both audiences and critics alike, this film offers a slower, more contemplative experience that's biggest strength is its thematic resonance more than its moment-to-moment entertainment (although this aspect still had me captivated from start to finish).<br/><br/>While not without a number of minor technical shortcomings (weak CGI blood, odd editing choices, some poor stunt-work) that one would next expect in a film from a director/producer of this calibre, this film is arguably Scorsese's most mature, poignant, and flawless insight into the human condition since Raging Bull. The film is ultimately about death, growing old, and how easy it is to let one's life slip away by focusing on the day-to-day struggles that are ultimately meaningless. While the first two acts of the film were incredibly entertaining, funny, and tragic all at the same time, the last act of the film contextualises the entire piece in a way that presents an utterly haunting message, prompting one to consider their entire life as a whole and remember that no job, sum of money, or amount of respect from peers is worth the same as genuine human connection - the true meaning of life."
"chmstewart","6","5","8","15 January 2020"," Nostalgic Disappointment
","The Irishman isn't a bad film. In a lot of ways it's a decent one. It's just not anything above good. The nostalgic feel makes for a feel good familiarity, but don't be fooled. This is far from a Scorsese masterpiece. Pesci and Pacino are outdated and miscast. Still wonderful actors but sadly often show their true age trying to play characters who are nearly thirty years their junior. The story is long, drawn out and too unoriginal to rate as highly as it does and certainly not a best picture candidate. Enjoy it for what it is - a decent flick that is better than a lot of movies out there, but not a new classic."
"jorisvaneil-143-494785","7","5","8","13 January 2020"," Ofcourse it's not bad, but most of all it's hugely overrated
","It's like Scorcese, Pacino, and DeNiro fans just hÃ¡ve to be lyrical about this movie, out of some kind religious conviction.<br/><br/>I realise this is just my opinion, like so many others here, but i think this movie is hugely overrated.
No, obviously this movie almost cant be bad. Not with this director, not with this budget, and not with this cast.<br/><br/>In short: i get the bliss of freedom it gives a director when there are no time constraints to the final cut. But how is it me, a simple consumer, and not Scorcese the genius director, who can see the obviousness of how a tension curve suffers when the movie's runtime is so long?
After 2 hours i felt i was still watching the introduction chapter.<br/><br/>I wasn't bored, but watching 3,5 episodes of The Sopranos back to back would have been significantly more entertaining than watching this story drag out.
Don't get me wrong, i love this genre, and i love all the other epics Scorcese has created. I've probably wished Casino or Goodfellas or The Departed could last longer, like 3,5 hours.
But i honestly think The Irishman pales in comparison to those 3 movies.<br/><br/>Another thing, i thought Al Pacino wasn't all that much in this movie.. yeah i know, it pains me to say it as much for you to hear such blasphemy. He just did what he always does. And not even that because i saw no real Pachino tantrum. Just him being old, sitting around, acting out his lines.<br/><br/>And the CG. I've read numerous articles of people praising how well they CG'd DeNiro to a younger version of himself. I totally disagree. I felt i saw no progress whatsoever in comparison to a much earlier try at good CG human faces like, say Tron Legacy. Uncanny valley, shiny plastic mask faces all over again.<br/><br/>And the story, i think i've mostly forgotten again since i saw the movie like 2 weeks ago or something.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, i think 7/10 is still pretty generous. Call it fear of angering the church of Scorcese/DeNiro/Pacino."
"WMB","4","5","8","6 January 2020"," You can't get young again
","This was a good story and Robert DeNiro is one of the finest actors of all time.....But..for me, it was impossible to take the movie seriously in many parts when 70+ year old DeNiro was supposed to be a man in his 30s and 40s. Makeup artists routinely age young actors to look older but it just doesn't work the other way. Same goes for Pacino and others in the film. I'm sure I would have loved this moving if it was done in flashbacks with younger men playing the youthful parts in the movie. I just couldn't stop looking at the jet black shoe polished hair on DeNiro that was supposed to be enough to shave 35 years off his face and laugh. In my circle, people feel the same but clearly there's a much wider audience that easily overcame it based on the very high ratings."

Somehow, Scorsese makes you feel empathy and sadness for cold blooded killers, after showing up close killings that somehow don't make you cringe.

","3.5 hour runtime. Holy crap. I love that this film had enough to say that it needed that long, but by the end it felt like I was marathoning a TV show. This was compounded by the fact that it lacked any noticeable 3 act structure. Major downsides of The Irishman were its failure to fork some extra money over to CGI when it counted. I can remember a scene where a glass window breaks and it looked awful. Positives included a palpable sense of inclusion and family that comes with an Irishman being accepted into the ranks of the Italian mafia. We all long to see and feel this inclusion so it always seems to be an intrinsically good thing. Also, I appreciated the inclusion of that empty feeling elders must get when their stories and life tales fall on the deaf ears of youth. The theme of finality manifests as a cold and lonely finality for our main character."

I will say that I did love it and was it too long at 3:29 minutes? I could watched 3 more hours but again I am bias but I was not bored for a second.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci once played a Homicidal Psychopath named Tommy Devito in Goodfellas and won best supporting actor deservedly so. This is a more understated role but make no mistake about it, after 18 years away from acting Pesci has not lost a thing, his portrayal as Russel Buffalino is amazing and was my favorite character in the movie, he may not be a Volcano about to blow his top like Devito was but he is just as dangerous and maybe more so as he pulls a few more strings.<br/><br/>Pacino has always been an over the top actor, some love him some think it's too much but to me he was perfect for the larger than life Jimmy Hoffa and he has a Grandiose performance that fits like a glove IMO, like Icarus Jimmy Hoffa flew to close to the sun and this is that story and what a story it is.<br/><br/>Deniro is The Irishman Frank Sheeran and this is the best performance I have seen from Bobby D in a long time and what can you say that has not already been said about the man, he is the company man who toes the line and does what needs doing and he really shines in the third act and I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>My final review is 4 out of four I loved it and don't have many gripes about the movie at all, would have liked to maybe see a little more of Frank Sheeran's family and how it fell from his grasp.

I really don't know what went wrong with the directing and editing.. and all that time it felt like the narrator was just introducing the personalities involved.... it felt like nothing really is happening.<br/><br/>From what I heard I expected to see outstanding acting..

I saw the movie the day it came out, and can't remember being more disappointed in a cinematic production. First of all, in my opinion, De Niro was miscast as Frank Sheeran; rather than an Irishman, he comes off as a digitally-enhanced old Italian playing the Irishman. More generally, the casting of the main characters was weak. Rather than going with good OLD boys of past triumphs, I think the movie would have benefitted from younger actors in the key roles.<br/><br/>Second, the screenplay didn't do justice to the story: insufficient character development, especially of Sheeran prior to his involvement with the mob; difficulty keeping track of several of the characters and their roles in the story; dialog that at times bordered on idiocy; and painfully slow pace, Rather than wondering what was coming next in the movie, I was thinking when the hell is this thing going to climax and be over. It was a 3 and a half hour movie that seemed much longer. Despite some great scenes and great acting, the movie at times was somewhat confusing and even boring in spots. Although I have great respect for him, I don't believe the overall direction of the movie was up to Scorsese's high standards.<br/><br/>In short, I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing the movie, but rather would recommend lowering your expectations if you've read Brandt's excellent book."

The movie, I think, could've been edited down to 2:30hrs and it would've made for a tighter story.<br/><br/>Still, ""The Irishman"" is worth the watch because some of cinema's greatest actors are in it, directed by one of Hollywood's most talented directors."
"k_dilshan_","8","3","4","18 February 2020"," Actor's talents carry the storyline
","First I must say it's not for everyone,bust if you're interested in this kind of movies it is a good movie.When you start watching 3 hour running time won't matter,because the actors will keep you until the end. The part that stick to me was the ending where how all of them living their last days. I mean most of the time they live their life how they wanted even frank (I think he only did a one thing that he don't want to do), but in the end they didn't have the chance to live the rest of their life with the ones they love and when they look back at things they did all of them had regrets. That gives a great lesson to all the people in this world. When you're in your last moment and when you look back at your life and if you have regrets how can you find peace in your life. I think because of that ending this movie reach the whole new level it gives the watchers something to think about and personally I like the movies that kept your mind busy for another few hours.
Although I have to tell about that poor action scene where frank beat that store man, that scene directly damaged the overall quality of the movie."

","Martin Scorsese Is one of the best you can like the movies he made.
The Irishman was one of the best Mob movies We can ever seen.the movie was about 209 Min but not only it's not boring at all but you can also see the real face of the Mobs. It's look like Martin Scorsese is one of the specialist on this field. and He knows everything about them."
"jbdean","7","3","4","29 December 2019"," A Headliner Cast - Still Not Enough To Make It A Classic
","Sadly this wasn't the swan song movie for DeNiro it's been hyped to be. With a runtime of 209 minutes, it's about 89 minutes too long. Filled with far too many ""talking heads"" scenes, with DeNiro and Pacino rehashing how he's got to do what the mob wants but he's not going to do what they want about 5 times too many. Okay already. We get it. Hoffa was a badass.<br/><br/>This coupled with endless scenes of Pesci & DeNiro's wives smoking, wanting to smoke or arguing about not being able to smoke was beyond a waste of film and time. It would have been fabulous if Scorsese would have used even a fourth of that 89 minutes to showcase Harvey Keitel. Instead we're left with seeing him maybe twice or three times with less dialogue than a glorified extra. It was truly disappointing.<br/><br/>While the film was good, it was far from great. It seemed like the Goodfellas met Scent of a Woman. At the end, the film shows us that DeNiro and Pacino have really not grown as actors as we've been led to believe. Gone are the edgy characters like DeNiro's Taxi Driver and Leonard from Awakenings! There was no hint of Pachino's Bobby Deerfield or even his Michael Corleone. We're left with the typical gangsters they've given us over the decades. Pesci, on the other hand, while still giving us a mild taste of Tommy DeVito from Goodfellas with a dash of Vinny Gambini from My Cousin Vinny, stole the show from the Trio of Headliners.<br/><br/>Is the movie one you should pass on altogether? Not if you enjoy these three stars or gangster movies or even the genre from the Jimmy Hoffa-era. Is is an Oscar winner? Well, it sadly doesn't get my vote but at the end of the (long) night, I am glad I watched it if for no other reason than to see DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino & Keitel all on the same bill."

","This movie is a eulogy to the fake Italian-American accent gangster movies reproduced by Martin Scorsese. The acting was good, the story was good but I felt the story was over flooding with content to cover. The story was trying to make a screen adaptation of ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" about Jimmy Hoffa's rise and fall and his people that were there for his rise but not his fall, and then there was the original thought provoking story of Scorsese's gangsters getting a reality check. It was hard to keep watching after two hours, but I'm glad I kept watching. The digital makeup to make the actors look younger was uncomfortable to watch because I knew there was old men under there, but I think that was the point. Scorsese loves to make his watchers uncomfortable, and I appreciate it. Movies should challenge our emotions and thoughts just like a painting or book.<br/><br/>This movie is great for anyone who loves the long dialogue, suspenseful, violent, Italian-American gangster Scorsese films. But if you aren't a fan of that kind of movie, I wouldn't recommend you commit to watching it."

"RayCharles81","10","12","25","29 November 2019"," Most of the Critics of This Movie
","Are revealing everything wrong with society in today's world, and it's tied to the fact that they are also Marvel and DC comic book groupies, as well as Star Wars Episode 73; The Rise of Leah and Episode 91; Jabba the Hut's Background Story anticipators.<br/><br/>Rather than respect these accomplished and proven great actors and the director for 5 decades of excellence and classic performances, they long for one of their B-list younger actors to have showed up and made an appearance. There is no respect for character or their elders. They would rather live in fantasy delusion of the Star Wars Empire and planets that don't exist, or live in a city like Gotham or Superman's city...again and again and again. They probably couldn't find Dayton Ohio or Philadelphia Pennsylvania on a map.<br/><br/>This movie isn't as fast paced for them as Fast and the Furious part 8 or the remake of Baby Driver. There's no zombies or dragons roaming around to cause them arousal. There's no Knight King and zombie death armies or villains wearing masks, costumes, or capes. So they can't get into it since their reality is too distorted. To compensate, they focus on attacking 3 of the ""proven"" greatest actors in the history of cinema for their superficial looks based on the CGI. They would rather have one of the young pretty boys who can't act but is a generic cardboard cutout who just came off of the casting couch play the younger roles. There's no respect for their elders, but only respect for The Emporer, Darth Vader, The Scarecrow, The Joker and whatever other 100th character remake they are looking forward to seeing.<br/><br/>Also, some of them don't even like Goodfellas that much, but they are citing it to gain some credibility to their review. They probably dozed off during Goodfellas at many of the quiet conversation parts and husband and wife scenes, but then they woke up for Pesci stabbing somebody and when they jumped the guy at the bar after insulting Pesci, and then they took a nap until the ending when Liotta talks to the camera. But that's it. They were never fans of these guys anyway, and just Goodfellas bandwagoners.<br/><br/>In summary, don't watch this if you can't appreciate a realistic, true story and great multi-award winning actors who are icons. This is for mature audiences only. It's a relatively mild-paced movie loaded with attention to detail, truly excellent acting performances, and it's based on a true story during the Kennedy and Nixon presidencies. If you are looking for Caped Crusaders, untalented young B-list actors who can't act, and some cliched horror movie, then you will surely be disappointed.<br/><br/>As for Scorcese movies, I will take this over the ridiculously overrated and overhyped ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (just an awfully overrated and almost a bad movie), ""Hugo"", ""Shutter Island"", and yes, even ""The Departed"", which is the best of the four mentioned. The Departed was very good, no doubt, but for me, this is just better than it."

"bengssimon","10","10","20","2 December 2019"," ""You don't know how good a friend you got.""
","Marty's back with a bang. A bang that hits the heart, hard. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino all bring the A game for this one, and it's glourious to see. The Irishman is another mob masterpiece from Scorsese, but the difference between The Irishman and Goodfellas (1990) & Casino (1995) is massive. While all three movies deal with the mafia, The Irishman is about so many other things, with the context of a ""gangster milieu"". This is a movie about loyalty, betrayal, friendship, family, existentialism, reflection and ultimately, life & death. It is the philosophical work of a genius.<br/><br/>Frank Sheeran is played with such empathy by Mr. De Niro and the character is washed over by such a wonderful sadness. Sheeran is a brilliant soldier, who follows orders, no matter what, and can at no point show any sign of weakness. Mr. Pesci as ""The quiet don"" Russell Bufalino is almost Don Corleone-esque and Mr. Pacino is brilliantly eccentric and funny as Hoffa. It's impossible to choose a stand-out performance here, this is the peak of acting talent. Justice would be if all three won awards. By the way, Anna Paquin's acting with the eyes is really quite extraordinary. And don't forget Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano and Jesse Plemmons who all shine in their respective parts.<br/><br/>What I didn't expect was the real humanity of the whole story. These guys were incredibly close but things go wrong and Frank struggles to keep everything in check. We actually really see a vulnerable human being behind the muscle. At stake here is pride & friendship and life & death. We see the guys grow old and for the absolutely heartbreaking finale Marty says: We're all going to die. Will we look back and ask ourselves: was it really worth it?<br/><br/>On a technical level, it's what we've come to expect from Thelma Schoonmaker. The editing is phenomenal. The de-aging CGI was described as ""experimental"", but it's not even noticeable and it certainly doesn't effect the greatness of this motion picture. For a 210 minute long film, it really does go by way too fast, so strap in.<br/><br/>As I see it, this is a perfect film. I really do think we've witnessed true greatness here. If this is the final De Niro-Scorsese production it would be a close to prophetic conclusion to a partnership that'll be remembered forever. We need to treasure this, because it is high art made by the world's greatest living filmmaker. It might be his masterpiece."

"ronakkotian","9","10","20","30 November 2019"," A dream come true!!!
","Scorsese has always been one of my favourite directors. His films are simply spectacular and I always look forward to what he brings next. When I heard that he was revisiting the mob and crime genre I was thrilled but when I heard that it starred De Niro, Pacino and Pesci my excitement went through the roof. Having seen it, I can confirm that this is one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>The Irishman follows the life of Frank Sheeran, a truck driver, who gets involved with the Bufalino crime family and Teamster Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>It felt so good seeing a Martin Scorsese film after a long time. Goodfellas is one of my favourite films of all time so to see another crime mob film with three legends in the lead roles was just a dream come true. However if you're expecting something like Goodfellas, you may be disappointed because The Irishman is very different compared to it. This movie takes its time. It takes its time by fleshing out the characters and creating the feeling of that time period. A lot of the film is dialogue heavy which, by no means, is a bad thing because writer Steven Zaillian brings this world and its characters to life through it.<br/><br/>The dialogue is constantly investing and does not get boring at any point. You are sold on the fact that these are real people and not actors portraying them which goes to show how strong everyone's performance is but it also shows the talent Zaillian and Scorsese possess as both are able to keep the story and its people interesting through the film's 3 hour 30 minute runtime. Scorsese's direction is mesmerizing. There is no particular style to it but then again it did not have to have one as the film itself is quite old fashioned. He once again proves to us why he's the best in the business.<br/><br/>The acting is outstanding. This is De Niro's best perfomance in a long time and the same goes for Pacino. It felt incredible to see Joe Pesci acting in a film after his retirement. All three had amazing chemistry with one another and it's sad to think that this may be the first and last time we ever see these three together in a Scorsese film. The supporting actors Ray Romano, Stephen Graham, Harvey Keitel and many more were also great in their roles. The CGI used on the actors may be distracting at first glance but as you learn more and more about the story and its characters, the CGI becomes seamless and less of a distraction.<br/><br/>The music used is also very appropriate for the time period the film is set in as it creates a wonderful atmosphere to the movie. As mentioned before, the film is shot beautifully but the final shot is one that is quite thought provoking. It really made me think a lot about the many themes the film presents itself with.<br/><br/>The only problem I had was to do with Anna Paquin's character. Her character plays a big part in De Niro's character arc but I felt it was not explored as deeply as I wanted it to be.<br/><br/>All in all, The Irishman is a fantastic film. Scorsese has given another film that will definitely win some Oscars next year. It felt really refreshing to see a mob film this well executed with three absolute legends acting alongside each other."

I liked how Robert's character developed, Joe Pesci was great too, and Al Pacino was a gem, was like quicksilver, from his introduction until the moment his character vanishes.

"Prismark10","8","10","20","29 November 2019"," The Irishman
","The Irishman is a companion piece to Martin Scorsese's other gangster films, Goodfellas and Casino.<br/><br/>It is also a teaming up of his old pals for one last ride. Robert De Niro has not appeared in a Scorsese film since Casino. Neither has Joe Pesci who basically retired from the movies in 1998. Harvey Keitel last worked with Scorsese in The Last Temptation of Christ. Al Pacino is the new boy, his first time working with Scorsese.<br/><br/>The Irishman is less violent than Goodfellas and Casino. It still packs a punch although Scorsese has been more careful not to make these gangsters look as glamorous as in his previous films.<br/><br/>Spanning 40 years, Frank Sheeran (De Niro) recalls his story. A World War 2 veteran who fought in Italy, a truck driver who delivered meat who went on to become a man who painted houses (a hitman.) Sheeran got involved with Russell Bufalino (Pesci) a Pennsylvania gangster who kept a low profile. It brings him into contact with Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) the leader of the powerful Teamster union who loaned money from its pension fund to organized crime. Sheeran went on to become close with Hoffa and a union organiser.<br/><br/>Scorsese has called The Irishman a chamber piece. It is mainly about its three main characters and only De Niro, Pesci and Pacino go through the digital de-aging process. They are made to look in their late 30s/40s for the early part of the film.<br/><br/>The film has the best cinema performances that De Niro and Pacino have given in years, mainly because the quality of some scripts they have been offered have been far from the best. Pacino plays Hoffa differently from Jack Nicholson in the movie Hoffa. Pacino's interpretation is of a man who likes ice cream sundaes, hates tardiness and unwilling to see reason because he thought the Teamsters owed him the leadership as a right. Pesci in contrast with his volatile Goodfellas character is a more thoughtful wiseguy here.<br/><br/>The film clocks in at three and half hours. It is too long and one hour could had easily been excised from it. The de-aging has been done sympathetically. It works mainly because we are never told how old they were when we see them at their younger age. However, you can make an actor in his 70s look thirty years younger, you cannot digitally make them move like younger men. You can spot De Niro gingerly climbing some rocks in one scene.<br/><br/>The treatment of females in this movie is superficial. Sheeran's and Bufalino's wives are just there to chain smoke. Only Sheeran's daughter Peggy shows unhappiness as to her father's chosen profession. Even then the old Peggy is wasted. At one point I did wonder why the film had a de-aged Holly Hunter playing Peggy. Only to realise she was played by Anna Paquin, who won an Oscar for playing Hunter's daughter in The Piano.<br/><br/>Despite the reservations, Scorsese has crafted a wonderful film, getting together the actors he relied on from his own early days as a director. There is an air of elegiac nostalgia to a style of cinema that might be passing away which Scorsese reflected on with his comments about Marvel superhero films. Ironic that The Irishman only got a limited cinema release as its main platform is Netflix."
"kyriakosz","3","10","20","28 November 2019"," Just another gangster movie
","This movie felt a lot like re-watching The Godfather, The Taxidriver, Goodfellas, Scarface, The Untouchables and any other popular Scorsese or Coppola gangster film. It is all in one and it is definetly something we have all watched before.<br/><br/>It is a good film but it lacks originality.<br/><br/>Scorsese is doing the exact same thing he accuses other directors of doing: He takes something successful and runs it again and again, without even trying to think of something new. This movie also isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being. It's just De Niro Narrating his, Pacino's and Pesci's whole career.<br/><br/>So, it is safe to conclude that ""The Irishman"" isn't cinema. I guess that's why it went up on Netflix so soon!"

","It plays for 209 minutes so yes, it could lose around thirty minutes or so towards the end when the pace noticeably slackens and that' it, really, my only criticism of Martin Scorsese's magnificent new movie ""The Irishman"", a valentine to De Niro and Pesci, Pacino and Keitel and a homage, not just to his own classic ""Goodfellas"" but also to The Godfather films and the television series ""The Sopranos"". In many ways it's like an anthology of gangster movies but not in the way you might expect. Yes, there are a lot of 'hits' on view, (Gangster Movies Greatest Hits?), as De Niro goes around despatching, with a few bullets to the head, not his enemies but those of his associates and employers. He is literally a gun for hire, even when the victim is someone he might really care for. In this respect the movie most closely resembles ""Goodfellas"" but what really makes this a great film rather than merely a very good one are the conversations. This is a movie full of really good talk delivered by some of the greatest actors alive today. There were times when I was wriggling in my seat out of the sheer pleasure of seeing De Niro sit down with the likes of Al Pacino and Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel and simply talk. Indeed, I could have been doing with more of Keitel whose part is really reduced to just one great scene, but what a scene it is.<br/><br/>Early reports of the film made much of a new digital process whereby the actors appear as their younger selves. To be honest, I found this hardly noticeable particularly where De Niro is concerned. Only Pesci came as something of a shock, (he looks like he's wearing a rubber mask in his early scenes), but then Joe has been absent from our screens for so long now it's difficult to know what exactly he does look like. To find fault with the process is really a minor quibble; it's just a joy to see this cast in the one movie.<br/><br/>De Niro himself is hardly ever off the screen and his performance is certainly one of his finest in a few decades, (I'd long give up hope of ever seeing him in a part this good again). We also owe Mr. Scorsese an unending debt of gratitude in coaxing Joe Pesci out of retirement. This isn't the Joe Pesci of old, the volatile little firecracker from ""Goodfellas"" but a measured old man who knows all he has to do is raise his little finger, not his voice, to get what he wants. His character here might be what Tommy DeVito would have become had he not been bumped off, resting on his laurels but a killer to the end. He should win the Oscar for this.<br/><br/>Of course, they and others in the cast, are Scorsese regulars. Pacino, on the other hand, is Coppolla's boy and is working with Marty for the first time and initially he seems out of place, like he's drifted in from another movie altogether and what we are getting here is 'Shouty Al', 'Roaring Al', Al at the top of his lungs and his performance is in marked contrast to the subdued work of De Niro, Pesci and Keitel. For a moment I thought he might unbalance the picture until I realised this is just what we needed. His Jimmy Hoffa is an adrenelin shot in the movie. Like his co-stars he is an actor relishing the best role he's had in years and like them he has his own great little moments, (dancing with Anna Paquin as De Niro's estranged daughter we could be watching an ageing Michael Corleone). Of course, even actors this could would be nothing without the benefit of Steven Zaillian's marvellous script or Scorsese's sublime direction. When the film was over I thought no, it's not one of Scorsese's masterpieces, it needs trimming, but twelve hours later I have revised my opinion; warts and all, this is as good as movies get."

","I don't understand some of these negative comments especially referring to the acting. It's some of the greatest actors of the last century together in one epic directed by one of the greatest directors of all time. Is it casino ? No is it good fellas? No. BUT is it an instant classic ? Damn straight.<br/><br/>This is the first time a gangster film really paced itself. No parts felt rushed. No parts felt drawn out and at 3+ hours that's a feat in itself. The acting, the de-aging and the story are spectacular as can be expected with the given context.<br/><br/>Pacino knocks it out. De Niro kills it and Pesci is a legend simple as that and we are reminded why every time he is on the screen.<br/><br/>So ignore the negatives sit back and enjoy what will likely be the last great gangster film for years and years to come.<br/><br/>Hats off boys."

"Ranitdas26","8","7","13","1 December 2019"," Scorsese's New Masterpiece
","I am just gonna say that Joe Pesci and Al Pacino killed their roles ! Pacino's role as Jimmy Hoffa , the Union President was so well portrayed by him ! Although in the book I heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt , Jimmy Hoffa just dissapeared , but Scorsese did good by changing the subject and made Frank do the killing by putting his life at stake !
Also Joe Pesci did incredibly good portraying the head of the organised crime family , Russell Buffalino . He and Jimmy both were father figures to Frank . They both had a major role in all the decisions Frank took in his life , for keeping his family safe or for any other reason. They both were also responsible to degrade Frank's life and made his life a tragedy . Beacuse of him his daughters are doesn't want to keep any relation with their dad as Frank is slowly waiting for his death.
In the beginning of the movie , its shown that Frank (who was a war Veteran at that time) made his foes dig their own grave and later killed then mercilessly ! He said , "" Its just crazy but I never understood that how they just keep digging their own graves"" which became an irony at the end of the movie where he is choosing his own grave .
At the end of the day The Irishman is Scorsese's another master work , although it has one or two flaws like that scene when De Niro was curb stomping that shopkeeper which was showing his inability due to his age , but these are just minute flaws which can be totally ignored .
Overall one of the best films of 2019 . I highly recommend it .
My rating for this movie 9/10"

"bankofmarquis","8","7","13","30 November 2019"," Delivers what was expected
","Like eating comfort food on a cold, wintery day, sitting down to catch the latest Scorsese/DeNiro mob movie filled me with a warmth that was satisfying for it's familiarity. It is a film landscape mined by professionals who know this genre of movie well.<br/><br/>There is a terrific film in this 3 1/2 hour epic - if only ""Marty"" would have trimmed the fat to find it.<br/><br/>Telling the real-life story (with some conjecture and fabrications), THE IRISHMAN tells the tale of...well...Irishman Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) a working stiff who rises in the ranks of mobster Russell Buffalino (Joe Pesci) to be one of his chief enforcers and the personal bodyguard to Jimmy Hoffa (Al Paciino).<br/><br/>In the lead, DeNiro commands the screen like the DeNiro of old. His Frank Sheeran is menacing, razor-focused on his objectives. You never question Frank's loyalties and his ability to keep silent. DeNiro shows this by be being silent for a good part of this film, even though he is on screen for most of it. He is a commanding force that requires that we pay attention to him.<br/><br/>It was good to see Pesci back onscreen as Russell Buffalino. His mob boss is pragmatic, making decisions sternly and expecting his people to follow them, no questions asked. His presence on the screen is almost as commanding as DeNiro's and I wouldn't be surprised to see DeNiro (Best Actor) and Pesci (Best Supporting Actor) be in the mix come Oscar time.<br/><br/>In lesser, (almost cameo), roles - but faring very well - is a ""who's who"" of character actors, Harvey Keitel (who I would have LOVED to have seen much, much more in this film), Ray Romano, Bobby Canavale, Jesse Pleimens and Anna Paquin, I'm sure all jumped at the chance to appear - however briefly - in a Scorsese mob epic.<br/><br/>Faring less well in this film is Al Pacio as Jimmy Hoffa. He is back to his ""yelling Al Pacino"" ways of films like SCENT OF A WOMAN. His Hoffa is pretty one note and, consequently, his scenes with DeNiro are ineffective mostly because Pacino is chewing up the scenery (and yelling) while DeNiro is sitting silent and staring and listening to Pacino. This was a major disappointment for me, but (fortunately), Hoffa is in only about 1/3 of this long film, so while it hampered my enjoyment of the film, it didn't ruin it.<br/><br/>Credit (and blame) for all of this goes to master Director Martin Scorsese who has mined these waters more successfully in CASINO, THE DEPARTED and GOODFELLAS (his best film, IMO). This film is a loving pastiche to these types of films and a bygone era - and he chose to make it for NETFLIX for he wanted to make a sprawling epic and take his time in telling the story he wanted to tell. This is evidenced in the 3 1/2 hour length of this film, which if filled with long tracking shots set to a backdrop of Italian crooners singing old standards. It's a throwback to a different time and place, one that these players know well.<br/><br/>Scorsese has stated the he only decided to make this film because the ""de-aging"" software the he used to make DeNiro and Pesci look 30 years younger was ""good enough"" to use. And I would agree with that statement. The de-aging of these 2 (and others) is ""good enough"", in some scenes I forgot I was watching a de-aged DeNiro and Pesci, while in some other scenes, I could spot the trick. Again, it was ""good enough"" and not distracting (unless you were looking to make it distracting, then you probably found what you were looking for).<br/><br/>But for me - a fan of these types of films, I was not disappointed. It was about what I expected it to be. If you were looking for something different and new, look elsewhere, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B+<br/><br/>8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"
"krmcnamara","10","7","13","30 November 2019"," Brilliant
","I went in ambivalent, having heard about the length and the de-ageing, but also knowing that I'd almost certainly never see this crew together again, and so I should see it on the big screen.<br/><br/>It never drags, the de-ageing did not distract me in the least, and the performances were wonderful, particularly DeNiro's and Pesci's understated work. Yes, it's autumnal, almost wintry, but that elevates it above Goodfellas, for all of that film's visual pleasures."

"tinjo23","9","18","42","13 November 2019"," Scorsese's most mature and tragic work in years. Stripping back the glamour and allure of the gangster lifestyle and focusing on themes far more personal and painful.
","The first half is Scorsese, the familiar. Gangsters roam around doing nefarious, no good. Tracking shots, wipe fast editing, grisly violence and your Dad's favourite 60's and 70's playlist are all present. Only, this time with an added touch; a slight remove and sprinkles of melancholy. An element which truly comes into play during the movie's second half, which is the director at his most subtle, most deconstructive and possibly, most painful. De Niro's Frank Sheeran is not a far removed character from any previous Scorsese anti-hero, but he is quite possibly his most tragic. A man entirely void of emotional understanding to the people closest to him, the times he lives in or the life he's created for himself.<br/><br/>At 3 and half hours it's a butt numbing experience and bloated around the middle, but breezier than you might expect and funnier. Furthermore, the cast is unbelievably packed and very few names are sidelined. Keitel, Paquin, Cannavale and Graham may appear than disappear at random intervals, but their presence (and relevance) remain forebodingly intact.
Higher up the ladder are of course Pacino and Pesci (the crowd favourites) and they are, who guessed it, incredible. With the exception of some hard to conceal stiff limbs Pacino is as energetic and electrifying as anything from his golden years. Pesci, almost the polar opposite of his previous Scorsese outings, opts for a calmer, far more controlled presence. Which frankly only makes the moments where his darker nature takes the wheel, all the more chilling.
But this is of course De Niro's show and he is the best he's been in a very long time. For Scorsese he opens up his every pore of talent and restrictively infuses the emotionally stunted Frank with pieces of humanity where ever possible.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, what sets this apart is Scorsese. If you're a fan, it's his most mature work in decades and possibly his most personal since 'Raging Bull'
And if you've never heard of him, I recommend watching first 'Means Streets' and/or 'Goodfellas' if you'd like a crash course in the rise and twilight of the man's relationship with gangster cinema. A sub genre he himself breathed new life into over 50 years ago, that's still being mimicked today (mostly to gratuitous effect though).
So it only seems fair he gets to be the one to strip it down, put it on a scale and have final analysis on what a life of crime and violence is worth, in the end."

"ckmccabe","10","9","18","2 December 2019"," One of Scorsese's bests, please ignore spamming by Marvel fanboys
","The Irishman is a prime example of real cinema. Fantastic characters, writing, cinematography and pacing. This movie will put you through the emotional wringer by the end. Each shot of the film is precise and picturesque, something Scorsese has better refined in his old age.<br/><br/>The movie is about the relationships we build in each other and the terror of getting old. This should resonate with anyone who isn't a teenager, it's the true singular vision of an older artist who deserves the creative control he is given.<br/><br/>Unfortunately people aren't used to films like this anymore. Audiences want movies which are created by a entertainment board of producers, with each scene crafted to appease as many people across all ages as possible. These movies are loaded with flashy but ridiculous action scenes and corny jokes, precisely plotted to intervene whenever someone's attention span begins to wonder.<br/><br/>If I did have to complain about The Irishman I would say digital de-aging still looks rough. Certain scenes make De Niro's face too smooth and it can be momentarily distracting. After the first 20 minutes you get used to this effect, and to me it's hard to fault the overall film due to this. This is a technique the industry as a whole hasn't been able to perfect, beyond the first couple minutes of the new Terminator.<br/><br/>The Irishman is an incredible film, I can't recommend it enough. One of the best of the year, along with Joker and Doctor Sleep. If you're a teenager or prefer the lab tested Hollywood flicks I'd stick with MCU or Fast and Furious. They come out with new movies every couple of months."
"aciessi","10","9","18","2 December 2019"," In the Still of the Night
","So, here we are. If you're reading this review, you've seen The Irishman. If you haven't seen it, you're not treating yourself to good cinema. 3 1/2 hours of it, and believe me, you'll be honored to have set aside that time to watch it all. Only one man in the history of the medium can make incredible films that last this long. The one and only. Marty. I love you. We all love you. You've had a hell of a run these past 50 years. It's not possible to have you around for another 50, but what more you can give to us in the years to come is enough.. and yet, The Irishman feels like your swan song. The end of lifetime of gangsters, guns, crime, incessant cursing and violence that splatters the silver screen ruby red with blood. There will never be another GoodFellas, period. It's an all-time masterpiece like few films ever made since. It's one of those rare perfect films. If you are expecting The Irishman to be as good as that, you're making a huge mistake going in. This is not that. Whereas GoodFellas is a flashy, frightening tale of the ugliest underbelly of the Italian mafia, The Irishman is a Greek tragedy of betrayal and regret. In other words, the antidote to all of that debauchery. A rational, thinking person's point of view as to what it means to be a criminal. Was it worth it? Can you be forgiven? Can you even live with yourself knowing you've spent your entire life as one? The Irishman, in no few words and no rushed time, tells you how hard it is to answer these questions.<br/><br/>This is the story of Frank Sheeran. A WWII veteran and meat packer who gets involved with organized crime right from the very start. He provides a Philadelphia, Mafia owned restaurant with fresh cow's meat. When he is accused by the restaurant of stealing the meat from the delivery trucks, he solicits a Teamster attorney, Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano), to take up his case. Bufalino gets Sheeran off scott free. Dealing with wise guys, he's lucky he didn't lose his head. As Sheeran celebrates at another Philly restaurant, Bill introduces him to Russel Bufalino (Joe Pesci), the Don of the Philadelphia Italian Mafia. Frank and Russell hit it off. Russel appoints Frank to be his hitman. As they say in secret, he ""Paints Houses"", and he's pretty good at it too. As a rising star in the Bufalino crime family, Russell eventually puts Frank in contact with a Bufalino associate and his personal friend. One Jimmy Hoffa, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Frank lands the biggest break he's ever gotten in his life. He's going to be Jimmy Hoffa's fixer and hitman. Well, he's sunk himself so low. There's nowhere else to go but up. Frank is in the big leagues, and that's just where his troubles begin.<br/><br/>As Frank sinks deeper into the bog of the corrupt, violent power racket between The Bufalino crime family and Jimmy Hoffa, he realizes that his dual loyalties set him right in the middle of a growing war between the two. Hoffa isn't cooperating nicely with the fellow Teamsters, and Russell grows increasingly upset. Eventually, it all comes to a breaking point. Russell wants Jimmy Hoffa whacked. Internally, this becomes Frank's greatest challenge to date. Who's hitman does he want to become? Who's bridge is about to be burned? Moreover, does it even matter, since he's essentially sold his soul to two devils?<br/><br/>Character is key here, and in terms of performances, this is the Three Amigos of the Mob Genre at their very best. De Niro is great as Frank Sheeran. Delivering his dialogue with a shaky stutter throughout. Uncharacteristic of the tough guys he's played in the past. Sheeran is almost a reluctant gangster. Pesci as Russell Bufalino is quiet and calculative. A striking departure from the volcanic hot heads Pesci is so famous for playing. He reaches Brando-esque heights, capturing intimidation through subtly. The star of the entire film, however, is Al Pacino. He's on fire as Jimmy Hoffa. As over-the-top and loud as Pacino gets, and yet, that works so well for the larger than life Hoffa. A legendary performance for a legendary man that, no disrespect, triumphs over Jack Nicholson's betrayal of him in Hoffa. Additionally, much has been made about Anna Paquin's portrayal of Frank's daughter. Specifically her lack of dialogue. That wasn't an afterthought, it was exactly the point. Frank's daughter's embarrassment and disgust at her father's actions is represented through silence. This is indicative of human nature. When someone you love disappoints you, you can't even bring yourself to look them in the eye, let alone say a word to them. Scorsese brilliantly understands that, and Paquin delivers her silent portrayal powerfully. She's an unsung hero of the entire film.<br/><br/>The Irishman is a book in three incredibly long chapters. That being: Power, Betrayal and Regret, in that order. In Power, we see Frank's rise to Wise Guy glory, from the streets of Philly to the trenches of Washington D.C. We see how deep the rot of corruption truly is through the eyes of Jimmy Hoffa. Using the Mafia at his beckon call to get rid of anyone who gets in his way. Even going so far as rigging the 1960 Presidential election in John F. Kennedy's favor... which in all honesty, eh, take that with a grain of salt. In Betrayal, we witness Frank's fall, in which he agrees to deliver the biggest/worst hit of his life. In Regret, we see Frank at rock bottom as he crawls on broken glass for his daughter's forgiveness. Scorsese gracefully weaves his behemoth of a story through these chapters. The runtime itself gives enough breathing room for us to digest every last action and breaths these characters take. Everything down to the last facial expression is crucial to what tells the story. It feels like it's in real time, but it's riveting all the while. In film history, this is truly unprecedented. We are getting greatness, and nothing less.<br/><br/>Two moments stand out in my mind that define how great of a film The Irishman is. One, is the half-hour that builds up to the assassination of Jimmy Hoffa by Frank Sheeran. The climax. Truthfully, It's one of the best pieces of filmmaking I've ever seen. Scorsese, amazingly, captures the most agonizing moment in Frank Sheeran's life in slow-motion. Or at least, that's how it felt. It's embarrassing, cringe-inducing and painful to watch. We feel virtually all of it. A slow dreadful death march, essentially. In other mob films, it feels like a sucker-punch to the teeth when someone gets whacked. Not here. This one in particular arrives as real as death itself. Slowly and inevitably. The other moment is the final scene. Frank spends this last chapter of his life seeking a sense of closure that he never gets. Everybody is gone. A priest absolves him of his sins, and leaves him to rest for the night. Frank tells the priest to leave the door cracked for him before he goes. There it is. The final shot. Frank, all alone, with nothing but a crack in the door to comfort him. Instantly iconic. In that tender moment, we realize that it's all too late for Frank. He's made his peace with God, but to what avail? He's hurt every person in his life. He's left to die, alone. A lifetime, wasted.<br/><br/>My only gripe with The Irishman is that it was released on Netflix. Now that's a waste. This film demands to be seen in a theater, on a large screen, with a crowd of adoring cinephiles to clamor out of the theatre to discuss this in length when the credits roll. It's the best film of 2019. As far as the de-aging technology is concerned, it looks good for how infantile technology is at this moment. I'd suggest you not be too hung up on it. It doesn't damper the experience, neither does it comprise the story."

But alas the film was let down by the Digital De-Aging Technology used to trick us into thinking the now 76-year old Robert De Niro was playing his character Frank Sheeran as a 20+ year old.
Even Will Gompertz described the now 79- year old Al Pacino - who plays Jimmy Hoffa - looking more like the camp British TV host Larry Grayson than a tough-as-teak union leader.
In Truth I feel that Younger Look- alike actors would have been better, because in on excerpt we see Frank Sheeran (De Niro) beating up a local Shopkeeper and whilst attempting to kick him is less than convincing as a young man with the obvious physical attributes of a septuagenarian.
However I loved the supporting role of Joe Pesci, who plays Don Russell Bufalino, Who's performance as the quietly-spoken, business-like confident Mafia boss is exceptional.
I still recomend you view the film, despite its epic three and a half hour duration and the distraction of the failed digital de- aging!"

I had a silly smile on my face all through the film as I watched the greats effortlessly talk to each other portraying dangerous (and larger than life) characters from a tumultuous part of American history, people who were sworn to their own personal causes, leading a power-driven life in a society undergoing massive changes.<br/><br/>History is present throughout the film, in news clippings, snapshots, snippets of television news and you hear about the Kennedys, Cuba, Las Vegas, but you realize that you are watching a secret history in the film itself - a undercurrent that was running parallel and controlled by shadowy ""kingmakers"" or ""king killers"" as they influenced society, the country, and by extension, the world.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that this is a layered chronological film that is disruptive, but also smooth as silk in Scorsese's hands.<br/><br/>It is a ""hidden"" film - on the one hand, you have the history that we have all read about, then you turn a dark corner with the mysterious assassinations of the Kennedys, and the mysterious disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa - and all of this happening while the USA was engaged in a disastrous war in Vietnam. Then, you see an old Frank Sheeran recollecting and narrating a secret history of what ""really"" happened, which is curiously interesting as well, because the listener is never shown - who is Frank talking to?<br/><br/>As the audience, we are also hidden, secret viewers to a secret history. And as we delve deeper, we go into the recesses of Frank's memory as he saw it and experienced it, and within it, we see and hear rumblings of a further past in Sheeran's life in the war, how he followed orders to ""hurry up"", how the Kennedy killing was a secret mob hit, leading us to Hoffa's death later in the film.<br/><br/>Finally, it is Scorsese himself, who remains hidden, behind the camera, directing the history from the viewpoint of a book (I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt), which in itself is a view of a writer. There are multiple other instances of ""secrets"" in this film - both literal and metaphorical that I am not including here, but in all honesty, this film is like a dark Matryoshka doll, ""a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma"", but essentially offering a possible key to some of the greatest mysteries and conspiracies in the world.<br/><br/>It is also interesting to see how Scorsese has mixed genres like a masterclass chef - The Irishman is a road movie, a mafia movie, a drama, an action film, a thriller, historical fiction, but most importantly, it is epic.<br/><br/>Finally, on the cast, no amount of praise will do justice to DeNiro, Pesci and Pacino. They are exemplars of the craft, living industry standards, and with Scorsese at the helm, this was a match made in heaven.<br/><br/>Thank you sirs for making this film."

","Oscars galore. Too long? Not long enough! I loved it!"
"davidmvining","10","9","18","30 November 2019"," A great epic from one of our great filmmakers
","The canvas is very large, but the story is actually quite small. It's about three men navigating the American culture of the 50s and 60s as they slowly fall onto opposites sides of an impossible divide. It's about a man who chose wrong and ends up alone. It's also expertly and energetically told by one of the great filmmakers using advanced tools as effectively as possible.<br/><br/>From the outset, it's clear that this story is filtered through one old man's memory. Frank Sheeran, in his 80s and living in a retirement community, speaks to us of his story that began in the 40s when he was a member of the Teamsters Union, driving a truck full of meat around Philadelphia. He figures out little ways to make those around him happy at the expense of those actually supplying the meat until he shows up at his destination with an empty truck. His loyalty to his friends catches the eye of Russell Buffalino, a mob boss who takes a shining to the Irishman, especially when he displays a propensity for the Italian language picked up while serving under General Patton. Through Russell, Frank meets Jimmy Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters Union. Younger than both, Frank looks at Russell and Jimmy as surrogate father figures who provide him with opportunities for advancement in life including the presidency of a local chapter of the Teamsters Union.<br/><br/>However, nothing can always been happy in this world, and Russell and Jimmy end up in opposition around the direction of the Union after Jimmy gets thrown into prison on fraud charges. When Jimmy gets out, he hates how his chosen successor has become a doormat to mob interests, using the pension fund as an source of interest free loans to mobsters across the country. Jimmy wants to return the Union to its more idealistic and legal roots, but Russell has been one of those who has received greatly from the new order. Jimmy threatens everything, and Russell can't tolerate that.<br/><br/>However, the great thing about this large section of the film (it's the middle two hours) is that the animosity that grows isn't explosive or angry, but quiet and almost sad. Russell likes Jimmy, and the idea that it falls on him to arrange and onto Frank to execute the assassination of Jimmy Hoffa brings him no joy. Frank becomes a tool, caught between his two mentors and unable to say no to either of them, so he follows through on Russell's orders, meets Jimmy in Detroit and shoots him in an empty house.<br/><br/>This two hour section almost feels like someone else's movie, like Frank is a side-character in the film named after him, but it's the final forty-five minutes that really drives home whose story this is. It is 100% Frank's.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Scorsese will introduce certain minor characters with a freeze frame and a quick bit of text that describes how they'll die horrifically several decades later (such as, ""Shot six times in the back of the head in his own kitchen""). This prevents the audience from staying purely in the moment portrayed, always reminding us of the inevitable and tragic end that's surely to come, and considering that it's all told from Frank's unreliable narrator of a character decades after the rest of the characters have died, it provides a certain melancholic air that never really leaves the film. That melancholy really extends from Frank's own sense of isolation, which we get in great detail at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Frank had four daughters, and the film has used one, Peggy, as a nearly silent observer of Frank's behavior. Peggy has relationships with both Russell and Jimmy as well. With Russell, she's cold and distant, only ever giving small one note responses to his efforts to win her affections. Jimmy, on the other hand, has a very easy rapport with her and buys her ice cream which she accepts gleefully. Peggy, much like Frank, is somehow caught between the two men, but she sees the two men far more clearly than Frank does. Peggy can sense the violence within Russell that Frank either can't see or excuses away, and she also sees Jimmy's innate goodness. Frank loves them both, but Peggy easily decides between them. She not only sees the difference in character between the two men, but Peggy also represents Frank's isolation from his own family. He doesn't take into account what his family would think when he chooses to follow Russell's order to kill Jimmy, and that act severs what little connection he had with his family up to that point.<br/><br/>A good bit has been made of the great final shot of the film showing Frank alone in his room at the retirement home, only those paid to see him as errant company, but there's another shot a bit earlier that I think encapsulates the finality of Frank's isolation even better. Nearly crippled, hobbled on a pair of canes, Frank goes to the bank where Peggy works as a teller and tries to force a conversation with her. We only see her very briefly in a panning shot after Frank gets to the front of the line and Peggy very quickly sets up a sign saying that her position is empty and she walks right out of frame. It's very quick, maybe half a second long, but the swiftness of Peggy's disappearance is what gives the moment its power. Not only does Frank barely get a look at her, but we can barely see her either.<br/><br/>The movie's huge and intimate all at once. The special effects to de-age our three main actors are largely very good. It leaves with such a complete sense of solemn loss and isolation that gets built up to exceedingly well over the course of its three and a half hours. I loved this film. It's not one of Scorsese's best, but with a filmography like his, it's hard to get into that very top tier reserved for The Last Temptation of Christ and Silence."
"gcarpiceci","7","9","18","27 November 2019"," Many ups but as many downs....
","Whoa...this was a looong ride! The Irishman is a mammoth movie trying to do many things, perhaps too many to succeed in all of them.
Let's start from the goodies: undoubtedly the movie is sustained by extraordinary acting performances, especially remarkable those by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. What De Niro (and CGI) does with his facial expressions all along the movie is just in itself worth the money of the ticket. On top of that, the dialogues are incredibly juicy and the movie overall is extremely well crafted.
On the less positive side, The Irishman struggles to keep the story focused, with some outstanding peaks and some moments of lull - understandably so given its length; I mean, even masterworks like the Odyssey and the Iliad (just slightly longer than The Irishman) have inevitably many highs and as many lows, so Scorsese's ambitious work does not escape this everlasting law. Moreover, he introduces so many characters that he makes it very difficult for the viewer to keep track of them and of their relationships.
All in all, I had very high expectations for this movie and they were not all kept."
"burmarose","10","9","18","18 November 2019"," A Masterpiece of cinema
","Having read the reviews I decided to see this at the cinema before it comes to Netflix. I am very glad I did. This is without doubt for me, Scorcese's finest work, a truly, epic masterpiece of cinema. As with all Scorcese's best work, it haunts you for days afterwards.
The three and a half hours does not seem excessive, I barely moved, neither did the rest of the cinema audience. This film did not drag or slowdown for me at any point. The de-ageing effects are only jarring at first sight but the eye adjusts, and it really helps the film's coherence to have the same actors playing the younger and older characters. As for the acting, well, De Niro is at his very best, particularly as the elderly Sheeran. Pacino plays Hoffa slightly over the top but then perhaps Hoffa was really like that. Joe Pesci is outstanding as Buffalino, quietly spoken for the most part, but with that underlying menace. And it's wonderful to see the excellent Stephen Graham (Provenzano) looking like he belongs with such a distinguished cast. His scenes with Pacino, in particular, are electric. There are some very amusing scenes, the lake house back and forth dialogue about lateness is hilarious in it's banality as is the car scene banter about the frozen ""fish"". The audience were laughing, but it seemed like nervous laughter. That underlying menace leaches out of the big screen.
Some have commented on the lack of dialogue for Anna Paquin (Peggy). That's is actually the point. It's what she doesn't say that it devastating. It is beautifully restrained and she holds the screen perfectly. Lucy Gallina (as a young Peggy) is also riveting, playful and affectionate towards Buffalino while accusing her father with just a look.
De Niro comes to into his own in the post-Hoffa part of the film. Again, there are some very funny moments to leaven the mood. The coffin purchase scene is as funny as it is tragic. The scene in the bank where a frail Sheeran goes to see Peggy could almost have descended almost into mawkishness under a different director and played by an ordinary actor, but De Niro pulls it out of the bag. You almost feel pity for Sheeran, but you just can't and neither should you.
As with all Scorcese's best, it pays to watch and listen carefully right until the last frame ( ref.Taxi Driver). The film's final line spoken by De Niro, is utterly chilling.
If you don't get to see this at the cinema, then watch it on the biggest TV screen you can find. Then watch it again."

He allows us to live their lives, to understand their characters, to feel their emotions and thoughts. This movie brings the 70's in the 20's and reminds us that ""they don't make the actors as they did then""

"imejaw","10","10","21","3 December 2019"," Too short! A masterpiece!
","Reading the negative reviews makes me sad and nervous for the future of film and art. All of the comments about it being boring and too long are absurd. This is acting at its finest with some of the greatest actors and one of the greatest directors in the history of film.<br/><br/>I watched it twice in two days. It really deserves a second viewing. There is a lot to take in on the first viewing. On my second viewing I really felt the performance by DeNiro. So much emotion in an amazingly powerful performance. Pacino gives the best performance of the year, and Pesci is subtly brilliant. I hope it sweeps the Academy Awards.<br/><br/>The de-aging worked for me. I got wrapped up in the story and it never distracted me at all. This is what people want to focus on? Most of the film they are playing somewhat close to their actually age. It's not like we are watching 3 hours of all of them trying to portray 30 year olds.<br/><br/>This is a late career masterpiece from Scorsese and I would say it's his best since Casino. If you like classic cinema and love these actors there is no way you will not appreciate and admire all the work they put into this fantastic movie!<br/><br/>I loved it and I am so glad it was made! Great job to everyone involved!"
"AudioFileZ","9","10","21","2 December 2019"," Show Some Respect...Just See It, You'll Be Glad You Did!
","This is a movie you should see. Martin Scorcese has taken a forgotten story and made it vital, even gripping. It is with some surprise that at this late date Scorcese knocks it out of the park with a three and a half hour old mob story. Oh yes he does. It is with no small reason due to the late period acting turns of all three principals: Di Niro, Pacino, and Pesci. Nothing these three have done in recent memory matches their best, but this may eclipse that. The three are perfect and obviously invested completely. Did the real characters play their roles so well?<br/><br/>Scorcese is a master. Like Welles and Hitchcock...but he's still with us and if this is any evidence he is at the top of his game. See it and try to deny this is almost certainly the Hoffa saga decoded."

"ferguson-6","9","10","21","1 December 2019"," a holiday gift for cinephiles
","Greetings again from the darkness. The Copacabana tracking shot in GOODFELLAS in etched not only in my brain, but in cinema lore. Filmmaker Martin Scorsese teases us with a similar shot as the opening sequence in his latest. The camera snakes through the dank halls and rooms of an assisted-living center before settling on the well-worn face of wheelchair-bound octogenarian Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro). Mr. Sheeran is the titular Irishman, and he narrates the story of his life, at least as he recalls it. His is a life story that connects the mob to history and politics in a no frills manner surely to provoke thought, skepticism, and a knot in the tummy.<br/><br/>Oscar winning writer Steve Zaillian (SCHINDLER'S LIST, also GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN) adapted Charles Brandt's book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" for the film. Mr. Brandt was Sheeran's attorney and worked with Sheeran on his memoir. The book title is highlighted by Scorsese at both the beginning and end of the film, as well as through a line of dialogue in the first phone conversation between Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Mr. Sheeran was a WWII veteran turned truck driver turned mob hit man (and good soldier). He tells his story with little fanfare and in a way that we understand no glamour is associated with this lifestyle.<br/><br/>For those looking for the next GOODFELLAS or CASINO, you'll likely be disappointed. This one is not as flashy or stylish as those two classics, and instead is a 3 and a half hour introspective look at the men who are efficiency experts in power. Violence is merely one of the tools in their box. The presentation is contemplative, not action-centric. The hits are abrupt and jerky and realistic, not the stylistic choreography of shootouts in films like JOHN WICK. There is a skewed theme of friendship and male bonding ... even mentorship. It's unlike what we've seen before from mob movies.<br/><br/>After a chance meeting over a timing belt on a delivery truck, Sheeran is taken under the wing of Philadelphia mob boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). This is Pesci's first onscreen appearance since 2010, and he is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of ""the quiet Don."" His performance is 180 degrees from his comedy in LETHAL WEAPON (2.3.4) or HOME ALONE, and 180 degrees the opposite direction from his roles in GOODFELLAS and CASINO, where he was a bombastic man (not a clown) on the edge of violence at all times. Mr. Pesci has spent the last decade playing jazz under the name Joe Doggs. It's such a joy to have him back on screen, especially as the father figure-friend-ruthless businessman. His Russell is always calm and calculating, whether plotting the next kill or putting up with his wife's frequent smoke breaks on a road trip.<br/><br/>It's Russell who directs Sheeran to connect with Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Pacino flashes his blustery best as Hoffa in a couple of scenes, but is also terrific while spewing one of his countless ""c***suckers"", or savoring one of his beloved ice cream sundaes - a simple pleasure in a complicated life. Sheeran and Hoffa develop an unusual friendship in their many years together, and Hoffa's real life unsolved disappearance in 1975 is the basis for Sheeran's recollections.<br/><br/>We learn that Sheeran's time in WWII taught him to kill ... there is a scene involving POW's digging their own grave while his rifle is pointed at them. In fact, most of the story is told in flashbacks that bounce between different eras. Scorsese, as has been reported ad nauseam, has utilized the de-aging process from Industrial Light & Magic to show DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino and others over the years. The effect is a bit distracting at first, but the story and these characters are so intriguing that we simply roll with after the initial jolt. It's also obvious how Scorsese worked to make DeNiro look like the hulking presence Sheeran was in real life (think Tom Cruise in the Jack Reacher movies). Camera angles, should pads, and shoe lifts are used to make us think DeNiro towers over the others the way Sheeran really did. DeNiro is excellent in portraying Sheeran as a good soldier, reserved in mannerisms - even flashing a slight stutter at times. He's a proud man who simply looks at the mob work as his job.<br/><br/>In addition to the three stars who each excel in their roles, Scorsese has assembled a huge and talented cast. Harvey Keitel is chilling in a couple of scenes as Angelo Bruno, Ray Romano plays mob lawyer Bill Bufalino, Bobby Cannavale is steak-loving Skinny Razor, Jesse Plemons is Hoffa's adopted son Chuckie O'Brien, Domenick Lombardozzi is Fat Tony Salerno, comedian Sebastian Maniscalco is ""Crazy Joe"" Gallo, Louis Cancelmi is bespectacled Sally Bugs, Jack Huston plays Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, and even Steven Van Zandt plays crooner Jerry Vale.<br/><br/>You are probably wondering, 'Where are the women?'. While there is no Lorraine Bracco (GOODFELLAS) or Sharon Stone (CASINO), Scorsese makes the point that with Sheeran, and these other mobsters, it's all business and real family relationships are non-existent. Stephanie Kurtzuba plays Irene Sheeran (Frank's second wife) and Katherine Narducci is Carrie Bufalino (Russell's cig-loving wife). They have some brief but entertaining moments on the road trip, and Marin Ireland has an effective scene late in the movie as Carrie, one of Frank's daughters, while Welker White plays Jo Hoffa. But it's Sheeran's daughter Peggy who is the quiet moral center of the story and his life. Played as a youngster by Lucy Gallina and later by Anna Paquin, Peggy is a mostly silent observer of her father, and whatever conscience he has, is impacted by her glances. Ms. Paquin is especially good with one question ... ""Why?""<br/><br/>Worthy of special mention is Stephen Graham who plays Anthony ""Tony Pro"" Provenzano, a friend-turned-rival of Hoffa. Graham and Pacino share two standout scenes - one in prison, while Hoffa scoops his sundae, and a later meeting where Hoffa takes offense to Tony Pro's late arrival and attire. Both scenes are remarkable in that there is underlying humor balancing the surface anger. In fact, the film is filled with memorable scenes. Hoffa's guidance on self-defense in guns vs. knives, and most every scene between DeNiro's Sheeran and Pesci's Russell. DeNiro and Pesci have a chemistry few actors share. It dates back to RAGING BULL (1980), and I believe this is their 7th film together.<br/><br/>The film reminds me of the 1970's movies that fueled my movie obsession: THE GODFATHER I and II, THE CONVERSATION, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, CHINATOWN, and even THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. Sheeran may or may not be a reliable narrator, but these are real people - even if we don't know the specifics on every hit. Captions are periodically included to inform of us how a particular mobster met his maker - again providing some dark humor. What is a bit surprising is the male bonding, even friendship, between guys in such a brutal profession. And watching how the story weaves in and out of history with the Bay of Pigs, Cuba casinos, and the Kennedy assassination -""If they can whack a President ..."" is a bit unsettling.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (SILENCE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN) is a good fit for Scorsese's vision, and you can catch the varying camera styles for each character - and don't miss the stunning shot of the illicit guns in the river. Composer Robbie Robertson (The Band) delivers Scorsese trademark musical riffs, and 3-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmacker is in peak form editing this epic. This is the 8th film collaboration for Scorsese and DeNiro, but the first in 25 years (CASINO).<br/><br/>I'm a little concerned. In fact, I'm a little more than concerned. This feels like the end of an era. It's not the end of Scorsese films, but it's the final chapter of his mob films. No other filmmaker comes close in this genre. With the bookends of Sheeran reminiscing in the assisted-living home, this is quite the holiday gift for cinephiles ... and a last one (providing Netflix survives)."

I was embarrassed for DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino, Keitel and even Ray Romano. It looked like black shoe polish in everyone's hair. Scorcese and the rest should be ashamed for trying to pass this ""parody"" off as a serious movie. They say athletes should know when to retire.

"andrewroy-04316","9","6","11","4 December 2019"," A gangster epic deserving of being an end to the great mob dramas and the twilight of Scorsese's career
","The Irishman (or should I call it I Heard You Paint Houses, as Scorsese intends) has all the wonderfully crafted mob interactions and great performances you expect, but could be considered a thematic foil to Goodfellas. While Goodfellas was a great mob movie showing the duality of crime in its glory but also its insidiousness, The Irishman is a more philosophical consideration of aging and the fickleness of the seemingly all-important world of crime. All three lead performances are excellent, and maybe I'm being drawn in by the fact that it's the most showy performance, but I thought Pacino in particular was wonderful. De Niro is undeniably great and I wouldn't be too upset if he won best actor, and Pesci plays a great quiet power role, but Pacino's layering of doubt and uncertainty beneath his brashness stood out to me. While the first two acts set up the characters well and show great writing, it's the final act that ties the movie together and makes its thematic points. Its climactic scene and the way it happens quickly, just like the other house paintings in the movie, was very well done but absolutely devastating. Watching Frank age and watch everyone around him die or go to jail with him, we see how everything that was so important his whole life, all he did, is irrelevant in the modern world. Nobody knows who Jimmy Hoffa is anymore, and none of his friends are still around, and he's left contemplating what his life of crime really meant. The actions he took to be strong and keep his family safe only alienated him from them, and really cut him off from everyone outside the crime world. Was taking the climactic action really worth it when you see how it affects everyone, and when he was never truly fulfilled by the life he led? Seeing these struggles as he ages brought the biopic-style mob movie full circle, as we truly understand his entire life of crime and where it left him.<br/><br/>There are plenty of smaller elements that will definitely be sticking in my mind for weeks. The contrast between Russell and Jimmy was a really interesting one, and was a clear contrast in how random mob guys and Peggy reacted to them. Russell was always cold and reserved but universally respected, but never had emotional connections, exemplified as he tries to reach out to Peggy as a child many times and she never engages. Seeing him dying in jail was so affecting because we saw how his respect and importance didn't provide him anything in the end. Jimmy's story was still tragic but in an opposite way: he was the antithesis of Russ, brash and aggressive but also charismatic and loving. Peggy always cared for him, and he was the only person who seemed to love Frank. His downfall came from his unwillingness to play the political game everyone else accepted, and from assuming his friends would keep him safe over playing the game. All three men's stories end in tragedy, but each in a different way. The violence and crime dynamics are great and well represented, but it's the contemplative tone that keeps me thinking about the film. The de-aging technology was completely satisfying for me, even if their movements were a bit stiff, and the direction and cinematography are top notch of course. It's a long movie, but it's a worthwhile epic, and probably is the end of an era for great mob crime movies and the four men at the heart of the film."

","Martin Scorsese had made most of my favorite films in this genre. However, this isn't one. Not even close. I watched it at the cinema and felt it probably could have been done in half the time. There's a lot of unnecessary plot elements. They focus too much on secondary characters so we can empathize with them, without much success. The family relationship had a lot of potential as there's clearly an interest in exploring the father-daughter approach but it barely scratches the surface. De Niro's character is dull and senseless, feels the same way throughout the story. He doesn't show the complexity of someone struggling between being a family man, a close friend and some mob big shot. It's a character that simply knows how to follow orders and never experience any moment of self reflection and change; he lacks ambition and desires. A man that by sheer luck starts working with the mafia and becomes a union leader because he seems bored enough and needs a little bit of enjoyment in his life. That's the only argument that drives his action. The more personal interactions are set aside. His daughter notices from an early age his activities, though we never see a confrontation. The relationship he develops with Al Pacino's character is suppose to grow a lot closer, he is the stepfather of his daughter, but their interaction on screen is all the opposite, very rigid and more like that of subordination. De Niro's character ""tries"" with very doubtful conviction to persuade Al Pacino's into retiring or else... Always afraid to speak up and say the things straight forward. Not truly the reaction one would take when your best friend's life is on the line. By the end of the film, De Niro's apparently thinks about his past actions, kind of nostalgic,but not with the slightest regret for all his mistakes or wrongdoings. Someone who misses more being a lackey than the deep connections he had."

The lead actors are all Oscar worthy, from Pacinos shouty yet stubborn Hoffa to Pesci's calmness (even through he's just about the most respected and feared character in the film) And then there's De Niro' Frank, a quiet, keep your head down and you'll go far Character who you just can't take your eyes off of.

","Given all the great reviews of this movie by the professional critics, some of my friends, and many of the User Critics, I guess I'm going to be a contrarian.<br/><br/>I did see The Irishman on Netflix last night but I was kind of disappointed after hearing all the high praise. The movie really needed some good editing as there were lots of unnecessary scenes and the film lacked a certain ""tightness"". Also, I know many people didn't mind it, but the ""de-aging"" of the actors didn't seem to work very well. We know what the actors actually looked like at the ages depicted in the movie and their ""de-aged"" personas didn't look close to reality. Plus, they walked around like old men. Instead of 'getting the band back together', so to speak, I think Scorsese would have been better off having a group of younger actors play the parts and then computer aging them. That seems to work better.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say it was ""OK"" but far from being one of Scorsese's best. Besides, if I'm going to spend 3 ½ hours watching a movie it better at least be the quality of Showgirls.<br/><br/>I'm not an experienced reviewer so I'd direct you to the review on this site, done by CarsonTrent, who was much more professional in his writing and whose thoughts I agree with totally."
"PotassiumMan","7","11","24","17 November 2019"," Scorsese epic on Hoffa is well-crafted but very, very long, likely praised out of sentimentality
","The long-awaited Scorsese film on Frank Sheeran, the man closest to Jimmy Hoffa, is brilliantly acted by De Niro, Pacino, Pesci and an exemplary supporting lineup that includes Keitel, Romano, Cannavale and Anna Paquin, whom I haven't seen in a movie in nearly two decades. It also boasts extraordinary period detail, masterfully recreating an America that spans the 1950s to the mid-1970s. And the final chapter of the film is quietly menacing. The total absence of a soundtrack in this part of the film makes for an almost unbearable sense of dread.<br/><br/>What prevents this film from reaching greatness? In short, the film's vast, interminable running time. Some supporting characters seemingly disappear for an eternity in this film as their presence is dwarfed and sometimes completely forgotten on account of the film's never-ending trudge to its haunting conclusion. The film has a ghost-of-glories-past feel to it, with Scorsese's heaviest hitters all teaming up to make one last big mark. That might be the main reason it has been so overwhelmingly acclaimed.<br/><br/>There's no denying the craft at work here. Unfortunately, Scorsese's long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker did not cut nearly enough to render the tightest film possible and instead the final product is a lumbering behemoth of a film that, although very good, more than likely could have been even better. Recommended to viewers with enough stamina."

The de-aging is distracting. Some De Niro scenes works really well, but for the most part it's just too noticeable. Plus, the younger faces didn't match the tone and energy of their voices and bodies.
So, with that in mind, the performances are ruined with their ""younger versions"". It's a lie. De Niro and Pesci can't act like 20+ years younger.
But. Al Pacino to the rescue! He shines as the only one still capable of talking fast and/or yelling! I'm not saying he created an accurate portrayal of Hoffa. But his energy saved the movie for me and the hour and a half focused on him was the stellar one.<br/><br/>The story, another gangster movie, is more ""intimate"" or ""sentimental"" than the older ones, and it gets more interesting than Casino and Godfellas (bigger political implications, relatively explored in the movie).
In the last 40 minutes Scorsese tries to be Charlie Kaufman (Synecdoche, Adapation) or something. It goes really bad.
With younger people playing the younger versions of the characters? Maybe I can forgive the fact that is too long with better energy from younger actors. With a shorter cut? Maybe I could forget about these old actors failling to act 35+ years younger with the distracting CGI.

It certainly helps to have an understanding of the story of Sheeran/Hoffa before seeing this film. Although it is a long watch, at times the story feels dragged out and at others it goes by very quickly and you are left trying to work out what is happening, especially early on. Not a major hitch, but having an understanding of the story certainly helps and my understanding was definitely emphasised by reading into the story in excitement before watching it.<br/><br/>However, seeing De Niro absorb the main role with such dedication and an excellent piece of memorable acting does leave the audience with a turbulent mindset of feeling both sympathy and sadness.<br/><br/>Wonderful piece of art, and I truly enjoyed it."

"Ziglet_mir","3","10","22","30 November 2019"," Scorsese Recyclable
","I wouldn't call the gangster/mob genre one of my favorites. The genre certainly is one of the most respected and has a place in film history, thanks in particular to the three leads here and Scorsese, but was there really a need for this?<br/><br/>I've always respected Scorsese's work even if he isn't one of my favorites. His films have hit the whole spectrum for me from 2/3's all the way to a 9 (no perfect scores IMO), but for the most part has made his fascination with gangster films clear. With ""The Irishman"" we can tell how much Scorsese loves the mob genre and this film is like an ode, and a slow-ugly reflection of this director's past and views on violence and the vast array of characters he has brought to the screen. Has old age changed Scorsese? It seems like many of their craft, he has gained wisdom and particular nuance to what we have seen time and time again on the big screen. We've seen the quiet but dutiful hitman take out person after person with no remorse (although in this there is something even more cold about it), and we've seen biopics that show the smorgasbord of events that changed history forever. Here we see examples of both-nothing to write home about, but they are here. Particularly the former, when we get some sort of payoff toward the final act, and see the main character reach for forgiveness in what he's done (another Scorsese trademark).<br/><br/>Potentially the best part of any of his films is his fascination with forgiveness, redemption, salvation and religious purpose with his main characters and it is probably the only highlight in ""The Irishman"". At what cost did Sheehan's actions pay off? What did his daughters think? Where did he and his friends end up? What was he made to do against his own personal desires? But then, there isn't enough focused on this part. If Scorsese had stuck this part of the character arc out, the film would have been much better off.<br/><br/>Now the acting. There is the trifecta here everyone is talking about. The three old men turn in ok performances, in particular Joe Pesci who has a subtle sophistication and menace to his character that harkens back to his roles in ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". Al Pacino is manic, flawed and energetic as Hoffa, while DeNiro is honestly the weak link as the lead role the title of the film suggests. Overall nothing new, and nothing great.<br/><br/>Downsides of this film would be the 3.5 hour runtime (although length didn't actually bother me). I would imagine that it turns most people off to invest that much time, but they most likely will with the names attached to this production. My other critique would be the pacing of the final act as I felt it was rushed (believe it or not). I wanted to see more of Frank's struggle with redemption as that became the most powerful part of the film (Catholic guilt and forgiveness, etc.). The acting is meh, and there isn't much behind the direction except for the competency of making a movie. Once again (my unpopular opinion) that Scorsese doesn't offer much and that his past success makes him an overrated household name. Oh, and that CGI on Bobby D? Pretty bad. No way he can sell the physicality of a spry 30-something even with the attempt of changing how his face looks."

"meathookcinema","9","10","22","10 November 2019"," Stunning Movie By A Master
","'I heard you paint houses'<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's latest film centres around Frank Sheeran who we first see in a care home for the elderly reminiscing about his life. He recalls his time in World War 2 and then after this lovingly remembers the scam he had when he is working as a meat truck delivery worker (he regularly siphons off some of the contents and sells it to local mafiosi) when he crosses paths with mobster Russell Bufalino who he is then reintroduced to some time later. This proves to be a turning point for his life. It's through Bufalino that he is introduced to Jimmy Hoffa, teamster and celebrity. This marks another turning point for his life and the film's narrative.<br/><br/>I had to smile when I saw some of the major players from Scorsese's canon of masterpieces reunited in this film. It was more than awesome to see De Niro with Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel again.<br/><br/>But there are also new actors who more than hold their own. Al Pacino is predictably brilliant and it's great to see such a legendary actor under the direction of such a masterful director. Stephen Graham shows that he's just as brilliant in a Hollywood film as he is within the quality TV productions that he's starred in here in the UK.<br/><br/>There has been much made of Anna Paquin only speaking six words in a three and a half hour film. When you see the film you'll see why. Her looks and mannerisms throughout the film convey much more than lines and lines of dialogue as her role is akin to some kind of silent but all seeing sense of conscience or moral judge regarding her father's dastardly deeds that she knows are happening even if he tries to disguise them to convey himself as a honest working man. Instead of basking in fake outrage (are we really getting to a point where numbers of words uttered by male and female characters will be tallied up and compared when it comes to movies?! Are we really getting that ridiculous?) how about thinking what an amazing actress she is that she can turn in such a genuinely awe-inspiring performance by just using her facial expressions alone and what is implied rather than said out loud. Y'know, by using her acting skills and stuff! There should be a mention here regarding how brilliant Lucy Gallina is as Peggy between the ages of 7 and 11.<br/><br/>This movie is a sprawling epic that spans 1945 to 1990. The narrative shoots forward and backwards through time so effortlessly and effectively that it reminded me of Once Upon A Time In America (thankfully theres no panpipe music in this movie though). With this kind of timeframe being used it's been widely reported that Scorsese used CGI to make the leading characters look younger in some scenes. Whilst this can be noticed in the first couple of scenes in which this device is used, it blends into the movie as a whole and is quickly forgotten about as the viewer gets used to it. It also becomes unnoticeable because the film is so captivating for the viewer.<br/><br/>There was a point early on in this film that felt very familiar. There is a bar setting with an old 60's hit playing over the soundtrack whilst a plethora of mobster types are doing their thing. I thought to myself 'Oh God, I hope this doesn't turn into a GoodFellas clone.' I remembered the good but not great Casino feeling like 'GoodFellas Go To Vegas'. But The Irishman doesn't play out like this. It's a film that quickly veers into new territory plot wise whilst exploring themes such as age, reflection, mortality (on many levels) and how choosing to live such a thoroughly deplorable life whilst hiding under a veneer of respectability can impact the loved ones of the people who have chosen to take the dark path.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen yet it was a very uncomfortable experience. The movie is 3 and a half hours long and whilst it's an amazing ride it's a painful experience in a cinema seat. My aching posterior was so bad through the second half of the running time that I felt that I was wriggling around more than an eel. But the length of the film was probably intentional for Scorsese as this was made for Netflix- home of the 'binge watch' to be watched in the comfort of your home on the comfort of your sofa.<br/><br/>One more touch that I loved about the movie were the captions that accompanied each new secondary character as it stated his name and how/when he died.<br/><br/>This movie might end up in the Guinness Book of Records also as I don't think I've heard the word 'c*ocksucker' used so much in one movie before. This is a great accolade in my book.<br/><br/>The Irishman is a cracking movie. Fans of Scorsese will love this, as will fans of intelligent and innovative filmmaking. There will be several raised eyebrows as to the level of poignancy that the film holds. Which again makes me think of Once Upon A Time In America in that the audience is made to feel sympathy towards a character who the film has shown to have committed some heinous acts."

","""You people"" is a memorable line in ""The Irishman""--slur against Italians. However, the term could also refer to anyone too easily duped into thinking that having big-name actors and a celebrated director necessarily combine to make an excellent film. You people, are you willing to spend almost 3 1/2 hours of your life that you will never get back watching a film that doesn't really cut it? OK, OK. watching DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci in anything is a big pull, I admit. But sitting through this particular film experience is like getting excited about watching three world-class swimmers get into a pool for a lap together, and seeing the pool turn into a half-mile river of sludge with no finish line that you can see, seemingly going nowhere. The movie is too long, too unfocused, too aimless, and, all too often, a waste of talent.<br/><br/>And yet--the failure of ""The Irishman"" is not for lack of background material. The source text, I Heard You Paint Houses, by Charles Brandt, details how Frank Sheeran, an associate of Philly mob boss Russ Bufalino, came to turn on close ally Jimmy Hoffa. And in a telling 2015 interview on Click On Detroit (amp-clickondetroit-com) Brandt builds a solid case for his story built on five years worth of extensive talks with Sheeran and coordination with the FBI. Why would Sheeran talk to a former prosecutor and professional interrogator, as Brandt likes to call himself? It makes sense: Brandt worked behind the scenes to get the former boss' prison sentence for labor racketeering reduced from 32 years to 9 on medical grounds and built a relationship from there. In addition to taking Sheeran's word for events, Brandt has well documented reasons to prove that Sheeran killed ""Crazy Joe Gallo"" in a public clam house (a witness later verified the killer), the Sheeran delivered a truckload of arms to Dallas just before the Kennedy assassination on behalf of the Mob, and that Hoffa was lured into a private home in Detroit where he was shot at close range by Sheeran, with the body later cremated by Mafia soldiers The FBI subpoenaed Brandt's interview tapes and had access to the same information about Hoffa's disappearance. In fact, according to Brandt, the ""whodunnit"" part of the missing person's case was solved early on, but with a missing body and uncooperative witnesses, prosecution was impossible. As of 2015, the investigation was still officially ongoing.<br/><br/>So, yes, this and more are all spelled out in the film. But dramatically, viewers want to see the central conflict set up in the first twenty minutes of the film, and we're left hanging. Early on we get that Sheeran (DeNiro) is an ordinary truck driver and death-hardened former combat vet pulled into organized crime via the Teamster's Union. Along the way we see him as 40 - no, 30, no --at one point called a ""kid"" despite clearly being middle-aged (CGI just can't turn back the clock for men in their 70's: the poor aging effect makes for a confusing timeline). He enters the film married, meets a waitress who smiles at him, and apparently 20 seconds later is divorced leading a new life (women in this film are decorations, child producers and occasionally the ones who cry over crime victims.). He bonds with a quietly powerful Cosa Nostra head Russ Bufalino (Joe Pesci), who introduces him to Hoffa (Al Pacino, chronically in a bad mood, except around Sheeran's children). Hoffa is portrayed as charismatic, but a hothead. His loose lips about how Teamster funds are being used and abused ignite flaring tempers during his campaign to regain the union presidency, temporarily lost during a 5-year prison term. Bufalino is alarmed, and so are other Mafiosi. But despite warnings, Hoffa refuses to put a lid on it.<br/><br/>At last--about two hours in, the conflict comes more clearly into play. DeNiro's chronically deep frown are what the film uses to suggest inner turmoil. A few mumbled words at an awards dinner that our hero perhaps appreciates Hoffa's support and patronage. But then again, maybe not, because he agrees to do ""what has to be done"" without resistence when pressed by Bufalino. So, the story arc is more like a slight hill. A car ride to a wedding with the wives, whose main contribution to the story is to smoke while waiting for their spouses to finish criminal conversations, turns into an overnight at a hotel followed by a plane ride, a car ride, and a visit to a house by Hoffa and Sheeran, with only one emerging.<br/><br/>Throughout the film I looked for any evidence that Sheeran regretted his crimes. He seems to shrug them off, even in last-chance conversations with a priest during his final days in a nursing home. The truth was something quite different: he deeply regretted his crimes, confessed them to a priest, and afterwards stopped eating. effectively ending his own life about 5 weeks later.<br/><br/>Immediately after I watched The Irishman, I happened to find Godfather 2 on TV. There was no comparison. The actors aren't to be blamed for what age does to us: DeNiro and Pacino were hot in 1974, and they are now grandfathers. But the earlier film quickly and deftly laid out moral dilemmas and explained people's motives in resolving them. We were on board, ultimately, with all affairs Corleone, even when what they did involved breaking a law and taking lives. They were fully fleshed characters, sympathetic and believable. They became all of these things in two tightly woven, interconnected plots saturated in local culture and first-class storytelling.<br/><br/>Maybe it's impossible to remake any film in the shadow of The Godfather trilogy and expect it to compare. And maybe Netflix and Director Scorcese, should be commended for trying. But I found the effort a disappointment. And I was one of ""those people"" who had high hopes.<br/><br/>12-3-19"

However, although the performances are solid, the all-too-familiar acting styles of De Niro and Al Pacino heavily reduce the movie's original feel.<br/><br/>What impresses me the most (and differ The Irishman from others) is the message of the movie. It does not glorify the Mafia way of life, nor does it show the glamorous path from peasant to boss. The movie, instead, aims to stress on the consequences and trade-offs of such a lifestyle. Family breakups and lengthy jail time all comes at the mobster, one way or another. And or course, tragic death too.
No luxury was shown, no power over citizen was shown. For these low-level gangster, life was just an unavoidable downfall with no real satisfaction and internal peace.<br/><br/>The Irishman covers the same old ground, but delivers a much different message than other Mafia movies, in a satisfactory style."

He reminded me of my dentist. Also, I found the CGI of deniro's face really distracting. It didn't match his body. Either they should have made his body young as well or better yet, introduced a younger actor to play his younger self. I kept waiting for the film to get better, but it didn't.

","A new addition to the new retirement-age mob film genre - a niche to be sure. While the film is often hard to take seriously we are lucky that it doesn't try to be taken as such. It takes every opportunity to lighten its source material with subtle but gripping comedy. The rotating door of italian mob-men and their continious conniving plots were often lost on me - strange that a hulking 3 and a half hour film can still seem to rush so many elements and yet seem to drag on for others.<br/><br/>A very large feat of visual magic was taken on in order to tell the story of younger Sheehan and Bufalino - a feat that in my (WOAH those are startlingly blue) eyes went largely KAPOOT. I couldn't tell how old they were supposed to be because De Niro didn't act the age and it looked like the effects just painted over all their facial wrinkles to leave a weirdly simulated ""young face"". I can recall a scene where De Niro was beating a grocer and it was probably the gentlest, feeblest beating I've seen depicted. The film picks up at the entrance of Hoffa (Pacino), who brings a lightness but also a weight to the film that it lacks in its earlier half. The friendship between Hoffa and Sheeran feel at the films core - which makes the ending that much more devastating. The audience will be left both betrayed and shocked - especially since the film lacks any deep emotional gravity preceding its conclusion. The most original and funny mafia movie to grace the screen - even if it is your laptop screen at 1 am. 7.8/10"
"DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine","6","5","9","2 December 2019"," What a disappointment...
","When is saw that Martin Scorcese is directing a gangster film based on the novel by Charles Brandt, titled ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" a true-life account of Frank -""The Irisman""Sheenan, a mafia hitman who according to the interviews he gave to Brandt claimed that he is responsible for -more or less- twenty-five murders, including that of Jimmy Hoffa. For those unfamiliar with James Riddle Hoffa's story, it should be mentioned that he was the leader of one of America's biggest labor Unions, ""The International Brotherhood of Teamsters"", one of the most powerful and influential in the country. Hoffa was the President of the Teamsters from 1957 till 1971. Hoffa was a highly controversial figure who dared to oppose some of the most prominent figures in the American political life of 60s and 70s and one of them was Robert -Bobby- Kennedy, the bother of the legendary John Fitzgerald Kennedy who was murdered in Dallas in November 1963. Robert was also assassinated in June 1968 and while being the chief counsel of the Senate Labor Racket Committee he blamed Hoffa openly for corruption. Hoffa was known to have connections to organized crime and it was rumored that he was a personal friend of some of the most notorious gangsters in the country at the time. He was imprisoned in 1967 and sentenced to 13 years for attempted bribery, jury tampering, and fraud. Finally, he was pardoned by the Nixon Administration on the supposition that he resigned from the union's Presidency. Nevertheless, the main reason that the name of Jimmy Hoffa is familiar to all Americans is his mysterious disappearance in 1975 which remains unexplained till today.<br/><br/>As can anyone imagine any book or movie regarding Hoffa is of special interest, especially if one of them claims to know the truth of what finally happened to him. Furthermore when the cast is announced and you learn that one of the most important thespians of his generation, Al Pacino, will portray the erratic and impulsive Teamsters leader the excitement is doubled. The icing of the cake was that Robert De Niro, an actor whose collaboration with Scorcese in the past delivered some of the most iconic films such as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Mean Streets"", would play Sheenan.<br/><br/>
The result of the above was that my expectations of ""The Irishman"" were perhaps a bit too high so one can claim that I was doomed to feel unsatisfied or disappointed with this film. I was eager to watch it so I devoted some of the most productive hours of a day in order to absorb every single aspect of the movie. Unfortunately what I comprehended was that it is best for some great actors to retire before their age becomes a burden, tainting their reputation and directly influencing, in a negative way, their performances. The sight of De Niro playing Sheeran in his fourties was hard-to-watch as his body movements were that of an old man struggling to imitate those of a person half his age. Apart from that, there is no brightness in his performance, nothing reminiscent of De Niro's brilliance that the audiences loved in the previous decades. Al Pacino plays more himself than Jimmy Hoffa and his overall performance is significantly worse than the one by Jack Nicholson in Danny De Vito's, ""Hoffa"" (1992). The only member of the cast that does a truly good job and doesn't seem out of place is Joe Pesci who portrays and elderly gangster who initiates Sheenan in the criminal underworld and lifestyle.<br/><br/>
The narration of the story in the first hour of ""The Irishman"" brings to mind Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" with short segments of dialogue and action, montaged in a really fast tempo and lacking a clear central storyline. The plot thickens only then Hoffa is introduced in the film and Sheenan becomes his right-hand man. We watch as Hoffa's life gradually crumble and his friends decide that they finally have no need for him or his services and decide to kill him. Sheenan claims that he was the man that actually pulled the trigger and the movie stays loyal to the book, not altering any major plotlines. If you haven't read Brandt's book or if you are unfamiliar with the whole Hoffa case, then watching ""The Irishman"" may prove an instructive as well as entertaining experience. On the other hand, all those who hope that this gathering of stars in this production will produce an unforgettable result, equal to their mythical status in the world of contemporary American cinema will feel betrayed in the end."

The actors are very good, especially Joe Pesci. So good to see him come out of retirement for this. Pacino is fun to watch as usual. I wasn't bothered by the de-aging. I thought it was quite good in fact. It is slower paced than a Goodfella's or Casino, but don't let that turn you off. I'm seeing a lot of ageist reviews on here complaining about the actors being too old and past their prime. That's hogwash and disrespectful. Younger generations need to get their heads out of their behinds when it comes to aging. We'll all be there someday and It makes no one less valuable. This may not be Scorsese's crowning achievement (I think he did that with Goodfella's) but it's definitely worth watching. Sure it's long by today's standards, but that just gives us more to savor.

","First of all, I want to make clear that I am reviewing the film itself, and not praising the actors or the director only because of their names. (don't hate me, I like 'em)<br/><br/>First, this film is way too long for what it tells. I saw it at the cinema (because I don't subscribe to Netflix) but I think that it's not the right place to watch this film. It was definitely meant to be seen at home on Netflix. I would advice to consider this 3 hours and a half long film as two 1 hour and 45 minutes long films.<br/><br/>The director, Martin Scorsese, obviously made the choice to not edit his film to a standard 2 hours duration, like directors are usually forced to do to fit the cinema format. But the liberty about the film duration that Netflix gave to Scorsese doesn't play in his favor. It leaves a lot of uninteresting scenes that slow down the film way too much. I usually don't mind watching slow paced films, but I felt bored multiple times watching ""The Irishman"". It doesn't tell enough. The dialogues are streched too hard, and you immediatly forget some scenes and characters because they are not relevant to the story. Altough it may seem paradoxal, I thought that the film lacked pauses, like wide shots with a music or something, just to let the viewers a moment of reflexion about the state of the story. But in place you only get dialogues over dialogues...<br/><br/>Though I must say that the last hour is really good. You finally see where the film is going, you finally care about the characters' decisions and you want to know how it ends. But you first have to go through two very long hours of boredom.<br/><br/>About the esthetic of the film, I really liked the recreated look of the 60's and 70's, but not the look of the characters themself, especially Al Pacino. Why so much makeup ? It gives Pacino a quiet weird face. De Niro's rejuvenation and aging don't work that well. It's overdone thus unnatural.<br/><br/>It's a good film, yes, if you shorten i to two hours, but definitely not a ""10/10 masterpiece""."

","The movie The Irishman is directed by Martin Scorsese ( whose movies include The Wolf of wall Street, Shutter island, The Departed.....). The movie is 3hrs 29min long and revolves around teamster Jimmy Hoffa. Every scene in this movie is very well directed. Robert De Niro plays the role of Frank Sheeran, the Irishman working with and working for many Italians . Jimmy Hoffa (played by Al Pacino) is enthusiastic about truck drivers and teamsters. Frank takes care of problems and solves problems in a very silent but ruthless style. Frank is meticulous in his work. Another mobster Russell Bufaine , played very well by Joe Pesci (who almost disappeared from Hollywood after the movie The Casino) understands Frank very well and relies on Frank to get job done in eliminating people. The movie is very interesting and shows how Frank mastered the art of eliminating problems. It was truly interesting to watch Frank get a casket for himself. It takes a great Director to keep the interest of a packed theater for entire length of the movie. Robert De Niro is excellent as Frank and worthy of Oscar nomination. Excellent Direction. Oscar worthy."

But to go into your own genre and put out a flat story about Jimmy Hoffa and throw in Sporadic real event subtitles that have little to do with the story...I guess there's a reason nobody heard of the book and the movie was made after the ""Teamster Hitman's demise. This was just garbage redeemed by DeNiro's care for Hoffa which comes across very strongly and his efforts working both ends to avoid ""The Hit"" this was like a boring possible truth or part truth boring drawn out history lesson.
If Marvel can make Michael Douglas look 30 why can't Marty?

","The genre of this movie is: Biography, Crime, and Drama.<br/><br/>This is a tale of Frankie, who happened to be involved in crime through his career.<br/><br/>This movie is, quoting directly from the movie; 'It is what it is' in the perspective of Frankie. His relationships, his character build-up, his success, his friendship, his choices, his troubles, his mistakes, and his life.<br/><br/>And anyone who has literally 'lived' past their 20s can relate to him as a person. This movie isn't trying to make a point who killed and who became the boss and whatnot. Its focus is in Frankie and how he came to be where he is at the end of the movie. And let me tell you, it is as anti-climatic as it can be. And that, is, 'it is what it is'. The movie LITERALLY shows you when the characters DIE.<br/><br/>This isn't a feel-good movie, this isn't a shoot-em up while crunching popcorn movie, this movie is a thought provoking movie. Especially told by the same actors who have aged along in real life, it really makes you question; what really matters in the end? Looks like Frankie haven't figured it out. And no one really does, in real life. That's the powerful message behind the power struggles as a mafia. The latter part of the movie is the highlight.<br/><br/>Give yourself some time to absolve the entire movie."

No room from plot development or good acting or dialogue. Well I guess any movie prior to 1980 would never cut it. Surely nothing from the golden era of Hollywood. Actually movies like this are so rare today that I almost forget that they can be made. And since a large segment of audiences do not appreciate them, I guess they will be even rarer.

","So I watched the movie yesterday on Netflix. Because I've seen, that the movie is 3.5 hours long have prepared myself for some maybe ""boring"" parts, but there were NONE. There was always something happening. Action non stop and tension almost non stop. Acting of those 3 gentleman (De Niro, Pacino,Pesci) is more than great. Yes, everyone of them has a bit of self-touch to a character, maybe even what we have seen before. But in one word, acting was just GREAT, especially Joe Pesci. I haven't seen Pesci, till this movie acting so serious, so confident. The CGI thing, it was OK. You can see in some scenes (moments )that is not really that convincing, because we know how the actors look now. Especially you can see it on De Niro. I was expecting maybe more emotional scenes, but there wasn't plenty of them. Not too many in-family interactions. Maybe because they are Mafia and cold blooded killers. Not to much to be expected on the emotional side. But maybe I expected too much. Directing is great and convincing, skript too. I think that Martin Scorsese told this story like it should be told. Those people that gave less than 7 stars to this movie I think they have some problems within themselves. They are not objective by any means."

Pesci has the best performance and helps carry the movie and Ray Ramano is good as the union lawyer but it's such a minor role.

"tomellingham","5","4","7","12 February 2020"," A load of drivel.
","A 3-hour long Goodfellas tribute featuring elderly people.<br/><br/>A 58-year-old meat delivery driver with no pals and a bad back besties with an aged local mobster and gives up the day job to do mobster stuff.
The story is retold Ray Liotta style by his son in an old people's home.<br/><br/>The film starts off well enough, with some predictable but captivating 80's/90's mob-movie cinematographic cliches (some examples below) that look good on a 4k telly.<br/><br/>It was enough to see me about half an hour of watching this through, when I felt the urge to play with my phone.<br/><br/>Three quarters of an hour, or so, in, I discovered myself playing online chess against a friend. I think it around then I realised I had forgotten the movie was on, and I had no idea what was happening in it.<br/><br/>After chess, I put my phone down, tried to get roughly to where I last remembered being.
Managed about another half hour or so from that general area, before I went to make a cup of tea and forgot to go back.<br/><br/>I let The Irishman fairytale ramble on to an empty sofa for another hour or so before I switching off the Netflix app.<br/><br/>The next evening, refreshed, I was re-determined to watch the thing.
So I changed tack.<br/><br/>I decided to treat The Irishman like a mini TV series.
Every day, I vowed, I would try and get through a little bit of The Irishman at a time, and at some point, it would end - at least, I presume it ends at some point - and I would therefore have seen this thing in its entirety.<br/><br/>This didn't work. Although I'd like to thank Netflix for the 'continue watching from where you left off' function, which meant at least I was able to give it a good go.<br/><br/>I've no idea at what point I gave up on The Irishman, other than it was on the third day of trying to watch the damn thing.<br/><br/>The Irishman is the movie equivalent of a novel which nobody reads through to the end. The last half hour could be an episode of The Simpsons for all I care.<br/><br/>If there's any kind of conclusion you can tell me or not as you please - I am incapable of giving a chuff.<br/><br/>The Irishman is a load of utter drivel with - spoiler alert - a storyline that becomes less and less credible as it goes along to as far as anyone can be bothered watching.<br/><br/>I'd be a more forgiving if this had been produced by a bunch of start-ups. If that were the case, I'd give it 6/10 stars for effort.
But it's not. It's a film produced by people who are normally top of their game who all had an off year, all at the same time, and all together.<br/><br/>But it doesn't mean the team haven't done excellent work in the past, and it doesn't mean they can't do again so in the future.<br/><br/>It was directed by the bloke most famous for The Godfather - and you probably know this, cos you're on IMDb - and some of the bits I managed to get through did have flavourings of Casino.<br/><br/>But I reckon The Irishman copies the majority of its cliches from Goodfellas: The background narration the obvious main one, but also the sweeping location shots, side pans into street corner Italian restaurants, short clips of violence, newspaper clips, that sort of thing.
Oh yeah: and Deniro, and the bloke from 'Stop, or My Mom Will Shoot'.<br/><br/>There's no Ray Liotta though. That guy would have made it a cliche.<br/><br/>
If you like the way the 1990 film was put together you might enjoy some of these bits here too.
There's quite a few nice old cars and trucks to look at, and they've done a great job of putting locations, although not the main actors, into period.<br/><br/>If all the scenes with dialogue and violence were cut, you would end up with a quite good two or three minutes of cinematography that could make a decent enough 'retail mode' sequence for televisions in showrooms.<br/><br/>Another alternative use: one could switch off the picture and get on with stuff around the house. Deniro will chat on in the background like a warm, familiar, permanent companion. It would actually be like being in the old folk's home with him. That could be quite nice.
But as a film, nah.<br/><br/>Those who lamented this movie not coming out on the big screen had evidently not attempted to see the thing before making comment.<br/><br/>Cinemas dodged a bullet by missing out on The Irishman. Had they screened it, the future of the industry would have been at stake."

For gods sake 40 something De Niro almost stumbled and fell on the rocks of the East River, it was a bit embarrassing at best, and undignified at worse (respect to De Niro, I'm a huge fan).<br/><br/>The story is interesting, if this type of thing takes your fancy so I'm not going to talk about that, but there were a few bad choices in the movie like the actors, and the length.

","I don't know what's going on with movie ratings, critics and reviews these days but something is very fishy. Just like the movie 'Roma' last year also from Netflix, this year we get 'The Irishman' as the most overrated and polarizing movie of the year. Just like for Alfonso Cuaron who is a good director but made a boring so so film with 'Roma' albeit with beautiful cinematography, the 'Irishman' is a repetitive opus and mostly boring redux of Scorcese's past materpieces like 'Goodfellas' with a legendary cast of actors who are but an old shell of themselves. De Niro is not believable as a mobster given his age - no matter how much CGI you put on his face, his body just doesn't act/look the part. Joe Pesci just looks old even when he's supposed to look young. Al Pacino just doesn't fit the Hoffa character no matter how good an actor he is. Anna Paquin doesn't have much of a part in this movie as she barely speaks or emotes in the movie. Harvey Keitel just plays an insignificant part. Ray Romano & Bobby Cannavle were the only redeeming memorable supporting characters in this film. Scorcese is just making the same movie as Goodfellas/Casino with less mastery, and less energy, desire for tight editing/cinematography, nicely choreographed fighting/crime sequences, character development and good acting direction. Despite being a 3.5h movie, it just feels like you never get much into the psychology of the main protagonists or any kind of interesting plot... a mess of a film... even the soundtrack feels repetitive using the same tricks as his past movies... The Irishman is definitely not what the ratings would want to make you believe it is... which tells me that the fix is in... The oscars might give this movie a shot at best picture just like they did for Roma last year for best foreign film, except this time, it's the crown jewel for Netflix... So overrated by bot ratings and at best dubious reviews... In short, 'The Irishman' is the most overrated film I've seen since 'Roma'."

"patriciogl10","9","4","7","16 December 2019"," Outstanding narrative feat.
","One of the longest awaited releases in recent memory, The Irishman is Marty Scorsese's mob magnus opus of this decade, something that was long overdue, not to mention him joining forces once again with former associates such as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and first-time
collaborator, the magnificent Al Pacino. Scorsese returns to the genre in top form, handling narrative tasks in an extremely substantial manner, with minutious precise storytelling that seems so well-connected from beginning to end. Each scene is composed through a firm thread which stays strong throughout the film, never letting any scene go unnoticed or feel somewhat unremarkable. Each scene has its purpose, whether it is small or big, it ties the story together. The editing is also a marvel to behold, since it brings the narrative element to the highest of standards, prompting to make the viewer feel that the duration of the film isn't something to be preoccupied with as long as there is an excellent film in front of them. The film slowly cooks on low heat like a stew, slowly building up to the point of being done, and the final result is an absolute delight, a feast to the senses involved.<br/><br/>The acting is first-class, supreme and superlative, as if there weren't enough adjectives to describe the immaculate performances of De Niro, Pesci and Pacino. Even the rest of the cast does a magnific job to keep the boat not only afloat but almost floating up in the air. The only thing that results a bit distracting is the de-aging effect, specially on De Niro, just like Will Smith on Gemini Man, specifically the area around the mouth, which is something special effects companies will have to improve to make it as close to reality as possible.<br/><br/>Marty Scorsese and his friends came back for a monumental mob/political piece regarding the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa, proving that the Scorsese way is still efficient and highly regarded in 2019, where people can still appreciate movies of long duration, with nothing but a story to tell, supported by fine acting, and almost zero effects. The Irishman will only get bigger with time, as it will be regarded as one of Scorsese's finest works of his career, accumulated with efforts of such exceptional quality. Legendary."
"ojafredi","1","4","7","15 December 2019"," Sub par in every aspect
","Oh god how this movie drags along and is full of fillers which do not pose any importance from the storytelling importance. Not only are they unimportant but also confusing. An example of that is Franks daughter Peggy, who, since the start of the movie is a completely unnecessary character but yet throughout the years we see camera zooming in on her odd qazes and facial impressions as of they mean anything. Throughout the movie the dialogue between some of the main characters and Peggy has a  innuendo and is awkward to watch. One could argue that it's important since in the end Frank's daugther figures out what he has done and disappears from his life. Wrong! This is a stretch given how the father-daughter relationship was portrayed during this excessively long movie.<br/><br/>Also, the entire thing isn't believable even with the deaging. They wanna tell a story of a semi young guy who works his way through the ranks in some 30 years or so. De Niro and the rest of the group looked old to begin with so it was difficult to understand the timeline advancement in the movie. Also, De Niro can try as much as he'd like but he had a posture of an old man from the start. The stunts and fight scenes were also laughable. De Niro beating up a grocery store guy wa so fake and you could see from a mile away he wasn't actually touching the guy. Almost every gangster in the movie was a senior.<br/><br/>Given the length of the movie, it's absolutely unclear how de niro became such a man of power because the entire film is just a bunch of hints and mainly him standing on the sidelines when something important takes place.<br/><br/>This attempt was just weak and embarrassing."

","Missed 'The Irishman' during Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival with Star. It has taken me four days to watch it in bits and parts. Finally, watching it, is done. 😁<br/><br/>The Irishman leaves you with a swallowing sense of regret, loss and frailty. In a brilliant scene, Pesci's character tells De Niro's Frank Sheeran, ""Look how strong I've made you. No one can touch you."" The statement is starkly contrasted by powerful men who are assassinated, imprisoned, betrayed or weakened by age. Most devastating is watching a man achieve his peak power, and then see his slow realisation that he has lost the love of his children.<br/><br/>It will be revered as one of the greatest films ever produced about organised crime, and might very well be the definitive statement on the genre, because it's difficult to imagine anyone eclipsing what Scorsese has done here.<br/><br/>It is obviously long but it's never less than compelling -
#MartinScorsese, #RobertDeNiro, #AlPacino and #JoePesci, all in their mid-to-late-70s, are each carrying a lifetime of work, with practiced ease.<br/><br/>If you fortunately see them all together for 4 consecutive days, your happiness multiplies. 😁"

"janoffpeter","1","4","7","6 December 2019"," Hugely disappointing
","I consider myself a seasoned Scorsese fan but this was over hyped and underachieved. There is very little about this mammoth production that is memorable.There were certainly elements of greatness which are masterfully reflected in each star studded actors performances and Scorsese's flair for story telling on mixed timelines but there I wasn't a moment of the movie where I thought yes! That's the master at work.Pacino was horribly cast as Jimmy Hoffa and must have (true to his type) used the swear sucker at least 20 or thirty times. There's was just a point where that kind of language no longer propelled the script or mood. De Niro was cast correctly but his performance seemed kind of contrived.
and lackluster. I wanted more from Joe Pesci. He lacked the cruelty and ruthlessness he used to portray so-very well. It was a botched effort to keep the Casino/Goodfellas theme alive due to its lack of intensity. It was an attempt to stay true to those films but that was a mistake. There are much more compelling and exciting epics of history that Scorsese could have delved into. But since he insisted on performing the same old genre (this time focused on the Hoffa era) with the same old actors without really having his heart committed to the project which produced a 3 hour long sojourn into nothingness seems like a waste of time and money. Considering this would most likely be their last hurrah they didn't by any means go out with a bang. Just a tepid whimper. Let dead dogs lie."

Age reducing tech was a bit distracting and their ageing physiques and movements still give it away. Even so, if the story line was better, this wouldn't be an issue.<br/><br/>Big actors, big budget, BIG disappointment!"
"mungflesh","7","4","7","3 December 2019"," Good but weak for Scorsese
","An elderly Mob hitman (De Niro) recalls the people he knew (Pesci, Pacino) and the decisions he took which defined him.<br/><br/>I think knowing a bit about the subject matter might have helped with this movie. Scorsese takes for granted the fact his audience know what's gradually unfolding. I didn't and although it's coherent and well scripted, it's lacking tension and, in the first half, a sense of direction. I suspect on subsequent viewings it will come together more nicely.<br/><br/>Whilst not on the same level as Goodfellas, Wolf of Wall Street or Taxi Driver, it's still a decent film but its length does it no favours.<br/><br/>The main negatives, aside from the running time, are the awful use of CG to make the cast younger and the cartoonish blood effects when people are shot. The choice to use ageing actors and youngify them rather than young ones, with prosthetic make up, proves a bit odd looking.<br/><br/>It's a good movie but one of Scorsese's weaker ones."
"kevin-h-720-45317","7","4","7","2 December 2019"," Dont believe the hype...
","I had high expectations of this and was quite let down. Where as previous Scorcese masterpieces like Goodfellas left me wanting more and leaving an Impression, the Irishman did neither. If you really look at the film and dont be blinded by the cast you cannot ignore things that make it look hollow. In one scene alone where De Niro who plays Frank Sheeran takes his daughter to the local shop to beat up the grocer who pushed his little girl he looks like what he is. He looks like a pensioner beating someone up. It looks completely fake and feeble. Another scene where Russel buffalino played by Pesci addressing De Niro as ""young fella or man"" is farcical. He looks like an octogenarian dressed as James Dean and no amount of CGI can help that. The film isn't all bad but it lacks vitality. While it also tells the story of American history over a 30 year period it lacks certain credibility. I didnt know until I watched this that Frank Sheeran also claimed he single handedly slain Crazy Joe Gallo when witnesses at the time claim there was at least 4 gunmen. I also found out that not one US agency including the FBI thought that Sheeran had anything to do with Hoffas disappearance and all we are left with is the dubious confession of a dying man. Maybe worth a watch this but at near four hours it wont be something you will feel a need to watch again."

","Some parts of this movie were quite brilliant but unfortunately it was ridiculously drawn out with some mind numbingly dull parts that were hard to watch in their dullness.<br/><br/>Basically as a film it was far too long and would have worked better as a 3 part mini-series.
Nothing against long films if they keep the audience on their side like Once Upon A Time In America did brilliantly over 4 hours in 1984. A movie I've watched a dozen times. This will be one I won't repeat that experience of even twice.<br/><br/>The writing and acting was not up to the usual Scorsese standard and the old geezers Pesci, Pacino and De Nero looked like they were just there for the pay check in some parts.<br/><br/>The de-ageing scenes were in one way great to see but in another very sad as these guys are in their 70s and the 30 year old segments reflected that in the way they moved. One fight scene highlighted this as a 70 odd year old bloke playing a 30 odd year old in a fight looked pretty silly.<br/><br/>Overall it wasn't bad and told a good story in a decent way. The veracity of the story we will never know and 3 and a half hours telling that story probably made the viewer not really care as they were exhausted. Hopefully all the old guys will now retire for good as they don't do their Legacy any favours with a film like this."

"Opinate","5","7","15","3 December 2019"," You can't hide the old eyes and slow movements of an aging actor.
","If you can put up with the first hour and a half it does catch you up in the end because DeNiro is believable at that point and you see some actual humanity from him (his feelings are mostly just for himself though).
The anti-aging CG needs to be stopped right here, right now. It does not work because you can't change a person's old eyes or the way older people move. The effect of digitally smoothing out the wrinkles on a face just takes away all the edges and character, so DeNiro didn't look like a young DeNiro, rather he had a flattened blank looking face that at times looked like a colourized John Wayne, and at other times looked a bit Barbara Walters when they started using thick soft focusing to cover her age.
I would much rather see a younger actor play DeNiro - whether he looked like him or not - One who didn't have creepy old eyes looking out of a flattened out face. Younger people's eyes are wider, more energetic, not so tired.
There were many instances when a younger actor would have made (action) scenes faster, quickening the overall pace of the first two thirds of the film too, and that would have been a huge relief.
It is not worth 250Mm price tag, but is worth a watch for the last bit. Just go into it knowing you have to wade through a lot of boring material to get to the good bits - and don't expect too much from the 'good bits' either - maybe it just felt good because it was a relief to actually see the character in his own skin after all the creepiness (with a bit of makeup).
I LOVE Stephen Graham and did not have a problem with his accent at all. The cast is stellar and the film solid otherwise, if you like lowlife old gangsters, that is. Nothing redeeming at all if it's not your genre."

"bsmith5552","9","7","15","2 December 2019"," Whatever Happened to.......Jimmy Hoffa? Hmmmmmmm!
","""The Irishman"" is yet another masterful film from Director Martin Scorcese. He has assembled a very large cast to fill out the film's 209 minute running time.<br/><br/>It's the story of mob hit man and senior union official Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) as he reflects on his past life. He came to be associated early with mobster Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) whom he met at a service station when he stopped to help Frank fix his truck.. Frank begins to skim off beef sides from his employer, selling them to Skinny Razor (Bobby Cannavale) and friends. Frank becomes a close confidant of Bufalino performing several ""tasks"" on his behalf.<br/><br/>Bufalino points Frank toward Union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) with whom he becomes an entrusted friend. Frank goes back and forth between the two powerful men ""helping out"" wherever he can. When Senator Robert Kennedy (Jack Houston) persecutes him, Hoffa is sent to prison for four years losing his position as Union Boss to his former assistant Frank ""Fitz"" Fitzsimmons (Gary Basaraba). While in prison Hoffa is confronted by mobster and ex Union official Tony Provenzao (Stephen Graham) over Tony's lost pension benefits. The two men argue and end up in a fist fight.<br/><br/>When Hoffa is released from prison around the time of John Kennedy's assassination, He tries to regain control of the Union. Bufalino and senior mobster Angelo Bruno (Harvey Keitel) warn him to back off as ""Fitz"" has found favor with the mob. Finally, Bufalino tells Frank that the time to eliminate the troublesome Hoffa has come. Frank with mixed emotions, agrees to do this ""little service"" for his mentor.<br/><br/>Following Hoffa's disappearance, Frank's daughter Peggy (Anna Paquin) disowns him over her suspicions on the Hoffa affair. Frank and Bufalino eventually land in jail together and grow old over the years. After Bufalino's death Frank is left to dwell in the past all alone in his last years.<br/><br/>The performances by the principals are mesmerizing. Pacino is outstanding as Jimmy Hoffa particularly in his hell raising speeches to his membership. DeNiro is sympathetic as the long suffering but faithful soldier Frank Sheeran. Joe Pesci, who had to be talked out of retirement for his role is good as the highly respected crime figure. And look for TV star Ray Romano as Bufalino lawyer Bill Bufalino.<br/><br/>Much has been said about the terrific de-aging (and aging) process used where the main characters look and act younger (and older) without the aid of make-up. It's quite amazing indeed. As they say, this couls be the start of something big.<br/><br/>A terrific, if overlong film."
"dcastellani","10","7","15","2 December 2019"," The best Mob Movie of the 21st Century
","From start to finish this movie is a 10. The movie is on par with any of Scorsese's prime films, from Goodfellas to Taxi Driver this will go down as one of his bests. The only thing you can knock this movie for is the 3 and a half hour runtime, but that's where it grips you. The writing in this movie is one of the bests in Scorsese's library, but it is one of the best maybe even the best of 2019. The funny part is in the movie there is a lot of dead silence just the camera lingering on whomever is on screen after a conversation, but it's not just some gimmick to get you to sit there for 3.5 hours. Whenever this happens in the film it's a time when something said or something done is being thought about by the character and it gives you the time to resonate before moving on to the next scene. Scorsese brings the whole gang back for one last go around, and boy what a way to go out if this is the final film for these brilliant men. De Niro has been goin steady the last couple years but this was the De Niro we know best. His performance is wonderful and deserves a nomination. Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa is the best we've seen from him in a long time. But if you ask me the one the only Joe Pesci gave the performance of his career. Pesci's roles have given him this reputation of being this loud mouth fight first ask questions later kind of guy that we all came to love, and that is why this is his career performance. This is a role that has come at the perfect time for Pesci. When he is on the screen you feel that every word he says is precious time being spent on you. He is cold he is calm he is calculating he is the man of the film for me. Everything in this film is perfection, the cinematography, the score, the pacing, acting, writing, directing. If you had asked me yesterday what the best movie of 2019 is I would have said the Joker easily, but not anymore. The Irishman is a 10 wise guys out 10 it is the best movie of 2019 and it still won't get any Oscar nominations goodbye"
"SanDhuBoy05","10","7","15","30 November 2019"," Nothing beyond these 3 in the genre..
","When you watch a 3.5hr movie in 2019 and they just fly past and you don't even realise, that says it all.<br/><br/>Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are genre defining actors who once again hit the home run. All three of em' gave on of the best performances of their career. De Niro was the engine that kept the movie running. Joe Pesci as Russel said so much without saying much. The 'less is more' blended perfectly.
But its Al Pacino that brought the shine to the movie in his own way. A stand-up 'say it to your face' kinda guy trying to do what he can in the era of gangsters all around as Jimmy Hoffa. He had that pull that makes you want to root for the guy and hope it all works out for him in the end even though the film synopsis clearly mentioned he got slayed if you are not familier with the Jimmy Hoffa name.
All in all it was a work of art, with all three legends complimenting each other and Martin Scorsese makin them gel into the movie. 10/10"
"statuskuo","9","7","15","30 November 2019"," A Study In Real Cinema
","At time ""The Irishman"" does get bogged down by the Netflix inspired episodic feel, but this dissection of the inner workings of union and the demise of Jimmy Hoffa at the hands of a close friend is too engaging to leave for a mini-series. It's to be told by the master of cinema, director Martin Scorsese. And, though his recent comments about superhero flicks being the death of real storytelling, which I emphatically agree with, he has earned his right to say so, and in this flick he's proven his skillful craft combining all his efforts from previous mobster flicks. EXCEPT, everyone involved are so subdued and in character, it's hard to remember that Joe Pesci is the rampant hothead in ""GoodFellas"" or ""Casino"" To be honest, ""The Departed"" wasn't worthy of Best Picture. This is. It's a masterful control of pace, storytelling and character idiosyncratic behavior that could've been easily caricature. Instead, we're dealing with a Steven Zaillian script and anchored by incredible faces with incredible pedigree in how people USE to make films. This is the flick we have been waiting for as the trilogy to complete the modern day crime storytelling (I disregard ""Mean Streets"" as it's more hood film). In organized crime, most silently nod and people go dead. It's that fast. And the mystery surrounding Hoffa's disappearance is more the MacGuffin of the film than what's at the core. And that is, that friendships within crime don't last long. And that being emboldened to someone through this world does not mean you aren't marked for death. It's comes in many forms. In Robert DeNiro's Frank Sheeran, it is that he is left with the ghosts of people he's wronged. Especially the one who trusted and cared for him the most.<br/><br/>Now, is it a perfect film...no. The biggest flaw is that it doesn't present new information about Hoffa's death. It provides his life. And his stubborness, a lot of arrogance and entitlement. As a viewer we understand the dangers of going against organized crime. In Al Pacino's Hoffa, we see a man so blinded by being a somebody, he's willing to continue to bat at a hornet's nest to get the recognition he craves. And it's his own undoing. What this flick really focuses on, is DeNiro's subdued assassin. And through the eyes of his own daughter, he is a monster that lives in the house. A hand grenade whose pin has been pulled and he spends his life wondering how to put it back. His one daughter, Peggy, played by the adult Anna Paquin, witnessed his brutality at an early age. Though low key, he is a pitbull when called upon to do an ugly job. He justifies all his poor decisions as to the welfare of his family. Which, unlike ""GoodFellas"" there is a little more class to this than to the thugs of that movie. ""GoodFellas"" is a hammer to the teeth, whereas ""The Irishman"" plays at the outskirts of crime. The constant bickering which undoes it all has very little to do with people thriving in crime, and more to do with getting respect. It's a brutal grind to get there, since we know the ending.
As always, the camera is at the perfect spot at all times. This mob one, lensed by Rodrigo Prieto, plays it less glamorous. While eye-poppy in old Ektachrome color, it still remains modern. Even with all the vintage production design. Whereas Michael Ballhaus's dark underworld, classic style, this could be the perfect blend between Robert RIchardson's ""Casino"" and ""Goodfellas""
It's a great journey, and the biggest compliment I can say is that it made me want to know more about The Irishman.
Thank you for pure cinema Mr. Scorsese!"

","One of this years true diamonds and Martin Scorsese's return to his roots and to the genre he is best at: The gangster genre. Also funnily his first collaboration with Al Pacino and his reunion with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.
This 3,5 hour epic really convinces and you hardly ever feel the long hours and running time, it is always exciting, there is always something to tell and never drags. The first hour is a bit slower compared to the second and third because it take s a long time to introduce the characters and it is good and effective that it takes that time.
Robert De Niro was great and it is a shame he hardly ever gets fantastic material like that anymore. Really a fantastic performance and prove that he still makes a great leading man. Sometimes the performance was a bit monotone but especially in the last third he really shows off his brilliance. Fantastic to see Joe Pesci back, even if it is just this once for this film. He never lost his charisma and it was nice to see him in such a more ""calmer"" role. Fantastic as well. Al Pacino was a bit too Al Pacino for me... he was great, dont get me wrong. But playing Jimmy Hoffa I hoped that Pacino ignores a bit Pacino. Still that trio truly makes the film. We have also a good appearance by Harvey Keitel, tho his character deserved more work and Ray Romano. The direction and screenplay were among the two best of the year. Also the de-aging worked for me and I think the negativity of that is overrated. Really one of the best of the year."

","I'll readily admit to the fact that on more than one occasion I feared for what The Irishman could become.<br/><br/>After what seemed like years of gestation, setbacks and industry murmurings, how on earth could the ever aging yet evergreen Martin Scorsese possibly pull of the most audacious films of his long standing career?<br/><br/>Well shame on me for ever doubting, as Scorsese biggest passion project yet The Irishman is both a stunning feat of modern day filmmaking technology and old school craft, as the crime genre kingpin creates a balancing act for the ages while allowing audiences from around the world one last ride with a gang of cinematic legends that here combine forces for what's a fitting swansong to decades worth of hard work and generation defining roles.<br/><br/>Clocking in at a whopping 209 minutes, Scorsese and screenwriter Steven Zaillian's adaptation of Charles Brandt's book I Heard You Paint Houses takes its time in telling the story of Robert De Niro's Irish-blooded mob enforcer and hitman Frank Sheeran, as we follow his 50 year plus journey navigating the ranks of the Bufalino crime family under the guidance of Joe Pesci's patriarch Russell, while also illuminating Sheeran's long-standing friendship with influential American teamster Jimmy Hoffa, played by a fired up and typically gusto Al Pacino.<br/><br/>By utilising cutting edge de-aging effects, Scorsese and his tech team have managed to allow for these screen legends to be there for every moment of their characters screen time and while at first it's a little off-putting seeing these esteemed figures in such a way, but before long The Irishman will have you wrapped up in its web of friendships, betrayals and life musings and the scarily well done CGI work will become just a part of the scenery.<br/><br/>It's no mean feat that this works so well, but Scorsese is perfectly in-tune with this tale and thanks to this The Irishman very quickly establishes itself as a very different mob movie to the one people perhaps expected as it increasingly steers further and further away from the frantic Goodfella's and the over the top Casino to become a meditative examination of the organised crime world that is more interested in asking the hard questions of mortality, family and growing old than it is delivering action or polished shootouts.<br/><br/>All aged well past their 60's, The Irishman is reflective of those that inhabit its world both in front of the camera and behind it but it's not to say the men of this film aren't up for the challenge with everyone bringing their A-game to a film that feels like the perfect clashing of time, place and people.<br/><br/>As good as they've been in years, De Niro and Pacino wind back the clock in magnificent fashion here, both delivering considered and restrained awards worthy turns, while the much-missed Joe Pesci quietly walks away as the films MVP, in what becomes the performance of his career as Bufalino, a man very far removed from Tommy DeVito or Nicky Santoro.<br/><br/>While quietly spoken throughout and barely raising a sweat, the subtle nature of Pesci's performance here stands out as one of the highlights of Scorsese's bladder testing epic, an epic so well put together, so full of memorable dialogue wonderfully played out by a cast one could only dream of that you can't help but sit back and savour the chance to see master's at work, for could well be one of the last times.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>A stunning ode to old school filmmaking and storytelling that molds together seamlessly with modern day technical marvels, The Irishman is a mob movie unlike any other. Featuring an array of top-notch performances from some of cinemas most revered figures as an added bonus, Scorsese's most ambitious project yet has overcome the odds to instantly become one of modern cinemas greatest singular events.<br/><br/>5 watermelons out of 5"

"heisenberg12","9","8","18","28 November 2019"," Unbiased Review for Those Interested in Maybe Seeing It: It's Worth a Watch
","Any movie that gets hype and Oscar buzz on here is going to draw lots of biased people reviewing it. Before I watched The Irishman, it was hard to gage which reviews were legit and real and which were just biased, whether it was in a positive way or a negative way. First off, De Niro has made lots of controversial political speeches in recent years, which can affect how people view this, and then there's the sort of de-aging CGI that some people took issue with (Is that really enough to warrant a 1-2 star rating though? Is it that bad?); on the positive side, Scorcese lovers may give it an automatic 10 since he is one of their favorites, which goes on a lot in reviews (let's face it; Tarantino often gets a free pass and 10 ratings even in his erroneous films).<br/><br/>So with all that out of the way, here would be my honest review for people who may be interested but on the fence about seeing The Irishman.<br/><br/>The first 1 hour and a half is absolutely dazzlingly amazing. I want to go as far as to say that I actually liked it more than Goodfellas, but I would have to see them both again to confirm that. It is an absolute masterpiece for the first hour and a half, no doubt.<br/><br/>And Joe Pesci- just hand him the Oscar right now. He gives what is in my opinion the absolute best performance in the movie. I liked him better in this role than his iconic role in Goodfellas, and he is truly outstanding. I was so glad that his character got so much screen time in this because he was by far my favorite, heavily outshining even both De Niro and Pacino. Those two are good, don't get me wrong, but Pesci is just stunning and deserves the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, without question. It's one of the best performances in a mob movie I've ever seen. He has so much screen time, and in every single clip or image, he is ""perfect"". every look he gives, every line he delivers is nothing short of perfection.<br/><br/>Even though De Niro and Pacino are very good in most of the scenes, I thought Pacino could have toned it down a little bit in some of his scenes. He does in fact give the old, vintage Pacino acting you have come to expect. It's not totally bad, but I would say he was the weakest link of the main actors, and I still love his movies and he is one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>DeNiro excels in the final half an hour of the movie, which sees him encounter old age and come to terms and closure with what he has done. This will probably at least get him a nomination for Best Actor.<br/><br/>The final act (half hour or so) is worth sticking around for so if you get bored in the long run time, I recommend you stick around for it. It was a little sad and heartbreaking, but it was so well done, I really appreciated how Scorcese took the story to that ""place"", rather than only keep it more superficial.<br/><br/>Now, as for the drawbacks or negatives of the movie: once the first two hours pass, the pacing really slows down (and the film somewhat gets watered down into some mafia movie clichÃ©s) and begins to feel a little bit generic. It is in fact true that many scenes could have been cut beyond that point, particularly redundant one-on-one conversation scenes between Hoffa, Ed Sheeran (The Irishman) and whoever they were meeting. Regardless, it's never ""bad"" per say, but it does become less entertaining beyond the two hour mark and is prolonged in a way that was probably unnecessary.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think this movie is definitely worth a watch one way or another. The CGI de-aging wasn't as much of a problem as some of the people who criticized it said. You do notice it at times, but you quickly get used to it and the story is strong enough that you lose focus of it.<br/><br/>It's not perfect, as a whole (due to the length), but it is a ""good"" movie, nonetheless...and it takes you out of fantasy comic book land for those sick of those types of movies. You get some interesting historical events in this as well that matures the story for mature audiences.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"the_movie_addict","9","8","18","27 November 2019"," Netflix hits a GOLD with Martin Scorsese's The Irishman
","Netflix hits a GOLD with Martin Scorsese's The Irishman<br/><br/>Someone who has watched all the Martin Scorsese movies and works and basically everything, The Irishman is a GOLD in the basket for a filmmaker maverick who's making films since 60's and isnt telling new generation that's old and getta outta of this business like ""I'm never gonna retire now."" Well, neither do I want him to ever.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's film is all about performances and the best acting he has got from his actors all these years is a proof that your skills arent just asset but also a talking thing for people who love cinema and movies and watch it genuinely fully submitted to the telling and showing.<br/><br/>The film is based on the 2004 book I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt which tells about f Frank Sheeran and basically the life he had as an alleged mafia hitman who confesses the crimes he committed working for the Bufalino crime family. But the film takes a further turn under the Scorsese's vision, direction and beautiful, philosophical and depth-ful screenplay by Steven Zaillian by keeping it to the ground like closer to graves but not dead so that we consider it like fantasy.<br/><br/>At last, Netflix did a great thing since their inception by bringing Martin Scorsese and the team he's famous for working with like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci , Harvey Keitel and many among others and not working with like Al Pacino and that in an age where acting is just another business and gettin famous is an event and not a custom or a pilgrimage or a journey like actors of past usually have with their filmographies. In an age where avengers is consider a film masterpiece and twilight earns millions at BO. this is just pure and raw GOLD.<br/><br/>I will watch it again and want Netflix to make another film with same people so that I say my money has got the best person to keep it with.<br/><br/>So go and watch it because that's just the way it is."

","To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I'm mad at Scorsese. I want those 3 and a half hours back. You've been telling the same story for the last 30 years. Not only that, you've been using the same cast too. The story jumps around so much, I thought it was a House of Pain song. Sometimes jumping around helps the plot, but this isn't one of them. If it was shorter, it could have worked. You can't spend 30 minutes in the present then jump back 10 years for five minutes, then jump all the way back to the present again only to repeat the same process with no care in the world about rythm and smooth plot progression. That never works. I will give credit to the wonderful CGI. It was awesome to see that age progression. You know what wasn't awesome? Seeing those effects on 80 year people. Great, they look like 40/50 year olds that have had a lumbar puncture and have to walk like 80 year olds for a couple of hours. I was worried they were going to fall and break a hip. They all have the mannerisms you would expect of an 80 year old. Basically, Scorsese is the Adam Sandler of gangster movies. Start calling you Martin Sandler,cause you just wanted to make a movie with your buds. Everyone is upset that De Niro didn't get an Oscar nomination. He didn't deserve it. Hell, Sandler deserved it more than De Niro did. Having one line at a time shouldn't cut it. He's a great actor, but that doesn't mean he earned it. I loved how he tried to walk like he was younger. Reminded me of a robot learning to walk for the first time. Overall, I wasn't impressed. Not when comparing this with his previous movies (i.e. Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Departed, Shutter Island, Raging bull) and sadly enough, not even when comparing it with this year's cinematic masterpieces such as 1917, Uncut Gems, Little women and even Parasite which is a borderline indie movie next to the rest of the Box Office Big Players at this point. No, I was just... bored. Absolute snoozefest of a movie. Do yourself a favor and avoid watching it in the cinema as the chairs can be less than comfy for sleep."

","The film is a useless recreation of Goodfellas. A story told with all the Scorsese bits that goes absolutely no where... except to the grave it builds for itself.<br/><br/>Sure, I can appreciate Marty as the auteur he is but this movie makes no points and that doesn't happen without a ton of effort. We are given the voice-over narration much like Ray Liotta did but this movie never pops and cracks with anything resembling that same excitement. I'd like to thank this movie for teaching me that powerful mobsters are forgotten like every other person who never did anything good for society. Just a really memorable lesson that it appears from the reaction, people actually needed to hear?<br/><br/>The ending: I've always liked the ending to Goodfellas, it is ambiguous enough to let the audience wonder what type of life Henry hill was now going to lead but I guess Scorsese thought he did a bad job? Here we are treated to an hour of geriatric care that felt all too familiar to perhaps what is happening to Scorsese in real life... The only difference is he actually has amazing movies to uphold his legacy rather than this character of a glorified hit man who never connected on any level with his family and therefore will die very alone ( wow! What a poetic and imaginative ending for a movie about a killer).<br/><br/>The set up: early on it felt like we were in for some chapters of a story told outside of a timeline. Obituaries creep above people as they are introduced to the screen but by the end of the 3.5 hours who the hell remembered or cared to remember what any of them said.. there ends up being no reason at all to provide this gimmick in the movie since we aren't even introduced to these characters let alone tie the story back into all the ways and reasons these auxiliary characters died.<br/><br/>Ultimately this reminded of a children's book that was being read to me so I could fall asleep. There is nothing creative or exciting about anything in this. The screenplay (see above reference to a children's book) is tired and used as self reflection of the most immature of minds. A bad bio pic that doesn't know what it's story should be . A so called ""family man"" who only does his murders for the benefit of his family? But he leaves his wife and is upset that his daughter doesn't speak to him anymore? I'm sorry I wasn't able to feel bad for a murderer , how meta critic and the users of this site are giving this a rating in the 8s is just beyond me and has seriously made me reconsider ever reading a review of a movie again. I hope you enjoyed this one"

Uneventful except for a few good Al Pacino moments. Some murder scenes with awful fake cgi blood that sprays walls then doesn't drip.. it just remains still like a photo of blood.. or blood that's already drying. Strange failed de-aging of faces and old man bodies. DeNiro beating people up looked silly. He even fires the guns awkwardly, like hes trying to flick out the bullets. This movie would have been great 25 years ago.. now it's just awkward. Pacino steals the show.. Romano, Keitel, and Canavale were all good but barely in the movie.

","I saw The Irishman at a small movie theater a few weeks before it went on Netflix. The place was packed. I guess like me, all these audience members could not wait to see the most recent film by the great director of, among other movies, Goodfellas and Casino. Well, it finally began, and we all watched. And watched. And watched. Finally, after two and a half (loooong) hours, the movie ended. An older couple in front of me then began a vain attempt to applaud, but they almost immediately stopped when it was clear that no one was going to join in. And then there was silence. And that silence continued as the audience members slowly got up and filed out of the theater. The feeling there was palpable. It was the feeling of disappointment. Pure disappointment."

Here we find the classical themes of a mafia biography spanning from 50s to 70s, the usual wonderful camera work, the maniacal reconstruction of that era.
This is all a Scorsese obsession, like a kid that maniacally wants to go back to his childhood.
The movie is very predictable, to the point that you can easily anticipate each scene. Last but least, casting De Niro as an irish is total crazy."

","I really loved it! Although it goes slowly and smoothly whole the movie and in may not be attractive to new generations somehow, but still, how you could not love it?! (As I'm a new generation,too) The end of the movie and the loneliness which would come to all of us one day, no matter what we've done whole our live is really touching...
however, it's clear as daytime that these kinda movies may not seem impressive to everyone when you see that no any exciting and breathtaking scenes are there. but hey, take it easy about it, this is its own kind and well, to me, it was impressive!
But as criticism to be honest, there are something which may bother you somehow in cases like those few scenes when the screen gets lost for a sec because of changing angels and such, mostly when Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) speaks with phone or something( I don't know if anyone focused on that or not), or you may get confused about the names, cause there're lots of names with different roles which the movie will not introduce them to you and so you have to make a mapping in your mind to see the contracts and connections but totally, that's not much of concern, that's easy if you follow the story whole the time...

The Irishman on the other hand is nothing more than an enjoyable but overlong movie. It looks great and the cast of Hollywood royalty are terrific. The problem is that the story is far too slim to justify three and half hours and in the second half it becomes totally bogged down in the politics of the Teamsters which isn't in truth very interesting. It ends up looking like the director had made up his mind to make a 210 minute film, because that what he is known for, and made the story fit that time frame. That said it is well worth a watch but unlike his earlier films this isn't one I will be returning to anytime soon."

"derbigpr","8","5","10","3 December 2019"," Great, but far from perfect.
","Let me be clear, it's very difficult reviewing this movie without taking into consideration the names in it. There's obviously bias, there has to be. This movie is like an end of an era, and it features all the actors that made that era as amazing as it was. However, it's clear they're all past their prime, and it's clear they're all just a small fraction of what they used to be. Pesci is great, it might actually be his best role ever, unfortunately, he gets relatively little screen time and plays a side-role. Pacino is good, but overacts a lot. De Niro? Oh boy... what did they do to him. I really, really don't like how CGI-heavy this movie looks, and it's pretty obvious when you know how these actors look in person and how old they are, and then compare that to how they look in the movie... BUT DE NIRO, I've seen animated movies in the last few years that seem less CGI than his face. First of all, his eyes are stupidly blue, like...impossibly blue, you've never seen anyone in your life with eyes as blue as his in the movie. Combine that with the fact that almost every scene involving him is a close up (for a reason I'm getting to now), and it's very hard to ignore.<br/><br/>Now... De Niro is 76 years old, but in the movie they attempt to make him look young... and it REALLY, REALLY doesn't work. Any scene with him walking or doing anything but sitting is really awkward. He looks and moves like an old man. His hands and fingers are all deformed like an old mans hands, but he has a CGI face of a 40 year old. His assassinations look awkward, the way he holds the guns, the way he shoots, the way he fights..looks exactly like a 76 year old doing it.<br/><br/>So CGI is pretty badly masking what it's trying to mask... another bad part is the gore. We all know mobster movies are full of blood, and this was no exception. There are plenty of people shot on camera, with blood splattering around, with bullet holes shown from close by, etc. The issue is, THEY ALL LOOK FAKE. BADLY FAKED, bad CGI, like in a low budget film, not a 160 million one.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it's good, it's what you expect from a mobster/political movie, it's slow, long, but doesn't feel like it's dragging. The issue is you know how it's gonna end, and that's always a problem with movies based on a true story.<br/><br/>To conclude, as an homage to these great names, it's a decent send-off. Don't expect a movie like Goodfellas, this ain't it. This is a much darker movie, focused much more on death, on people aging. There's not as much ""mobster romance"" as in other similar movies, it's more a miserable story showing a movie realistic picture of what it's like to be a mobster, rather than focusing on expensive cars, suits, hotels, food, jewellery, etc. It's the most HUMAN of all mobster movies I can think of. Still, it leaves me feeling a tiny bit disappointed, because it's NOT as good as it would have been and could have been had it been filmed 20 years ago. And that's sad. Not only because of the movie, but because of the actors. Watching this makes it hard not to feel like it's a good bye."
"tolunayd22","8","5","10","3 December 2019"," Don't exaggerate!
","A movie with tempo problems. In some parts, editing is accelerating so much that you cannot think and feel what the script means. Looks like it's going right away and something happening. Even this is what Tony is staying at. Some parts are slow. These parts are usually the last scenes of the film. There was an unnecessary attempt to lengthen the film. Robert De Niro's particularly young CGI stands out. Believe in the quality of CGI in the war resembled a game. Other players had no such problems, but Robert De Niro's CGI was a little grin. The story has a beautiful mafia theme. Acting performances are really very successful, quality is officially flowing. Because there are legends everywhere. The quality of the shot is already good, you can tell from the director. The soundtracks is nice, and it's good to use pieces that keep up with the environment. Long story short, I think it is a successful production but I can say that a film is not very perfect.<br/><br/>⭐ 100/85"

","First of all, the de-aging technology in this film is very very distracting and one of the reasons I was put off by it. A video on YouTube improved the de-aging dramatically using free software, also when they're walking or shooting a gun or doing stuff you can see their old bodies and tell they're about 70 years old. Peggy was the worst character in the film, no one ever wronged her and her dad gave her everything since she was a kid and never hit or abused her, protected them and made choices for her and his family, she just had this same stupid look from a kid to a grown up, ungrateful and annoying. Joe Pesci's acting isn't as great and intense as films like Goodfellas, De Niro was De Niro, Al Pacino was great in it, best character in the film for me. The film is a bit long and the story isn't very original nor that interesting. Writing is great for most of it, but there are so many dialogue scenes and so little action scenes, it's not a negative, but the tension and action could've been better. The scene at the end where he's sitting all alone at Christmas is really sad. All in all, it's an ok film, not great, definitely not Martin Scorsese's finest work."
"benarnold-06835","6","5","10","1 December 2019"," Marty misses the mark
","As much as I wanted to love this movie it missed the mark, a last hurrah for such an iconic and masterful film maker which unfortunately feels flat.<br/><br/>I'll start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Mr. Scorsese, especially his early work. The ensemble cast is something dreams are made of but I feel as though the movies success is carried by such legendary names, look past this and you'll find a bloated, lifeless, and flat shadow of a film. As many people have mentioned the CGI is off putting and in many ways contradicts Scorsese's philosophy on film. The actors simply cannot convey the movements of a younger man which is required, this is nothing against them individually but the choices made by Mr. Scorsese.<br/><br/>Going into a Scorsese movie (especially a Scorsese gangster flick) one carries certain expectations, one such expectation is of course a killer soundtrack! Marty was well known for handpicking his soundtracks from his carefully curated collection of 45's and over his career this has become a staple of his movies. To put it blatantly the Irishman's soundtrack is non existent.<br/><br/>Secondly one expects to be hit by that pure cinematic magic that has immortalised the likes of Goodfella's and Casino. In this regards the Irishman felt like a long drawn out slog of information with no real heart and soul. This may be down to the Frankenstein camera rig that was used, nothing beats the brilliance of 35mm and the quality it brings to the screen, the Irishman felt like a TV movie.<br/><br/>My final gripe with the film was perhaps a personal issue, it depressed me immensely. Seeing the greatest actors of their generation wilt in front of my eyes was truly sad. The great Bobby D, Joe Peci, Keitel (underutilized), and Pacino now all old men playing shadows of themselves, it was sad. The thought that we will undoubtedly lose these great actors washed over me at the end of the movie and left me feeling truly sad.<br/><br/>I feel as though this movie is being measured by the weight of the names involved alone (wether positive or negative) and not as a stand alone piece of cinema. Take away ""Directed by Martin Scorsese"" and the movie could be easily overlooked, sure it has the stellar cast but is anyone truly convinced?"

The powerhouse blending of DeNiro, Pesci & Pacino make this Scorsese's Magnum Opus imho. DeNiro adding narration to keep the viewer informed is a great touch and there is humour to offset the brutality. Great performance from Stephen Graham, further enhancing his reputation as one of Britain's best actors.
There are some doubts as to the accuracy of the story, both from Scorsese's interpretation & indeed from Sheeran's own words especially regarding Jimmy Hoffa's demise. You want cast iron facts?

","It is certainly true that expectations must be managed before seeing this film. It does not have the pace, glamour or visceral violence of Goodfellas or Casino. It has a similar theme and certainly similar cast but it's a different movie. This is much more a character study based around friendship, power and loss of power, loyalty and ultimately mortality. And in those themes the movie succeeds spectacularly in many instances but falls short in others.<br/><br/>Of the three lead roles, Joe Pesci, as Russ Bufalino, delivers the best performance of his career and of the movie. Understated but menacing. Powerful but vulnerable. A desire for family and to be loved (heartbreaking with Franks' daughter) but also disconnected and cold. Beautiful to watch.<br/><br/>Pacino also delivers a great performance as Hoffa. Always interesting, skirting the edge of over the top but never crossing it. A portrayal of blindly clinging to power and reputation against all odds and advice.<br/><br/>I had the biggest issue with De Niro. The CGI is a little odd (sometimes making him look like a weird version of Alec Baldwin) and the bakery assault is not convincing at all (a pity as it's pivotal to his family relationship later on). But the main issue was I did not really connect with the character. Unlike Pesci and Pacino, I ultimately didn't really care what happened to his character. The character was just to compliant, too robotic, too disconnected.<br/><br/>The movie is too long, but it didn't have to be any shorter. Instead it needed to use that extra 90 mins to explore some of the fantastic supporting cast and characters which would have ultimately made the movie much stronger at 3 hrs 30 mins.
Harvey Keitel , Ray Romano and Bobby Cannavale are massively underused, so much so their story and involvement becomes a little confused. Stephen Graham lights up the screen every time as Tony Pro but again, his story is curtailed somewhat.
In addition had Franks family, in particular his daughter played by Anna Paquin, not been sidelined for most of the movie, I might have cared a little more about the final 30 mins.<br/><br/>So all in all, I enjoyed it. Beautifully shot as you would expect from Scorsese. Has a strong feeling of authenticity around 60s mafia life and relationships in the 60s and well acted. But a little self indulgent and could have easily been a 10."

","The duration is a long ride, ultimately it is worth it. I am not sure that's the way the story happened, but even if wasn't we'd never know, the movie also makes it clear. They took it with them.<br/><br/>Regardless it is a piece of mastercraft cinema, which has been somewhat lacking as a genre of late, and it makes this film all the more worthwhile and rewatchable.<br/><br/>The acting, cast, theme, cinematography, and direction are truly calibre in its genre and as cinema, and despite the duration are well worth the entire ride. De Niro is at his best, Pesci and Pacino are also stellar. Stephen Graham was memorable. Hopefullly this film gets the recognition it deserves.<br/><br/>Thanks for the entertainment"

","With a 3 hour 29 minute runtime, The Irishman is bound to be at least a little slow, but within that runtime is a wonderfully executed piece of art, which is both brilliantly acted, fantastically directed, and beautifully shot. The cast is off the wall fabulous with the three leads; Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci; obviously being the standouts. With the films impressively long runtime, you think there would be more to say about the film, but truly, not much can be said about the film. The film can be slow and slightly confusing to follow, but in the end proves to be an energetic clever gangster film that knows exactly what it is doing. The script is also wonderfully written, with enough chilling, as well as incredibly interesting, dialogue that seems to carry the film more than enough to make quite an impact. In the end, The Irishman is the end of an era film that will be held as one of the greatest gangster films of this time, and it more than deserves that title.

"Leofwine_draca","10","10","25","29 November 2019"," Nearly as good as the best
","As a massive fan of Scorsese's older gangster movies like GOODFELLAS and CASINO I was eager to see this film, which can be termed a real successor to those all-time classics. While it's not quite on par with those 1990s efforts, it's still a very good and very well made picture that's easily Scorsese's best in the last twenty years or so; a massive improvement over THE WOLF OF WALL STREET and HUGO in any case.<br/><br/>De Niro gives a taciturn performance as the leading gangster and hitman, while Scorsese has done the remarkable job of bringing the great Joe Pesci out of retirement one last time and also stuck the legendary Al Pacino into the picture too. The production values are exemplary and the de-ageing effects more than adequate, although the story takes a little while to get going. The situation with Hoffa really escalates into some powerful moments at the climax. Clearly the work of an older director, this explores themes of regret, violence and ageing with a dark heart at its centre."
"joshbarton15","10","9","22","23 November 2019"," Another masterpiece from Martin Scorsese.
","When it comes to crime epics, there isn't a more go-to director around than Martin Scorsese, his filmography speaking for itself, with the likes of Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed only a few of the classics of the genre he has made spanning a career of over fifty-years. The Irishman doesn't just boast a masterful filmmaker at its helm but a deliriously impressive cast full of frequent Scorsese collaborators such as, Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Joe Pesci and, surprisingly working with Scorsese for the first time, Al Pacino, in its arsenal.<br/><br/>The Irishman chronicles the life of Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a truck driver turned hitman who had ties with the Bufalino family and the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).<br/><br/>Make no mistake, the scale of The Irishman is just about as epic as you can get, Scorsese's film spanning a number of decades and the filmmaker masterfully delivering a surprisingly meditative reflection of both a hitman's life of crime and his own career. Moments feel like they could come straight out of Goodfellas or Casino yet The Irishman is an entirely different beast altogether, slow and calculated in its execution but so engrossing and hard-hitting when it needs to be.<br/><br/>Steven Zallian's screenplay combined with Scorsese's masterful direction ensures The Irishman doesn't overstay its welcome at 209 minutes. Sure, you could say there are scenes that could be cut entirely or shortened however, it's an absolute pleasure to watch this film play out from start to finish, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography and the legendary Thelma Schoonmaker's editing only adding further quality to proceedings.<br/><br/>The method of de-aging has been used a number of times before, most notably within the MCU however, it has never been used to this extent, the majority of this film spent with these actors in their younger years. It honestly did take a while for me to get used to it but it soon becomes seamless and makes the possibility of these actors working together throughout the ages a truly captivating cinematic reality.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Irishman features a mightily impressive cast littered with strong performers but it's the main trio of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci that really are a force to be reckoned with. De Niro is the best he's been in years as Frank Sheeran, his charismatic yet nuanced performance giving the film such a powerful driving force in the lead role. Pacino steals the show as Jimmy Hoffa in what is also his best performance in years, making his first time working with Scorsese an even more special occasion. It's Pesci, brought out of retirement especially for The Irishman, who really caught my eye with a incredibly cold and quietly unsettling performance as Russell Bufalino, a polar opposite to his performance in Goodfellas. Harvey Keitel and Stephen Graham throw their acting weight about accordingly while Anna Paquin does a lot with very few words, a true testament to a performance.<br/><br/>The Irishman hits Netflix soon but I'm so glad I got the chance to watch this masterpiece on the big screen. For that, I'd like to say thanks to the Prince Charles Cinema and, more importantly, Martin Scorsese."
"Brandon902","10","9","22","22 November 2019"," The Perfect Encore
","We can not begin this review by focusing on the previous exemplary performances by everyone involved in past cultivations of brilliance. That would be too easy.<br/><br/>I will try my best to explain, and perhaps illuminate the magic that Scorsese has truly grasped in this wonderfully adapted biopic, without spoilers due to the fact that this is still under limited viewings, and will not be streamable for another 5 days.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is, this film is literally the pinnacle of mafioso, 35mm, fable over action story telling that we may never see again. Scratch that, one of the best films that we will ever experience with the direction film making is going in the next 20 years.<br/><br/>If there is one thing about Scorsese, it is his amazing attention and experiences with the nuances that make all of us click or indulge, not just in the movie, but also adapt to the lifestyle and story that all films hope to pull you into. Scorsese does this trick with absolute ease and magic, like he doesn't even try, like you never had a chance in hell to be able to escape his grip, a tidal wave in a swimming pool, an Italian carving his way into the American dream.<br/><br/>This film has it all. If you've seen Goodfellas specifically, or any of his previous work you already know what I mean. The scores playing in the distance, the silverware clattering on fine china, the density of the wine being poured in real crystal. It is all there and then some.<br/><br/>Cleverly titled The Irishman, surprisingly it's only about one, or two Irishman who was in an Italian landscape in some of the greatest turmoiled times that America has experienced covering many decades. With that being said, a movie for many generations.<br/><br/>My fiancé who is a first generation Italian couldn't believe the language, the accents, the body language that was displayed in a film that could never be anything except a Scorsese masterpiece. I felt the exact same way, even when she was the only person in the cinema who understood some scenes, and me being Irish, some of the smaller forgettable ones.<br/><br/>This film tackled the family dynamic of a toxic situation, of a war veteran who had an unspeakable skill set, and the absolute sorrows that will follow an undesirable life that so many of us may follow based on decisions that we have no internal control over. I doubt the validity of the direction, as I have read ""I Heard You Paint Houses?"" as a teenager, but this didn't matter.<br/><br/>You will be lost, unsure who to vote for, it tackles serious political issues that are still a mystery in the public's conscience. All the while dancing with your emotions of what is right and wrong.<br/><br/>The ending, felt like a eulogy for this form of brilliance and story telling, which I'm not sure was the hardest part. Or was it the realization that this is the top of the mountain performance, that I've seen come out of all involved?<br/><br/>Again, I am completely torn and lost. Time will tell, and that is what this film will leave you with. The realization of time, the bewilderment that cinematic nuances can make you feel like it all slipped away. This ending left me wondering if this was also a climatic approach for Scorsese, Pesci, De Niro, or Pacino finalizing their place in this world with their greatness. I really hope not, because just like the characters involved: time waits for no man, and with that eventually, our legends are all erasable no matter how much good or bad we end up living with. Time will leave all of us empty handed.<br/><br/>Leaving the film with that, I almost would have preferred a snub .32 as soon as I stood up."
"monberger","10","9","22","16 November 2019"," The Irishman is an Epic Masterpiece!!!
","I want to say that 200 and something minutes, was purely entertaining. A movie to become of epic proportions must have a running time of at least more than 120 minutes. The Irishman running time is over 200 minutes. I know some people do not like long movies but let's be real short movies usually feel like they are missing something. they usually luck of story and character development. The Irishman exceeds all that. Magnificent art direction from Scorsese, Al Pacino is just masterful as Hoffa. The three of them Al Pacino, De Niro, Pesci are truly amazing. The last time we had an epic winning best picture was with the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. What year was that? 2003 or other epics like Gladiator or from the '90s like Titanic, Schindler's List, Dances with Wolves, The English Patient, Braveheart, etc. for sure I'm forgetting other epic films. It is about time! The Irishman Surely is an epic film. I don't think This year will be another movie to beat. The Irishman for me is the best picture of 2019. If you like this type of mob films you will love it. Give it a try."
"Ciaran_Clarke99","9","9","22","9 November 2019"," This ain't no theme park, this is Scorsese!!!
","The Irishman is Martin Scorsese's newest film based on the true events of the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa and the book I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt. I haven't read the book yet but this movie was so good I'm considering picking it up like I also did with Goodfellas.<br/><br/>People's main concern with The Irishman is the length and I may be biased since I love the long life of a mobster movies like Once Upon a Time in America but I never felt like the film dragged, it always kept me interested and the non-linear story was never confusing I always knew where I was and what was going on.<br/><br/>This is Robert DeNiro's 9th film with Martin Scorsese and his first time working with him since 1995 in Casino.Now DeNiro is 76 he still completely gives it his all and this is his best performance since 1997's Jackie Brown. Everything between Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci was just enthralling, the dynamic between the characters felt so right, it's hard to example you're just engrossed in the dialogue and world built around these characters and Joe Pesci coming out of retirement for this movie was probably the best decision he could have made as this is my favourite Joe Pesci performance. I loved Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa doing a sort of similar performance to his character in Heat and despite the fact that he doesn't have many lines Harvey Keitel gives a great performance as the brooding Don Corleone type of character. Something I've heard quite frequently is that Anna Paquin as Peggy doesn't have enough lines and I'm just going to say that her silence is what tears Frank (Robert DeNiro's character) apart especially when they are watching on the news about the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa and she stares at him in silence as she knows fully well that Frank killed Hoffa and he just has to sit there as he losses his daughter.<br/><br/>A main part in the production of this film was the digital de-aging used through out the majority of the film and to my surprise it looked really well and never took me out of the experience, expect for one point when he beats up the grocery store worker for pushing his daughter it is so clear that it's just a young mans face on an old mans body.<br/><br/>While watching it's so clear that Martin Scorsese was trying to re-encapsulate his golden days with Goodfellas and Casino and that isn't necessarily a bad thing but mainly the thing that stood out to me was the sound track, it was just too similar to the Goodfellas sound track and occasionally when watching Robert DeNiro all i could think of was Jimmy Conway.<br/><br/>The Irishman was a brilliant return to form of Scorsese that kept me entertained at all times and is currently my favourite film of 2019 and I doubt any other film will change that. It was just another cinematic masterpiece from Scorsese"
"thesar-2","4","6","13","30 December 2019"," Got 3½ Hours to Kill?
","Nice to see the old gang back. Now, retire.<br/><br/>Like war movies, I view highly acclaimed/recommended gangster films once and though I usually like them, I never want to see them again. I saw Saving Private Ryan once and thought: That was good, but I never want to see it again. (Same with Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now.) Also fits with The Godfather Parts I and II - saw those as a teenager and for my remaining 30 years, I have no interest in revisiting them.<br/><br/>When it comes to this gang of misfit besties, I've seen Goodfellas once (again, I liked it and shelved it for the rest of my days) and Casino. In that latter film's case, I've actually seen that many times since, well, I love Sin City and believe what they told me - mostly in narration - to be true. Since I'm not a gangster-film lover, but casinos are by bag, Scorsese's Casino remains as my favorite gangster/mob film and I've bought it when available on multiple formats and will watch it a few more times before I pass.<br/><br/>The Irishman has been recommended to me from at least 6 people. Not sure why. Despite all I told you above, this movie is JUST okay. Take away the painful...regrettable 209 minutes (or 3½ hour runtime,) it was slow as hell and I would've really dug a 2-hour cut of this.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The direction at times is fantastic. It was Scorsese at his finest. But, only at times. And the acting, wonderful. Aside from Pacino, I 100% felt these characters were genuine. And the cinematography and special effects of aging/de-aging these actors was top notch.<br/><br/>But, after a while, it felt all so drawn out, I counted the minutes and played games on my phone as it droned on only stopping to read when some people got knocked off. Not only were the years 1979-1981 bad for mobsters, I would've preferred to see those stories.<br/><br/>I guess the entire three and a half film can be summed up with: A nobody stumbles into the Mob's grace and eventually becomes besties with Jimmy Hoffa only to have to make a tough, loyalty decision years later.<br/><br/>The first hour is fast paced, wonderfully directed/shot and gets me involved. Not to mention it reminded me of Scorsese/De Niro/Pesci's golden years in the 80s/90s. Unfortunately, Hour 2 slows down a bit, Hour 3 drags and during the last half hour, I counted the seconds.<br/><br/>Funny, the biggest thing on my mind was the controversy over Anna Paquin's minimal lines. That kept me going and what to look for in the last third. It did NOT live up to the hype.<br/><br/>And neither did the movie. For me, anyways.<br/><br/>If you LOVE gangster/mob tales, especially with De Niro, Pesci and Scorsese on board, oh, I'm sure you'll love this reunion. It was interesting, I'll admit, for I didn't know that much about Hoffa. But, as I stated above: will I ever want to see this again?<br/><br/>Hell, no.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Try not to start your film at the end of someone's life. I know that's Scorsese's M.O. Both Goodfellas and Casino tell you who lives throughout the feature in the opening act. Same here. So...where's the tension with your main characters? But, who am *I* to tell the Avenger-hater how to craft a movie?"

Its long run time has perfect pace, but don't go expecting the roller coaster ride of Goodfellas or Casino, this echoes classics like The Godfather's and Once Upon A Time in America's pacing with the feel of JFK to name a few.<br/><br/>It's poignant, funny and the violence boldly plays second fiddle to the characters and their relationships. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci are on fine form along with Harvey Keitel (whose screentime is limited) with their ageing special effects holding up for the most part (Pacino looks a little off at times). A casual viewer probably wouldn't notice as they age from the 1950s onwards, it touches on many periods with great recreations.<br/><br/>For completion, it's only crime is not including Ray Liotta and Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

This is classic Scorsese and frankly (pardon the pun), one of his very best. I loved every moment. DeNiro is still at the top of his game... raw and real. Pacino hasn't been this over the top since Scent of a Woman... truly a master at work as Hoffa and the real take away from it all is that Pesci may have ""retired"" from acting but you'd never know it. His intensity is legendary and absolutely remarkable. Scorsese is and always has been my favorite director and this film reaffirms that feeling in every way.

"tigertahir","10","6","13","1 December 2019"," ""I HEARD YOU PAINT MASTERPIECES""
","It is a master in complete control of his craft, it's Scorsese at the top of his game. Scorsese's recent magnum opus of mob genre is the best film experience I've had this year.<br/><br/>Film Starts with iconic Scorsese tracking shot though the hallway of and Old Folks Care centre, and at the end of it we see and aged Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is sitting in a wheelchair. This is the story of this Irishman spread over several decades, Frank was a WWII veteran who fought in Italy, that is why he speaks Italian and that's why he's merciless when killing people. Frank narrates his story that goes back to 1950s when he was working as a truck driver, delivering meat, but then he started stealing it for a local gangster. This eventually drops him into the orbit of Russel Buffalino (Joe Pesci), who is a national level mobster, a soft spoken Mafia don who is part of a body that controls Philadelphia. Russel tries to be a good person, but he's a person who will scare you by just talking. After Sheeran proves his worth as friend and Hitman for Bufalino, he eventually meets Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Frank forms this enduring bond with Hoffa over the years, and he becomes Hoffa's confident, his go to person. Hoffa makes this bond with Sheeran's family especially his daughter Pegy who for some reason is scared of Bufalino, she just can't look at him properly, but with Hoffa it's different, there's love and respect for each other between them. But then tension starts building up between Hoffa and Bufalino and things start going south for everyone especially Frank.<br/><br/>The Irishman is masterclass in terms of story telling, the film is dark, brutal, gritty but somehow manages to be funny at times. Scorsese allowed his character to not fight and kill all the time, they sit they talk and just stay quiet at times. It has iconic Scorsese violence, people get shot in the face so many times that you'll not be able to keep the count. It is a master dealing things with full control, he gets the best of his actors and performance are absolutely breathtaking. Robert De Niro being Robert De Niro, he's just at so ease when acting, he's been in some pathetic movies lately but The Irishman is a proof that De Niro is not an actor for films like Dirty Grandpa, this is what he's made for. Al Pacino is known for roles when he's yelling at the top of lungs, when he's angry or when he's showing extreme emotion, full of passion, that is what he's doing as Jimmy Hoffa. He's fierce as Jimmy Hoffa. Joe Pesci is although playing a character totally opposite of his reputation. He's quite and terrifying, he's a guy you don't want any trouble with. He will kill you and then will go on with his normal life like nothing happened, he's that cold, and Joe Pesci is astonishingly good as Russ Bufalino. When the film is into its final act, these are the moment so priceless it's hard to put in words. The tension is built with impeccable camera work, Scorsese just suddenly cuts the background music and there's complete silence in the background and De Niro and Pacino are acting like it is their last time, few words more expression, and then The Irishman becomes an instant classic.<br/><br/>A film for the ages, you will love it and cherish it for years to come. Thanks to Netflix and producers for putting their 160 Millions into this project. Go watch The Irishman because this is a collaboration we might never see happening again, EVER!"

","Martin Scorsese did it again,he released another astonishing movie about betrayel and mob familly but this time we can see Al Pacino playing in a Scorsese movie for the first time.
I have to say that ""The Irishman"" is definitely not the best mafia movie ever made,""Godfather"" being the best and its followed by ""Goodfellas"".So this make this movie the 3rd best movie of the genre.
I really loved Joe Pesci in this movie,I think it's beyond amazing for an actor who's retired to come back after some time for a complex role like Pesci has and to nailed it.
As for Rober De Niro and Al Pacino,they make you speechless because of the strong relationship the actors have behind the scenes and as the characters they play.
Another great thing that Martin Scorsese nailed it,besides the fantastic score and story,is the CGI effects for Al Pacino,Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro.I never seen an entire movie based on De-aging characters.We saw some few scenes with this CGI effecs in Star Wars and Marvel but not like we've seen in this movie.
What I didn't liked too much but I got used to it where the blue eyes effects for Robert De Niro character,it sometimes made the CGI effects look weird or that it was something wrong with the special effects but I wasn't too distracted by this issue and I know that the blue eyes were supposed to make De Niro look more like a irishman.
If I would have to decide for the best mafia movie between The Goodfellas and The Irishman,I would choose The Goodfellas because of the astonishing dialogue between the characters and for the way the female characters are well made in that movie.
As a 2019 movie,""The Irishman"" is the 2nd best movie from this year,""Joker"" being the best one.
Another thing that I would want to add is the fact that the Martin Scorsese's films are evolving way better than the ones that Quentin Tarantino has.No offense to Tarantino but his last film Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is almost good,not great or a masterpiece and it also has some boring scenes.
Overall,""The Irishman"" is :one of the best movies that Martin Scorsese made in the years of his career,that has a fantastic story as well as an amazing cast whose performances are very complex and well made by one of the best directors of the world(Martin Scorsese)."
"temaTorn14185","10","6","13","30 November 2019"," Stunning film

","This is going to be short, as you've seen it all before, and although it was enjoyable, I couldn't get passed the fact, that the characters always looked or acted oddly in almost every scene. I was constantly trying to work out what was wrong. Was it the CGI ageing that made the faces look odd and move strangely, or the characters moving like old men, even when they were meant to be so much younger, they were sooo stiff.<br/><br/>I know this is much less a movie review than a critique of technique, but as someone who loves the genre, it ruined it for me, by making it unbelievable."

"novacasa42","10","6","13","28 November 2019"," A Masterpiece.
","A fine curated piece of art, that's what Scorsese put before our eyes, he brought out everything in his arsenal of skills, every move is calculated to the teeth, every work is accounted for, it never skips a beat, it comes packaged in a smart setup which is not surprising with a director like Scorsese, in its over three hour runtime, not a single second is wasted, every little thing meant something, every frame worked towards the story, whether it's a one-second still or a ten minutes sequence, everything clicks here.<br/><br/>The performances, my god, where should I start? everyone brought their A-game and some more, the whole cast was infinitely charismatic, but the lead trio, De Niro, Pesci, Pacino were just phenomenal, true masters of their trade, absolute strong presence, when they're on-screen, you're tuned in, not by choice, they just demand that of you, it's just fascinating for me to see a long sequence rich in dialogue between arguably the best two actors alive, the back and forth here is everything but acting, it is too real, that's how astounding they are, Pesci again, in my opinion, delivers so relentlessly as he always does, and when on-screen he takes control, he commands, not even De Niro can match his level, he just has this thing, it's unbelievable.<br/><br/>Scorsese always referred to Cadillacs as the top of the industry, well this film is a Cadillac, it has endless class, I feel privileged and honored to have watched this, something that history will hail its cult status in years to come, A Marvelous MASTERPIECE."
"Gunsjoe","10","6","13","27 November 2019"," Classic Scorsese!
","I cant believe what I saw after looking at the man in his Seventies responsible for it. Among that famous group of 1970's directors including George Miller, Spielberg, etc, Scorsese's style has the most staying power. This fact is on display in this movie.<br/><br/>I cant think of a bad thing about this movie. Scorsese's last movie - ""Silence"" was my favorite movie that year. This one is my favorite this year. Don't worry about the running time; you wont feel it.<br/><br/>My best movie experiences are those that feel so real that I feel i'm participating in the movie rather than being a bystander. Like Silence, this one did that to me. I felt I was there - in the screen. There's nothing about this that I don't absolutely Love.<br/><br/>Scorsese has shown what a sharp head he still has on that aging shoulders. The Cast was great, I mean, how can you go wrong with this star power right? The camera work and the sound also contribute greatly to the immersion you get.<br/><br/>I'm really grateful to Netflix for making this movie a reality. Think about it - with all the recent social message movies flooding Hollywood these days, do you think this movie would have been green lit given its running time and its overall theme?"
"goldi-38533","3","8","19","3 December 2019"," Disappointing
","I don't understand the 9-10 star reviews here. Scorsese is better than this overlong, drawn out, too much dialogue (except notably for Anna Paquin) and too much voice-over effort at the gangster genre. Just dull and plodding. And I agree with the comments that point out the incongruous movements of older actors playing much younger characters - de-aging does NOT help here! It's embarrassing. And Pesci referring to DeNiro as ""kid"" when they meet? Who's kidding who here. Extremely disappointing!"

","A brand new epic gangster drama that more than deserves its long screen time, The Irishman is a pure masterpiece, a film that will stay with me for a long time. What an acting performance by Pacino, De Niro and Pesci. Martin Scorsese's well-known themes can be seen again with a gripping, funny and profound effect. The music is simply brilliant, what i say? Phenomenal!!<br/><br/>It is a historical and fascinating story that you have to the watch concentrate and not in episodes, in addition you must understand the history around Hoffa. I felt a lot of atmosphere from several Mafia films like; Goodfellas, Casino, The Godfather. I also sometimes thought of Quentin Tarantino's Once upon a time in Hollywood. Pacino reminded me even a little of his role as Michael Corleone and Tony Montana. Sometimes there are some slow / silent moments in between, which are perfect, especially the last half hour, but those minutes are worth it because the acting is brilliant. I was in shock when Frank killed Hoffa out of nowhere. However, the film cannot really be compared with Goodfellas as many people thought. Its a stand-alone classic, and for sure one of the best Scorsese movies ever. Scorsese can be proud. Good job in terms of de-aging. The 210 minutes flew by. I'm a happy person!"
"ritera1","7","8","19","12 November 2019"," Been there, done that.

Many times.<br/><br/>Sure, genres do repeat themselves several times. But not as succinctly as here.<br/><br/>Within the many engaging vignettes, there really wasn't a driving force in the very long 3.5 hours. Amusing to see brain-dead mobsters talk all that brain-dead mobster stuff. But been done to death: Suits. Cussing. Killing each other. Got it. No insight into that horrid lifestyle. The effects of such, but nothing how they could consider it the norm.<br/><br/>The de-aging was not as bad as I expected and heard of. But it wasn't impressive. Looks very animated and didn't get deNiro down under looking 45, even when he was suppose to be in his 20s. Seems like it'd make more sense to use deep fake with images of deNiro young. Not like there's ain't plenty. The message was that deNiro was used to killing in WWII, but was only depicted in one quick scene. (And why'd he have the two Germans get out of the hole when they'd be in there anyway?)<br/><br/>If you must, be very aware of the 3.5 hours, as it feels like 3.5 hours.<br/><br/>And this also brings up the perplexing state of affairs at Netflix. They're $12 billion in debt and think that sinking $159M into this will make them money? Prestige? I'm lost."

They earned that title through a career of heading up ""classic"" and ""masterpiece"" level movies that are among the greatest of all time.<br/><br/>No ""young"" actor alive today is anywhere close to their level for this genre. This isn't like placing DeNiro in the Godfather II since DeNiro was far out of the league of today's young actors when he was a young actor in the late 70s and early 80s. Today's crop of snowflake metrosexuals could never play dominant, masculine, testosterone-driven ""men"" like these guys, guys with balls of steel who you believe. Maybe their high-pitched, estrogen-laden voices could somehow convince the viewer they were a ""boss"", but it would be the same viewers who can't wait until James Bond is played by a female, which is fitting since real manly actors don't even exist anymore.<br/><br/>But besides the fun banter, nobody could play these legend roles other than these legends themselves, and no ""young"" actors could even come close to carrying their weight for these heavy parts."

Although the duration of the movie is very extense (209 min = 3h 30m), it makes the whole experience worth it by the end of the film. Anyways, I'm not lover of long films, so that's a factor that I personally did not like of this movie.

","Believe the hype! Scorsese has crafted an epic masterpiece of monumental proportions. This sprawling epic takes on The Godfather as the greatest mob movie of all time and honestly I like Irishman more. Full of breathtaking technology and powerful performances by everyone involved, this film will leave you in awe of the masterclass in acting that is present. Robert DeNiro gives another career defining performance, which given his pedigree is a hell of a statement, but true nonetheless.<br/><br/>The real stars here though are Al Pacino who is on fire as Jimmy Hoffa, giving one of his best performances in 30 plus years.<br/><br/>Then there is the ever amazing Joe Pesci, who thankfully agreed to return to acting for this role as his every move in this film will have you in a trance.<br/><br/>I predict both Pacino and Pesci will be nominated for Best Supporting Actor with it being a 50/50 shot at either winning. I think at this point any of Supporting nomination will just be a space-filler as it comes down to these two. (Sorry Mr. Hanks)<br/><br/>As for the de-aging technology that was made famous by Marvel, it is flawless In this film. I spent my time trying to catch some hint of cgi and yet there was none. It literally feels as if you are watching them in that era of their lives.<br/><br/>Essentially what I am getting at is this is a modern masterpiece. Not only is this the best movie of the year. But this is the best movie in decades. Every single person is on their A-game and it shows. Does the film run long at times? Yes, but at this point Scorsese has earned the right to make a 7 hour movie if he pleases, and even after 3 and a half hours I still found myself not wanting it to end.<br/><br/>The hype is real and this movie needs to be seen.<br/><br/>If you can make it to a theater showing it, you definitely should as it demands to be seen on the big screen, otherwise check it out November 27th on Netflix."

Like when Frank first meets Russel. It's more like watching a cut scene from GTA. It just doesn't work. They would've done a better job if they just cast someone younger. Like given young DeNiro wasn't in it for that long, they could've stuck a younger bloke in there and then used VFX for the later DeNiro.<br/><br/>Aside from all this, I think it was a good representation of the story of Jimmy Hoffa. Especially given I didn't know about it until watching the film. But as we already know from Raging bull, the wolf of Wall Street, goodfellas. Scorsese seems to shine at true stories.

The real Frank Sheeran was very pale and the typical Irish look. Other than that, De Niro did a very good job despite being older than the character he was portraying.

"Mohican15","7","3","5","5 January 2020"," ""Three And A Half Hours Of My Life I'll Never Get Back!""
","I can probably sum this film up in about three words: overlong, grim and boring.<br/><br/>My family will tell you I'm a big Scorsese fan (Goodfellas is one of my absolute favourites!) but I was really disappointed by his latest directive outing. The genius behind Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and The King Of Comedy (to name a few) has presented us with a monotonous slug of a film: The Irishman.<br/><br/>I got a big kick out of seeing my acting heroes (DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino, Keitel...) doing what they're best at doing and the attention to set detail was spot on (as always with Scorsese) but apart from that, I found little to like about The Irishman.<br/><br/>The CGI was passable; I didn't think it was great but I didn't think it was terrible. The main problem (for me) was that DeNiro is trying to sound like 30-year old with the voice of a nearly 80-year old.<br/><br/>As someone who's read Charles Brandt's I Heard You Paint Houses (the book that the film is based on), I was really struck by how much story Scorsese and Zaillian left out of the script and film. Almost all of Frank Sheeran's young life is glossed-over and people who don't know who Jimmy Hoffa was will be left almost none the wiser. If you really want to know who Jimmy Hoffa was and want to see a film about him that is both gripping and moving, I'd recommend Dany DeVito's Hoffa (1992). The film is not only shorter (by a whole hour and a half) but holds a cast that actually resembles the real people they're based on. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with The Irishman's cast but Al Pacino resembles none of Hoffa's characteristics or mannerisms. Jack Nicholson on the other hand is a virtual carbon copy of Hoffa's restless, volatile nature and squat, bulldog features.<br/><br/>If this film were a piece of music, it would be a funeral dirge. The usual excitement of a Scorsese narrative is replaced with a prosaic confession spread-out over three and a half hours. It's not soulful or meaningful but dry and barren of any emotion. Maybe that's what Scorsese intended but when I sit down for a three hour film, I intend to be moved and gripped. The Irishman did neither. My advice? Watch Hoffa instead!<br/><br/>But what do I know? ""I'm an average nobody, get to live the rest of my life like a schnook""."
"Brakathor","8","3","5","2 January 2020"," Another Scorcese Classic. The Last In A Trilogy? Let's Take A Look At The Legacy.
","There's no denying that Martin Scorcese has made a lot of good films. You'd have to be a pompous windbag to say otherwise; looking at you, Peter Greenaway. That being said, to date he's only made three truly great films, in my opinion, and The Irishman is one of them. Taxi driver is a very good film, but it's also very raw, idealistic, and in so many ways, more of a reactionary statement piece, than an example of supreme storytelling. Travis Bickle is a bit of a caricature, and as such, the plot develops in a very contrived way. In short, Taxi Driver, Cape Fear, Shutter Island, The Departed, etc. are all good films, but I have major problems with all of them. The Irishman, I have very few major problems with. Again, good vs. great.<br/><br/>You may disagree, but to my opinion, Goodfellas is by far Scorcese's signature work. This is where he found the winning formula in biography crime dramas. All three of his entries in this genre are tight, concise, strongly character driven, and led by a masterful down to earth realism, which never feels the need to delve into over-the-top gross-out scenes, and no other living director has been able to achieve the same level of greatness in this sub-genre. In short, films like The Irishman are what he was put on this earth to make. After Goodfellas came Casino, my personal favorite in the trilogy, and very underappreciated, in my opinion. The Irishman may in fact be my second favorite Scorcese movie to date.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the corporate side of these dramas, and for that reason, Goodfellas just never resonated with me. Objectively speaking however, I have to say Goodfellas is probably the better movie. The pacing was just so on point, and you have far more standout scenes. If I have to crown a winner of the three, it has to be Casino, and I say this while trying to remain objective. It was by far, the more dynamic movie with Sharon Stone's character, Lester Diamond, Don Rickles, Joe Pesci the classic Italian mafioso hothead, and the country locals: so many conflicting powers and unique characters all battling over the same terrain and wealth. It was just so much the perfect cast and perfect landscape for an almost perfect film. That being said, how does the Irishman measure up?<br/><br/>A lot of people have said the Irishman is too slow paced, and the truth is, yes, the first hour of the movie does drag. When the movie really comes to life is when we're introduced to Jimmy Hoffa. Al Pacino by far steals the show, and manages to create the more compelling character of the cast. He worked a lot on the accent and mannerisms of the character, to the point where yes, you're still watching classic yelling bellicose Pacino, but it's an undeniably distinct character you've never seen before, who's so subtly nuanced in a way that conveys both a level of humility and meekness in the same breath as being hugely arrogant and bombastic. It's a truly brilliant performance which I think is what largely sells the movie, and is one of many major components that elevates The Irishman from coming across as a swansong from an aging director looking for one last major hit.<br/><br/>The question now is how do the other actors measure up? Joe Pesci's portrayal is well handled and well honed, in a way that you would only expect from a veteran actor; however, the first hour of the film, the reason why it drags, I think comes down to the fact that none of the characters up until Al Pacino's character, were compelling enough to be the driving force of the film. To my opinion, and this may be controversial, but I think Robert Deniro was hugely miscast in this film, and yeah I get it, Scorcese badly wanted to put together the legacy cast, and the title character was the most logical role if Deniro was going to be in this film, but to my opinion, to a small extent he's really not the actor that he once was; there was no need to highlight it, i.e. he would have been GREAT in a supporting role, and the title role called for someone a lot more brooding.<br/><br/>When I think of an actor like Lawrence Tierney, just as one preliminary example, THAT'S exactly who ""the Irishman"" was meant to be. I mean come on, who honestly really takes Deniro for being Irish? ""Ayyy wadaya want? I'm Irish, badabing badaboom."" Granted it's not QUITE on the level of Christopher Lee as Fu Manchu, but I can't deny that it was glaring enough to take me out of the movie more than a few times. That's a problem, and I say all of this in the context of having seen Deniro convincingly pull off being a subtle-spoken Jew in ""Casino."" Al Pacino worked a lot on his character to give him a middle America feel, whereas Deniro came across as a generic Guido gangster; it's as simple as that, a comparison that's both convenient and valuable. Most of all, you want to feel like there's something more on the other side of this deeply brooding character, something to build your anticipation during the first part of the film, but it just isn't there.<br/><br/>Another solution might have been to expand on Pesci's character during the first part of the film, and give him a couple scenes where he can really shine, rather than remain the mysterious power figure with an underdeveloped backstory. Again, it's a great movie, but ultimately I think the criticisms of the first part of the film being too slow-paced have some objective truth behind them. The titular character is just not as compelling as he could have been. You've also got to say that maybe Scorcese overestimated the power of anti aging technology just a bit, and the better route to take might have been to cast Deniro as old Sheeran and bring in another actor to play young Sheeran.<br/><br/>In the end though, when things get going, and you find yourself deeply immersed into the politics of the thing, here it very clearly becomes a true contender in Scorcese's body of work, with many standout scenes, all involving Jimmy Hoffa, aside from the fish scene, which in and of itself was brilliant. Keep in mind, all my criticisms thus far involve comparing Scorcese with Scorcese, which honestly boils down to a lot of nit picking for the sake of conversation. If this was the movie of a young new director, I'd be reviewing it in a much different context. I definitely thought the movie was great, more than just a swansong, which was my biggest fear coming into this. The question now is, will there be another? I don't think so, and I don't think there needs to be. This is it, and it's as close to the ultimate gangster movie that Scorcese always wanted to make. There was Goodfellas which was new and fresh; Casino, which presented a slight evolution, and now the Irishman which presents a bit of a de-evolution back to Goodfellas without feeling fresh.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie does feel stale to a degree, largely because of the legacy cast. That's not necessarily a detractor to a new audience, it just signifies a lack off separation between the past and present, and to a greater extent, a lack of evolution. This indeed was a major concern that Joe Pesci had going into this, the main reason why it was actually a bit difficult to finally get him to agree to do it, and yeah I have to say that his concerns were somewhat justified. Would it have felt stale if a new actor was brought in to play young Sheeran, similar to casting fresh-faced Ray Liotta as the starring character in Goodfellas? I think there's a good chance not, and ultimately this would have been the bolder move to take. Again, I can't stress enough how bringing in actors like Sharon Stone, Don Rickles and James woods helped give the film ""Casino,"" such a unique feel.<br/><br/>More than anything, what ""The Irishman"" represents is a re-enactment and medley of everything that worked in the past, and worked well. Either way, regardless of all the ""what ifs"" and ""could haves"" that you can bring up, Deniro is back, starring in a classic gangster role, and you're still glad to see him, even if he feels a little out of place. It's a good screenplay, and overall well put together, but it is well over three hours long, and in the end, movies this long always run the risk of becoming tedious midway through. In my opinion, Pacino deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor here, as a large part of the film's sustainability for a broader audience through those three hours, rests largely on the shoulders of his performance.<br/><br/>Personally I don't get that held up over the subtleties of an actor's performance. Everything I've spoken to in this regard boils down to what I view as either missed opportunities or resounding successes. All it comes down to is the difference between good and great, and there's simply no point in reviewing a Scorcese film unless you're ready to put the film to the test in defining both those terms with elements of the film itself. The Irishman, the ultimate gangster movie with the ultimate gangster cast is not perfect, but it is by far, more great than good."

","9 + 1/2 out of a perfect 10 score.<br/><br/>I saw The Irishman in Washington D.C. yesterday in a packed theater. A sold out Sunday morning at 11am showing. I bought my tickets in advance because I've heard the stories of shows selling out and tickets selling on stubhub for as high at $200 each. (because of the extremely limited theater run)<br/><br/>I'll skip all the details about how awesome it is to see a film in such an exquisite cinema house as landmark E street. I'll skip how much fun it was to sit there right next to the capital and the white house watching a movie about people who shaped the history inside those buildings. I'll skip explaining how fun it was to travel hundreds of miles and watch this in a place filled with avid, smart and excited cinema fans.<br/><br/>The film had so much hype about it, that I was a little worried it would not live up to said hype... So I was ready for anything (including disappointment)<br/><br/>What I got for my $24 matinee ticket was 3 and 1/2 hours of total Scorsese immersion. This isn't ""Goodfellas part 2"". This isn't ""Casino the follow up"" This is its own film. While the faces on the screen are the same, the characters are different. And EVERY ONE INVOLVED came and brought their A-game!!!!<br/><br/>Seriously..... the pace was pretty quick for 3 1/2 hours. and you get a lot of info shoved at you in that amount of time. The sensory overload is incredible. It really was impossible to take it all in and comprehend everything to a few paragraph summary untill a good 24 hours later. The more you sit and ponder what you saw on the screen, the more you fall in love with this film.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil a second of this. But you GOTTA GO SEE THIS IN A THEATER! SPARE NO EXPENSE! YOU WILL REGRET NOT DOING SO!<br/><br/>For the past 24 hours I've tried to come up with any reason not to call this the finest achievement in Martin Scorsese history. I keep trying to tell my self reasons why I can't call this the greatest film ever made. But the more I ponder what I saw in those 3 1/2 hours, I seem to be losing reasons to say this isn't the most important epic film ever produced. How can anyone compare Iconic pictures with one being better than another? the moment you say ""Raging bull"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""FIll in the Blank"" is better than ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Citizen Kain"" or ""FIll in the Blank"" you subjectively enter into a realm of thought that is only opinion based upon your own likes and desires of what is great film making.<br/><br/>My only complaint and the reason I give this film a 9 and 1/2 star rating out of a perfect 10, is that there was no 10-minute INTERMISSION in the middle of the film.<br/><br/>Come on, Gone with the wind, The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, It's a mad mad mad mad world, Woodstock, all had an intermission. Why should anyone be forced to have to miss a second of this amazing film in lieu of a bathroom break? every last second is important in this masterpiece ... It HAS TO BE SEEN ON A BIG SCREEN.<br/><br/>DO your self a favor. travel, or do whatever you have to to see this film. It was a life-changing event for myself. A fan of Scorsese and a fan of perfection made cinema.
Again I'm not going to say it was the greatest film ever produced, but I really can't say it isn't."

","When you read my review for ""The Irishman"", please keep in mind that I am not a big fan of gangster movies nor am I a huge fan of director Martin Scorsese. It's not that I think the movies are terrible and I know that Scorsese is a great director...but I never would have even seen the film had it not been featured at the Philadelphia Film Festival this past October.<br/><br/>The film is a very long saga about the live of Frank Sheeran, a real life mobster who brutally murdered quite a few people. At about 3.5 hours, the story did keep my interest...though I do think about 30 minutes could have been shaved off the story. This is my only complaint about the film....and it's minor. On the plus side, while the film is very violent, it's not as intensely violent as some of Scorsese's other pictures....though it's hardly in the category of his brilliant flop, ""Hugo""!"

We also see how he reminisces his greatest hits as well as the mysterious disappearance of his friend, Jimmy Hoffa in 1975.<br/><br/>We also get to see great acting. De Niro carried the film with his narration and performance as Frank Sheeran. No question that Pacino was a great scene stealer as Jimmy Hoffa. As for Pesci, he was also worthy of mention as the head of the crime family in Russell Bufalino. It was amazement on how the three exhibited a lot of ease in their performances.<br/><br/>Finally, the direction was also worthy of mention as it provided an interesting story from beginning to end. Added to that, we also see a different buffet of Scorsese elements in most of his great movies.

","America's most over-regarded purveyor of middle-brow dreck churns out another pile of celluloid blarney.
If you can look past the attempt to turn a couple of septuagenarians into young go-getters, the first half-hour of this movie is sorta compelling. Heck, I was just happy to see Pesci back on the screen after an eternity away.
But once the movie starts to focus on that worthless slimeball Jimmy Hoffa, to the exclusion of any subplots, this becomes one of the most turgid movies I've suffered through in a long time. Nobody under the age of 50 knows who Hoffa was, much less cares that he's buried under the endzone at Giants Stadium.
After a while I alternated between looking at my watch and wondering whether DeNiro's alien eyes were due to contact lenses or special effects. Either way, he looks like a character who wandered over from Avatar.
The scene at the awards ceremony where DeNiro as Paddy McSheen - or whatever his name was - and Pacino as Hoffa stand face-to-face and keep repeating, ''this is it"" or ''it is what it is,"" or ''is this it,"" ad nauseam, my goodness, shoot me.
I'm no longer surprised Scorcese couldn't get this garbage distributed in theatre chains. It's obvious now that he plotzed it into three arthouse theatres where nobody would see it over a holiday weekend, and then sold it to the s3ckers at Netflix. THEN had the audacity to go on a media tour where the gullible media peddled the narrative that he'd planned it this way all along and somehow this was breaking new ground in how movies are watched.

Except for one fundamental difference, the funny moments are not solely cynical but more vivid and genuine. This indicates the direction scorsese follows with this movie: he wants to make something more grown up and mature. It is in fact a testimonial of someone who did horrible things in his life, that will naturally haunt him in his late years.<br/><br/>And for the first time, marty actually shows us those late years in a manner, that is truly emotional and disturbing.<br/><br/>His pacing is purposefully slow at times, so that in the end, you can have the same melancholic look-back at franks past and indulge in his misery.<br/><br/>I loved it and I'm going to rewatch it on a slow, silent, melancholic winter night..."

","This film was a surprisingly subdued character study. Yes it's a mob film, but it's not about the mob, it's about the characters, Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran (Robert De Niro), Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), and Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). There's a lot of subtle character development, and a lot of context is provided to understand the characters and the point of the story, hence the 3 and a half hour runtime. But all that context is necessary, and every scene was necessary so I believe the runtime is justified. This film honestly feels like a novel, it's not a story about one topic, it's a story that encompasses one man's entire life. The writing is superb, the directing and cinematography are fantastic, the acting is top notch, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and especially Joe Pesci. It was so good to see him back in a film because he's pretty much retired at this point, but Scorsese convinced him to come back for one last film and I'm so glad we got one more amazing performance from this legend. He's so subtle, quiet, and yet very threatening, like he's going to have your entire family murdered if you cross him.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is one of my favorite filmmakers, he's very inspirational to me, and into his 70s, not only has this guy not had a misstep yet, but he's still making top quality films this late in his career.

","I can't explain how good it feels to see an old-fashioned, good, honest 'film' again.
The true art-form of the category realized. A real story told with heart, soul, and without shoving PC jargon down my throat. No agenda's here. Just showing human beings for what they are - real people with shortcomings and downfalls. More interestingly yet again - exposing what the real world and what real world power is - based on corruption and scandal. Everyone remembers JFK for his greatest speeches. Few care to realise that he, like every politician, was shrouded by corruption and nepotism. And people now are angry at Trump because he won't show you his tax returns! As if the rest of politicians are saints. If that's all you've got to worry about, I'd say you're doing alright.<br/><br/>It's clever, and it's funny, and engaging, genuine, and sparks emotion. There are cameos and nods to the classics. The performances are only outclassed by the absolutely flawless direction. Flawless. This is direction perfection. This is what Todd Philips and all the other 'wannabe artsy' hacks need to look up and take notice - and learn something - from. What a shame to think how incredible Joker would have been if Marty had taken the reigns, rather than the totally unbelievable, mis-characterisation garbage of a borefest we got from Joker.<br/><br/>It is long - a good 40 minutes or so - but knowing it's made for Netflix, it's entirely understandable why Marty decided to tow the line there.<br/><br/>Forget Goodfellas. This is truly Godfather-esque in its storytelling ability and scope. Like Once Upon A Time, this is truly a nod to real films and storytelling of the past, and it's a crying shame that this will potentially be one of the last true films of its kind, ever to be made - just like Once Upon A Time.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see this in an actual movie theatre - with curtain, dress circle and all - and will remember this for the rest of my life. Incredible job by all involved.<br/><br/>DeNiro - Best Performance in decades.<br/><br/>Pacino - Surprisingly funny and subtle in his versatility.<br/><br/>Pesci - My goodness, Pesci. Never should have given acting up. Still has it in spades. Could steal a scene in no less than 15 seconds from almost any current leading actor you could imagine. They don't make em (films or stars) like this anymore."

","This is as close as Scorsese will get to his old style, and yet keep a significant distance between what made films like goodfellas and casino fantastic.<br/><br/>
To call this a return to form is an insult to the master, who's last films have been nothing short of great and entertaining but only just scratching above the line of being true classics. The Irishman is well above that line, and it truly solidified itself amongst the ranks of Goodfellas in the last 30 minutes where Scorsese's plan goes from being a entertaining and engaging mess to a piece of art. To put it simply, it tells the story or betrayal and regret for 3 hours but only reveals what it means to Frank in the last 30. Pacino is a true actor in this film, embodying Hoffa and making people like De Niro and Pesci seem like backgrounds to which he can stand and perform. I want to commend Scorsese for giving us this film because no one asked him for masterpiece about ageing and becoming old. No one expected it from him to deliver a tale of this potency. But it becomes so clear that only an aged Scorsese could make a film like this. This is why we waited for The Irishman. This is why we needed another gangster film from him. Because only a veteran director can make you empathise with a part of your life that's 50 or so decades away."

"martin-fennell","10","8","20","10 November 2019"," Worth the wait.
","I though It was an excellent movie. De Niro gives a great performance. It is particularly powerful in the very late stages of the movies. There are times though when he has that De Niro look on his face. I mean that look people in the entertainment business put on, when they want to imitate him. His face looks so tight that you might wonder if it can move at all. Other times he is more relaxed, and looks younger. But I am not sure if he was supposed to be younger. I wasn't always sure, where the movie was chronologically. But what really convinced me initially of the quality of his performance, was his superb narration. It is in the closer stages of the movie, with De Niro, as an old that his acting becomes as good as anything I have ever seen from him.
I kind of found it hard to gauge Pacino's performance. The thing for me is that Pacino has given some great performances in the latter part of his career. So his performance here doesn't hold any great surprises for me. Wheras De Niro seems to be coasting along for a long time lately. His performance here makes me remember why I once thought of him as one of the greatest actors ever.<br/><br/>1 view"

","By far the best picture of the year and I am confident that it's gonna grab so many awards during the award season. Scorsese gives us exactly what we expected from his dream project even if it has arrived a little late. De Niro - Pesci - Scorcese reunite after 24 years since Casino to recreate the same magic chemistry in a 180+ minute plus gangster epic.<br/><br/>It's extremely surprising when you think the man who played the iconic Michael Corlene is only working with the master himself only in their late 70s. Al Pacino is the heart and soul of this movie, his performance is his best since Angels of America and he does it so effortlessly. All the actors whom we all loved in their prime return together once again to give us a one final goodbye.<br/><br/>Unlike his previous mob movies, Scorsese doesn't direct a tough guy macho type mob film but shows us a carousel about the 30 year journey of one Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro). The music is very subtle and the violence is very very minimal. Irishman is about loyalty, betrayal, parenting, politics, law enforcement, corruption and many more things.

If this was done by Ed Wood, it would at least be funny. Here I could not keep watching because I cringed so hard looking at ""young"" De Niro. The others were not in better shape. It was just distracting.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","4","8","18 January 2020"," The mafia movie Scorsese always wanted to make.
","At almost three-and-a-half hours long, The Irishman (2019) might seem like a daunting movie to sit through. However, much like Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood (2019) gave Quentin Tarantino the space to make the movie he wanted to, Netflix seems to have allowed Martin Scorsese to create the film he wanted with little-to-no interference. Consequently, the 3.5 hours of this movie could have probably stood a bit of a trim, but the pacing is so well done as to make the time fly by (similar to another movie of epic proportions, Lawrence of Arabia (1962)).<br/><br/>One of the most significant strengths of this movie appears to be its de-aging technology. While it's still a bit on the edge of the uncanny valley, the main actors did look significantly younger than their current ages during the flashback sequences. Instead of relying on look-alikes and teaching them the mannerisms of these incredibly talented actors, Scorsese took a more technical route that could fully use De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci to their fullest potential. After all, these three actors make the film what it is. I only wonder if it took this long for Scorsese to release this film because of this technical achievement.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a Scorsese film. He's so intertwined with the mobster genre that I'm surprised The Irishman wasn't released sooner. After all, most people have a passing knowledge of Jimmy Hoffa but know that the mafia in the United States was undoubtedly a real influence on politics in more ways than we're likely to admit. If anything, The Irishman is a return to form for Scorsese and his mafia films that cemented his name in the zeitgeist of cinema decades ago. There's certainly a lot in this movie that can act as Oscar bait, but the strength of the narrative and the performance of the actors help elevate it to an instant classic.<br/><br/>The mafia movie Scorsese always wanted to make, I give The Irishman 4.0 stars out of 5."

Because throughout the entire movie the viewer is feed with the supposition of the-CGI-makes-them-look-young-and-they-act-youthfully - but that is a total BS.

What Pesci does in his rol as Buffino is so good, not a fals note at all, Pacino, also great, is amazingly good as Hoffa. Editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is again proof why she is the best editor ever in film. Score and music department by Robbie Robertson is again nail on the head, classics from the 40s till 70s, and his theme from Irishman is honey to my ears.

I felt like I was looking at my immigrant grandfather at times.<br/><br/>The beating - apparently some people couldn't get past this, and I'll concede that it was bad. But come on- you really stopped watching the movie for that? It was thankfully brief, but I'm not sure why they left it in the film. I suspect indulgence from somewhere.<br/><br/>On to the compelling;<br/><br/>Joe Pesci - Brilliant, understated portray of the kindly uncle/ruthless gangster Russ Bufalino - maybe his best work to date. A simple line like, ""There's been a change"", delivered so offhandedly but with the gravest of implications, is simply chilling.<br/><br/>Al Pacino - Best performance since ""Glengarry Glen Ross"". I hate to keep using the word ""understated"", but that is a very relative term for a guy who has been accused of overacting at times. He portrayed both Hoffa's insecurity and hubris with equal aplomb, and he made him sympathetic. I know what's going to happen, you know what's going to happen, everyone knows what's going to happen, except Jimmy. Pacino made you just want to reach across the screen and shake some sense into him.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Robert Deniro;<br/><br/>I can't decide which character he had better chemistry with, Jimmy or Russ, and I don't think it really matters - it was just a real treat to watch. He was a good, loyal soldier from start to finish, caught up in the conflict between two juggernauts, and despite the genuine love and resulting equity he had built up with both Russ and Jimmy, found himself powerless to change minds or events.
He really was the glue that held this movie together.<br/><br/>Good performances, if limited, by Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano, Domenick Lombardozzi, Jesse Plemons, and Stephen Graham. Kind of fun to see Welker White (Lois from ""Goodfellas""), too.<br/><br/>Loved the historical context as well, with snippets portraying Kennedy's assassination, Nixon's downfall, Bay of Pigs, Cuban Missile Crisis, etc. It was like a ride in a time machine."

"davideo-2","9","4","8","4 December 2019"," Scorsese's most ambitious project, if not quite a masterpiece
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Morning * Monday Morning<br/><br/>In 1950s America, Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is trying to get by, providing for his family as a delivery driver. However, when a containment of meat goes missing from one of his deliveries, he is hauled before the court on suspicion of stealing. A union lawyer gets him off, and Jimmy is taken to meet Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), head of the Bufalino crime family, who control the unions. Bufalino has heard of his service record in Italy, and thinks Frank has what it takes to be a great hitman, which he takes to like a duck to water. When he is introduced to union supremo Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), it is the beginning of a deadly alliance throughout the years, of murder, corruption and betrayal.<br/><br/>The Irishman may be the most eagerly anticipated film of the year, Martin Scorsese's mammoth reunion of himself, Goodfellas stelwarts De Niro and Pesci, and De Niro's long time counterpart (for want of a better word) Pacino, in a no less than three and a half hour long adaptation of Charles Brandt's novel I Heard You Paint Houses. It's testament to what an arduous struggle it's been to make, that it was originally meant to be released years ago, but various issues put obstacles in the way, and now it has premiered on Netflix, before a theatrical release for those more inclined to see it that way. The result is a hugely admirable and rewarding experience, that stops a few shades sort of electrifying to be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Determined to cater to the loyal fanbase, and recast the big name stars everyone's loved and grown up with over the years, Scorsese has placed messieurs De Niro and Pacino in the lead roles again, despite their advanced ages, and so to make things look more realistic, a lot has been made of the 'de-aging' application applied to the stars, in a ground breaking move designed to keep everyone happy. While the grey hairs and face lines are removed from De Niro, it's a sad truth that early on in the role, he still looks too old for it, struggling to convince as a man with a young family just starting out, simply on account of, well, his age (sadly.) While this threatens to sully things early on, after a while you're thoroughly absorbed in the story, and his performance is no less committed, matched by Pacino, in bombastic, powered up mode as the real life Hoffa, whose disappearance this applies some very interpretive speculation to.<br/><br/>It doesn't really have exactly the right amount of dynamism and magnetism it needs to keep your attention for such a long length, but it never bores you, or makes you lose interest either, a spectacular accomplishment in itself for a film that is one of the few to rival Lawrence of Arabia in length, or, indeed, De Niro and Scorsese's 1984 epic Once Upon a Time in America (which I've never seen!) ****"

"medwards1","9","4","8","3 December 2019"," I Heard you Paint Houses is a mature, clever perspective on a gangster epic.
","Scorsese brings us a last (probably) nostalgic jaunt into his old familiar territory with some old (kinda) familiar faces. From the very start of the film you are reminded of the echoes of all the great gangster films Marty has brought us before.<br/><br/>We begin with a long slow tracking shot, instantly calling up visions of the one from Goodfellas. However, whilst in that film the shot is there to show the wide-eyed surprise of Lorraine Bracco's character as she is seduced into the life of being a mobsters wife as she is swept along into the glamorous side of the life of crime and the headiness of power, here, in The Irishman (or rather I Heard you Paint Houses) the shot is there to show the inevitability of life spiralling into its final conclusion.<br/><br/>This is, at its heart, a story about ages and about aging. This is a story seeped in the fact all the principle people involved in making it are well into their seventies. This is not to say the film is slow or lacking energy, but rather measured, well-paced, doing everything it needs to do without being rushed. This is a mature film.<br/><br/>That our lead character and narrator the titular Irishman (De Niro) is first shown sitting on his own in a nursing home (retirement community as Tony Soprano would have forcefully corrected) works in a few ways. It sets up he is a survivor; he has outlasted all the other characters in this story. He is alone; everyone he loved is either now dead (often at his hand) or has disowned him. As he begins to relate the story we switch from non-diegetic voice over to diegetic articulation; this emphasises a key concept that undercuts the whole movie, the idea of the unreliable narrator. At first we assume he is talking to someone, maybe a cop, maybe a journalist, maybe a priest, out of shot. Much later we see a wider angle of where he is sat, that heavily suggests he is relating this story to no one, talking to himself, in what could very much be the confused ramblings of an old man. How much of what he tells us is true, dreamed or made up or even misremembered? Unlike his other gangster films, there is no contradictory or complimentary (depending on how you view it) commentary from another character. Also, because everyone else in the story is dead, there is no one left to gainsay his story, we are asked to trust him, or not.<br/><br/>The body of the movie covers familiar territory for a Scorsese gangster film, an account of how an outsider came to be integral to a crime family and their criminal operations across the span of several decades. A rags to riches and back to rags tale (although age and death is the leveller this time instead of arrest, being a rat or universal paranoia and distrust). We have several moments that echo earlier gangster films (such as the car bomb in Casino) but I won't dwell on those as it is more fun discovering them yourself.<br/><br/>This is not an absolute masterpiece, it is not quite to the level of a Taxi Driver, a Goodfellas, a Casino or a Wolf of Wallstreet, however, it is still significantly better than almost every other gangster film you could chose to watch. If you are a Scorsese fan you are richly rewarded for your knowledge of how Marty makes a film, if you are a stranger to films by this director, well, where have you been? Painting houses?<br/><br/>The best thing I can say about this film is, even though it is long, I wanted to watch it again right from the beginning once I had finished it, and the only reason I didn't is it was already nearly two in the morning."

","In his most emotional gangster movie. M. Scorssese delivers the last mob movie, the one that put all the big fishes on screen, taking Joe Pesci outta retirement, and giving Pacino and specialy De Niro one of their most emotive performance of their carreirs.
We have to see ""The Irishman"" from the protagonist perspective, for he is an old man know, reflexing over his life since he was a simple truck driver, untill he mets the man that changes the course of his life for good.
Gets clear with the epilogue of the film that Frank always felt devastated for how the things went for his friend. A sensation that will stick to him to the very end of his life.
Pacino is glorious every scene, and Pesci brings to colours all corners of the screen with his dialogues and performance.
For me, it was sourt of a goodbye, of all this legends of cinema, who got all reunited one more time to wave their hands and say ""farewell, dear friends""."

","I don't understand why Scorsese made The Irishman. Nothing new under the sun, old wine in new bags.<br/><br/>Or... Scorsse created a 'swan song' to honor his own career of beautiful maffia movies . If that is the case, then he has more than succeeded. But not for the reasons he might have hoped for.
First of all - in terms of storyline - the lives of the main-characters run somewhat pathetic to their end. This depressive fact is reinforced by Scorsese's casting; his old friends and loyal actors. They gave us the most beautiful performances - most of the time under Scorsese's direction. But after that, these men went down career-wise, acting in forgettable trash and they grew older....much older.
So, Scorsese pulled these actors somewhat posthumously out of their creative lethargy and pushed them into this far too long film.<br/><br/>To ""do it"" one more time.<br/><br/>The hopelessness of this attempt is even more emphasized by the fact that due to poor make-up, these hero's of the past, officially old and winkled, are - in the mostly flash-back sequences - walking around like display-mannequins. Its irritating.<br/><br/>This could not have been your intention, Mr S.
The Irishman is a failure not only in terms of script - nothing happens - , not only because there is a serious mis-cast in terms of age, but also because the actors play so bad; the energy is gone. Are they bad actors? No, they simply have to act an energy that doesnt fit the energy of their age; the 'age-gap' is simply to big.<br/><br/>PS: IDe Niro - who is know to me for these somewhat chilly, surious little eyes - has now, older, these large, deep, emotional and compassionate eyes and expression. Beautiful in full close up. Put this actor in a role that fits his age - an Eastwood movie, or something like On Golden Pond - and he will deliver a power and depth he never had before.<br/><br/>And why do i rate this movie a 7? Well......because the production is really beautiful and Scorsese and these old men, after all, gave us so much beauty before. Too much to be nullified by this superfluous vehicle."

"mikayakatnt","2","6","14","10 December 2019"," Snoozefest
","Even as a Scorsese fan, this film disappointed. As much as I wanted to love this film, I was simply disappointed by the end result.<br/><br/>First, the good. The source material this film uses tells the real-life mystery surrounding the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. It shares the unlikely, yet true, story of Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran and his involvement in the Philadelphia mafia. This epic of a movie covers ~30-50 years and a large cast of interesting characters. All could have movies made about their own lives that would be as interesting.<br/><br/>The cinematography and choice of music is AAA+. I'd like to give Rodrigo Prieto special attention to the work that he did in this film. The plot is compelling and worthwhile.<br/><br/>But the flaws quickly come up. I found Scorsese's choice of actors unfitting for the story told. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci are all well distinguished actors in their own regards. Yet, their age and cliched acting overpowered the positives that they offered. There was no single point in the film that I was convinced of Robert De Niro or Al Pacino were men in their 30s/40s. No amount of CGI de-aging could hide that fact.<br/><br/>Seeing men in their 70s acts in a 3 hour film can make this a snoozefest for some of its viewers. That can be seen in the Netflix numbers showing the small number of viewers that actually make it to the end.<br/><br/>As many critics pointed out, I felt as if the long and winding story could have been told in a more concise manner. Action and scenes of significance happen far and few. Time is taken to build the world that Frank Sheeran existed in rather than moving the story. But some people will see that more as a pro than a con.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, I wanted to love this film. Yet, it fails to have the same cinematic magic that Scorsese has shown in his other work. The film disappears in the viewers mind as soon as they finish it, if not sooner. The film leaves no lasting impact on its viewers and will be overshadowed by Scorsese's earlier work.<br/><br/>2/10. One star for plot, one for cinematography. It really took Scorsese 10+ years to make this film?"

With Pacino mis-cast, and DiNiro's facial cgi and blue eyes a huge distraction, Pesci conjured up the most with what he was given. Thanks to Netflix we thankfully saved the price of theater admission, but whether seen at home or the theater, a dismal waste of 3 and a third entertainment hours.<br/><br/>P.S. #1 Where was the technical adviser on the glaringly obvious 'here, it's the timing chain' goof?

","My initial thought about this movie (prior to watching it) was mixed. A great director and a classic cast of actors- but, the actors are past their prime for this kind of movie. I imagined them having to take frequent breaks to urinate, during dangerous conflicts and action sequences, given the combined size of their prostates. And, how can one accept the genuine nature of men who are supposed to be tough when they are 70-80s years of age?<br/><br/>I guess De Niro probably affected my opinion with his proclamation of wanting to punch POTUS in the face. It's hysterical to think that he believes he is a tough and rugged man given his age when even true tough and rugged men tend to calm down (because they have nothing to prove) - his offstage behavior betrays his on screen perception. He has type casted himself, sorry to say that given the true artistic contribution he has provided to the film industry and film fans over his lifetime. He is now just an angry old man who hasn't developed maturely.<br/><br/>I will give it another try, maybe I can get past my preconditioned perception and view it from an empty and accepting perception.<br/><br/>I do have to add, I don't know why actors and musicians do that to themselves. It's like they have decided at some point that what they create will be best if it's spirit and nature will be identical to each creation from that point on. So, they create the same work of art over and again.<br/><br/>But, this may be good because it opens the door to new talent- God knows we need new talent these days."

","The Irishman belongs firmly in the Martin Scorsese canon. Like Casino, Goodfellas and The Departed Scorsese's The Irishman is a film telling the story of Mob related history, this time, the life and times of Jimmy Hoffa. It's a lengthy film, 3 1/2 hours but worth every minute. Dinero is perfectly cast, along with Pacino and Harvey Keitel. Joe Pesci delivers an Oscar worthy performance, in fact I expect this film to receive multiple Oscar nods. It's a great movie, great cast and great production. It's well worth the running time."
"karredondo-56621","10","6","14","30 November 2019"," DON'T LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!'n
","What an incredible work of art. Scorsese delivers not only one of his best films, but a great film PERIOD. Despite what some small minded viewers may think, this is NOT a film with washed up actors trying to revive their once promising career. No, this is a work of art, worth every minute, with veteran actors, writers and a director who knows the art of story telling.<br/><br/>DeNiro (Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran"" delivers an emotional performance giving us an incredible insight into the life a reputed mafia hit man and glorified body guard. By the end of the film you can't help but almost feel bad for Sheeran and the loved ones whine were effected from his actions.<br/><br/>Side Note: I've read a lot of peoples reviews complaining because in the movie Sheeran doesn't have an Irish accent.. The real Frank Sheeran, even though he IS Irish, was born in Darby, Pennsylvania and he spent more time in Italy during World War II (411 day in combat) than he ever spent in Ireland. So that's a really poor reason to give a low rating for this movie.<br/><br/>Pesci comes out of a 20 year retirement to play the Pennsylvania mob boss Russell ""The Quite Don"" Bufalino. If your expecting Pesci to be the brutally violent and aggressive mafia soldier as he once was in Casino or Goodfellas, you've come to the wrong place. However, it's almost victorious to see Pesci portray and actual BOSS, as if we've seen him rise through the ranks of gangster cinema through the years and finally put him where he belongs. Pesci delivers a firm performance, mesmerizing the audience with his subtle body language and menacing stare downs as he vaguely orders certain hits throughout the film. If we don't see another film with Pesci in it again, I couldn't be more happy with this one we've been blessed to see.<br/><br/>Pacino absolutely steals the show! Jimmy Hoffa was one of the most famous people in the United states at one point, and DeNiro couldn't have said it best: ""Young people nowadays have no idea who Jimmy Hoffa was.."". As sad as that is, it couldn't be more accurate. I've read numerous books about Hoffa and Pacino did an incredible job bringing the late Teamsters President to life on the big screen. I've also read negative reviews about Pacino saying he ""plays the same role he always plays"" and that he just ""screams"" and ""looks old"". What people don't know is that Hoffa was an incredibly intense
Individual and cared about two things, and two things only: His family and the union. It breaks my heart to see Hoffas demise being that he was given numerous chances to buckle down but he couldn't stand by and let, what he thought, some low life gangsters come in and take his union over just because who they were or what they did or who they were connected with.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is an incredible work of art, mixed with subtle yet forgotten parts of history that shaped the future of this country forever (World War II, JFK election/assassination, Bay of Pigs fiasco, Cuba and the Havana Mob, Fidel Castro, The CIA, Nixon and Watergate"". I feel like because Scorsese made an honest remark about the current popularity of super hero films, he will be getting more people saying negative things about it because based on bias opinions. Avengers: Endgame (Which I loved) was 30 minutes shorter than this and I never heard anybody complain, even when the best parts of that movie was the last 30 minutes. I love super hero movies ALOT. Im a huge fan. But The Irishman is an incredible film, no matter how you categorize it (Gangster/Mafia film, Drama, Crime, History, Based On Books ETC) it should and I think WILL, go down as one of the greatest films in our lifetime. 10/10, 5 stars, 100%, 2 thumbs up.

But then I watched it for a second time....<br/><br/>I watched it for the second time at home, alone and with subtitles on; and I enjoyed it on a whole different level. I was able to understand what the right way to watch this movie is. This is not an action movie where the actors are explosive and fiery. This is a movie where conversations are extremely important. You need to pay attention to what the actors say to each other, or what the narrator says. Another element that really stood out on the second viewing was the music. It is subtle, but present in most scenes and it is so amazing. This is undoubtedly one of the movies which will be talked about in years to come.<br/><br/>If you decide to watch this movie, do yourself a favor: put your phone away and dedicate 3 hours of your focus to this movie and let it entertain you slowly but surely."

","I want to take the chance to thank Martin Scorsese for making The Irishman. Not only did he revive the Mafia Film which was dead for such a long time. He also made it possible for us to see our heroes together on the big screen again. Just by considering the cast, the movie deserves big respect.<br/><br/>But fortunately the plot did not disappoint either. It was no Expendables movie for instance where the cast was great but the content missed somehow. Scorsese did it just right and proved that he earnes his title as master. These goodfellas such as Deniro, Pacino and Pesci did a great job. In a time where the Film industry is dominated by super hero movies or senseless sequels it is an honour to watch The Irishman.<br/><br/>I could have sit there for another 3 hours. For a long time I was not so focused, so thrilled by a movie. For now I want to rate the irishman 9 out of 10 possible stars. After watching a documentary about the whole incident and rewatching The Irishman, rating it with 10/10 is quite possible."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","6","14","16 November 2019"," Confessions of a home decorator.
","Scorsese's return to perhaps his most potent genre is a subtle slow-burn that maybe comes the closest out of any of his prior titles to outright decry the lifestyle it depicts. This is done via a phenomenal epilogue that sees the piece simply fade out, around thirty minutes after what's essentially its ending, rather than explode in some sort of blaze of glory. It's a remarkably effective choice, ensuring that any waylaid claims of glamorisation are put to rest before the lights come on. In this regard, the difference between this picture and, say, 'Goodfellas (1990)' is rather slight; it's certainly tangible, though, a definite effort to compound its message rather than leave it completely up to audience interpretation. Though comparisons between 'The Irishman (2019)' and its previously mentioned ancestor are inevitable (and, even, valid), the two movies couldn't be more different when it comes to everything other than their genres and their barebones plots. This affair feels decidedly mature, an underplayed exploration of character that uses crime more as a backdrop than a narrative focus. It crafts a palpable world whose terms are written in euphemism and whose debts are paid with blood. It never feels preoccupied with its seedy dealings, refusing to revel in them and instead nonchalantly presenting them as a fact of life for its characters. Its violence is quick, dirty and effective, nothing more than a means to an end. There's less focus on it, even if it's still as prevalent as ever. The narrative moves at its own pace, presented as a series of flashbacks narrated by its protagonist. It seems like the elaborate, matter-of-fact and occasionally confused confession of a dying man desperate to get his misdeeds off his chest before they finish him for good. For the most part, this works well, going some way in justifying the flick's fairly messy structure. It's necessary, even if it sometimes runs into the technique's usual issues with telling instead of showing, and it's delivered excellently by 'old man' DeNiro. The performances are great across the board, with many actors playing against type and turning in some of their best work. Pesci, especially, is great, returning as a major player after a twenty year hiatus from such roles. The digital ageing is a little rocky in places but it isn't distracting. After a while, you forget about the special effects wizardry and focus on the time-hopping narrative. It's probably the best way such a narrative could be presented, actually. The entire affair is decidedly considered, seemingly conceived to be exactly what it is. It's an assured experience that actually makes some relatively bold choices - especially when it comes to its flashes of 'arty' filmmaking. It does have issues, though. For one, it's very long - I mean, it's literally the longest film I've ever seen - and you can feel its length. It seems like a good half hour could have been excised to no real detriment. It also seems more suited to a mini-series than a movie, mainly thanks to its episodic nature. It takes ages for its main point to become clear and, even then, it's only really evident in retrospect. Its main dynamic is potent, don't get me wrong; in fact, the flick becomes better and better as it bubbles to the surface in the second half. It just takes a lot of time to kick in, that's all. The thing is quite tonally inconsistent, often undercutting itself with extended, out-of-place humour. Sometimes, this adds a little layer of charisma to the characters; other times, it reduces the intended effect of the scene in which it's inserted. The picture is presented so sincerely between its comedic beats that any deviation from its usually straight-laced nature is jarring, at best. Still, an odd tone can't stop the story from being as effective as it is, even if it does occasionally dampen its effect. The experience is always engaging and, usually, just as entertaining. It works better on a scene-by-scene basis until far later than it should, but it ultimately makes for compelling, worthwhile viewing that says something without shouting about it. It's well-made, distinct and enjoyable. It's a shame that, unlike me, most people won't get to see it on the big screen. 7/10"

","There's no question Martin Scorsese has forever left his mark on cinema. Still to this day he serves as the ordained staunchest defender of cinema. And when his maker finally reclaims him to the grandest of Wonder Theaters in the heavens above, he'll deservedly be placed on the Mount Rushmore of cinema down here on earth, forever perched just a bit higher and with far greater permanence than us regular folk.<br/><br/>This review won't be some drawn out ode to one of the greatest filmmakers of all time-and in particular our favorite director. His latest flick, 'The Irishman,' is magnanimous in its breadth and scale, though it isn't perfect. We wish the blood effects used throughout the film were practical instead of CGI. The Canada Dry product placement is nagging. The decision to cast Action Bronson for a certain scene is downright bizarre and the ending should've been edited down, shaving off some of the bloated 3.5 hour run time.<br/><br/>Yet think about what this film represents. We have Scorsese directing De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci along with a veritable ""who's who"" of the gangster genre. It's a once-in-a-lifetime reunion of what is called the ""New Hollywood"" era of cinema, the movement in American film history from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s when a new generation of young actors and filmmakers came to prominence in the U.S.<br/><br/>We were fortunate enough to see this film at the gorgeous and historic Belasco Theatre. The experience felt like a throwback to the golden age of cinema. We'll always cherish the memory and be thankful for all the enjoyment and pleasure Mr. Scorsese has given us over the years. If you've benefited the same, see the movie in select theaters now or on Netflix beginning November 27th."

AND STOP MAKING 3.5 HOUR LONG MOVIES.<br/><br/>i promise i gave this a legit chance. and even tho i completely disagreed with his super hero movie comments, it did not affect my opinion of this movie. having said that, it wouldn't make me sad in the least bit if there was never another movie like this one. i would rather watch a garbo superhero movie than go through this boredom again.

","Look Al Pacino is brilliant. He has shown through time that he has always been a great actor. He carries this film. Pacino genuinely looks happy. He looks sad, reflective, and insightful.<br/><br/>Pecsi and Kitel do wonders. They look and act the part but the film is horrible. It drags. It loses sight of what a film is supposed to do. This is like when Guns N' Roses reunited at first but hated each other. Martin and Robert are out of their range. They no longer have what it takes.<br/><br/>The runtime is also a downer. When Martin made Mean Streets it was an early film. So while it was a bit boring you felt there was an artist burning with passion. Here, there is nothing. I am not sure what is more disappointing me wasting my time or believing this could have been a good film. For all the aging effects, the reunion, Martin saying how he got the gang together- its a let down. We have to stop this nonsense. Film is never supposed to be this way.<br/><br/>The problem is one- Robert has nothing left. Martin cant inspire him anymore. So it ends very blandly. I can't say more."

It is not a film for women who are more comfortable with films containing women characters of substance; it is not a film for Hollywood Action-character movies with multiple follow-ups, and it is not a film for people to whom Gangster films are a put-off. Having said that, it is a film for film-goers who enjoy the slow development of story and who enjoy an afternoon of continuous story manipulation: of character, of time sequence and historical operative.<br/><br/>The final substance of the film dealing with Teamster boss, Jimmy Hoffa allows Pacino to dominate the screen with a pizazz that only a Great like Pacino can manage.<br/><br/>Diane and I missed this magnificent film on the Big Screen and watched it on our home small screen but by whatever size screen, make every effort to see it."

3h30 long hours later, after too many snoozes, gotta say, not the best Scorsese.
I don't understand the hype around that movie.
It's basically the same as Mafia movia but not as good (very far) than Goodfellas or The Godfather.
And the technology to get Pacino , Deniro and all the others, is simply not on point. Very disappointing."
"markkbranson","9","5","11","3 December 2019"," It IS Long, but Well Worth the Time
","I understand that when you see the running time is over three hours, you are going to say, Hell no."" Please stop and think and then watch this film. It is slow, it is not action-packed, it is nearly 100% characters. But as you watch De Niro and Pesci and Pacino and Romano and the brief appearance of Keitel, you know that you are watching master-craftsmen doing some of their best work and showing you some history that too many of us have forgotten.<br/><br/>I know that 21 century film goers want a breakneck pace with something happening every 3-4 second and with lots of jump cuts to maintain the unbearable space. Scorsese takes us back to a time when we wanted a break and the escape movies give us. This movie--if nothing else--is a master class in the older film-making techniques with some CGI added in. Watch the extra clip with DeNiro, Scorsese, Pesci, and Pacino talking about the effects used and the directing insights required as the stars age from their 30s and 40s into their 80s. Then watch the movie to relish this experience even more.<br/><br/>Pesci is the real draw for me in this film. He plays against his manic type and come across as the wise mobster who know the ways of the world and can simply get action by saying, ""That's the way it is.""<br/><br/>I have loved De Niro's work since ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) and ""Raging Bull"" (1980). He does not disappoint us as he ages before our eyes and we realize that his amazing talent will be gone from us at some time in the future. That realization saddens me, but this same realization intensifies my viewing this opus and others from De Niro.<br/><br/>Pacino's work for me has ben on and off over the years. I appreciate his performance is ""The Godfather"" saga. I like his work as the devil (aka John Milton) in ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1997). Other things are sleepers for me (""Heat"" (1995) and ""Dick Tracy"" (1990) are two quick examples.) Here he shows us Jimmy Hoffa--whom, I know, most of you have never heard of. He brings his larger than life persona to the fore here and it works.<br/><br/>To confess, I have not been a fan of Ray Romano. I believe my father in law's 24/7 watching of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is responsible for my negative viewing of his work. But here--he plays a lawyer with a verve that is making me reconsider my prejudice and encourages me to see more of his work.<br/><br/>Keitel is one screen way too little in ""The Irishman."" From ""The Mean Streets"" to The Wolf in ""Pulp Fiction"" to George Baines in ""The Piano,"" I admire his work and was pleased when I saw him here. Regrettably, his time was too short.<br/><br/>I can't help but think of what Scorsese is doing with the last scene. De Niro is bound to a wheelchair and he has been visited by a priest. As the priest leaves, De Niro asks him to leave the door open a bit. The camera cuts to a long shot of De Niro sitting there then go to black with end credits. I see in this short an echo of the closing shot of John Ford's ""The Searchers"" (1956). There, John Wayne is outside but the door closes on his face and closes on the end of the vision of the American West. Is Scorsese, likewise, suggesting a potential end of an era here? Please watch ""The Irishman"" and post your assessment here. If you don't post, see ""The Irishman"" and relish this opportunity of experiencing great art!"
"maniepranav","10","5","11","3 December 2019"," The perfect closure.
","Martin Scorsese is one of my favorite directors. Goodfellas, The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street happen to be movies I love rewatching. So when plans of him making another mob movie with Pesci, De Niro, and, finally, Pacino came up, I was excited.<br/><br/>I think I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. It is by no means a by-the-numbers gangster movie. It's a massively reflective and introspective piece that also doesn't happen to be a nuanced satire. It's, well, sad. And that's the quality that makes this movie a winner for me. The idea that Frank Sheeran was most likely in a limbo of thoughts as he inched closer to his end was so beautifully expressed that it might just make you a little emotional.<br/><br/>Despite being 3.5 hours, I don't think that even a single minute was unwarranted. I wasn't bored. The first hour was good, felt a lot like Goodfellas and just showing the trappings of being in a crime family. The second hour was even better, focusing on the dynamic between Hoffa and Sheeran, and De Niro, Pacino and Pesci reached a new peak this time. Of course, it was made all the more exciting by the plot.<br/><br/>The final stretch, however, is everything. It should just be the basis for an Oscar for De Niro. I mean, sure, Joaquin Phoenix was great, but De Niro in the last hour of the movie was absolutely phenomenal.<br/><br/>I think Scorsese is at that point of his life where he's looking at the various ways he can contribute to cinema. He's made excessive stuff, fun stuff, thrilling stuff. This is unique. It manages to be both fun and introspective without being too broody at the expense of boring people with long shots (I'm looking at you, Tarantino). It reminded me a lot of El Camino, which was similar in terms of what it wanted to be, but nowhere as good as The Irishman. This isn't saying that the movie is good because it's Scorsese at all, I've been bored by some really famous movies before. This movie is objectively good. And I can see why it's not a miniseries.<br/><br/>Thank you, Martin Scorsese and Netflix. 2nd favorite movie this year so far, behind Parasite.<br/><br/>(Just one problem: this deserved the theater treatment. Totally. Gorgeously shot.)"

","The whole time watching The Irishman, from the beginning when the camera pans to De Niro's character and he starts to tell his story, I wondered who he was talking to. I thought maybe just the viewing audience. That was until the end, when he refused to tell the priest his sins. It wasn't until after this that,I realized, the entire story was his, in fact, confession to God. He's never seen telling the story to another living person, just the only being that it mattered to.<br/><br/>This changed the whole perspective of the movie for me.<br/><br/>Yes, it has the same style, music and cinematography of all the other Scorsese classics.

","This movie, not film, definitely not cinema, is a pathetic repackaging of classic Marty. I have not seen a money grab like this since The Godfather III. De Niro's portrayal actually does begin to develop the character, but it's nothing we haven't seen him do before. Pesci is, well, he's F'n Pesci...no complaints. Reminds me of his cameo in A Bronx Tale. Now we get to possibly the absolutely most horrible miscasting decision of all time. Al Pacino is closer to Jimmy Carter than he is to Jimmy Hoffa. All he did was dust off his performance in City Hall, which I love, and...well crap. It's like neither he nor Marty had ever even heard of or seen Jimmy Hoffa. Shoulda brought back Jack. He nailed it. Again, I will finish this movie. I'm a bit scared because I'm 51. Not sure I have that much time left."

It was great to see such a star cast together on a screen, the de-aging didn't bother me as it Did to some people, but I would have preferred other young actors portraying them. The story is very linear and one dimensional. This was a great opportunity to make another lifetime classic, but I don't see it in that list up there. With this story, it could have ended with 2½ hour run easily!
I don't mind lengthy movies, but if the story isn't that compelling, then it's just a bit of a stretch."
"kushtrimhasani97700","9","5","11","29 November 2019"," De Niro, Pesci, and Pacino in one film, Mesmerizing
","Martin Scorsese, what hasn't been said about him. His career spans decades, he's made some of the greatest films of all time, the man is the last of his kind. With the Irishman, Scorsese has crafted a compelling chapter to his crime saga, a generation of actors used in an interesting and layered story about a man who played a big role in history, and has interacted with some of the most revered men and criminals of the 20th century. It's a fascinating story that flows elegantly through the tribulations and seedy underbelly of the mafia, and their interaction with the political landscape in the 60s era. The story particularly focuses on Frank Sheeran's relationship between the infamous teamster union boss Jimmy Hoffa and Pennsylvania crime boss Russel Buffalino. The film's giant runtime is expected to turn many movie goers off at 3 and a half hours, but the film has scenes that all feel integral to building up its dramatic finale. The performances from across the board are terrific. Pesci, De Niro, Pacino are legends, with many surprise cameos that also give terrific performances. While the de-aging can look weird at times, the talent on screen, the movies commitment to its world and characters make the film consistently riveting from start to finish."

Last night I finally managed to convince myself I will just stop in the middle and watch it in episodes like a mini-series.<br/><br/>Oh boy was I wrong! it was impossible to put it down and i ended up watching it till 2AM.<br/><br/>While the movie could maybe (and maybe not) benefit from a little shorter exposition it is fantastic. While chaotic at first and hard to follow as you jump back and forth in the stream of time you soon realise that this is how a memory of an old De Niro works as he tells the story of his life, friendships and betrays.<br/><br/>After the first hour or so it clicks and then with every passing hour it becomes so much more and zones into the human nature, and pain, and unexpected territories only to end on a soulcrashing discovery in the end.

","The Irishman is a title that you should bother watching only if you're a die-hard fan of mobster movies, for which it was made. The movie isn't about tense scenes, action or even story at that point. It's about enjoying the atmosphere that it creates, the same atmosphere you would feel watching Goodfellas or the Godfather. It's about the small talk, the way they behave, the ""gangster"" vibes the entire movie has. You shouldn't even bother trying to listen to every bit a dialogue - I was out of the loop for quite the bit of the movie's length and I still enjoyed it. It's like when someone comes to a nice expensive cafe and complains about the prices - it's not the drink you pay for that's expensive, it's the pleasure of the atmosphere you're in at the time, drinking coffee in your room and on a patio with a nice view isn't the same thing. And that's what this movie is all about. The atmosphere. So don't come in expecting it to be realistic to what actually happened, don't expect memorable scenes or Casino 2. Expect to get a good vibe, which surely will happen."

","Okay, I've read some of the complaints about the film, and I understand and maybe even agree with some of them. 1) The movie lost me at around Hour 3. 2) The computerized de-aging was somewhat distracting, and I think the beating up of the grocery owner should have been done by a younger guy, maybe. BUT I find myself somewhat distracted when actors wear makeup to age them. When they get other actors to depict them at younger ages is also distracting, because I find myself assessing whether the actor actually does look like a younger version of whatever character they're supposed to be. 3) The movie is somewhat depressing because of the ending, and because all of these great actors and Scorsese himself are getting older. The movie deals with aging and death from old age diseases, like cancer (Pesci character) or whatever Frank ends up dying of - not from getting shot or garroted. Pacino no longer looks like he did in Scarface. De Niro no longer looks like Johnny Boy or Travis Bickle. 4) Lastly, I wasn't fond of Pacino as Hoffa. He didn't look like him or sound like him. Jack Nicholson actually did.<br/><br/>But...De Niro gives a fantastic performance. His portrayal of Frank was sensitive and believable. Certain scenes were highly emotional. The scene where he gets the message from Pesci that he's going to have to kill Hoffa was so real, very emotional. And his phone conversation with Hoffa's wife and the previous scene with his daughter were excellent. And if De Niro looked odd in the de-aging process, maybe it was because he wasn't trying to look like a younger version of himself. He was trying to look like a younger version of Frank Sheeran. He wore blue contact lenses. He wore facial prosthetics to make his jaw more squared off. There were other things he did to emulate frank - the lumbering, hunched over posture - that was him being Frank, not him being bored!<br/><br/>Robert De Niro may be the best actor ever. He is able to convey a character so realistically - even the small part he had in American Hustle was SO effective.<br/><br/>The movie was highly suspenseful in the scenes leading up to Hoffa's killing. Picking him up, driving him to the house, etc. I enjoyed it, found the film fascinating from a historical perspective. I grew up near Detroit in a union family and remember Jimmy Hoffa and what a BIG deal it was when he disappeared. It still is a big deal.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Irishman isn't my favorite Scorsese movie, but I think it's way better than Wolf of Wall Street. Leonardo DiCaprio is okay, but not a great actor.<br/><br/>There is controversy about whether Sheeran's ""confession"" is legit. I would recommend reading or watching interviews of Jack Goldsmith if you have an interest in learning more about Jimmy Hoffa."

Just don't watch it with any preconceptions - watch it as an admirer of film. And you can probably do that in 2 sittings if you get easily uncomfortable sitting for that long - you do it with everything else on Netflix.<br/><br/>I didn't watch any adverts for this movie, and I didn't know anything about it, other than Scorsese and De Niro. That was enough for me. And so the whole way through you're gifted with many Hollywood greats re-appearing in this master piece of a life story.<br/><br/>And this is really where you should begin. It's not a mob movie in the sense that you'll see guns and actions scenes the whole way through. It's more life like, a story of a life, life the Godfather, slow paced, it develops in layers, and characters and conflict.<br/><br/>Really, and probably obviously it's about the rise of an Irishman - a nobody looking to take care of his family. But it's not an obvious rise to become a mob boss, it's about his rise and development of his character and choices. But it's also about his relationship with his friends, family and daughters. It's a beautiful film, a tragedy in a sense. It's beautifully made, well cast, well acted, subtle, funny, emotionally charged - and poignant.<br/><br/>You won't be disappointed - this is Scorsese being great as usual."
"nagsaptarshi","7","2","3","23 February 2020"," A movie 20 years late
","The movie is unnecessarily long. There are so many scenes which could easily be done away with. But to add to it a Godfatheresque touch, ace director Scorsese drags it far and far to a point you start feeling bored. Character development of De Niro is brilliant but the same cannot be said about others, particularly John Hoffa or Pacino. On the contrary, De Niro somehow looks nonchalant throughout the movie, while Pacino and Pesci really shine. The de-ageing effect through CGI is ludicrous. I mean, these are old men. Just by some effects you can not make some hepta or octogenarians look young. Had it been released a couple of decades earlier with at least 90 minutes less run-time, it would have been a cult movie. But now its late, very late. Watching two legends Pacino and De Niro sharing screen together for so long is a delight though. Its a good lessons for the highly rated young actors, too. When people want to see a pair on screen, they do not take a call on it fearing they might lose some fans and when they finally take a call positively at the fag end of their career, they have lost their charm. To conclude, it may be a swansong in the careers of the illustrious actor trio by an ace director who is also past his prime. Only if the effort was a little more fascinating. Will give it 7 out of 10 for the love of the actors and the director."

You are put inside many characters and small plots, but in the end suddenly in a blink of an eye the irishman got old and retired. It's the same with all the other guys - they are murdered or jailed. The title of the movie predicts its feebleness, because the fact that De Niro is an irishman is mentioned somehow, but it's not the most important thing about the his character and the plot itself. It's not even of medium importance. The film could easily be entitled 'Frank Sheeran"", but wouldn't be that intriguing."

If you've seen mafia films before there are some familiar beats here, though the acting and Scorsese's execution are so top-notch that the familiarity doesn't detract from the experience.

","Here's my super late review of the Irishman . So 'The Irishman' is directed by Martin Scorcesse and it's out right after his comments against marvel and popcorn movies in general , and he shuts people up with this movie alone. The movie stars Scorcesse's homeboys De Niro , Pacino and Pesci . The movie is his forte , almost like a revival of Goodfellas , it's about mobsters , and no one knows better about that than Scorcesse cause he's lived it . The ensemble and legendary cast were amazing despite the trash prosthetics and deaging cgi . The story once again is like Goodfellas , but more in line with the association between the Teamster's Union and the mafia. It has all the Scorcesse trademarks from rise to power , leaving your wife for an other woman , abusing power , drugs , fancy restaurant meetings , betrayal , sugar , spice and everything nice . The movie is produced by Netflix and is 3 and a half hours long giving the Lord of the rings a run for it's runtime. Since it's produced by Netflix the movie is free of strict censorship and works more in line with the directors vision , the cinematography is gorgeous and has neatly written and quotable dialogue followed by rich production design. Now I saw a lot of articles and reviews online calling it a boring movie , but it's not and I'm not gonna say it's a "" slow burn"" or anything , in fact it's fast phased film for its runtime , if you keep up with it by googling for technical terms like ' truckers union ' and stuff you will be caught up with the movie and you'll be hooked , I can guarantee that. The internet also calls it an epic , but even though the story is an epic , stoic characters despite being great don't support it . In the end , the Irishman is a modern day reboot of Goodfellas with a stellar cast , gorgeous production design , all of Scorcesse's tricks and one big brush to paint your houses."
"j-madej","9","2","3","2 December 2019"," Scorsese's work will be studied for decades to come and 'The Irishman' becomes one of the chapters of life of this magnificent, insightful director.
","By now plenty has been written about how the CGI de aging effects ruined the new movie of master director Martin Scorsese titled 'The Irishman'.
Dear Reader,
if thats all you focused on, then you have missed the point of this movie. Now, If you are Scorsese do you wait another 5 or 10 years for the CGI technology to develop more and risk possibly loosing one or more lead actors due to old age, or you go for it and finally make a passion project that has been brewing in your mind for over a decade.
Just like with government organized crime syndicate popularly called the Mafia, has its own code of ethics and loyalty. You never share information with law reinforcements agents and you make sure that code of silence is maintained under the penalty of death. All differences are always sort out internally without reliance on outside forces.
Film as the art form is a wonderful tool that permits the filmmaker under vail of artistic exploration to make films that can try to explore some historical unsolved mysteries and yet protects the filmmaker from breaking the code of silence. Oliver Stone did that successfully in his 3 hour long assassination biopic JFK and now Martin Scorsese with 'The Irishman' is trying to do the same by exploring the unsolved mystery of what happened to Jimmy Hoffa.
'The Irishman' is 3 and a half hours long which for attention span of a modern viewing audience can be bit beyond their grasp. Now, without generalizing this film will be experienced by you depending on your age and intellectual capacity. That doesn't mean that the younger audience will not enjoy 'The Irishman' as more mature movie goer does, its just means that based on the technological advancement in style of narration like, TV channel Mtv with its fast editing the younger audience has grown in maintaining their attention span for shorter periods and get easily board with style of narration which Scorsese explores in 'The Irishman'. Again this is not a statement but more of a observation. And now lets get to the movie itself and let me tell you what I think works in this film. By the end I will be honest with what did not workout.
As most of you know by now 'The Irishman' indirectly tells the story of disappearance of influential Track Union President Jimmy Hoffa in 1975 played wonderfully by Al Pacino but Hoffa's story seems to be only a part of the plot that is being told in span of 60 years. Pacino enters the movie after 47 minutes is passed which means he isn't the protagonist of the story, Robert DeNiro's character Frank Sheeran is.
As the titled 'The Irishman' we follow his story as a ex military, husband and the father who is trying to provide for his family. He encounters by a chance unassuming yet powerful gentleman Russell Bufalino brilliantly underplayed by Joe Pesci who happens to be affiliated with Italian Mob. Both man become close life long friends and we see their relationship evolving during act one of the movie. Act two seems to be introduction of Jimmy Hoffa's character which eventually will lead, without giving away too much, to loyalty test put forth by Bufalino to our protagonist. Both Sheeran and Hoffa grow fond of each other as well as their families which enhances the emotional stakes of whats happens in climax of the movie.
There is a lot to like in 'The Irishman'. Stylistically Scorsese delivers movie we would expect from him that looks beautiful in terms of coverage. Long dolly shots that are used as moving masters to set up the geography of locations punctuated by close up inserts and cutaways of objects the characters touch in the scene which enhances the cinematic style of Scorsese.
Of course this wouldn't have been Scorsese movie if the characters would not share their thought with the audience using voiceover. In film schools instructors insist on not using VO claiming and probably rightfully so that it is a lazy way of exposition. In film we show, we don't tell. However Scorsese broke this rule and made voiceover exposition his stylistic calling card.
Personally I didn't mind the CGI de aging effects specially considered that they are used primarily in act one. Did they looked perfect? No, however they were not bad enough to take me out of the movie. What I mind was the body language, Its extremely hard to make 75 year old man move like he is 45. The scene that comes to mind is when DeNiro comes to the store to confront a man that manhandled of of his daughters. Scorsese decides to keep the whole sequence in long shot showing the whole incident from far which doesn't work, becouse DeNiro's body looks old and not energetic enough to ""sell'"" the beating of the shop clerk to the audience. Scenes like this one took me out of the film more so then the problems with CGI.
I think the hidden Oscar worthy jam in 'The Irishman' is Joe Pesci. Where most will gravitate towards Pacino and DeNiro charismatic character performances, I loved what Pesci did with his character. There is duality in his performance which is often rewarded by the Academy members.
Small characteristic works very well in medium of film and Pesci in his performance explorers little nuances that lended him an Oscar back in a day. I am very happy we had a chance to see his talent again and hopefully we see more of him in other projects.
The cinematography and lighting is beautiful. Blocking (the movement of actors in relation to the camera) is very well choreographed, but its not as good as lets say 'Goodfellas' where famous bar scene comes to mind, when lead couple enter the nightclub through the kitchen, with camera tracking them all the way to their table inside the nightclub. This type of scenes are technically very difficult to shoot not only coz of the technical-light challenges, but also in terms of choreography of extras and actors. Everything has to aline perfectly, because there is no way to fix it in post-production being one consecutive take. With long tracking shots like above mentioned one from 'Goodfellas"" Scorsese showcases his mastery of the filmmaking medium.
And now on to what doesn't quite work. Apart what I already mentioned (CGI and old body language) this film is simply too long. Honestly it could have ended being 3 hours long. The last 30 minutes becomes meditation on aging and perhaps to some extent an intimate glimpse to Scorsese, who perhaps feels as a aging director is part of cinema style which with time is becoming a dying art. As I was watching DeNiro's character preparing his funeral arrangement I couldn't help to think in the back of my mind that Scorsese kept that last 30 minutes to show something important which he is perhaps dealing with on a personal level.
Is 'The Irishman' a masterpiece? History will show. I think the problem most viewers will deal with is that in this film the protagonist of the story (DeNiro) is a antihero. He is a hitmen who murders people for mafia bosses. That last 30 minutes of the film he has a chance for redemption which he is looking for specially in the eyes of his kids completing the character arc. And in essence just like his daughter we are watching him trying not to judge his actions, but we just simply cant forgive him because even in confession scene he doesn't shows his true self ultimately missing out on redemption. This is the ultimate fault of 'The Irishman'. No clear character ark in his protagonist.
I am very pleased that after many financing problems (originally 'The Irishman' was suppose to be produced by Paramount which eventually back out) ending on estimated 159 mil budget from Netflix we were fortunate to have 'The Irishman' written in to filmography history books.
Scorsese's work will be studied for decades to come and 'The Irishman' becomes one of the chapters of life of this magnificent, insightful director."

My personal heros de Niro and Pacino didn't shine as much as i hoped, in a scorsese attack on cinema of today. Pacino alwas has beautiful moments in a character that screams and yells, but maybe in the end the character wasn't the perfect fit(weirdly enough). About de niro.. i' have seen all the critics and i can see how they feel.. a legend not shining in a movie he partly directed is not something to speak positively about. In the end i think pacino did a great job as always and de Niro lost a bit of his edge. I hope more of this great producer will follow although i doubt it and it's great seeing this 2 great actors again. I also noticed with other people that good old story telling is lost on most people of today and that is anything but scorse's fold.

","It's not he best Scorsese film, lets begin with that. Many can argue that 3 and a half hours is an unnecessary length time for this movie, the story could be easily explained in 2 and a half hours. Also I can accept the fact that the CGI looked amazing in some scenes, but disturbing in other ones (I think this technology is incredible and will be improved in the future in benefit of cinema). However, everybody can agree that The Irishman is full of heart. Marty, Al, Bob and Joe left all in there, and we as an audience should be grateful that this guys are still alive and delivering such high level of art. I liked very much the structure of the story, not confusing at all and keeps you hanging until all comes together. I loved the nostalgic ending that Scorsese approach in this one, revealing the human side of Frank Sheeran at his last days, which is something I've never seen on Marty's mob films. And of course I liked the script, cinematography and the beautiful performances. Bob and Joe I hope get nominations, and Al is a secure bet for supporting actor (although Brad Pitt is very good too). All in all, I still think Goodfellas, The Departed and TWOWS are better movies, but The Irishman if for sure in my top five films of this living legend, MARTIN SCORSESE!"
"malcolmi","8","2","3","28 November 2019"," The Limits of Loyalty and Power. . .
","A thoughtful journey through the landscapes in which the decisions and actions of a man's life bury him in layer after layer of separation from the known, the familiar, the loved, until at last he's alone in a wheelchair, IV plugged into a vein, in the corner of a single room in an extended care facility, at twilight, while the Five Satins croon ""In the Still of the Night"" and the camera fades to black. The story would have been richer if the men's wifes and children had been given voices to speak their perspective on the external shape of this patriarchal world. And Scorsese's yearning fascination with the energies of dark capitalism give the characters of Jimmy Hoffa, Frank Sheeran, and Russell Bufalino more grandeur than their real-life counterparts could ever have deserved. Power, and loyalty cease to be compelling when they're corrupted by flawed morality - they become frightening at first, and then a repellant conduit to the death-in-life of prison, or a hospice bedroom. The actors' craft is so fine that it deserves a more multifaceted, & ultimately more complexly truthful script.
I was thrilled by De Niro's restraint, Pacino's well-tempered pleasure in leadership, and especially by Joe Pesci's gently-expressed implacable will. Pesci's Russell Bufalino is the gravitational centre of this film's world - he welcomes the friendship with De Niro's Frank Sheeran, and accepts Sheeran's loyalty, then reveals how loyalty must give way to the application of 'justice' when hubris requires punishment. And I admire the commitment of all the members of Scorsese's troupe - Bobby Cannavale, Ray Romanow, Stephanie Kurtzuba, Harvey Keitel, Steve Van Zandt, and so many others - for their expert creation of the family, friends, and competitors in that bleak wiseguy world. I was especially pleased to see Welker White playing Jo Hoffa - her role alongside Pacino seemed the perfect fate for her character in Goodfellas as the supercilious young cocaine mule who won't fly without her lucky hat. Her presence made me wish even more strongly that she, and Anna Paquin as Peggy Sheeran, had been given extended voices in the film. Scorsese's work always contains that depth of actor/character texture, and would be richer for giving scope to both sexes.
One other caveat: I wish that Scorsese had found young actors to create the early episodes of Sheeran's story. As De Niro did for Brando in The Godfather Part 2 so someone should have done for each of the three central characters, to amplify the effects of age, time, and consequences, on the men's lives. Despite computer technology, the actors were old from the start, physically and emotionally, in a way which neutralised the effect of their progression through the lives they chose. We want to see the arc of their experiences, rather than to be lodged from the beginning in the weight of the inevitable ending."
"PyroSikTh","8","2","3","28 November 2019"," A Flawed Masterpiece
","The Irishman follows Frank Sheeran, a hitman for the Italian mob from the 50s to the 70s, and his friendships with union boss Jimmy Hoffa and mob boss Russ Bufalino, all culminating in Jimmy's assassination, and Frank's reflection in old age. It has all the hallmarks of a gangster movie that Scorsese does best, the hits, the deals, the respect, the broken families, but without all the glamour. The Irishman marks the end of gangster movies, putting a cap on a previously vibrate genre with a story altogether more sombre and depressing while equally as epic in scope.<br/><br/>The movie does everything it can to strip the glamour away from being a gangster, depicting Frank as a soulless foot soldier without a thought for himself, and ultimately the last one left, to die alone of old age and the lack of dignity that entails. Everybody gets old and dies, even gangsters, and all of life's successes don't mean much when you can barely stand by yourself, you need help going to the loo, and your family have abandoned you to live their own lives. Respect means nothing when there's no-one left to respect or to be respected by.<br/><br/>Talking of old age, I want to use this opportunity to segue into my biggest criticism of the entire movie. De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci are all fantastic actors, and they've all proven that time and time again over the years. They're true icons not just to the gangster genre, but to acting as a whole. Problem is they're all in their late seventies. Late in the movie this is fine as the characters start reaching that age, but early on, despite the untold millions spent on digitally de-aging all three of them, it's not enough. CGI doesn't mask how they move or posture themselves, and they move and posture themselves like a bunch of guys in their late seventies. All the de-aging does is smooth out their wrinkles and give them digital facelifts. At no point is this displacement more apparent than when Frank, in his late 30s, beats up a shop clerk for pushing his young daughter. De Niro no longer has the physicality required to move like a man in his late 30s, and so we get late-seventies chicken arms as he struggles to land the kicks and not fall over in the process.<br/><br/>The actual de-aging itself isn't particularly great either. It is nice and subtle and you would barely even notice it was there if you had no idea about it going in, but because it's subtle, it just looks like old men in makeup. The most successful application is a shot of twenty-something Frank in Italy during WWII, but there's no lines to speak, and no facial close-ups to worry about. De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci never look much younger than their 50s even when they're meant to be young men in the primes of their lives. Where all that money and time went I have no idea, but all you have to do is turn on Scarface or Taxi Driver to see how badly they missed the mark.<br/><br/>At three and a half hours long, The Irishman is the longest mainstream movie released in nearly thirty years, and it makes use of every minute and every second. The editing is tight and well-paced, making those three and a half hours relatively fly by. But the film is not immune to the problems of such a long runtime. Two of the most important scenes in the entire movie go on too long and come so late in the movie that they feel like a drag even if they aren't. Frank's celebration is a sombre scene of warnings and telling glances, exhibiting some fantastic acting moments between De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci, but by the end it starts to feel like gossiping girls with 'he said this' and 'he said that', and goes on so long that it feels meandering and labours the point.<br/><br/>Similarly the final forty minutes or so happens after the climax of the movie. While these are arguably the most important moments in the entire movie, it likewise goes on and on and feels like labouring the point, which can feel anti-climatic after Hoffa's disappearance. You get the big climax the entire three hours of the film has been building up to and, wait, there's still another forty minutes to go as we slowly watch the remaining gangsters get sent to prison, age, and unceremoniously pass away. Don't misunderstand me, these scenes are important, full of great moments, and the movie would be less satisfying without them, but they drag on too long for a movie that's already a huge time investment.<br/><br/>On the acting front, De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci all nail it. Pesci in particular offers potentially the performance of his long career, playing Russ in such a cold and calm demeanour that would be alien to previous Pesci characters, but arguably being way more threatening than even Tommy DeVito. Pacino has some great moments, particularly whenever he berates other people, but also some of the smaller, more intimate moments opposite De Niro. De Niro is also great of course, but I can't help but feel a little miscast as the 6'4 physically imposing Frank Sheeran. Stephen Graham is also a highlight as Tony Pro, and plays off Pacino and the rivalry between the two characters really well. Finally the last one of note is Anna Paquin as the grown-up version of Peggy, Sheeran's second daughter. She gets one line in the entire film, but up until that point her silent glances speak louder than anything else, and her one line becomes ever more poignant because of it.<br/><br/>I feel like The Irishman has been a hard movie for me to judge. It's such a long movie that I'd forgotten many of the earlier moments by the time the film finished. Gangster epics like Godfather Part II and Once Upon a Time in America have always been difficult movies for me to get into, whether I liked them or not, and The Irishman is no different. It's a landmark film that won't be forgotten any time soon, and could easily be considered Scorsese's magnum opus, but I couldn't blind myself to the film's flaws, and found there was too much to distract me from what would otherwise be quite an intellectually challenging movie. I give it a solid 8/10, because ultimately its flaws aren't enough to detract how important this film is and will be to the gangster genre."

","Yes, it has finally arrived and been made. Scorsese has been wanting to do this film for years. THE IRISHMAN focuses on the Life Hitman and Teamster Boss Frank Sheeran who confessed that he was responsible for the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa.
The Film delivers and when I was watching this film, I was thinking GOODFELLAS. Could you imagine DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci in a film together directed by Scorsese!!
The Filmmaking process Scorsese has done is the same as GOODFELLAS but it was different in many ways. 3 hours was worth it. So, the question arouses. Who stoled the Show? I must say, Both DeNiro and Pacino. They ultimately have great chemistry together. Joe Pesci was great as well as crime boss Russell Bufalino. It's best that you watch this on the Big screen. These three legendary actors has accomplished so much in a Film that dealt with character development, suspense and emotion. Yes, There's lots of Violence. Let's face it. It's a new film directed by Martin Scorsese. I never had any issues or flaws except the CGI was sufficient. I paid attention to the story and I followed it through. This is an amazing Film. There's talk already of Oscar Nods for all three actors. So I suggest everyone go to see this film and It's a must. My rating: 8.4"
"ankitthedon-sharma","8","2","3","27 November 2019"," Masterpiece!!..but I would never believe an Irishman!..now onwards.
","Let me get down straight to the point because I have just finished my movie and I am feeling sour about what The Irishman is...we will talk about it later.<br/><br/>Screenplay: centered around De Niro with Pacino playing second major and Pesci having screen presence of around 10-12%. If I had to rate screenplay alone of this movie ...I would give it 6-7... I know what I am saying because I am a huge fan of Scorsese's narrative gansta-land flicks, slow moving but detailed description of events. But don't get me wrong ...this is nothing in front of CASINO and Goodfellas, when it comes to screenplay...let me repeat again..."" In screenplay this movie lacks significantly if not a lot""..Why?..side characters barring a few have not been given many dialogues to speak...events are slowed up intentionally to give Classical feeling..but these things doesn't add up to any meaning this time Martin, or do they?..Besides that, all props and cars and scenarios created, really were able to bring back those 60s-70s onto the screen.<br/><br/>Acting: O man, don't ask me ....DE NIRO is fabulous..He has acted so well that fifteen minutes into the movie , you would fall for him...and your heart would say let this man have 10 Oscars for this movie alone. De Niro is not stopping..I think he won't retire with less than 5 Oscars...and damn the luck of Mr. Joaquin who may again loose this time to Mr Bobby De Niro...who paints houses.ðŸ¤£
PESCI didn't have much scope ..we can say..being moderate...or we can say, that He now ain't the same Guy who used to ask people to fetch shine boxes or ask people if he was being funny while pointing a gun towards them..I would say he looked better stabbing 7 foot tall guys with pens and whatever he could get his hands on.
PACINO as authoritative as always..I think some roles were always meant to be played by AL only, and nobody could have pulled the act of Teamster's leader with such flamboyance...seeing him play Hoffa you get a sense that Scarface isn't dead yet...and I couldn't stop myself from mentioning..I stopped watching the movie when AL died..he is so lovely...and his role is so good and moral and he is so right in whatever he think or does that you as a viewer become biased and take sides...that's what I did...I couldn't see the movie after he died..I couldn't handle my emotions.
I have written so much about acting because it is what is holding pieces together...if this movie is legendary...it is because of the weight BOBBY and Al put in behind their roles...Al had screen presence of 60 minutes less than Bobby ..so I see Bobby grabbing The Golden Lady this year.. my rating to acting- 9.7/10.<br/><br/>CGI- Me and my movie buff friends were quite worried about CGI and whether it would be helpful in hiding the real ages of the three veterans...and astonishingly CGI was effective in the increasing order Pesci, Pacino and Bobby....it looks as if 70% of CGI budget has been put into blurring Bobby's wrinkles ..while Pesci was left as old as he is...Also much work has been done on faces...but what about bodies Martin?...they all looked like old and grumpy men all through the movie...this is huge letdown...I am telling you that because it's too bad to have legends acting, legends directing and you all war like prepared to watch the movie ...but when you see it you feel something is missing...and that's what it is...how can Martin do that with Pesci's face..?..and what about the dropping shoulders of Pacino ...I should again mention BOBBY looked all fine...it looks as if Martin was all worried about him getting an Oscar...which btw he deserves...Hell of an actor.<br/><br/>Background music: Ok... tempting but not quite to be remembered.6/10<br/><br/>Story: Mostly Real events...whatever fiction was there is good and is fine edged....trip is smooth ...until for me Pacino dies(omg ..such a heartbreak) .8/10<br/><br/>
NOW COMING TO THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT: after watching 2:30 hrs something of this movie I was like what the hell did I see..? I mean Martin's characters used to have morals...ain't that what Bobby keeps on saying on various late night shows...Even Gangstas used to have ethics ...now that's what missing... emotional beings like me would never see any resemblance with Bobby's character ..because after all the emotional backdrop that he himself produces...he shots his friend Down.!!!. I would never have done this...not even for 10s and 100s of millions of dollars or with a iron piece to my head...never...I mean this is ridiculous...it is so anti-heroic..We cannot cherish what Bobby did...Martin should have paid heed that in his and Coppola's classics main leads did such things only when they had some solid ethical reason..(whenever they shot one of their own)..and till the shooting Al's character did nothing against the hood... whatever was there was in the wind...was an expectation...and why the hell Irishman and Buffalino guy didn't shoot that Pro guy down instead..??.it baffles me...hence Martin ...
8/10 FROM MY SIDE...
AND CONCLUSION IS THAT I THINK YOU MISSED THE LEGENDARY STATUS FOR THIS MOVIE because of some subtle and some not so subtle reasons. Must watch."
"TheTalentedMrRainMan","8","2","3","27 November 2019"," Pacino absolutely steals this film, my word!
","Pacino is simply a marvel in this film, I can't get over it. He's the oldest guy in the cast, yet the energy he lends the character of Jimmy Hoffa is extraordinary. The man is almost 80 and you could still make a case to say this is one of his career best performances.<br/><br/>Pesci, though, is not far behind and his character here is just as intimidating as we're used to from him, but in a more subtle, refined and chilling approach to his character. Can I just say this guy is a legend and it is just amazing to see him back on screen, at the top of his game? De Niro, too, shows range I never knew he had, and Scorsese adds a field of depth to his character that we simply haven't seen in De Niro's previous gangster films. No doubt the 209 minute running time helped with this!<br/><br/>The running time is indeed a bit overwhelming, but I do strongly suggest still seeing this in one go. Those expecting the 'Goodfellas' vibe will need to adjust their expectations, the first half of the film is more slower paced and establishing, but once this film hits its stride, you'll find yourself gripping the armrests for dear life. Some beautiful exchanges and scenes, and some haunting, melancholy imagery permeate the narrative throughout.<br/><br/>The reflective, nostalgic tone of this film feels like a appropriate homage to these four legends of cinema (including Mr Scorsese); indeed, the entire film feels like a love letter to this buried genre of cinema. De Niro's reminiscence in this film, feels so authentic, almost like he is looking back at his own acting youth.<br/><br/>I'm already looking forward to another re-watch at the weekend. Thank you Marty!"

","DeNiro, trying to be the young tough guy he was 50 years ago. It just doesn't work.
Joe Pesci, who I love, just didn't cut it. he was smirking the whole time, almost in awe of DeNiro.<br/><br/>the movie did not suck, but these guys are just too old, there was literally nothing new here.<br/><br/>What a disappointment."
"michaeltrivedi","4","8","21","29 November 2019"," What?
","I feel I've been too lenient with my star ratings in the past. The Irishman is the perfect place to start correcting my mistakes. You would think the star power of Deniro, Pacino, Keitel, and Pesci would make this movie great, on top of directing by Scorsese. It didn't. This was pretty bad.<br/><br/>Mind you I didn't finish watching the movie. But here's the story from what I recall. A man who begins his career as a driver for the meat industry begins getting into more risky mob related jobs. These are sometimes violent. He rises up and makes a name for himself. Somewhere along the line he joins sides with Jimmy Hoffa, the teamster leader. There he uses his skills to help the guy along the way.<br/><br/>I do not know how the story ends, but I am assuming I would have to watch it sometime or another. This movie was basically about a bunch of old people. It was almost like a PG rated Scorsese mafia movie. Netflix always seems to screw up good movies. They take directors and writers, and back them up, only to turn out horrible end results. This is a prime example. It was interesting having a driver character rise the ranks. There was some dread there. Also, parts throughout the movie had their moments, but were few and far between all the lame moments.<br/><br/>It would have been cool to see some young guys in there with these old guys. And it would have been cooler to see the old guys taking on positions of the mob boss roles seen in Goodfellas and Casino.<br/><br/>I would say skip it<br/><br/>4 stars"

","This was worth the wait. With actors who can be described as icons of cinema, plus a director who is getting even better, if that is possible. This film impresses so much.
This is a long film but it does not seem long, it holds your attention from the very start. It even commands it, such is its power.
This film will be for Martin Scorsese, what "" Once Upon A Time in America was for Sergio Leone. And will become even more appreciated with repeated viewings.<br/><br/>
So much praise has been given to Robert de Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, it is fully justified. Seeing these three actors at the height of their artistic powers, is truly a privilege to value and appreciate. It would come as no surprise if they were all nominated for academy awards. Along with Ray Romano, what a performance by him.
Could Robert de Niro win best actor beating Joaquin Phoenix, the hot favourite for the excellent Joker ?. In one word, yes.
It would be fitting that this film win , Best Picture, Director, Actor in a leading role, supporting actor, editing, cinematography and numerous technical awards. In fact it should sweep the board, with academy nominations and awards.
Finally in my view it was Joe Pesci who stole the show, he has a habit of doing that. Goodfellas is a perfect example. The way he projected power and authority, in a quite, understated way, was simply breathtaking.<br/><br/>The Irishman is not just a film to go see. It is a film to learn from, it is a film to study. It is a look at American history, the past ,even if that past is dark and troubled.
It is a film that we all should be thankful and appreciative to the team involved in it."

","I am not such a big fan of Scorsese, but I was interested in his new netflix-flick: The Irishman. When I saw the reviews flooding in, I immediatly started watching it.<br/><br/>Was it a good movie? Yes.<br/><br/>An oscar winning movie? Not exactly.<br/><br/>This movie has even more characters than Avengers: Infinity war and it's difficult to keep track on them. If you go into the movie without knowing what's it about (like me) goodluck, this movie is going to be a tough one. It has no foundation and it's hard to where it wants to go. It's a 3 hour movie, and with almost no exciting bits it's hard to watch too be honest.<br/><br/>Consensus: The special effects we're amazing and the acting is great. That's about it. I wasn't really invested in the plot and it took me a week to finish the movie. Not a big fan."
"ines_fr","7","1","1","6 June 2020"," A movie that hasn't truly fulfill it's potential
","I am a Scorsese's fan but I believe that this movie is being judged based on the director's reputation above all and not in the movie itself.<br/><br/>I think that it could have focused much more on the psychological aspect of Frank and his inner struggles, namely his regrets for Hoffa's death and the rejection of his daughter instead of spending so much time showing all the people the mafia had killed.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of amazing aspects like the direction, cinematography, and acting but the running time made, in my view, the movie not reach it's full potential.<br/><br/>At a certain point, I was loving the movie but just thought it was enough.<br/><br/>I realised that my review was very different from the one's of people I almost always agree with. That's because they didn't watch it all at once.
But like Scorsese said in an interview, a movie is made to be watched at once and not like a series (although this movie was only available in streaming).<br/><br/>And, honestly, no matter how good the film is, keeping the audience engaged for 3h30 is almost impossible."
"f-06379","8","1","1","31 May 2020"," The Irishman
","Perhaps this is really the best curtain call for a generation of filmmakers and gangsters in the movie. If criminals don't die of immorality, they will eventually wither away. Aging has eaten life. Confession and prayer have become a fixed agenda. Even if you stubbornly refuse to reveal your inner thoughts, even if you know that it will never be easy to get forgiveness from your family, you still want to have a gap for yourself."
"WooderIce64","8","1","1","28 May 2020"," Another Great Scorsese
","With a venerable lineup of crime dramas under his belt, Martin Scorsese produces a film that he has wanted to for a decade; The Irishman. It's based on the book I Heard You Paint Houses, which follows the life of Frank Sheeran, a truck driver who ends up with the South Philadelphia mob, and then eventually with famed teamster Jimmy Hoffa. Robert de Niro, Scorsese's most frequent collaborator, plays the role of Sheeran. Joe Pesci, another frequent face, is in as Russell Bufalino, head of a Pennsylvania based mob family. Al Pacino, famous for his role in The Godfather films, returns to crime dramas and plays the role of Jimmy Hoffa. All three performances are good in their own right, even if they are thrown off by external circumstances.<br/><br/>For those who have seen Goodfellas, there's actually quite a bit of overlap in terms of the way the film is structured. Both have the main character serve a double role as narrator, both follow the life of this character over the decades, and they are similarly edited. With Sheeran also the narrator, it feels almost like a documentary, especially as the country changes and the mob and teamsters with it. The film's editing is also very good, considering how much is packed into the staggering runtime. The main difference with Goodfellas is that The Irishman is told from an elderly Sheeran, a mobster whose life is behind him. The ending of the movie is surprisingly emotional, seeing just how much of a toll that life took on him and how everyone around him got hurt.<br/><br/>We all know from history that Jimmy Hoffa disappeared, and that his body was never found. That being said, it's still surprising when it happens. While the way it happens in this movie may or may not be how it actually went down, it is very impressive that the movie can take the one thing that we know is going to happen and make it one of its biggest surprises.<br/><br/>Another thing that drew people's attention was the de-aging tech used in the movie, which had previously been used in Rogue One and other blockbusters. It doesn't work in this movie. De Niro and Pesci are in their 70s, and Pacino is 80. While CGI can make them look younger again when they are still, no amount of CGI can change the fact that they move like they're 80. Even on a small screen, it's obvious that someone way older than the character is playing them.<br/><br/>One thing must be addressed: the runtime. It's 3 hours, 29 minutes. It's over an hour longer than Goodfellas. Given that it is a Netflix production, it can be watched at any time with any pauses you want. Most of the people who watched this movie did it in multiple sessions, which is reasonable given the runtime. However, this movie is best watched in one go. If you have 3 hours and 29 minutes to watch it, do it. It is best watched in one sitting. It is still acceptable in multiple viewings, and there are guides online with timestamps on when to stop. Netflix also has a 23-minute featurette called The Irishman in Conversation, where Scorsese, de Niro, Pesci, and Pacino talk about the movie. It's recommended for fans of the movie, and it is kind of nice to see them just casually talking about the movie."
"claire-ingham-623-884719","6","1","1","23 May 2020"," Enjoyable if you don't compare it to anything else and can look past the odd CGI.
","I keep seeing in the reviews about Goodfellas and Casino but you can't compare the two really because the difference is youth. Something that is difficult to recreate. The acting and story, both good but I did struggle with the odd CGI eyes. Younger men should have maybe done some of the scenes - such as the grocery store etc but overall it's a good film. Reviews are subjective anyway and what I think, may not be what you think. Go watch it, you'll soon know."
"shabanavdulaj","8","1","1","21 May 2020"," An old cast and crew come together to make probably the last movie of it's kind.
","The movie is a true achievement. There isn't a false note here. The only problems I had with this film are the prolonged ending and the young computer generated De Niro, Pesci and Pacino. Although everyone is praising the VFX's work up and down in the internet, I think that they haven't done a very good job. Maybe they have done the best that could have done, all I'm saying is that De Niro looks like an old guy throughout the entire film.
Now I loved the acting, all the cast did an amazing job. Joe Pesci killed it. He is extraordinary here, very believable. The role of the mature mob boss suits him perfectly and to me he gave the best performance.
De Niro is also good. He has been playing so many gangster roles over the years, he looks like he is home when he's underneath the skin of this guys.
Pacino played my favourite character in this film and although his performance is very decent I think that he has less chances of getting an Oscar nod than the other two legends.
What I also want to point out is the production design. I think that they nailed it, the buildings, the streets, the cars and the whole set is done really well.
Overall I think that this is a very well made film, that will surely test the patience of the average movie goer, it tested mine during the last 30 minutes."

","I love Martin Scoresese, easily one of the best film makers alive. However i belive this film is exellent interms of reincarnating the classic 80s/90s mafia/drama genre that film lovers are passionate about. Indeed this film executes that excellently and was thoroughly enjoyable becasue of that. However, just becasue a film is 3.5 hours long doesnt give it 'depth', it quite frankly makes it a tv series that wants to get into the oscars, with alot of the scenes being enjoyable despite the length passive specatorship will destinquish the audiences attention for the characters and the story. You can also CGI someone to look younger as much as technology lets you, but you cannot CGI a 70 year old (legendary actor)s body language. That scene where he beats up the shopkeeper who hasseled his daughter is very embarrasing to watch and they should've just hired a body double and shot from a different angle to deter the audience from witnissing that somewhat laughable scene that contrasts from what the context of the scene wants the audience to think.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is definitley worth a watch... But unlike Good Fellas and The Godfather, it isn't a classic you can re-watch over and over again.<br/><br/>I was struggling whether to give it a 6 or 7/10."
"DeBBss","8","1","1","13 May 2020"," Scorsese Still Has It
","Scorsese is a directing legend for making gangster movie, and it's been a long time since Scorsese made a movie like The Irishman. I've missed this type of Scorsese and I'm happy that he still has his magic. The Irishman is literally the perfect gangster movie; it has De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci. It's story is based off of real characters and actual events, and it takes its time to tell the story.<br/><br/>The Irishman is very long, but it never got boring to me. There's always something happening and it really immerses you into the story. I love the extreme amount of exposition given at the beginning in Scorsese films, and in The Irishman, you get plenty all throughout the runtime. Some may say that The Irishman is slow paced, but I don't interpret it that way. The story is constantly developing itself and its characters; it took its time to develop everything, and it truly makes a believable story. I also love the dialogue and nicknames in The Irishman, it really gives you that Scorsese feel. The only issue I have with the screenplay is the lack of solid queues for what time period it is. I don't think Scorsese wanted to have texts saying what year it is, but it really confuses you, and you're forced to search up what happened in whatever year.<br/><br/>Every character gets a great level of exposition, as I've said, and this makes all the characters super fun to watch. My favorite part is the chemistry between De Niro and Pacino. Pacino and De Niro make these two characters have a genuine friendship and it being destroyed by De Niro's character (Frank Sheeran) is sad to watch. Because of the great friendship, the character development was done very well. At first, I thought that the story was mainly with Pesci and De Niro, but it was shared between the trio, and that's what setup the third act so perfectly. There's a lot of characters in The Irishman, too many to count, and it can become very overwhelming with all the information, but the writer did a great job with handling all of the characters.<br/><br/>The Irishman was shot very well; it has that Scorsese feel with how it was filmed, so basically, The Irishman has amazing cinematography. One of my favorite parts about The Irishman are the song choices. There's so may rock gems in the soundtrack that it makes The Irishman very pleasing to listen to. One thing that I want to point out are the visual effects. Creating faces as a visual effect is extremely difficult and it takes a lot of time, and they have done a very passable job. There is a little bit of uncanny valley with De Niro's younger face, but it's still very impressive.<br/><br/>The Irishman is a great mobster film; it has all the attributes that's desirable for a gangster movie fan. It's long but entertaining and intriguing. The character exposition and development is expertly written. The acting by the trio of Pesci, Pacino, and De Niro is great, and they give you that gangster feel in the characters. I can see why some people would hate The Irishman, but if you love any Scorsese mobster film, then you're going to enjoy The Irishman."

","It was about 1 hour longer than it should have been. De Niro should not have played young himself because lets be honest he doesn't look young in those scenes no matter how much they dyed his hear and masked his wrinkles. He looks, talks and walks like if he was 60...not 20 or 30... 60 and that scene when he beat up that grocery store owner was awful. Obviously fake punches not because they didn't care but because De Niro is old and fighting with his own body and not that other guy. They should have hired someone younger who (optional) resembles him like they did it in God Father. And frankly this first hour of the movie is utterly pointless. Nothing what happen on screen matters until Jimmy Hoffa joins the story. If they cut the first half of the story and some other pointless scenes later it could have been much more enjoyable movie."

Essentially, we're forced by the self indulgent pacing to patiently listen to an older person tell a long winded story about people and events in which we're quickly losing interest. There's nothing at stake here. Nothing is told that hasn't been better rendered before. Perhaps it would have worked better if it had been more rigorously edited, or possibly expanded into a two or three part limited series, given all the characters and potential story lines introduced.

","If you're looking for a masterclass in filmmaking, ""The Irishman"" proves Martin Scorsese and his cast of legends can do it better than anyone in the game. A profound, compelling and slow-burning masterpiece.
.
In this crime drama, a mob hitman recalls his possible involvement with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa.
.
The hype surrounding ""The Irishman"" is real and if you're a fan of cinema or Scorsese or crime films in general, this is one for the ages. Running at three and a half hours, the length of the film didn't even affect me or those I was with. The length is needed and every detail is necessary in ""The Irishman"". Robert De Niro is superb, Joe Pesci's performance is something you've never seen before; calm and collected, and Al Pacino is absolutely sensational. Upon leaving my seat I felt overwhelmed with emotion and overly satisfied with what I had just witnessed, which was much more than a mob film. Consider this Martin Scorsese's magnum opus and a riveting must-see."

","""The Irishman"" (2019 release; 209 min.) brings the story of Frank Sheeran. as the movie opens, the camera scans through a seniors home and eventually finds Frank, who begins to tell his story. We then go back in time to 1975, when Frank and his wife, along with Russ and his wife, are getting ready for a road trip from Phillie to attend a wedding in Detroit. We then go further back in tine how Frank and Russ first met... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest opus from director Martin Scorsese. This movie has been in development hell for YEARS (over a decade, in fact), but when the right elements finally lined up, Scorsese and his team made the most of it. Robert de Niro (as Frank) has been pushing this project from day 1 and is masterful in the role of Frank, whom we follow over a period of 4 decades or so, from his early days getting involved in the Phillie mafia to his time with Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa (played masterfully by Al Pacinco). But the best performance comes from Joe Pesci (as Russ). As we see this mobster/union power struggle play out, it's never clear who has the final say, and Scorsese doesn't attempt to resolve the issue, and we are left to make our own conclusions. Much as been made about the movie's 3 1/2 hr. running time (without an intermission, I might add) , and truth be told, the movie could've easily trimmed a good 20-30 min. without losing any of its essence. But then again, who can argue with Scorsese? or de Niro?<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" opened this weekend in a very limited theatrical release (before moving the Netflix by the end of the month), and I couldn't be happier that my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was one of those theaters. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was PACKED to the rafters, to no one's surprise. I quite liked it, even if the movie is a bit overly long for its own good. If you are in the mood for another serving of Martin Scorsese-Robert de Niro-Al Pacino-Joe Pesci mobster drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

","The acting was as to be expected from such icons. But the movie is simply too long getting to its premise: what supposedly became of Jimmy Hoffa.

","This is the only film I've seen all year.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, I've seen a whole lot of moving images with weeping actors and swelling music and pretty lighting and expensive CGI and all that. But they weren't actually FILMS, just a bunch of stage directions and cliched gibberish thrown together by lethargic boardroom committees of affirmative action-hired hacks and screentested before herds of ADD-afflicted cattle.<br/><br/>This, on the other hand, is a genuine work of cinema, with every scene a pleasure, culminating in the kind of thoroughly satisfying, harmonious whole that at some undisclosed point in the past decade became just a thing of the past. It's now true to say they don't make them like this anymore: there's no identity politics, no feminism, no product placement, no hiring quotas, no awkwardly-inserted fashionable causes or talking points. Just a really good, solid story, perfectly told, beautifully shot and immaculately acted by every single player in the film. EVERYONE brings their A-game. No-one coasts and grabs the money and runs. It's as if everyone knows this is almost certainly the last mob film Scorsese will ever direct, and they all want to be a part of history, which this is. It's an instant classic.<br/><br/>True, it may retread ground we've walked before in earlier Scorsese movies like Goodfellas, and even later TV shows inspired by those, such as The Sopranos. But we don't care, because that ground is such a rare and rewarding place to be.<br/><br/>Really, the only weak spot I can think of is that de Niro never once looks or sounds like an Irishman, and his blue contact lenses occasionally make his eyes look like some kind of alien lizard. Which is a little distracting. Also, the digital de-aging was possibly not needed. But that's honestly all I can complain of: it's his best performance in over 20 years, all the way back to Jackie Brown and Casino. And it's the best Pacino has been in all that time, too. Amazing to see him working with Scorsese at last.<br/><br/>I don't know how much of the story is true, but then in this case I don't really care all that much, I was just glad to be along for the ride. And even after 3Â½ hours, I didn't want that ride to end."

","This is a dark movie, so perhaps it shouldn't be such a pleasure to watch, but it really is a joy to be guided once more through those mean streets by Martin Scorsese and his A-team, de Niro, Pacino and Pesci. Yes, we've been here before. And yes, the women's roles are underdeveloped, albeit brilliantly acted. But that's the milieu Scorsese and his excellent screenwriter Steve Zaillian are investigating. The depth and the quality of every element is evident in every moment of this long film, which held me enthralled throughout. It is such a relief to return to this level of artistry in an age of facile blood-and-guts merchants like Tarantino. THE IRISHMAN is the real thing. And there's a bonus in a small but perfectly executed, effortlessly threatening cameo from Harvey Keitel. Unmissable."
"heinigrunbaum-786-20424","4","11","33","27 November 2019"," The illusion isn't there
","Sorry. Not so captivating. You wanna watch a Martin Scorsese movie and then tell your friends how fantastic it is. But not this time. Sorry.<br/><br/>Actually from the first scenes in the movie you are being struck by the idiocy of young men moving like old men. I mean, you can make someone younger with modern computer technology, but the way Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino move their hands, their heads, their eyes, their whole body language, completely takes away the illusion associated with cinema. Good cinema is when you believe in everything up there on the silver screen. That belief, that illusion is what sets cinema apart from the theater and sometimes real life.<br/><br/>THE IRISHMAN doesn't capture this illusion and our love for these aging actors (dare I say old?) doesn't make up for it either. A good story well-executed, but the illusion gets broken again and again. Martin Scorsese should had used younger actors since it clearly is much easier to make young actors act like old people rather than having old actors act like young people. That is the simple lesson of this movie.<br/><br/>Oh and, the other lesson is that everybody wants to see a Martin Scorsese movie with Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino. No matter the cost, apparently... (budget + 150.000.000 US dollars)<br/><br/>So were the money well spent? From an audience point of view, from my point of view, the answer to that is a resounding NO ... because the illusion wasn't there... Sorry!"

"treywillwest","9","9","26","15 November 2019"," nope
","We all know that artists are prone to making art about the same thing over and over. Martin Scorsese is certainly prone to this. His latest film could be characterized as his second remake of his own film, Goodfellas. But whereas the first remake, Casino, simply felt like an inferior retread, The Irishman feels utterly different from the first two films, even though it seems to literally have many of the same scenes. It might be a better movie than Goodfellas, and that is saying a lot.<br/><br/>In a way, The Irishman feels like a disavowal of the earlier two gangster films, in which organized crime was depicted as a negation of the mundane and an attempt at transcendence. Here, gangsterism is the mundane par excellence. It is what makes society and history move forward, it IS the everyday reality. The main character, Robert De Niro's Frank Sheeran, doesn't aspire to criminality. He finds himself a hitman the way some people find themselves in any job- by sheer luck and an appropriate resume- four years of killing people in WWII. So, seemingly, do most of the characters we meet. They don't seem to have tried to get into this world, they are just in it, and don't question it's rules- one of which is a near guarantee of a violent death. In a very real sense, these are very passive people.<br/><br/>The one major exception is Jimmy Hoffa, played by Al Pacino. One of the ways this film is uncharacteristic for the director is that the traditional Scorsesean protagonist, they who assert their own, absolute law in the name of transcendence, is here a supporting character. And unlike most of Scorsese's other transcendentalist-characters, we of course know Hoffa is doomed from the start. This is by far Scorsese's saddest movie, of any genre. Indeed, if one were to try to describe what it is trying to evoke with one word it would probably be ""regret."" This film could probably only have been made by a bunch of old people. And Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino, and Joe Pesci, the film's third lead, are all in their 70s at this point.<br/><br/>De Niro has been phoning it in, at best, for years, maybe decades now. He sure makes a comeback here. This is one of his strongest performances ever, and possibly his single most vulnerable. I've rarely seen an actor convincingly convey so many different stages of a character's life. The film is so long we almost feel like we're aging with Sheeran, but that's not in any way a criticism. We come to feel the way that memory has salted the character's wounds.<br/><br/>Pesci gives a performance that noone could have thought him capable of. He's actually subtle, and utterly magnetic. His Russell Bufalino isn't an evil man, exactly. Murder has shaped his world from the start even more than it has those of the other characters.<br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum, Pacino reveals that he can now only be Pacino. It's a good thing that in this context, his strutting, shouting-self works, because it's not really a performance, it's just schtick. I remember watching his films from the 1970s and thinking he was a good actor. He's always had presence to spare. I wonder now if he ever had anything else.<br/><br/>There is a sense in which this film's message is no less mundane than that everyone, regardless of the choices they make, will die one way or another, and that we all must face death, in the most ultimate sense, alone. But we must compare the way that the asserter-transcendentalist dies, unknowably but possibly without regret, with the very knowable, inevitable end of the rule followers. Perhaps Hoffa is marginal exactly because old Scorsese is finally throwing up the white flag in the quest for transcendence, he's acknowledging that it's probably always only been a myth, like Jimmy Hoffa has become. If that is what he is doing, then it is ironic that he does so in what might be his most transcendent work of art."

I'm glad I wasn't the only one who found this film to be ""slow-moving"". I'd say you could have easily cut out at least 30 - 45 minutes out of the film and would have would up with a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Overall, I saw it in the theatre since Deniro, Pacino, Pesci and Scorsese collaborated, but if you ask me had I known what I know now, I would have told you I'd skip this one and instead rewatch ""Heat"" (1995), ""Casino"" (1995), ""Once upon a time in America"" (1984) and ""Godfather: Part 2"" and would get a much better ""fix"" than watching the film.<br/><br/>However, since art house flicks like this one are a dying breed, the Oscar season is coming up and if you're a fan of the actors / director, go see it ... it's always amazing to watch Deniro, Pacino and Pesci together on the big screen."

","Having Pacino, DeNiro and Pesci in these roles 25 years ago would have been perfect. They were 3 of the screens best mobsters, right up there with Cagney, Bogart and EG Robinson. But unfortunately old age and/or death comes to all of and this trio are respectively 79/76 & 76 which makes them far to old to play characters that exist in a time frame from 1955-75, for about 90% of the the 3:30 running time, which is long even for a Scorsese film. But then Hollywood loves to sanitize war and cop movies by usually having guys in their 40's & 50's in positions that in real life would be filled by young men who tend to believe they are immortal and in an effort to prove their manhood will do incredibly risky things. My guess is that OC works much the same way-most of the foot soldiers are younger although the old mobsters remain targets. In any case, ""The Irishman"" is an interesting film, bringing back a number of other actors who previously worked for Scorsese on his other mob films or appeared in ""The Sopranos"" or ""Boardwalk Empire"" among others. If you can get past the age discrepancy it's not bad although DeNiro's perpetually laconic and laid back portrayal of the title character worked better for Robert Mitchum in his day. Way too long though-could have easily edited an hour from this. My guess is Netflix might eventually break this up into a 4-5 episode series, probably other footage they could throw in."

There was the ""he's in the witness protection program"" one, the Government killed him one, the mob killed him one, he moved to Burlington Island and shares it with the Jersey Devil one, and then my personal favorite...he's dead and buried in the Meadowlands.<br/><br/>So, I now lived long enough to watch the best of mob films and TV series, etc., and looking back, I think I now could believe any of those stories could relate to the Hoffa mystery, but if there was one to be told in film and who could tell it, I had no doubt it would be Martin Scorsese, and here it is.<br/><br/>This is an amazing piece of work from an amazing Director who is telling a ""story"", with his touches needed, but making you feel like someone at the end of their life, is telling you a story of a mystery - a story you believe, or you don't. But for me, I can.<br/><br/>Scorsese got the best actors in the roles to make this tale believable. Al Pacino rocks as Jimmy Hoffa, as I believe he was and there has to be an Oscar nod there. Robert De Niro, our storyteller, is utterly believable in his role, another Oscar performance there too. The question left for us is -- is ""Mr. Paint Houses"" telling real? Did it happen this way? And Joe Pesci...Joe Pesci -- my goodness -- he was phenomenal in this role because he was not playing what you expect, what you may have type-cast him in -- and because of which, he did it soooo well, Oscar nod...and dare I say shoe in win? We'll see.<br/><br/>For me, ""The Irishman"" took me back to those pre-teen days when this was unfolding and happening and in the news and the papers because when names were mentioned...I was like ""Hey..! I remember that name!"" And the hit at the restaurant - I remember that too, it was in the papers. I was remembering - because...I did...forget. And that to me was such an interesting part of this tale. I remembered. However, at the beginning and end of this film it was mentioned how this generation doesn't know about Jimmy Hoffa. True, but think about that statement. It's really a double edge comment, and gets to the heart of the telling of this tale.<br/><br/>And Scorsese unfolds this tale of admission. He has always told a story, but this is done in such a manner, it grips you. You question. You're not gonna get the high skilled kill mob count you might expect, as this is a tale about one, told by one you'll either believe...or you continue to chase after the other ""theories"" (which they GOTTA be doing because 30 years went by before they could check up on Sheeran's tale, and up to 2018 with the Documentary 'Riddle' we STILL don't know) --, but the time of Hoffa was more than interesting with government, FBI, the unions, crime, Presidents, paid pardons -- and there are parallels in this tale that remind you of what is happening right now -- which makes you wonder - gee, times may not have changed at all, which is why films like this -- are important to remind all of that very same fact."
"BlueSkies765","10","5","12","30 November 2019"," Scorsese never disappoints
","Scorsese was able to create a movie that adds something new to a genre that already has many classics. The movie is based on true events. It's a bit of history it was interesting to learn about Jimmy Hoffa and how the unions worked back then.
Scorsese also did a great job of showing the tragic dimensions that the destructive lifestyle of the mafia creates. In The Irishman the value of human life is explored in-depth and this is how it stands out. A movie over 3 hours long it spend much time exploring topics like the bonds between people and guilt. The Irishman was also beautifully shot and of course there were a lot of phenomenal performances. A memorable movie."

","If you start watching this film thinking you are going to be watching Goodfellas 2 or Casino 2 you will be disappointed. Just because it is by the same director and stars the same actors doesn't mean it's related. It's a completely different story.
Yes the film is very long. It's about ageing mobsters. Joe Pesci has slowed down in the last 25-30 years. He's not a psychotic murderer like in Goodfellas and Casino because it's a different story. This film is about the acting and the story not the shocking ultra violence.
People are focusing on the CGI, that it's not good enough? I thought it was excellent. De Niro is in his 70s. You can't make him look like a 21 year old man but they did a good job of portraying him in his 30s. Same as Joe Pesci.
Speaking of Joe Pesci any real fan of Goodfellas and Casino will love seeing this guy back on the screen with De Niro. You will never get these two on the screen again, especially with Al Pacino as well. Not to mention one of the best cast films I've seen in years. The type of movie you enjoy watching to recognise some great actors from your favourite shows.
Film fans have trouble watching long films these days and I don't blame them with fast paced big films of the marvel era. You will not get that here but what you will get is a sprawling gangster biopic beautifully shot with amazing actors, script and soundtrack."

","The premise that Frank Sheeran was behind the murder of Jimmy Hoffa is tenuous at best and so this movie postulates what could've happened versus what did and among the many theories espoused about Hoffa's disappearance this one has much less credibility.
Beyond that I found the movie started to drag out and the last half hour was to the point of unbearable. To keep a viewer interested in a three hour flick is a tough act with the best of stories but there just wasn't enough meat on the bones of this story to hold my attention for that long. To me this film was worth watching for Joe Pesci alone and while De Niro and Pacino but in a solid effort I found nothing really all that worthy that they didn't deliver in other films of higher caliber. Probably best this movie went to Netflix as a theatrical release would've strained people's attention spans."

The young DeNiro as a ""tough guy"" was completely unbelievable with a creepy deaging - makeup / cgi job - he walked and looked like the 76 yold he is in real life. Pacino looked just weird as Hoffa. The story line was so predictable as soon as Hoffa was introduced as a character and became friends with Frank you knew Frank was going to be involved with his ""disappearance"".<br/><br/>If you are looking to watch a Mob movie you would be far better served watching the Godfather movies, Goodfellas or watch the Sopranos which are all far better than this stinker..."

","With all of its violent pageantry, watching a Scorsese film always feels like there's something larger at stake, but The Irishman just felt insincere to this Scorsese standard; the B-Side of Scorsese. I'm not sure what we can get out of The Irishman that we haven't already seen before, and at 3 and a half hours, it's quite the chore to find the answer to that question. A movie centered around an ""Irishman"" who couldn't feel less Irish as the least interesting of the three main characters. Al, Bobby and Joe turn in matter-of-fact performances that rest on their most easily recognized mannerisms; Joe handing in the clearest attempt at something new. Would it have been a worse movie to get guys in there who can play their age for 70% of the movie? There are no memorables here, as a movie about old men gangsters just comes across as an old man gangster movie. As the ""Irishman"" says, ""It is what it is."""

The Irishman is a total misfire in so many ways, i don't know where to begin. Most of all, the main actors are in their late seventies. That is simply embarrassing for them. No amount of cgi will erase stiff joints whilst playing a thirty year old.
The movie could have been two hours long, not three and a half hours long. There was simply no reason for this movie to be so long. And yes, it dragged. I find these auteur directors definitely need a producer breathing down their neck to edit, edit, edit.
It took me two nights to finish this fiasco once I was invested in it. It seemed like it went on two weeks.

","Sorry for being pragmatic but, why Robert De Niro, the typical American actor, to play the Irish man? Then, why 3 hours? I hadn´t seen that length since Titanic, which I could appreciate as there was action all the way through , but not here. I was attracted by the first scenes where I could see again some ageing actors and well-known director, but here is the problem: the same actors are supposed to play 30 years younger, except that they don´t look more than a couple of years younger, at best. Then, because the cast is ageing, all the ´action´ is slow. It may be fine for an ageing audience who will be happy to see their ageing stars but I am not this old yet. I am not rating this as I am not planning on watching it until the end, life is too short.

","Sometimes you can't go home again. With ""The Irishman"" director Martin Scorsese takes one too many trips to the mafia well. Watching this movie often feels like you're watching a summer reunion tour of a bunch of old rockers but not nearly as fun. ""The Irishman"" does have some nice moments but it goes on forever. It needed some serious script editing. It often feels like Scorsese and company were picking up scraps from other (better) gangster movies. As far as the performances go, they weren't so hot. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci all have a couple of good moments but they also seem to be on auto-pilot much of the time. As far the CGI goes, De Niro looked more ill than young in those scenes. Netflix claims that they spent zillions on this production but it doesn't look like it. It has the cheap look of a made-for-tv movie (which is what it is). At the end of the day, ""The Irishman"" isn't that good. It ends up dragging down the batting average of all the talent involved. Dishonorable mention: the casting of church basher Jonathan Morris as the nursing home priest."

"evanston_dad","8","4","9","5 December 2019"," ""Goodfellas"" Redux
","""The Irishman"" is the most ""Goodfellas""-ish movie from Martin Scorsese since 1995's ""Casino."" That's a long time for devotees to wait to see the master director return to the format he virtually invented. Is the wait worth it? Yes and no. ""The Irishman"" is no ""Goodfellas,"" but I'm also not sure it's trying to be, though it's almost impossible not to compare it. For the first half of the film, it's hard not to be dogged by the sense that we've seen all this before but by artists (many of them the same artists) who had more energy for it twenty and thirty years ago. But then late in the movie, we realize that this film has more on its mind than being yet another retread of a mob life epic, and it's the film's last, quiet moments that earn it a place of its own in Scorsese's canon rather than just a Scorsese rip off of Scorsese.<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" is very long, but I didn't feel its length that much. And it's the last half hour or so that gives the film it's punch, and only because of everything that's preceded it, so I wouldn't want it to be any shorter. This movie continues past the point where films like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" end and suggests that the sometimes hellish life of being a gangster may be nothing compared to the hell of growing old. The main character, played by Robert De Niro, is a mafia ""yes"" man, carrying out orders while trying hard not to think too much about them. As a result, he gives pretty much his entire allegiance to one man (played by Joe Pesci), while alienating everyone else in his life, from his family to close friends (notably Jimmy Hoffa, played by Al Pacino). What happens, then, when the man from whom you've always taken your orders is no longer around to give them? What happens when everyone else who has comprised the very small world in which you have lived has died and left you behind? What happens when you have nothing but time to reflect on the man you have been and the things you have done? What happens when the one thing that made you feel vital no longer exists? It's not hard to believe that Scorsese the filmmaker is using this film to ask himself some of the questions he asks of his characters, and that's what gives ""The Irishman"" a sense of ruminative pathos and makes something richer out of what could have been a glib genre exercise.<br/><br/>This is a pretty engrossing, always entertaining, and at times very funny film. But there is one major drawback that I had a heck of a time getting past, and I'm not sure I ever did completely. And that's the fact that everyone in this is simply too old to be playing the characters they're playing. Robert De Niro, vibrant as he may still be, is 76 years old, and, de-aging digital technology aside, he cannot pull off thirty and forty. He and Pesci, similarly de-aged, just look weird and kind of creepy for a good part of the film, and even if the technology can make De Niro look somewhat younger, he still moves like an old man, something most noticeable in a scene where he kicks the crap out of a grocery store owner. At times the movie smacks of a bunch of kind of sad old dudes who are past their prime trying to recapture the glory days of their youths, but then again, given where the movie goes, maybe that's part of the point.<br/><br/>One thing, or rather one person, I can heap unqualified praise on is Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa. Pacino OWNS this movie. He hasn't been this good in a long, long time.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","On a lazy weekend evening, you have the rest of the day all for yourself to kill, with a bottle of Scotch in your hand. 'The Irishman' will definitely be your perfect company to savour.<br/><br/>Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a World War 2 veteran, narrates his time as a hitman. ""Painting the house"" as they call it, Frank does the hitman jobs for Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), the head of North Eastern Pennsylvania Crime Family and Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the head of International Brotherhood of Teamsters in the 50s to 70s. Hoffa gets into trouble when President JFK's brother, Attorney General Robert F Kennedy arrests him. While President Nixon grants him a conditional pardon, Hoffa does things that does not go well with other crime families.<br/><br/>The movie runs for a 3.5hrs and if you enjoy the language of the 60s/70s and a fan of De Niro and Al Pacino, you will have a blast watching this. The plot as such is complex with too many supporting characters, happening over a 30-year period. Yet, the screenplay keeps us interested throughout with its twists and turns happening in the lives of Sheeran - Russell-Hoffa trio. Another noteworthy element is the deep-fake of the characters' younger versions that is seamless.<br/><br/>Go for it!"

It's absolutely beautiful. All these progressive actors came together one last time to show how open-minded and non-dogmatic they were. And how did they do that? By making a dogmatic, narrow-minded movie that subtly bashes the religion of their ancestors. I'm sure all their ultra-orthodox grandparents would be proud of them. They'll be seeing them soon. I hope these men enjoyed their time here on earth, because its nothing compared to eternity. The only real question I have is this: when Robert, Al, Joe, Ray and Martin are sitting in a hospital bed, a few years from now, facing the last hour of their life, will they call for a Catholic Priest to administer the last sacrament?

In fact many of the scenes, even the family scenes it would appear that Deniro might be a grandfather or great grandfather but in this movie was the dad. However the actors are so good it still is a good movie to watch. I just wish it was done with yuh younger actors.

","For some reason I could tell almost from the outset that I was watching a Scorsese movie. To be honest, the movie registered with me in much the same way as did Scorsese's Goodfellas and Casino. The difference being the dialogue for The Irishman was just expanded and some extra scenes were added making the story more detailed. Of course whenever Scorsese makes a crime film he employs his regular cast. I thought all of the performances were good except for possibly Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa. I think he could have been a little more subdued.<br/><br/>A lot was made of the ""digital make-up"" used to make the characters age. I thought it worked just fine.<br/><br/>If you like the Scorsese crime films, you will like The Irishman. It is a long movie so there is an investment of 3 1/2 hours. It wouldn't have bothered me a bit if they'd have trimmed some time off it, maybe even an hour. Purists will want my head for even thinking such a thing.

","I went into this expecting a high energy conclusion to the Good Fellas/ Casino era..a kind of trilogy to the mob influence on American culture. While the movie did attempt to deliver on this the conclusion was a kind of geriatric ward for once robust acting giants. I was most excited to see the return of Joe Pesci and all we got was a husk of a performance. He seemed half asleep and frankly it felt like he didn't want to be with here. DeNiro just bounced from scene to scene making faces and kind of got through it adequately. Harvey Keitel was hardly in it.<br/><br/>The one saving grace was Al Pacino. He ran away with every scene he was in. He didn't just coast on a once relevant reputation. One of his best performances in years.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction seemed a little off..overbloated script with sudden bursts of violence that weren't very memorable.

There is 1 scene in which Robert actually ""fights"" or pushed and kicks a guy, and he almost loses his balance because he's old!

Stephen Graham & Al Pacino's playing of each others enemy brings some unforgettable moments, violent and vulgar yet adding great comical relief. Robert DeNiro's best work in a long time, torn completely between his relationship to Joe Pesci's Russel Buffalino and Al Pacino's Jimmy Hoffa.

"LF1984","10","4","9","28 November 2019"," Truly Unforgettable
","I was fortunate enough to see this film in a cinema several weeks ago and I revisited it again on Netflix. For 3 1/2 hours I was taken on an unforgettable journey with these amazing actors bringing these characters to life.
The film really takes it time to delve deep into these characters lives and relationships and that was appreciated and made for such a powerful and moving experience. It's a sprawling tale spanning many decades and events in history.
No surprise that the film is so well made. Everything is pitch perfect from the camera work, music, costumes and production design.
Needless to say the acting is phenomenal. Al Pacino easily does his best work for at least 20 years as Jimmy Hoffa and reminds us how great he is. Joe Pesci is truly outstanding, such a different character to what he is typically know for but he is unforgettable in this role. But towards the end of the film it hit me how great Robert DeNiro can be. The film centers on his character and he carries it with such a masterful performance. Also one of his best roles for at least 20 years. I hope they all receive the recognition they deserve. It's such a special treat to see them share so much quality screen time together in a film deserving of their talents. It's cinematic history.
The film is so dense and has so much to say. For days after seeing this film I couldn't stop thinking about it and the more I thought about it the more I liked it. I think it's typical of Martin Scorsese's movies that you need to give them time to digest to truly appreciate what he's created. I found the extended epilogue to be really haunting and heartbreaking. For me that's what really brought this whole saga together and realised what the filmmakers were trying to say. I found myself reflecting on my own life and legacy and it's definitely changed my view on life. Very few films I've ever seen had such a profound effect.
I loved this movie. To me it stands shoulder to shoulder with the best crime films ever made and really is one of Martin Scorsese's best films. He's created something really incredible here and it's already one of my all time favorite movies. A masterpiece and an instant classic that will never be forgotten."

","Size matters... or not, depending on the point of view of who is opining. But length matters for sure, independent on enything else. 3 h and 20 min???... are you sure Mr. Scorsese you have enough to tell to fill every minute of the footage with reasonably interesting scenes and dialogues?. Well, I understand that Netflix would not have put such a huge amount of money to gather such an splendid cast and offer such great production values should it not have received in turn a product that could be splitted in 3 or 4 parts for streaming broadcasting. But hey!, we went to the cinema to watch it, and the rules of the game are different here. No less than 1/3 of the film is redundant, uninteresting and lacking of rythm, and the second half ends up really boring and tiring. Interpretations are fine in general, great Pesci and Keitel, good De Niro, Ok Pacino (in line with his performances of the last 45 years); a pity that Anna Paquin and her character were not given more time and relevance in the film and instead so many tough guys hard-talk that goes nowhere is allowed so much footage time.<br/><br/>Finally, was it really necessary yet ANOTHER Mafia film with basically the same premises as the old good ones we all have in mind and in this occasion centered in a dark, and nowadays forgotten, personage as Jimmy Hoffa??. Silence was also a flawed film, but at least it had the interest of showing us some relevant historical events that are very unknown by the public. However, In the case of The Irishman, it all feels as a Déjà vu, a product crafted specifically for the show of a bunch of actors in the very last stages of their (otherwise) brilliant careers.... 6/10, mainly for respect to Mr. Scorsese and most of the actors, but actually it would deserve less."
"trelerke-politics","5","8","23","16 November 2019"," pointlessly long rehashing of ugly organized crime with great actors, see it on Netflix
","First, the Hoffa story here does not comport with reality, after his prison term, he was washed up as an active leader, this pissed him off, he got increasingly crazy and threatening to the mob bosses. He was finally taken out and we don't really know what happened, see ""living in Hoffa's Shadow"" by O'brien. More to the point, although composed of a great many wonderful scenes, it didn't cohere as a movie, a particularly long movie. Much better to see it on Netflix, treat it like a limited series. Sure, we get to see Deniro and Pacino and Petchi, and others act together, but it's mostly the equivalent of sketch drama. Petchi and Deniro talking about ""it is what it is"" Pacino in front of the union crowds. Awesome, but not 3.5 hours awesome. Many of the professional reviews extolling the Irishman are mostly nostalgic about some great mafia movie past, per Scorcese and Coppola, but really? do we need yet another lovingly recreated long form treatment of these essentially heinous people doing heinous things. On top of it, these people are simply ugly, inside and out, driving shiny vintage cars. Hoffa and the others helped to betray and corrupt the union movement in the US, making it easy to vilify unions generally, hell the Kennedy's hated unions because of corrupt creeps like Hoffa. Maybe an indepth story investigating this angle would be intriguing. On top of this, the movie itself was simply confusing, the killing of Hoffa, which NO ONE officially has any idea of, was treated in a very confused manner, the step son was driving the car that takes Deniro to the hit on his father, what of this step son. Anyway, this really doesn't matter, it's a worthy Netflix viewing over 3-4 nights. And yes, they're are many Oscar worthy performances in the movie, probably too many, but on Netflix you can rerun these moments to your hearts content."

The Irishman, like its aging gangsters, is a product of a bygone era. A lot of people like to say that ""they do not make movies like they use to"" Well, Scorsese has, with this powerful tale of loyalty, betrayal and regret. De Niro has not been this good since the mid 90s. Pesci, who came out of retirement for this role, gives as good of a performance as he has ever given.

There is a brilliant extended sequence where you're anticipating an action to occur and for most of it you get to observe the gut-wrenching emotions on Robert DeNiro's face. Al Pacino and Joe Pesci round out the legendary acting trifecta and both bring their A-game as well.<br/><br/>The de-aging visual effects were spotty at times, but you do sort of get used to it. Yes, the length could have been shortened, but at no time was I ever bored. The most noteworthy aspect of the film is the focus on contemplation of a life of crime and the attempt at reconciliation for said amoral actions.

","This is Scorcese's anti-mob film.<br/><br/>The last 40 minutes of The Irishman put everything up until then into a new light. Suddenly everything makes sense and the film becomes a heartbreaking and poignant epilogue to gangster culture and its violent history.<br/><br/>Speaking of violence, the Irishman is violent but in no way glorified (nor is it in any of his other films)... in fact it's quite the opposite. The violence here is quick, brutal, cold and almost cowardly, where respect can become naivety and get you killed.<br/><br/>It's this respect that Scorcese is more interested in depicting; the familial bond these gangsters have with one another and the respect they have for each other.<br/><br/>This is a sombre tale of regret and broken families, isolation and loneliness, a violent tale of power and betrayal, and overall a tale of powerful men that gain strength through each other, and the respect of others.<br/><br/>That said, my main criticism is that yes, it is indeed too long. That's not to suggest that the film doesn't earn its runtime, like I said the last 40 minutes really do hit hard.<br/><br/>It's in those last 40 minutes where the lack of a strong female presence throughout the film is justified and actually benefits the message it's trying to send. Still, I think it was a missed opportunity not have a stronger female role in the film.<br/><br/>My other issue would be the CGI... whilst it is fantastic, there some scenes where the elderly bodies of the actors with young heads really drew me out of the immersion as it just looked bizarre.<br/><br/>Overall The Irishman is a long and rather downbeat story with a lot to say but only at the end... the plot isn't anything remarkable and has similarities to Scorsese's previous films but stick with it to the end and its guaranteed to have you thinking for a while afterward."

","I've been wanting to watch this movie since it was first announced and after they released it on Netflix and highly praised reviews started popping out all over the internet I was even more eager to grind my teeth into this ""another crime masterpiece of Scorsese's"" but for some reason have been delaying it until tonight. And maybe because of my mountain high expectations I disliked the movie from the beginning. SGI and de-aging visuals were very poorly executed and whereas the main characters should all have been 40-ish looked just over 60 anyway. Bad that's OK, accuracy in a Scorsese movie is simply forgivable if a script is great and it sadly wasn't the case either. Who wrote the script? It feels like the majority of the lines were improvised by actors on the spot, I haven't witnessed more repetitive and incoherent dialogues in my whole life. Robert De Niro plays a parody of Robert De Niro, I don't know if it was intentional, but it was surely annoying to see him walk through the whole 209 minutes wearing the same facial expression of grumpiness. Sad. Al Pacino was at times overacting but overall good and I enjoyed his performance a lot better but Joe Pesci, having returned from his retirement for this movie, was absolutely brilliant. Overall the movie seems to be no more than a recollection of memories told by an old man in agony to get them off his chest before he dies; it doesn't show any growth of characters (exactly because all of them were old) whatsoever but is nevertheless a very fine movie."

","First Hit: An in-depth, introspective, and a sliver of a story into the mob world's connection to Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>This was a historical storytelling film of the life of ""The Irishman"" Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro). To make this happen, we begin and end this movie with Frank sitting in an old folks home telling the story of his life.<br/><br/>The young Frank begins with his being back from his WWII stint in Italy, and now a truck driver delivering meat. He finds that he can skim some of the carcasses off and sell them for extra side money. In doing so, he slowly begins to sell to mobsters who appreciate a good deal. A chance meeting, followed by a more formal introduction with rising mobster Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) begins a lifelong friendship. Russell gets Frank odd jobs including painting houses (which is a mob euphemism for murder) as needed by the mob.<br/><br/>Getting caught arriving at a store, that purchased the meat, with an empty truck, the trucking company wants to convict him for theft. What happened to the meat? Frank sold it to gangsters but acts as if he's no idea what happened to the beef in the truck. It is one of the few amusing scenes in the film.<br/><br/>Frank knows the value of keeping his mouth shut, and this trait along with his support of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters run by Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), Frank gets a new job being Hoffa's chief bodyguard.<br/><br/>The movie generously uses CGI to move these characters back and forth through at least 50 years of life. From young men in their 20s and 30s to old men in their 70s and 80s. For the most part, it worked well.<br/><br/>We follow these three gentlemen through their lives, including mob family wars for power.<br/><br/>We watch them fight with the government about expanding to Cuba and the Castro regime. We watch them struggle with John F. Kennedy's election and subsequent assassination. We see how Bobby Kennedy tried to bust up the unions and Hoffa in particular, because of how Jimmy loaned the mob millions of dollars, interest-free, in union pension funds. In fact, the film makes a point of indicating that union pension funds built Las Vegas by the mob.<br/><br/>There are softer moments in the film like how Frank's daughter Peggy (Anna Paquin as the older Peggy) visibly disliked Russell but liked Hoffa. The story also has a few tender moments of Frank and his second wife, Irene (Stephanie Kurtzuba).<br/><br/>The scenes are shot with an authentic and matter of fact feel to them, not splashy. One-shot that stuck with me was when Russell takes Frank to a small airport to get on a plane to meet Hoffa in Detroit; the camera looks out the tiny private plane window to see Bufalino sitting in the Lincoln. Russell will wait in the car until Sheeran returns after meeting Hoffa. There was something about this shot that brought the craft of even the small things matter to the forefront.<br/><br/>De Niro was excellent as the Irishman turned mob strong arm and Bufalino confident. The scenes with the priest towards the end were powerful as De Niro showed a lot of skill in his refusal to deeply go into making amends. Pesci was terrific as mobster Bufalino. The scene when he and Frank are just getting to know each other and speaking Italian with Russell asking him how he learned to speak Italian was very engaging. Pacino as Hoffa was convincing. I've no idea of who Hoffa was privately, but the way Pacino portrayed him here made it feel real. Paquin as Peggy was perfect. She knew deep inside who her father was and what he did, and her way of keeping her distance and her looks of disapproval were excellent. Harvey Keitel was sublime in his brief scenes as mobster kingpin, Angelo Bruno. Steven Zaillian wrote a strong and in-depth screenplay from the book ""I Heard You Paint Houses."" Martin Scorsese showed his strength in using actors he knows and trusts to bring another compelling Italian mob film story to the screen.<br/><br/>Overall: Although very informational, it was a long film."

"mmanville","5","3","6","27 December 2019"," I really wanted to like this, and did enjoy it the first 1/3, but ... the editing, the terrible pacing, ugh
","First, the good: some great acting, especially the supporting roles (Pesci in particular, but also Pacino).<br/><br/>Next, the adequate: DeNiro was not as great as he has been, so many, many times before. I'm judging his performance by the standards that he had a difficult task, to convey his character motivations though body language and facial expressions, because he had a ton of lingering shots in this 3+ hour movie, and not a whole lot of dialog towards that end, that was mostly driving plot action (memorable phone call and conversation with daughter near end notable exceptions). Perhaps the message he was trying to convey is that Sheeran was not that interesting or motivated a person, he just did what he was told and tried to (and mostly succeeded in) not thinking about it, but if that was the intent, then I have to question, why even make the movie, especially one this long & this focused on one person's experience?<br/><br/>Now the bad. This movie was in SERIOUS need of a strong editor; vast sections could have been cut out. Understand I'm not saying there are sections that are inherently bad in & of themselves, I'm saying there are just too many good or even greatly acted scenes that are simply just too redundant to each other, or too extraneous to the central theme. The movie was stuffed chock full of ""moments,"" ominous conversations etc that probably would seem great in an isolated clip, but in aggregate bog the pacing down too much. I think less of this indulgence earlier in the movie could have allowed Scorsese to make the climactic action (the last, most significant hit -- avoiding spoilers here!) have the big buildup that he clearly wanted it to have, without having to ""dial it up to 11"" to achieve that. It's like putting salt on food: if you use it sparingly in general, where it's really needed you don't have to add much to really have an effect. But if you pour salt on everything, all the time, at a certain point if you really want to get that flavor you have to dump a ton on, and it will end up covering up whatever flavor nuance you have. This is what I felt like was happening in the buildup to the climactic moment. Since watching I've been reading about the history of this movie, trying to figure out why there was so little editorial control put on this movie, why no one could stand up to Scorsese to tell him to tighten it up. As far as I can tell, Netflix just wanted the ""prestige"" so badly that they gave him total control, and, well, while I guess I can't blame him for reveling in that, I think (like most creative storytelling) it would have benefited greatly from a good strong editor, but Scorsese got the agreement to indulge himself from the start (not unlike Jackson with ""The Hobbit"")<br/><br/>Also ""bad"" was that was such a literal, true retelling of a story from a book that any and nearly every objective, informed observer knows was a load of BS. Read the article ""The Lies of the Irishman"" in Slate for the full explanation. Sheeran simply made up stuff in his last months so his daughters could share in the profits of the book that was made from it; his claim he was the hitman in the Crazy Joe hit is particularly contradictory to eyewitness accounts that the real killer was a short Irish guy (Sheeran was 6'4"" ! ), and for example the FBI agent depicted in the book and end of movie as coming to him asking him to tell the story because he was the last one still alive in real life has never believed he did any of the hits that the book says he did."

","This epic mobster film, based on the book I Heard You Paint Houses, by Charles Brandt, runs 3 hours and 29 minutes but it felt longer to me. This true story follows meat delivery driver Frank Sheeran who has a cute meet with mobster Russell Bufalino at a gas station, becomes a hitman for him and his crime family, loses his daughter's respect in the process, and gets closely involved with Union Boss Jimmy Hoffa, leading up to Hoffa's murder.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro plays Sheeran, the Irishman, with some distracting de-aging and blue contact lenses. Joe Pesci plays Russell Bufalino; his performance was the best part of the film for me. I worked with him on three films and he is a soft-spoken, sweet guy who I have good memories of. Al Pacino plays Jimmy Hoffa. Ray Romano brought levity to the role of the slimy lawyer, Bill Bufalino. Harvey Keitel, Anna Paquin, and Bobby Cannavale also star.<br/><br/>I watched the film because I was interested in the story and am a fan of Martin Scorcese. I was alternatively compelled by the story, bored, underwhelmed, and distracted by the shots of pretty cars. I enjoyed Robbie Robertson's music and the humor in the film.

","My Review- The Irishman<br/><br/>
It's very difficult to review a movie when it's been removed from Cinema release and goes straight to Netflix streaming.<br/><br/>The very limited Cinema release is purely so Netflix can qualify the movie for Oscar consideration and effectively denies the movie going public from seeing it until its released on television<br/><br/>This movie to my mind is far too long for any movie it's over 3 and a half hours and probably would make a great mini series but as a movie I got tired of the repetitive foul language and violence same old same old hit man crime and violence.<br/><br/>While I admired the performances of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino I've seen this plot scenario many times before . The Power play by gangs and gang bosses resulting in corruption and violence .<br/><br/>This one is the reminiscences of an old man Robert DeNiro retelling his ""glory"" days as a Teamster hitman assassin and his association with the notorious gangster Jimmy Hoffa told from his wheel chair in an aged care home.
We get introduced to these criminals and gangsters with captions on their ultimate fate either prison or gunned down and murdered.<br/><br/>Trouble is Al Pacino is now 79 and the flash backs to his teamster days as much as makeup can give the illusion of youth Al still looks too old to play a man probably in his early 50's<br/><br/>We meet many tough and savage teamsters and the slow pace of this film just made me lose interest , perhaps it may seem more dramatic on a huge screen but Netflix have made sure we only get s limited cinema release.<br/><br/>As much as I'm an admirer of Martin Scorsese films and Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino this is certainly no Godfather Part 2<br/><br/>If this is the future of Cinema Im not happy
If it's a film worth seeing Netflix should slow a normal release time there is a huge difference in a Television Show be it the best quality production but 3.5 hours is a mini series in my opinion.<br/><br/>There's lots of Oscar talk about The Irishman but like Roma last year I don't think it should be considered as it's a Netflix TV drama ðŸŽ­"
"northernpaladin","7","3","6","16 December 2019"," See the reality not the legend
","This is not a classic, those saying it is are indulging in wish fulfillment. Raging Bull is a classic, Gangs of New York is a classic, Goodfellas is a classic and those days are long behind Scorsese, which is part of the problem. Here we have a mildly interesting story spanning several decades about some seriously horrible people filmed as some kind of morality play which is at least an hour too long. Most of the performances are shallow and the direction pedestrian, the only person who emerges with any real depth of performance is Pesci the rest are mere ciphers. Yes it was good to see all these greats working together again but if this film does anything it shows they are no longer greats."

It felt a little forced with bringing in Pacino, Pesci and De Niro.

"arbd-42448","2","3","6","15 December 2019"," Started strong and ended in disappointment
","First off the digital aging bit was not as bad as others I have seen. Personally I prefer the skill of finding actors and actresses that look like younger versions of the lead. Looper comes to mind and I really feel that aspect was properly executed.<br/><br/>From a story perspective it starts off strong as you trek through a mobster story similar to ones that have already been told. This reaffirmed the stereotype that mobsters are simply one dimensional.<br/><br/>Many times are senes way too long and drawn out. I assume this is to create suspense or maybe some sort of character development but it comes off as an artsy way to pad out the film. This is a three hour movie that could have been wrapped up in two. If you don't agree then please explain why the wedding scene toward the end is shot all in slow motion. I thought Netflix was having buffering problem. Nope that's just the directors vision.<br/><br/>In the end the movie wraps up with the main character dying in a nursing home. Hopefully that saves you from wasting three hours of your life. Perhaps this is the director showing the arc of their career. Starting off strong then things slow down and eventually die and no one cares. I hope this is the final nail in the coffin for his career."

It really seems a huge homage to all this big actors and all their movie contributions. It feels sad for possibly the last time we could see them and to see this decade-long friendships... It's truly nostalgic. I'm sorry I've rambled on about anything except the movie! The actors were amazing, Pacino and De Niro still got it and we could feel they were at home, at ease in their own comfort.

Scorsese think he is GOD of the cinema and he has to say every content(subject) in his gangster films.
Cinema is not a box that you put every subject to it. You can put one or two things to it and try to zoom. Simple but Deep like Billy Wilder movies.
Irishman has dozen's of characters and dozen's of one line stories. You can't summarize 30 hours story into 3:30 hours. It must be a series or at least a mini series. The ""little"" Martin does not know this at the age of 77. Every Scorsese gangster movie had to be a series or mini series.
De-aging technology is the worst. Its completely waste of money. You don't know De Niro age in any scene of movie.

","The Irishman sees veteran Scorsese (now, in his 70s) returning to a genre that he had redefined with his early works .. a genre that brought him widespread critical as well as commercial acclaim and made him what he turned out to be.<br/><br/>And.. he returns with a power packed cast that is headlined by Robert de Niro (a frequent collaborator), Al Pacino and Joe Pesci (all three, now in their 70s) and many more stars in juicy cameos.<br/><br/>
The Irishman is adapted from a novel - ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" by Charles Brandt. It is set in the period from 1950s to 1980s and narrates the story of Frank Sheeran - a war veteran, truck driver who gets associated with the underworld crime families, becomes a mob hitman and how his life intersects with trade union leader, Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>The movie which runs for a whopping 209 minutes demands - nay, commands - a patient viewing and rewards the viewers with superlative performances by Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and De Niro at the heart of the narrative filling almost every frame besides excellence in almost every technical aspect of filmmaking - be it the brilliant staging, fluid cinematography, pitch perfect score.<br/><br/>De Niro is a class act in the role of Frank Sheeran - a stoic mobster of few words and fewer emotions. Pesci gives great company in his own version of stolid mentor for Sheeran while good old Al Pacino more than makes up for the lack of words and emotions of the these two in an energetic performace where he explodes in almost every frame.<br/><br/>What we might miss in terms of pace is more than made up by the quality of performances and the craft of a master who shows that even the oldest genre tropes, if handled right, could work like magic.<br/><br/>While the CGI assisted de-aging of the leads is not perfect yet, it is nevertheless unobtrusive and heralds exciting augurings for the future of movies.<br/><br/>The deliberate pacing by Scorsese allows us to soak in more of the unfolding events through the conversations, character arcs and gets us ever more invested in their predicaments. The narrative flows like a clear stream that is seamlessly punctuated by historic events (a la Forrest Gump) and sudden bursts of bloody violence.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie feels like a sagely Scorsese in his Yoda mode meditating on a mobster life.<br/><br/>The Irishman would certainly rank among Scorsese's finest and is certain to enjoy a brilliant run at the awards functions too."

"brennankress","8","3","6","5 December 2019"," Watching Paint Dry
","In a time where crime movies are expected to be filled with action sequences and violent displays, Scorsese decides to take a step back and look beyond the violence to the people who are so quickly connected with it. Perhaps, Scorsese should have kept the movie with its original title, ""I Heard You Paint Houses,"" as that tile summarizes the level of comfort the characters have with the actions they commit. And it is from this title that my headline comes from. I do not mean for a moment that the movie is boring, but instead, it brilliant captures the life of one man and the effect his life of crime had on him. It destroys his health, family, and friendships and from the time Frank (De Niro) is a young man ""painting houses"" until he sits in an assisted living home at the end, the audience has watched his life through and humbly sits with him as he asks the priest just to leave the door cracked. Scorsese masterful incorporates engaging dialogue, short powerful sequences of violence, and stunning characters that kept me enthralled throughout the long run time. Of all the movies, usually stuffed with explosions, that hit that bold 180 plus minutes, The Irishman was a welcomed break. De Niro and Pacino amaze with convincing dialogue between two colleagues, and friends. And Frank is greeted with the same question we must face, what became of our lives when all the paint dries."
"anand-27","3","3","6","5 December 2019"," Goodfellas for Geriatrics
","First things first. Scorsese was robbed off the Best Picture for Goodfellas in 1990. It was so good that it should be ranked alongside Godfather I and II as the Holy Trinity of mobster movies.<br/><br/>That said, The Irishman is anything but. To be honest, it is very, very overrated.<br/><br/>The story is a rehash of Goodfellas with the additional open-secret-about-Jimmy-Hoffa. It is slow, lumbering and most importantly, EVERYONE IS OLD and regardless of de-aging, they do not look convincing in their roles, nevermind credible. Pacino may come close with his over-the-top performance but that's just him in every movie since Scent of a Woman. Harvey Keitel looks distinguished from a distance maybe. But the rest. Seriously. People are raving about Ray Romano, de Niro etc Please. They hardly do anything that stands out. We don't even care if they live or die (same goes for almost everyone in the movie). There is no one to root for let alone feel for. Even the annoying Pesci dying in Goodfellas made us feel something. Even the Spider he shot.<br/><br/>I get that The Irishman is a winter sonata by Scorsese. He doesn't have much tricks left and this was too big a payday for him and his closest buddies to pass up BUT save the 3 hours and rewatch Goodfellas from 1990. It was the last movie Scorsese pulled out all the stops for and gave us his guts and glory. It entertained and it made us feel and it made us yearn for the mobster lifestyle like some guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>This Irishman is too drunk ad bloated on its own compliments that it deserves to sleep it off. Doesn't even deserve a courtesy Salut."

","This film is brilliant, but by no means perfect.<br/><br/>It feels like a cross between Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in America"" and Martin Scorsese's most famous film, ""Goodfellas"". However, it doesn't have the beauty almost operatic quality of Once Upon a Time in America, or the stylised panache of Goodfellas.<br/><br/>There are some epics out there of a similar run time, where the time flies by without you looking at your watch. In the Irishman, there are definitely moments that lag, and feel a little slow, maybe if it was 45mins shorter it would pack more punch.<br/><br/>The film doesn't have the zip or magnetism of other Scorsese outings, despite the story being a compelling non-fiction tale of Mafia hitman Frank Sheeran, and involves one of the most famous ""whodunit's"" in US history, in the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. (which is exciting source material).<br/><br/>However, the production quality is incredibly high, with vintage vehicles, clothes, absolutely spot on. The editing spliced with an incredible contemporary soundtrack, is trademark Scorsese. The cast is phenomenal, and every single one of them delivers a captivating performance in scene after scene. Great performers, delivering at their very best!<br/><br/>If you only ever watch it once, it's definitely worth the time!"

","Being a huge fan of Scorsese and the 3 main cast members I was really looking forward to this. It just went on way too long, with so many scenes and interactions between characters continually overplayed, it's as if the intent was to get Pacino and Deniro as much screen time as possible. I really felt like the movie could have delivered the same message with an hour less of runtime."
"ChristianLeFeuvre","10","3","6","1 December 2019"," When you combine a director and cast of this caliber, you know you are getting a phenominal film
","When you have a movie that has seriously outstanding talent on screen, and one of the greatest directors behind the camera, you know you'll have a film that you are going to love.
Despite it's three and a half-hour run time, you will be captivated by how good 'The Irishman' is.
This film tells the story of a hitman for the mob who has a possible involvement in the murder of Jimmy Hoffa.
This is a Martin Scorsese film with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. That's all I need to say really for you to know this is going to be top class acting.
The film is three and a half hours long, which most will find daunting and yes it is a long time, but, despite a couple of early scenes that drag out a bit longer than they need to, for me it didn't feel that long at all, it is constantly riveting because of the talent on screen and the talent behind the camera, this film's pacing is much faster than it's run time would have you think.
One thing I especially loved with this film is the fact that it allowed the characters to ponder how they are felling, to think, and the movie has scenes that are just silence, but there is so much more tension as a result.
Too many movies nowadays have forgotten to allow their characters to think, work out the situation they are in without constant chatter. It's almost as if films lately have become radio shows with pictures. What I mean by that is, on the radio you can't have silence, 'dead air' as it's known, people will think their radio has broken, and so many movies are filled with words, exposition that isn't necessary. We're almost not allowed to have characters that think, work out the solution in their head, but that is what this film does so well, and these actors are at the top of their game when it comes to 'expressional acting' it's all in the look, the facial expressions, they can figure things out, scheme, ponder and you can see it all going on in their eyes.
As a film buff, and I will say to anyone else too who loves movies, and especially the A list actors in this, I was worried that I would look at this film and see them, the actors, the 'names', but because of how well it is acted, directed edited and filmed, I found that I forgot about the actors and was immersed in the characters and that for me is what 'acting' is all about.
Both Pacino and De Niro are the best they have been in years, and Joe Pesci, who came out of retirement for this, is also incredible.
Some may compare this film to 'Goodfellas'. it's also a mob film, it has the same director and a number of the same actors are in both, and that's fine to compare, but the stand-out and most obvious thing to me which separates the two films, is that this film isn't as flashy, fast-paced and 'glamorous' as 'Goodfellas', it takes it's time to get into the mind of the characters, it's more....well, subtle.
Martin Scorsese is an amazing director. He has an originality that is present in all his films, they are exciting to watch even though so much of his films are just guys sitting around talking, you find yourself invested in his characters, yes there are moments of violence but there is depth to them all, and this film has all that, but with this one, it's more quiet intimidation.
This is especially so from Joe Pesci, who is phenomenal in this movie. This is Al Pacino's first film with Scorsese and he's got the perfect role here as larger-than-life figure Jimmy Hoffa, he's over the top but in such a positive way. De Niro though stood out for me. He showed so much command of his character that his lines didn't feel scripted, he has such a dynamic way of delivering his lines that they just roll out of his mouth so naturally.
There is 'de-ageing' in this film and knowing that before I watched it, I was a bit worried that it might have looked too fake or distracting, but after a short time I didn't even notice it, it's done really well.
If I have one niggle about this film, aside from the run time. Anna Paquin appears as an older version of De Niro's character's daughter, and we see the character a lot more when she is younger and she gets quite a bit of screen time when the character is young, however Anna Paquin doesn't get a lot of screen time yet she is integral in De Niro's arc, and because we didn't see so much of her character at that age, for me, some of the strength and impact it could have.
There is one 20min sequence which I reckon is one of the most suspenseful I have seen in any film all year. There is a long build-up to an amazing 'pay off'.
In short, don't be put off by the run time of this film, it is an incredible piece of work by an outstanding director with a cast of some of the best names in acting that you can get.
I loved it."

","This movie had the potential to be epic. Spanning a large period of time and over lots of interesting events in history but moved around with no thread tot eh overall narrative. It never got going and the pace in places was glacial. De Niro looked a old man through the whole thing. It was like he just walked off the set of Polar Express. They should have just got a young actor to play the younger Frank. Would have brought way more menace to the role and made the shifts from past present easier to see. He physically moved like a old man, especially the scene beating up the storekeeper. I would have liked Franks character to be developed properly. He had zero depth and edge about him for such a cold killer. Seeing him in the war would have been good.
Felt it 1 hour too long. Pesci was the best in it. Played his character wonderfully. Pacino also excellent.Stephen Graham brought the only reminder of Scorsese's usual gangster threat and menace. It's a solid movie and again edited excellently by Thelma Shoemacker. The movie slowly burns but never ignites. Scorsese went back to familiar territory here and seemed to have forgotten is way. Cant see myself watching this for long time."

"benps","8","3","6","29 November 2019"," The Irishman
","The Irishman is directed by legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese, and tells the story of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro),a mob hitman who recalls his possible involvement with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa.
The Irishman, as of now, has been long awaited by many, including myself, and I personally believe the result of the film is worth the wait. Scorsese is with no doubt a master, and The Irishman is masterfully helmed. His skilful using of the de-aging visual effects is impressive and respectable enough, however, he remains a strong storyteller throughout the entire film, as I found The Irishman thoroughly engaging throughout, despite the 3 hour 30 minute runtime which, thanks to the excellent editing from Thelma Schoonmaker, was never present in my mind.
The Irishman is also excellently written, features stunning acting from De Niro, Pacino, and Joe Pesci, and makes excellent usage of the mise en scene, as the period of time, as well as constant progression of this time, was very well conveyed without the needing to explain directly to us.
Although riveting, I suppose The Irishman could have been trimmed down slightly, and the relationship Sheeran conveyed with his wife and family could have been better developed. There were also some very minor technical issues, mostly in the visual effects, yet, on the whole, I thought The Irishman was excellent, never resulting or feeling the need to be a challenging piece of art, but instead meeting that perfect balance of being an accesable, crowd-pleasing feature, meanwhile conveying enough flair and unique qualities to cement it as something more different to the typical Hollywood film."
"mike-3251","7","3","6","29 November 2019"," A very watchable, just another tough guy movie.
","An entertaining film to watch if a ""bit"" on the uneconomical side.<br/><br/>Maybe the last time we will get to see these actors together in a film and so that alone had some value for me.<br/><br/>Pesci's performance was my favorite (though good supporting character acting all the way around) as he was appropriately understated, especially for him.<br/><br/>Bob did his standard slightly reserved/diplomatic tough guy acting, which was probably appropriate for this character, in the situations he was in and based on Sheeran's character in the book.<br/><br/>Al's portrayal of Hoffa didn't work for me, as the over-the-top bit (which I know Hoffa did quite a bit of) reminded me too much of Al's other roles. The Hoffa haircut seemed a bit weird on him, on the nitpick side. It's hard to believe that Hoffa was that cocky with the mob but supposedly, he at least came close to what we see here.<br/><br/>The visual style disappointed me as I've come to expect to be able to feast on that in just about any Scorsese film. The scenes were well composed but nothing outstanding and I expect he toned down his usual flair so as to not interfere with the acting/stars or the story.<br/><br/>Overall, the film did a very good job of telling the tale of the book and was also effective in showing how mundane all of the mob activities and ""shtick"" could be.<br/><br/>In the end though, it's just another tough guy movie with lots of stars.

"craigaconnelly1","8","3","6","29 November 2019"," A solid crime movie, skilfully put together, but temper your expectations somewhat...
","In Australia this movie had no official theatrical run, essentially going straight to Netflix, and that is where I was able to catch this one. As far as I'm concerned, that turned out to be a blessing in disguise - with a 209 minute run-time; I enjoyed it over two evenings... With an amazing cast and Scorsese at the helm, I've been anticipating this one for a while, and I went in with my expectations high. I wasn't disappointed because the story was good, there were strong performances from all the familiar faces, and it was constructed and told quite well. De Niro leads as the eponymous 'Irishman' Frank Sheeran, and the tale is told from his perspective as an interview with flashback sequences varying in their depth. A chance encounter with middle-management level mob boss Russell Bufalino (Pesci), leads Sheeran away from his conman trucker existence. His clear ruthless strength, wise guy cunning and apparent loyalty, sees him climbing the pyramid within the underworld. These qualities eventually come to see him positioned close to Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino), and he quickly establishes himself as his right-hand man.<br/><br/>Major spoilers' aside - the main narrative revolves around the political machinations between the mafia, the unions, and the blurred criminal world in which they both operate. Scorsese's influence on the book and screenplay is most obvious in the intense scenes involving Sheeran/Bufalino, Sheeran/Hoffa, and a couple of crack encounters between Hoffa and rival union boss Anthony 'Tony Pro' Provenzano (portrayed by Stephen Graham). I was reminded of the quote attributed to Vince Lombardi, which when paraphrased basically says: ""We will attempt to achieve perfection, knowing that it is impossible to do so, but in the process we might catch excellence"". And in a nutshell this is what I believe was Scorsese's primary method and objective with his main actors. He devotes a large chunk of screen time to these encounters, and powerful actors, trying to catch lightning but more than willing to settle for their best efforts... Did he succeed? Well that in my opinion is where you'll have to temper your expectations. Overall, this is a very good crime movie. Not a classic or career-defining work by Scorsese, as I've read suggested from others. De Niro returns to fine form, even by his lofty standards. However, the standout performances for mine come from Pesci and Graham. In many ways Pesci here is as powerful as he was in 'Goodfellas', yet in very different role."

"steveo122","8","3","6","28 November 2019"," An admirable work of speculative history.
","The story:
More than any other gangster movie, this one never lets go of the impression that you are willingly spending time with axxholes. It's based on real events and regardless of how accurate or truthful it is, that connection to reality, to the 'horror' aspect of knowing there are people out there doing these things, strips away the basic protection an audience has while enjoying viewing reprehensible/repugnant human tricks by having the 'It's only a movie' justification. For example, there comes a scene in which the audience is tempted to have some high level of empathy for the emotional pain a central character feels, as a 'normal' human would have while watching a 'normal' fictional tale, when the reality is that the character never actually reaps the level of pain a scumbag like him deserves.
Did Scorsese intend the dichotomy?<br/><br/>The movie:
That said, there was very much to admire and take delight in, most of it technical, front and back of the camera. On every level, it is as polished a production as one could expect from such a team.
Some scene/dialog pairings were alone worth the price of admission: the De Niro/Pacinos especially, much better than ""Heat"". And both of them, individually, give very impressive performances. Oscar talk is justified. Everyone, including the extras, top of their game.
The age-reducing software worked surprisingly well, to the extent that by the time film time catches up to the actors and their current faces, one suspects they used aging-software on them; the casting of supporting actors/extras was excellent - the faces were entirely fitting.
The period details are exceptional.<br/><br/>An admirable work of speculative history."
"natalia-khilkevitch","8","3","6","28 November 2019"," Casino with drawbacks
","Well, the first scene with the long camera roll already reminded Scorcese's Casino, and it was hard to get rid of that feeling through the entire movie (lasting for 3,5 hs).

The movie has a monotone tempo and there is no legendary memorable scenes.<br/><br/>Movies like The Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface ,etc. those all have some memorable scenes which cause audience to watch those movies or parts of them over and over again.

And DiCaprio was busy shining his Oscar.<br/><br/>The CGIed ""de-aging"" just doesn't work. Pesci calling DeNiro ""kid""? He's half a year younger!!! Not that it matters at 75. Blue eyes on DeNiro? For $160mil they could've hired CGI specialists who don't operate from their moms' basements.<br/><br/>The plot is pathetic. Jimmy Hoffa was murdered because he wanted to take back his union? (If you hibernated in the 70s, spoiler alert.) That was the first thing FBI looked at. And they've been looking at it for the past 50 years. What was the point?<br/><br/>All-in-all, a miserable fail with artificially inflated ratings and praises from the journalists who hope to interview Scorsese about the Taxi Driver."

","'The Irishman' is good, even reaching greatness at several points, however it has a few problems which bring it down. Firstly, it's long (running for a whopping 3hrs 29mins) and it feels it, mainly due to its pacing. The first two-thirds have a very episodic feel and aren't very focussed. The intent of the piece isn't really clear here. What we see just seems like a selection of random events in the protagonists' life, rather than a carefully constructed, character-building narrative. It actually takes around 3 hours, which is far longer than most complete films, for its main purpose to become clear. That's not to say what precedes it is bad, though. It's actually far from it, as its individual scenes are undeniably entertaining thanks to good writing, direction and performances. It's just never that engaging because of its lack of satisfying coherence. It also follows the traditional structure of the genre, coupled with generic narration, which gives it an overwhelming sense of predictably. The final portion of the film, however, really brings everything together and makes it stand out from other gangster flicks. Here, it offers a reflection and meditation on the genre as a whole, exploring themes of guilt and death in an effective and engaging way. It's an incredibly bold, ultimately genius, way to end things and leaves a great lasting impression. It makes the whole experience more likeable and far less generic upon reflection. Saying that though, one mustn't forget that it takes a long time for it to really be effective. A lot of the first 3 hours or so could easily have been trimmed for a leaner experience, without losing anything essential. It does allow for more time with the performances, though, which are nothing short of outstanding. Joe Pesci is the highlight, appearing in a far calmer role than you might expect. Another notable aspect of the film are the de-aging CGI effects used throughout, which aren't phenomenal and are really noticeable in the first few scenes. Thankfully though, the power of the performances and writing easily allows you to forget about this very quickly. It's surprising how little you even think about it as the film progresses. Overall, 'The Irishman' is definitely worth seeing (ideally on the big screen like I did, although it may be a little late for that now). Even if it's not Scorsese's best and can seem like an endurance test at times, it's still an ultimately effective piece that's undeniably entertaining in the end. 7/10"
"DjMethod","9","6","16","20 November 2019"," Look past the mildly distracting de-aging, and you will see a masterpiece
","The Irishman is a film with its own breathing, beating conscience. Throughout the film, we are introduced to characters with the details of the gruesome fates that await each of them plastered on the screen. There is no mistaking many of these are dead men walking. Men with their fates sealed into the actions we are concurrently reliving through the retrospective lens of an older, wiser person.<br/><br/>The movie is long. Please, please see it in theaters, as it may be the last new Scorsese film you can do so, but start it with an empty bladder. It's no Wolf of Wall Street in pacing, but it's paced exactly where it needs to be, and never gets slow or disengaging. It's apparent that a lot of thought goes into instilling these moments with extra meaning or tension, from smelling something fishy to giving alcohol metaphors as someone who strictly doesn't drink.<br/><br/>Acting is superb from the entire cast. Pacino is very Pacino, Pesci carries an intimidatingly loud silence, De Niro is great in every scene, and Anna Paquin gives a phenomenal ghostly presence. She may very well have given the Oscar-nominated performance with the fewest lines in history (we'll see, Judi Dench...).<br/><br/>The de-aging effects have a Polar Express-y softness most noticeable in the early scenes. Makeup is only occasionally distracting (e.g. De Niro's bright blue contacts). And there's an early curb scene that should have been re-shot to be less old man.<br/><br/>The Irishman (""I Heard You Paint Houses"") is complete and wholesome cinema. It gives the Netflix generation a hangout sesh with some of cinema's most beloved actors dishing out their same gangster core, but with the mental burden and guilt-ridden glances that haunt an aging hitman. The opening song contains everything Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran is about to unfold for us over the next 3Â½ hours. Over that time the narrative weighs down the tune with a growing heaviness, all the way up until the poignant final shot.<br/><br/>This is Scorsese matured and in true form, doing what he does best as a veteran filmmaker and master storyteller, only with the introspection, wisdom, and humanity that confront and reflect on his life's work."

","Been waiting for this one for some years and it was worth the waiting. The trio Pesci/Pacino/De Niro are a powerhouse, each bringing their a-game in an Oscar contending masterpiece. The slow pace through the story made me forget about time which made the 3,5 hour film feel like 2 hours.
These kind of movies make me hope more producers walk into Scorseses shoes but this proves he is one of a kind. The way he tells the story, going back and forth into time and the dialoges between the different characters are so powerful.<br/><br/>De Niro was exquisit, I loved him in Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Casino but in this one he goes beyond it all. The emotions he brought forward made me feel sorry for his character. Being a coolblooded assassin and mobster and yet he crushed every feeling of disgust by bringing a human side to the game which in the final gave me a lump in my throat.<br/><br/>Pacino, I love this guy! His first appearance made me think about Scarface and Carlito's Way. An energetic gangster with a lot of charisma and with a love to hate attitude. The energy he gave to his character was great and even if you know what happens to him you still hope he somehow start being reasonable.<br/><br/>Pesci, wow, it has been a long time since i've seen him play so powerful! From being a good friend to being a killer boss. And how he portrayed this was great, in a 180 degree turn to how he was in Goodfellas. he's now a serious and pure evil gangster. Yet its hard to hate him, just because its Pesci.<br/><br/>Only minus is how little they used Anna Paquin, I hoped she had some more real screen time. Yet was her silence strong enough to express her feeling toward her father and how she lived through his career.<br/><br/>The movie itself was without overhyping it a masterpiece, if this is the swan song for these 4 people it is a farwell in style and in honor and I truly hope that Scorsese's work get paid of with at least an Oscar. And releasing this in a year where movies like Once Upon A Time In Hollywood & The Joker have been released I see this one taking away all their prices! Great job by Netflix for giving the time, money and trust to Martin and his team. It's an absolute winner for a streaming service!"

","Scorsese has done it again. He has delivered another brilliant film, not without its flaws though cause it does feel like a slight let down at times.<br/><br/>The film is extremely ambitious and clocking in at a whopping 3 hours 29 minutes, it doesn't always prove it's necessity to be that long although I loved every minute. The only real flaw I have is that it doesn't have that style and excitement previous Scorsese films have.<br/><br/>The Irishman is arguably the most mature Scorsese film to date. And it's a refreshing take on the genre. It's much of a reflective, more bleaker tone to it than the glamorous mob films. Scorsese paired with Shoomaker is a match made in heaven. They are both incredible here.<br/><br/>The performances are brilliant. Robert De Niro gives his finest performance since Casino. Al Pacino and Joe Pesci are awesome as well, both who are outstanding. Supporting cast are brilliant as well. The CGI is noticable at times but you quickly don't notice after a while.<br/><br/>I think it's definitely a film which needs to be rewatched cause I'm sure my thoughts on the film will be better but what we got is 209 minute epic. It's a really fascinating film. There are some incredible moments throughout and it's really character driven which I really liked.

It is actually slightly better than Goodfellas in ""some"" ways, but I think Goodfellas is such a classic and broke new ground in such an original way that it is hard to declare it totally better than that.

","I love Scorsese films and when others complain about the length of some films, I'm usually grateful for the extra time I get to spend with characters. Not this time.<br/><br/>The actors are all far too old to play the much-younger versions of themselves the film requires. It's one thing to smooth out the wrinkles a bit (which is terribly distracting itself) but there's no way to de-age their bodies. Their posture, presence, and overall fitness are all those of elderly men. That's not a criticism, it's just a fact, btw. It looks ridiculous in the more physical scenes like De Niro beating up a grocer or a flashback scene to a very young De Niro in war. I honestly felt -throughout -that I was watching a film about old mobsters working out of a retirement home.<br/><br/>This is nowhere near as gripping and compelling as Goodfella's or even the much-flawed Departed. The story drags and meanders while some plot points lead virtually nowhere. It would've benefited greatly from some serious editing. There's probably 30-45 minutes that made absolutely no impact on the story and that is almost an unforgivable sin when you have these actors, this director, and the enormous budget granted to this movie. This isn't the tight storytelling most of us expected.<br/><br/>I watched this last night and today the first thing that occurred to me when I thought of it is how much I'd like to watch Goodfella's again."

In reality he can't even get it up and in addition to this De Niro is playing an Irishman, that is even worse than Gerald Butler telling the Persians to stay out of his Greek lands in 300 -Eeeaaarth and Waaater"".

Pacino is excellent however, giving a powerhouse perfornance as the stubborn, yet ill fated Jimmy Hoffa, whom De Niro's character befriends.<br/><br/>Pesci feels quite limited here (by self choice) but still worthy of anyone's time.<br/><br/>Alot of the characters here seem wasted also, specifically with the calibre of Keitel on show. Paquin is another who is almost muted in terms of script dialogue.<br/><br/>The story wears itself out by the finale, with what I felt to be an anti climax and very disappointing overall.<br/><br/>I can always tell if I like a movie or not by whether or not I would watch again.<br/><br/>On this occasion, sadly not."
"anthdalton-60084","10","5","13","28 November 2019"," This is art
","Yes these blokes are old, however they are seriously invested in this project. Pesci is brilliant, Pacino hasn't been this significant since Scarface, De Niro is just unbelievable. I stumbled across this on Netflix, on a week night, it's after midnight and I couldn't look away.
I have never posted on IMBD before, but just felt compelled, this is seriously good.
I have always respected Scorsese, loved the Godfather and the Departed, absolutely adored the Last Waltz (the best rock and roll movie ever by a mile), but this is better. It's raw, it's real, it's deep. I should have watched this at a cinema. If it doesn't take home a s**t load of Oscars, then the Academy Awards are a joke."

","I just finished The Irishman and my heart is still racing. In the first 2.5 hours you have another beautifully crafted, well acted Scorsese mob drama that reunites all-stars of the genre in spectacular fashion. But it's the last 45 minutes that complete the experience. Watching an aging, depressed Sheeran gives you both sadistic pleasure and pure sympathy as he experiences a change of heart after it is far too late. The final minute is the best splice of cinema it's size that I've ever seen. The final scene is aesthetically simple and purely heart-wrenching. The whole film builds for the sole purpose of all collapsing on the protagonist in the final hour. A breakthrough in the genre and a career high for Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. A massive win for Netflix."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","5","13","28 November 2019"," Scorsese's ""The Irishman"" is an epic chronicle of crime
","One of 2019's biggest and most anticipated films, ""The Irishman"" seemed too good to be true when the project was originally announced. Not only was it to be directed by Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, but the director would bring together screen legends Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci in a film that sounded dreamlike for fans of mob films and the crime genre.<br/><br/>Scorsese has shined once again and has crafted a film that elevates the senses. While he may not be a fan of Marvel movies, there's no denying we're witnessing the work of a master. Expect ""The Irishman"" to be a leading contender for numerous awards.<br/><br/>Scorsese's latest is instinctually being compared to his former crime works such as ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Departed"" and ""Casino,"" yet with ""The Irishman"" Scorsese has done a unique job in crafting a picture unlike anything he's ever done yet still manages to incorporate touches of his artistic style that made him so internationally acclaimed in the first place. We have several engaging tracking shots that the filmmaker is prone to for us to engage with the setting and experience the characters' sights and surroundings as well as spectacular slow-motion sequences that allow us as an audience to view the intimate details and gravity of certain situations.<br/><br/>What distinguishes ""The Irishman"" from not only Scorsese's past work in the crime genre but the vast majority of mafia films is the style Scorsese approaches. While ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Departed"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" contained constant excitement and riveting intensity, ""The Irishman"" follows a subtler, more nuanced approach and is more of a character study that examines more crucial topics of the human condition. Instead of every scene being filled with tension, intensity, or conflict, ""The Irishman"" takes its time and strives to let the audience understand everything there is to possibly know about the characters, letting us study their faces and get inside their heads so that we can eventually predict what they're going to say before they open their mouths.<br/><br/>An adaptation of the narrative nonfiction book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" by Charles Brandt, ""The Irishman"" chronicles the life of Frank Sheeran (De Niro), a truck driver and WWII veteran who ends up working as an assassin for Philadelphia mob boss Russell ""Russ"" Bufalino (Joe Pesci). Both Bufalino and Sheeran grow close and have mutual respect, the two's relationship one of the most intriguing elements of the film. Sheeran takes out whoever he's asked with no questions, his lifestyle becoming robotic as he gradually falls apart from his four daughters.<br/><br/>Sheeran soon starts working with famed union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) as his bodyguard, who he meets due to Hoffa's financial ties to the Bufalino Crime Family. Frank Sheeran is most notable for being the alleged man who killed Jimmy Hoffa after confessing, for to this day no one truly knows what caused Hoffa to vanish in 1975. The film explores at length the two's relationships and, without spoiling anything, examines the eventual despair and repercussions of their connection.<br/><br/>The film digs deep into the rich history of Hoffa and his feud with the Kennedy family. Scorsese examines the secretive acts of corruption that both politicians and mobsters orchestrated to shape vital policy in the United States. We get to follow Hoffa's influential political career and his tension with both President John F. Kennedy and his younger brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Hoffa's constant quest for power through Sheeran's point of view, making the film excel as a narrative.<br/><br/>While Hoffa is no doubt committed to working people and his union, power is his underlying motivation throughout the film. Sheeran, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have much motivation throughout the film besides making a living and getting the job done. He is by no means on a quest for power or wealth and has no evil in his heart, his lifestyle never changing despite his rising status in the Bufalino Crime Family.<br/><br/>Scorsese has crafted a crime film on an entirely new level. While at times the film is very slow and about 35 minutes of its 3-and-a-half-hour runtime could have been cut, ""The Irishman"" is a monumental crime epic and a new American classic. This is a Hollywood epic created by some of the most gifted icons in the entertainment industry and the results solidify this.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" will always be Scorsese's greatest film, and I can think of at least three of his other films that I personally enjoyed more than his latest. Yet the veteran director has crafted his most ambitious project yet and delivers a film close to his roots in crime filmmaking that expresses his filmmaking abilities vividly.<br/><br/>Scorsese's wisdom and years of experience as a director are exemplified in every frame and sequence, not one moment uninteresting to look at even when the film lags in its narrative. Every character on screen has a purpose and Scorsese and Academy Award-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian (""Schindler's List"") ensures that we are well aware of everyone involved in this story. Additionally, Scorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker has yet again put together a film that visually depicts this story in stunning fashion, the film flowing beautifully between each frame.<br/><br/>On-screen, De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci have some of the best chemistry in film history. Each actor says every bit of dialogue naturally, almost as if they never even read the script and are naturally aware of what to say. De Niro gives one of his best performances in years, his best acting expressed in his varied facial expressions that invite us into the actor's thoughts and feelings. Towards the end, De Niro shows off his vulnerability and heart-wrenching talent like you've never seen before, the iconic ""tough guy"" portraying a broken soul with nothing left.<br/><br/>Pacino has a ball as Jimmy Hoffa, having the opportunity to give another one of his famous on-screen outbursts and given dialogue that only he was born to say. His character's big mouth and stubborn personality give the ""Godfather"" actor a chance to have fun and shine as the actor we all know and love.<br/><br/>While De Niro and Pacino are beyond impressive, it's Joe Pesci, coming out of retirement to make the film, who delivers the most memorable performance. Usually the hot-headed, cold-blooded killer, most notably as Tommy DeVito in ""Goodfellas,"" Pesci delivers a 180 from his previous work. His portrayal as Russell Buflaino is calmer, his character a wise businessman who shows signs of humanity throughout the film. Pesci's work in this film will catch everyone off guard, for they won't be used to seeing him as a soft-spoken, easy-going mastermind who uses his danger strategically instead of loosely.<br/><br/>Much of the talk on the film surrounds its high price tag at $160 million and how Netflix chose to produce the film after no other studio would take it due to the budget, as well as the de-aging CGI used on De Niro while portraying Sheeran in his forties. Admittedly, the CGI is ineffective. We can still tell De Niro's true age and it simply doesn't work well enough. However, that's beside the point. We don't need CGI to get what Scorsese is trying to express. Through his artistic direction and his actors' masterful performances, we're sunken into a story about regret and the decisions we make in the past that impact our lives.<br/><br/>As always, Scorsese invokes a constant moral ambiguity that makes us empathize with each character despite their illegal and immoral actions. While not as focused as his past films and not entertaining enough to deserve an extremely long runtime, Scorsese has crafted what very well could be the last great mob movie. This may be a film that is better experienced in increments instead of one theatrical viewing, yet theatrically it excels as well due to its stunning direction and an exuberant chronicle of crime.<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" is one of the best films of 2019 and a visionary crime epic that will be talked about for years."

","The Irishman is undoubtedly a very well-made piece of cinema, but it's one that stays within its box and fears to try anything truly new. It's a Scorcese Mafia movie, and from that simple description you can envision quite accurately the entire film. All the classic locations and character archetypes are here, and much of the picture feels like a team of highly skilled filmmakers just going through the motions. Nevertheless, the director's expertise shines through in the smaller, self-contained scenes. Simple exchanges between characters about the most mundane things carry so much wit that they become more entertaining than any explosion or shootout. The energy and style are both there, but unfortunately the creativity isn't."
"slepore-04350","7","10","33","26 October 2019"," Worth the watch

This film drags and has so many unnecessary scenes. Not to mention some of the shots feel like it was one and done (mostly DeNiro). But overall the acting is amazing I mean come on. Pause the film half way, go for a walk or something and come back to it."
"revenant83","1","6","17","3 December 2019"," Plodding, shallow, derivative
","There is no new insight or revelation here. The movie is essentially a docudrama, except the main character's story is a fabrication -- a dying man's lie created from whole cloth, perhaps to gain the notoriety or respect he lacked as a younger man. Sad that such great talents were wasted on this drivel. Never let the truth get in the way of a good story? Perhaps, but then bring a good story. The only way this story would be satisfying is if it were true, but with that possibility removed, there's nothing left worth watching at all, let alone for 3.5 hours.<br/><br/>Much has been written about the anti-aging technology. It's all true. It was a waste of money and ineffective, and half the time it feels like watching a video game cutscene. If older men could carry themselves as younger, they would. Old people don't move stiffly because it's fun, or because they're lazy. They do it because they're old and they can't help it. DiNero, Pacino, and Pesci are old now, and wearing young masks doesn't change that. Fortunately everybody's just sitting around for 80% of the movie, otherwise it would be even harder to ignore.<br/><br/>I have to assume most of the high ratings are due predominately to the current fad for nostalgia. Watching some of the best actors of their time in this piece feels a lot like watching Stranger Things. Once you get past the trip down memory lane, you realize it's just a collective reminisce that won't stand on its own down the road. It works only because of what came before it, and without that, it's nothing."

There's stuff about the mob too but it wasn't like Goodfellas. It was also way too long and drawn out. I thought it was pretty slow too. Some scenes could've been shortened.

","Okay, first off - if you're expecting 'Goodfellas' then you'll be disappointed. This film lacks the 'snap' of the aforementioned movie - the sense of adrenaline-fuelled fear that Jimmy Conway et al induced is nowhere to be seen. De Niro's character seems tame compared to Conway and there were moments when I longed for some of that menace to show through. Pesci looks and acts aged and I was unimpressed with his portrayal of a mob boss. Pacino delivered to some degree however, throughout the movie, I had the distinct impression that he had forgotten some of his lines. The scene in his office was laughable and I found myself wondering why somebody hadn't shouted 'CUT' halfway through his rant. The real gem, for me, was Stephen Graham's performance. His face off with Hoffa in prison was electric and it has to be said he certainly held his own against Pacino. The final meeting between Frank and Hoffa played out way too fast - there was so much opportunity there to take those characters to the edge and it didn't deliver. All in all, and I'm a huge fan of De Niro, I was disappointed with this movie. I feel it failed to live up to expectations when you consider the calibre of the cast. Graham was superb. The rest were totally forgettable."

Steven Zailian wrote an outstanding script. Nothing can be said about the acting in this movie because we have the best leading & supporting actors in history. Al Pacino is perfect in showing that how a good politician Jimmy Hoffa is and also how he can manage the mafia so smoothly but his only fault was his blind side Frank Sheeran. Joe Pesci has a very different role than the previous ones with Scorsese, before he was the time bomb that would explode anytime but in this movie he's the decision maker, the reasonable mafia leader.

","I was eagerly awaiting this movie to come out. I had to watch it on Netflix as my local cinema was having a refurb and I couldn't get to see it, and after the trailers I was really excited for it to come out.<br/><br/>We sat down on a wet Sunday and started the film off and almost straight away, I had found fault with this movie. The CGI de-aging of actors when done correctly looks good, but this doesn't. I was buzzing to see Joe Pesci back on the screen again as he is one of my favourite actors but what did they do to his mouth? At times it looked painted on, and poor Joe has jowels which added to the work but it made the entire bottom half of his mouth look 'out of sync' with the rest of his face. His character didn't do anything through the whole film and was more of homage to the actor I think rather than giving him a meaty role. Add to this the really odd relationship with Sheerans' daughter through the film, I found it quite laughable at times.<br/><br/>As for DeNiro, what was with the blue eyes? Why did they have to be SO blue? Add to this yet more ropey CGI, it started to make me realise that they should really have gotten actors to play the younger selves. A La Space Cowboys maybe. Add to this the perma-sneer that he had on his face when smiling made it laughable.<br/><br/>The stand out for me was Al Pacino playing Jimmy Hoffa. He nailed the part and he was probably the most interesting character in the film for me. Also, his de-aging was probably the best done.<br/><br/>A lot had been made in the press recently after Scorsese spoke out about the Avengers not being cinema. He maybe should have kept his mouth shut because at least they know how to do visuals. yes, the cityscapes and all that were top drawer (ILM) but the characters just didn't do it and considering the obscene amount of money it cost to make this film, I struggle to see where they spent it.<br/><br/>This should have been a swansong for many actors, but for me it was a movie too far and one I probably will never revisit again."

","I may be missing one or two that have been released over the last decade, but the last time I remember really liking a film based around the mob was probably American Gangster back in 2007. Netflix has been on fire lately with their feature films. From last year's Roma winning Best Foreign Film and now The Irishman winning many awards, along with their upcoming release in Marriage Story, they are proving to be a genuine film studio. At a very lengthy 209 minutes, The Irishman has now finished its film festival run and is now streaming on Netflix. I'm not going to beat around the bush. This film is simply one of the best films of 2019 by far and possibly even the decade.<br/><br/>Based on the true story, Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is a recently fired truck driver who has stumbled his way into becoming a mobster, teaming up with leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Chronicling these events through the years, we get to see a large portion of the life of this man and how his past has now become his permanent present. With the addition of Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), this film is filled with rich characters. You definitely can't complain about the main characters being underdeveloped here, because their amount of screentime and endless dialogue make for a very fleshed out piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Superbly directed by Martin Scorsese, I would say this movie is his best work since Hugo or The Departed, but this film is better than both of those in my opinion. Although I haven't seen his entire filmography, I would have to go back to Goodfellas from 1990 to find a better film of his. I found The Irishman (although slightly long) to be his best film in many, many years. Each frame of this movie screams filmmaking and I was glued to the screen from start to finish. This film deserves all the attention it's getting and Scorsese is a major reason for that.<br/><br/>Writing films like Schindler's List and Moneyball, Steven Zaillian is no stranger to penning award-worthy screenplays, and while I believe he absolutely deserves all the attention in the world once again, it's really Charles Brandt who stands out to me. Having hardly written anything noteworthy before teaming up with Zaillian, I'm very impressed at his work here. I'm not sure who contributed more, but for a writer who is only just beginning to build a resume, it doesn't get much better than this. Bravo sir.<br/><br/>I could gush about this movie for hours, but I'll wrap it up. The Irishman proves that Martin Scorsese will never lose touch as a director, seeing this trio of actors on-screen will probably never happen again, the cinematography is Oscar-worthy, the deserves to win many awards, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film takes home many of the top prizes this year. Yes, it's a little long, but it's incredibly engaging. The length is really my only minor nitpick. Other than that, this film is one of the best films in recent years and will probably be remembered as a Scorsese classic in the years to come."

","I keep hearing what a great movie this is. Wish I could agree. I remember going to the movie theatre when Heat came out. It was a big deal to see Pacino and DeNiro on the screen together for the first time. And the much awaited scene didn't disappoint.
All these years later, and their respective careers have been filled I with drivel in the interim.<br/><br/>At their age, their casting is a complete misstep for this story. Modern technological advancements in de-aging DeNiro aren't particularly convincing. Furthermore, it's a total snoozefest. First hour is like watching paint dry.
If you can endure the snail paced story telling, you'll eventually discover some tense and suspenseful payoffs in the fourth hour, but geez, it's hard going.<br/><br/>Probably better as a four part mini-series."

","Everything else is just a snoozing, slobbering, old white guy of a movie.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality of this is the costumes and sets being 100% accurate, but the directing goes way too many directions- the pointless text exclaiming how/when people died, the incredibly awkward scene interactions that IN NO WAY segue to the next, and when you finally are introduced to Hoffa, and check the runtime, you cannot believe you're only an hour in with another two to go.<br/><br/>The CGI age progressions are laughable, at best. I'm sure they'll come along soon enough, but this movie will be one we laugh at the feeble attempts once it gets better. It was relied upon far too heavily.<br/><br/>I did like Joe Pesci's acting, but the script being so wobbly definitely handicapped his performance; DeNiro seemed to be a firm believer in pre-release hype, and over-acted throughout.<br/><br/>Never mind that Sheeran was, for all intents and purposes, prone to grossly over exaggerating much of his life's antics, Scorsese seems to be doing so, as well.<br/><br/>All in all, a trodding, clumsy adaptation, with very little bright spots-I'd like that 3 hours back, please."

","I'm no expert on gangster movies or on Scorcese, but I am a fan of DiNiro, Pacino and Pesci. So I was prepared to be blown away, but it didn't happen.<br/><br/>First, why not develop the theme of the Irishman (of the title) entering the world of the Sicilian mob? That would be interesting, and didn't get much attention.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't get the sense that the lead actors were really inhabiting their characters, although some of the face-to-face dialogue between the leads was very engrossing. But not because they were inhabiting the characters, but rather because they are just so good at delivering lines. It was sort of like being at an acting class.<br/><br/>The screenplay was, I thought, very powerful, but it didn't get translated into flesh-and-blood conflict that made the audience care (unlike The Godfather, say). The movie kept me interested mostly because of the historical content (Cuba, the Kennedys, Hoffa) but it's not a movie that leaves a lasting impression."
"mchertov","7","4","10","30 November 2019"," A Movie of Epic Proportions
","Scorsese has finally done it. He has done what only Sergio Leone before him was able to do: make a 3 hour gangster movie with amazing acting and a good script. The Irishman is ""epic"" in every sense. And this is precisely it's downfall.<br/><br/>I have great respect for Scorsese and the work he has done in his field. I have equal respect for DeNiro, Pesci and Pacino as well. The talents of all four of these men are brought to life in this movie. At the same time, however, I can't help but think the run time was kept the way it was just to get all the actors decent screen time. I would expect Scorsese to want to get the most out of his actors and have them show their prowess. They do, but it really is at the expense of the movie-pace. Had the script been a tad bit shorter, it would have been a much better movie.<br/><br/>The script is another thing that needs to be discussed, as it is impressive. The dialogue is outstanding between characters and really let's us know their personalities, thoughts, and feelings. The movie is gritty, as you would expect, with un-stylized violence that makes you feel every punch and gunshot. The realism takes you deep into the ruthless world of organized crime, where even the most respected capo can become a target. Rare is a movie that is able to be so real and get away with it.<br/><br/>Overall, I am conflicted on the score to give this movie. Had the run-time been shorter, I would have given this movie a 10. But the additional hour of movie creates slogs that just can't be ignored, or saved by a powerhouse actor. Once Upon a Time in America blended together the epic, the violent and the fantastical into one masterpiece of a movie. The Irishman tries to do the same...and almost succeeds."
"TwistedContent","10","4","10","30 November 2019"," A Mature and Soulful Piece of Cinema, A Much Needed Gift from Scorsese
","I remember myself saying to someone how amazing it would be if Scorsese made one more mobster movie, that was before ""The Irishman"" got announced & honestly, I didn't think it was going to happen. Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"", ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"" were some of my favorite movies in the early cinematic endeavours, the first three have been re-watched many times and will get again. Every piece of news during the production of ""The Irishman"" got me more and more excited, an absolutely stellar cast got pieced together, the return of Joe Pesci, Steve Zaillian as the screenwriter & Netflix (Whom I respect a whole lot for their brave and bonkers business and creative choices) stepping up when no other studio did. Let me tell you right away, I'm not the least bit disappointed.<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" proves that, after all these years and innovations, Scorsese formula still works - as great as ever. The gangster shtick was missed and will be missed again. Overly long runtimes do tend to bother me sometimes, but, somehow, this, the really rarely long runtime of 3 hours and 29 minutes, didn't worry me - I'm talking about the feelings before even getting to watch the movie. I wasn't wrong, it was all worth it. ""The Irishman"" flows beautifully, the first two hours are eventful - colorful and authentic characters get introduced, not all at once, but steadily and patiently, some may appear once for a brief moment and only get their time to shine later in the movie. It's full of intriguing and flavourful story, almost feels like a good mafia novel. The 2nd half stabilizes slowly into a single timeline & transforms into a (cannot choose a better word) soulful and content drama. In the end I was left staring at the entirety of the credits and fighting some wild man tears.<br/><br/>It's not that often a movie has such a cast, I almost whana call it a wet dream (I speak for myself), it was mesmerising to watch them at work - I can only applaud to all of them. I think ""The Irishman"" really should get some well deserved Oscar noms, but I'll be the most disappointed if De Niro doesn't get one. Visually ""The Irishman"" was the top tier you'd expect, great cinematography, the digital deaging turned out to be just fine, violence is stone cold & production design - spot on. The original score & soundtrack felt as dear and nostalgic as the whole movie itself, I'm sure I'll listen to it's main theme song time and time again.<br/><br/>Now I'm not the in-depth analyser on paper and I usually don't talk about the plot, no spoilers, but I can honestly say it's a truly great, very memorable and very (pardon me for saying it again) soulful piece of cinema. To avoid disappointments, I do advice not to expect lots of action, dramatic intensity or suspense - it's a crime drama, driven by the characters, their relationships and morales. You know, I'm just really glad this movie got made. My rating: 10/10."

"JMichaelAtchue","9","4","10","29 November 2019"," One of the Best Films of the Year
","Martin Scorsese's ""The Irishman"" is more than a movie - it's an event. In assembling the greatest actors of his generation, and the best ""de-ageing"" effects that modern technology has to offer, Scorsese has crafted an epic meditation on violence, guilt, and the role of organized crime in American history. This movie is a once in a lifetime experience that I doubt will be repeated ever again. At 3.5 hours ""The Irishman"" is long, probably too long. But it's always entertaining thanks to an outstanding screenplay by Stephen Zaillain (of ""Schindler's List"") and of course the phenomenal cast.<br/><br/>Everyone from Joe Pesci to Ray Romano and Anna Paquin delivers a perfect performance, but the movie belongs to De Niro and Pacino. It goes without saying that these are two of the greatest actors alive, yet for the past twenty years their movies have dramatically declined in quality. (I mean seriously: who thought making ""Dirty Grandpa"" and ""Jack and Jill"" was a good idea?) But in ""The Irishman"" they're at the best they've been since ""Heat"" in 1995. The decision to cast them was a masterstroke: De Niro owns the role of a quiet but ruthless hit man, while Pacino creates a vibrant, charismatic, yet fatally flawed Jimmy Hoffa who we know is doomed from the start. I tend to shy away from making Oscar predictions, but Pacino is my personal choice for Best Supporting Actor of 2019.<br/><br/>The Oscars have never been friendly to Martin Scorsese. But it will be hard for the Academy to snub him again for ""The Irishman."" Scorsese revisits his signature themes of family, loneliness, and guilt while making something refreshingly new. Unlike ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" that are aggressive and fast-paced, ""The Irishman"" is slow, thoughtful, and ultimately different from what has come before. While many older filmmakers have seen their relevance diminish with time, Scorsese has updated his distinctive style for a new era of online streaming and I loved every minute of it. Beautifully shot, written, and acted, ""The Irishman"" is a deeply profound and highly engaging movie that's one of the year's very best. 9/10."

Frank Sheeran really wants to be a good friend, a goof father, but he is missing the big picture.<br/><br/>""You know, you got orders, you follow them. They tell you to bring some prisoners into...into the woods. You know, and they dont tell you what to do. But they just say, you know, hurry up!

"lewilewis1997","6","4","10","28 November 2019"," An Hour Too Long...
","It's an okay film, but far from Scorsese's best. The last hour gave me a sense of deja vue, haven't we had this dialogue already? Incidentally, the dialogue is pretty basic, I can't think of one witty or memorable line. It's dull.
It's well shot with some interesting angles and effects, but the CGI should have rendered the bodies as well. A middle aged face on an obviously elderly body just looks wrong. De Niro moves like he has arthritis.
Maybe in a cinema with a big screen and full on Dolby this would have been better? But streamed on Netflix on my lowly 23 inch HD screen and stereo sound it was very disappointing and not worth the wait. Pacino shone out as Hoffa, I think he really relished this role, and helped save it from being a 5.

Although not perfect, the story really was fascinating and although the film is 3.5 hours long, you don't notice it until you get to the last half an hour and the main story moves away from the Hoffa mystery.<br/><br/>The cast are excellent, although I did find De Niro's smirking a little tiresome as we've seen it in other films. The real standout amongst a great cast is Joe Pesci. What a great performance he puts in. Al Pacino does seem an odd choice at first to play Jimmy Hoffa but after a while I started to forget that and just enjoyed a really great cast in a great film with a great script.<br/><br/>Scorsese's best film since Casino by a long way. Stephen Graham also puts in a great turn and the film is brilliantly edited too, keeping up the tension when needed.<br/><br/>I think the last twenty minutes or so (after the Hoffa story comes to its conclusion) does ramble a bit and could easily have been more economically done with regards to what happened to some of the characters. However it seems a shame such an excellent movie is being resigned to a small theatrical release before hitting Netflix. This is one of the best films so far or the 21st century from a master storyteller and a gifted cast."

","This is a gripping piece of cinema. Messrs. Scorsese, Pesci, De Niro & Pacino deliver a gangster movie like no other. It is a little bit long but that was really only an issue for my circulation in a rather old cinema seat. The 3Â½ hours flew by. True, we still don't actually know what happened to Jimmy Hoffa but this film offers a compelling and engrossing narrative as to what might have happened, not just to him, but to the whole Mafia-led enterprise that dominated parts of the USA in the sixties and seventies. Whether Charles Brandt's book - upon which this is based - be true, or not is almost academic. This doesn't set out to deliver history, it sets out to deliver a theory, and it does so with style and panache and illustrates with distinction the toxicity of the political situation at the time with all of its concomitant violence, thuggery and nastiness. Excellent!"
"starostenkoivan-90744","8","4","10","9 November 2019"," Another masterpiece from the masters of the gangster genre
","So Martin Scorsese and the co created their next masterpiece. ""The Irishman"" was shot in the best tradition of Scorsese's biggest gangster flicks - ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". Like them, ""The Irishman"" is also based on real events and spans several decades from the life of the Italian mafia.<br/><br/>The first half of the film turned out to be very dynamic - in the classic Scorsese style, with sharp transitions from one scene to another, accompanied by jazz and blues pieces, with De Niro's off-screen narration. The second half slows down a little and is more focused.<br/><br/>The stellar cast has fully justified its presence. This is the fourth joint De Niro-Pacino film (also the ninth one by Scorsese with De Niro, the fourth with Pesci, and the sixth with Harvey Keitel), and here they have more screen time than in other joint films.<br/><br/>Pacino plays the role of Jimmy Hoffa - the leader of the truckers union tied with the Italian mafia. This is Pacino's most prominent role over the past decade. Recently, he played in rather mediocre films, or small parts in big films. In ""The Irishman"", he returned to his typical role as a tough and unprincipled character.<br/><br/>De Niro plays Frank Sheeran (on behalf of who the book was written on which the film is based) - a trucker, who later became a close friend of Hoffa and his bodyguard. For De Niro, this role also became a return to his origins - he hadn't played gangsters for a long time (with the exception of ""Heist"" (2015), perhaps) and hadn't acted in Scorsese films for more than 20 years, playing more ""good"" roles. Although he plays the role of the mafia ""pawn"", following its instructions, his character is no less cruel than Ace from ""Casino"".<br/><br/>Joe Pesci plays the role of the Italian mafioso Russell Bufalino, who combined De Niro and Pacino characters. This is the first Pesci role after an almost 10-year hiatus. At first, he didn't even want to appear in ""The Irishman"", but Scorsese and De Niro eventually persuaded him. It is rather atypical for Scorsese films, when Pesci does not play the role of a thug with an explosive temperament, from whom you do not know what to expect. Here he doesn't kill anyone, entrusting it to the others. He is more cold-blooded and prefers to keep a low profile.<br/><br/>The whole plot revolves around this particular trinity.<br/><br/>Harvey Keitel has only about 3 scenes for the whole film - he plays the boss of the Italian mafia. His appearance and way of talking, by the way, reminded me of Brando's Don Corleone.<br/><br/>I really liked the way the actors were rejuvenated by means of CGI. De Niro looked like a 30-year-old - as if you watch him in ""The Taxi Driver"" period. Like in ""Once Upon a Time in America"", De Niro goes through several stages of age - from a young and energetic gangster to a deep old man. Once again, he showed the ingenious skill of disguise.<br/><br/>In terms of cruelty, this is a more restrained Scorsese film. There's much less violence than in the above-mentioned films, and it is not that expressive. Mostly the characters use guns and do everything quickly and clearly. Accordingly, there are no scenes similar to those from ""Casino"", when Pesci character attacked a guy with a pen who was insolent to Ace. The fake blood is completely made with CGI as well, for this reason the murder scenes lack the very realism of Scorsese's previous gangster flicks.<br/><br/>In general, this is one of Scorsese's best films. I would say that this is his best film since ""Casino""."

","I only stuck it out until the end because I kept thinking eventually something would materialize that would have made the wait worth it. That moment never came. In addition to being too long there were a number of annoying details that made this unbelievable. First being the incredible miscasting of key roles. Though I love De Niro and Pacino, both were obviously too old for the characters they played, and giving De Niro blue eyes did not convince me he was Iris-especially when he begins too speak fluent Italian (from spending 4 years in Italy fighting in WWII, really?). The children never age over time, 70 something year old De Niro has a young baby, leaves his wife for another woman, who then become friends. Lastly, the male characters obsession over the middle daughter was bizarre, and uncomfortable to watch as I was unsure where that was going. All in all it was a major disappointment and waste of an evening."

"kpassa","5","5","14","30 November 2019"," What Was The Point?
","The film was beautifully made but Scorcese, DeNiro and Pesci had already made their masterpiece in Goodfellas and Pacino had already made his masterpiece in the Godfather movies so why make another gangster movie, especially about a subject few people remember and even fewer care about anymore? I'm guessing it's because they are all heading for the Nursing home like Frank Sheeran and they wanted a swan song before they checked out. I don't see how all of the rave reviews can save this movie because if you took all of the reviewers and put them in a theater they would barely fill it for one showing. Who is going to fill the theaters after that? Oh well, at least that huge budget provided employment for a lot of people and they can have a merry Christmas."

"rugolin","9","5","14","25 November 2019"," The Forrest Gump of Gangster Films.
","There has been some debate whether the story in this film is actually true or accurate or if Frank Sheeran was just a fabulist. Martin Scorsese says that is beside the point as he wanted to tell a story about men who live by a violent code of honor that may not be the most productive thing they could have done with their lives. Frank Sheeran like the eponymous Gump seems to be at the center of so many historic events in the 60s and 70s that it has a bit of an epic historical feel to it. Scorsese adds a surprising bit of humour throughout the film especially with pop up captions telling us the fate of minor characters throughout the story. Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro have actually put in a real set of performances in contrast to the lazy efforts and phoning it in for paycheques they have done for the last few years with less talented directors. It was great to see Joe Pesci again on the screen and he plays against type where instead of his trademark volatile and manic performance he gives one that is quiet,chilling and cunning. The period detail and music is first rate and the direction is practically perfect. If you could point to one flaw it would be the length. It seems that lately instead of getting theatrical cuts,more directors are giving us their directors cut which runs 3 hours+ in theaters. There were times I wished in the auditorium that there were still 10 minute intermissions like back in the day to get up and take a break or hit the washroom. That aside I would say this is another classic film that will be added to Scorsese's filmography and a great swansong for him,DeNiro and Pacino and a note taking exercise for everyone at the MCU on how to make a real film."
"GroovyDrew","10","5","14","17 November 2019"," A must see
","If you like The Godfather. If you liked Goodfellahs. If you liked Casino, that would make this movie a must see for you. The acting of all cast members was phenomenal. Great story. Intense scenes. So glad I went to see it!"
"adam-m-fontenot","10","5","14","15 November 2019"," A soul damned beyond recall
","In a magnificent performance, Robert De Niro plays Frank Sheeran, a man who becomes a pitiless killer for his bosses. Sheeran is expected to show them unflinching loyalty, but is never rewarded for his efforts by promotion out of the role of Teamster grunt. He receives only his superiors' recognition as a trustworthy man and the symbols of loyalty they bestow on him. Fortunately for his bosses, he's a man who values loyalty highly: he wears the mark of their trust for the rest of his life and carries their secrets to his grave.<br/><br/>This puts him in the unique position of experiencing first hand the effects of living by violence one's whole life. In Scorsese's other films, we frequently encounter depraved characters who enjoy every pleasure that life can offer without the filmmaker's explicit condemnation. We begin to understand how we too are wired to be attracted to their lifestyle, but we also watch these temptations damage a person by crushing their ability to live a recognizably human life. In Scorsese's films, we're allowed to decide for ourselves whether the cost is worth it, just as we are in life. Yet I doubt whether any Scorsese character has ever lost so much for so little benefit as Frank Sheeran. If De Niro wasn't utterly convincing in the role, if we didn't see the strength of his loyalty and friendships, we'd feel that Scorsese had finally become a moralizer.<br/><br/>We spend the first half of the film trailing De Niro as he becomes a hardened killer. As he turns his natural talents and creativity to evil, we see him corrupted by his connections until the path he ends up following seems like his only prospect. As this happens, we see the destruction it wreaks on his family. He grows distant from his wife and children, eventually becoming severed from them entirely. When they do meet, he's reduced to muttering empty platitudes about ""trying to protect them"", unable to find any way to connect. We're left to wonder if any reward could be worth destroying the love others have for you. Along the way we're treated to some wonderful acting from the family members, particularly Anna Paquin as Peggy Sheeran.<br/><br/>Stylistically, The Irishman is a good deal less showy than Scorsese's early films, and features simpler set design than The Wolf of Wall Street. The result is a grittier gangster film than Goodfellas, which further serves to minimize any visceral appeal of De Niro's character. Any desire to live like Sheeran is adrenaline fueled, not created by glamor. This creates additional empathetic distance between the character and ourselves, forcing us to ask how he found himself on this road. Like Esau, he sold his inheritance for a bowl of stew. Is that a realistic story? Scorsese would have us believe it is.<br/><br/>The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that showcases the range of pleasures available to the wealthy, along with the damage they do to others, one's family, and oneself, and asks us to say ""no"" in our hearts to this life. Does The Irishman have similar intentions? No. Leonardo DiCaprio's character Jordan Belfort is not hopelessly lost. However unlikely it seems, he could find the way back to a decent life. If that does turn out to be impossible, it's as much the result of American culture as it is his personal failings. Not so in The Irishman. It's hard to imagine an environment more apt to produce repentance than where Sheeran finds himself. He's surrounded by kind nurses and a very sympathetic priest who visits him regularly. The film makes it clear, however, that he's incapable of reform. It spends a remarkable amount of time at the end of the film considering just what it means to be damned. It's like a gangster's Wild Strawberries.<br/><br/>Most of us are inclined to be hopeful about even the worst cases and think hardly anyone could be too far gone. The priest is such a person; he helpfully puts words in De Niro's mouth and suggests that one can be repentant even if one does not feel it. He needs Sheeran to be, if not redeemed, at least redeemable. But Sheeran's case is more severe than any of Scorsese's previous characters. This is a person who's able to understand the desirability of being a better person, but whose soul is so dead that he's incapable of wishing for it in his heart, unable to see any path from here to there. All that is left for him is waiting for death to make an end of waiting. This miserable condition is what wrings pity out of us despite the distance. We are not him, but we could be.<br/><br/>As expected, all the technical elements of the film are top notch. The acting performances in particular shine, and it's great to see De Niro, Pacino, Keitel, Pesci, and the rest together again. (The boys are back!) The fact that I could never have guessed how many visual effects artists worked on the film speaks for itself. Scorsese shows his usual impeccable taste on the soundtrack. And Thelma Schoonmaker's editing deserves a lengthy review in itself. In short, I suspect this film will be widely acknowledged as one of Scorsese's best, and it demands to be seen on the biggest screen you can find it on. Yet what stands out the most to me is how well all of these elements were put to use to tell such a remarkable story, both like and unlike anything Scorsese has told before."

","Overly-long to the point of indulgence... presumably backed by Netflix executives egging Scorsese on to deliver a final masterpiece and stick the proverbial middle-finger to the larger film studios. Fail.<br/><br/>The Hoffa story has been covered before and Nicholson beats Pacino easily. Pacino dials in a watered-down version of the excellent 'Scent of a Woman'. And a haircut doesn't make a character! Fail.<br/><br/>De Niro looks downright freaky when de-aged and there are several scenes where it's excruciatingly obvious that he is an actor in his 70s, in poor shape, trying to portray a thug who is decades younger. The grocery store scene for example... painfully bad film-making. Fail.<br/><br/>The inclusion of Anna Paquin makes absolutely no sense at all. With virtually no dialogue and adding nothing to the story, her talent is completely wasted. Fail.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the character of Peggy irritated me the entire movie. Are we supposed to be watching the movie through her eyes? Should we feel sorry for her? Why did she have such an aversion to Pesci's character? Why did she cut off her father? What did she see? What did she actually know? Did her sisters feel the same way? Silence and long stares. Fail.<br/><br/>If you're going to stuff a film full of A-list actors the story, characterisation and acting must be A-grade too. In too many scenes I found myself pulled out of the movie and watching the actors themselves... it's irritating! Fail.<br/><br/>One thing I liked? Stunning period cars, harking back to a time when they were extravagant works of art.<br/><br/>Ultimately, there is simply no pay-off to this movie. The tension doesn't build to any kind of gratifying conclusion. I felt no sense of empathy or sense of loss for the last man standing: old, decrepit, lonely, and fading away in an old people's home. I felt no nostalgia for the bygone age of mobsters, thugs, and crime families that we've come to love in films like Goodfellas, The Untouchables, and others. This felt like a bloated, filler-episode, of a TV series running out of ideas, and overdue for cancellation.<br/><br/>Sorry, Mr Scorsese. Some of your movies are of the highest calibre.

The main characters are approaching eighty, so to make them look younger, even the non-speaking parts are senior-citizens. With the use of digital technology Notflix are able to make aged but distinguished familiar faces look uncannily waxy-young with old eyes, and we also pad their great-grandfatherly frames out with «muscle-shirts» so their stooped,crabby bodies look ungainly fat while of course retaining the charming stiff, doddering movements of geriatrics.

"billmarsano","4","3","7","8 April 2020"," Scorsese Misses His Own Point
","Critic love Martin Scorsese, Hollywood, not so much. That has cause the former to over-compensate, as if they could shout an Oscar into being. Nice try. Scorsese clearly intended a loving and fond farewell to the great days of the Mafia, when organized crime at east had, within its own ghastly context, some class, some honor, some style. (Can you imagine the Mexican drug cartels inspiring anything like 'The Godfather'? Surely not.) The nostalgia-laden closing scenes make that clear (I half- expected 'Those Were the Days, My Friend' to be in the score at that point). But the result is 189 minutes of slow-moving, dreary brutality by a character who seems chosen to demonstrate the banality of it all. Then there's the documentary tone that creeps in via expository scenes, complete with captions, that explain long-forgotten mob episodes. (Keep in mind that a central conflict-between the mob and Teamsters Union boss Jimmy Hoffa-dates to the 1970s. That resonates with what percentage of today's audience-10, maybe? The mob vs. JFK goes back to the early 1960s. Hell, why not throw in Judge Crater? The Irishman himself is a dullard-boss points finger, Irishman pulls trigger: no thoughts or feelings intrude. His brutal beat-down of a storekeeper in the presence of his young daughter is an hommage to 'The Sopranos,' but extended as the source of her lifelong alienation, it's close to theft. The acting was fine, if overpraised, and I though Al Pacino s Hoffa misread his main line ""It's my union"" by stressing the noun instead of the possessive pronoun. In short, critical unanimity should always be suspected."

His delivery of a powerful, yet low key behavior was also very appreciated. Not over the top caricatures but real characters fleshed out, as flawed and dangerous, but human and even tender at times.

The movie is deliberately paced to assurp all the fine details, the acting is at a stratospheric level and story is complete.

","I just watched it and when I first saw the faces of De Niro and Pesci I thought hmm those look strange. So that was it. After 30 minutes I had to online and I find out what is happening there. CGI edited faces. I really tried to overlook it, since I am a big fan of De NIro, Pesci, Pacino, Keitel. I was really excited finally getting the time and it is 3.5 hours to completely watch in one piece.
But I cannot overlook it. I am kind of angry that Martin Scorsese and Netflix ruined this movie, which was probably the final moment in this format for those 4 guys together on screen.
I honestly cannot say much about the rest of the movie and maybe have to rewatch it later again. But for now that is it.<br/><br/>Sp prepare yourself, unlike me, and watch some trailer before or screenshots.<br/><br/>On a side note. Knowing what I know now will definitely affect watching future pictures. Well on Netflix you normally get only muscle packed hunks and perfect women anyways. So does it make a difference?"
"Kingslaay","Null","3","7","22 December 2019"," Vintage Scorsese: Another classic
","Ever since I heard of this film and cast I awaited with eager anticipation. The director who made the iconic Goodfellas and Casino was back again with his usual crew. The Irishman does not lose a step, its pace is quick and information is hurled at you. You are taken on a big journey and experience a great deal of infamous mob history. This is a fantastic film from start to finish and this stellar cast hits it out of the park.<br/><br/>Al Pacino steals the show and every scene he is in. We get an intimate look at the lives of Hoffa, Frank and a number of key figures over time. The beauty of this film is the depth and connections of all these figures. The Irishman brings history and organised crime to life. I will be watching this film another time to experience and pick up even more.<br/><br/>We should count our lucky stars that we got to see Scorsese team up with the likes of De Niro, Pacino and Jo Pesci for what will become a classic. 8.5/10"
"cordenw","7","3","7","19 December 2019"," why didn't you use younger actors to portray them in their youth?
","OK , so you'd have to pay them more than it cost you to do the CGI but it would have given some younger actors a break and we wouldn't have had to suffer through the ""avatar"" type cartoon scenes.
I don't know how Scorsese was convinced that this was the best route to go because he must have been given samplers at the outset.
The real weakness in this technology is that it only really alters the faces and it is very obvious in parts of the action that there's creaking old bones underneath a young visage.
When DeNiro is beating up a shopowner it looks like an outtake from the old people's home, you half expect him to fall over after the effort. In many other situations it looks like the old age walkers have been edited out .
But if you can get past these shortcomings it's not too bad of a movie. Any time you've got the Mob and the Irish involved in fighting with Unions and Politicians then you've got me interested.<br/><br/>It's a great portrayal of the Union thuggery and bullying, contrasted against the Mob's respect for hierarchy. Both of them of course find it easy to get politicians in their pockets and both of them too have no hesitation in getting rid of the ones that go rogue on them.
What is missing is the raw energy of headstrong youth and power that we saw in the Godfather series.
The menace is still there but it somehow seems old hat in these days of billionaires, oligarchs, tax havens and global corruption.<br/><br/>Some of those guys in countries like Malaysia, The Ukraine and uncountable African crapholes make more in a day than the entire crime system in the USA makes in a year.
Fun to watch though, you have to break it up into a couple or three viewings as it's a very very long movie."
"Mike_O_Dwyer","4","3","7","17 December 2019"," An Awful Lot Of Not Very Much
","Let's get this out of the way first: the CGI used to youngify the leads proves that indeed you can make actors look younger, in this case a 76 year old De Niro looks like a 50 year old De Niro with too thick make up and a bad wig playing a 35 year old De Niro with dodgy knees. Yes, it's marvellous that they can de-age faces to a certain extent, but the body language is completely out of whack - as are body sizes and shapes for anyone who knows what these guys looked like in their young gun days. It's off-putting, a distraction, and a bad call all round.<br/><br/>I'm old enough to remember watching Raging Bull in the cinema when it first came out, being blown away by De Niro and, as a young teenager, wondering why more films weren't shot in black and white; I'd always been a fan of old black and white movies and it was a revelation that there was someone who still thought it was a good idea to shoot that way. After Raging Bull I was hooked on Scorsese and De Niro, eagerly scouring film magazines to see what each of them were up to - back then films would take months to make it across the Atlantic. I wasn't disappointed, their collaborations and individual output filled up my teenage years and saw me through college. Scorsese had The King of Comedy, After Hours, The Color of Money, Goodfellas (easily the best gangster movie since The Godfather), and even Cape Fear, a wonderful hammy genre flick that indulged both of them before returning to more grounded form with Casino. De Niro had other movies too: The Deerhunter, Once Upon A Time In America, Brazil, The Untouchables, The Mission, Angel Heart, Midnight Run, and Heat.<br/><br/>These are all films that The Irishman is not nearly as good as.<br/><br/>I think there's too much nostalgia for what Scorsese and de Niro have given us over the years, how we feel about them and their legacy is being conflated with how we ought to feel about The Irishman. I've watched it twice now and, although I quickly skimmed through it the second time, it seems to be a whole lot of hoo hah about not very much. De Niro plays Frank Sheeran, an ex-soldier and truck driver who becomes a hitman for the mob. Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, Al Pacino are all correct and present. Pesci quietly threatens with eyes that seem weary and weighted down by a lifetime of hard calls, Pacino always looks like the liveliest dancer in an old folks home, the one who can't sit still and wants everyone to join in whatever trouble he has brewing.<br/><br/>The movie plays out like the longest day of exposition. We don't really get to know these people at all. We get told a huge amount about an awful lot of stuff, but everything happens at a sit-down pace until those few moments when De Niro can gather up enough energy to walk to a location and blow something up or blow someone away - but those are only brief interludes. Honestly, even now, so soon after watching it I have trouble thinking of a memorable scene or even a line that might become quotable. Stephen Graham's Tony Pro turning up to a meeting, smug and arrogant, is pretty much as close to dangerous as this thing gets.<br/><br/>It all looks beautiful. The re-creation of different eras. Shop sign typography. Music. Cars. Street scenes. Clothes. All the incidental things that provide a wonderful backdrop. But gangster stories need larger than life characters to pull you in, not a bunch of old guys reminiscing about who did what to whom before looking around and realising they're the only one left breathing.<br/><br/>Disappointing."
"Tremarco01","3","3","7","17 December 2019"," Disappointed
","For a cast like this I thought it was at least going to be good but was I wrong, CGI was terrible and far to boring to be a gangster film. If your expecting something like Goodfellas it's far from it."
"jadavix","9","3","7","15 December 2019"," Oldfellas
","The spectre of death hangs over ""The Irishman"" more than any other mobster movie I know. When you think about it, that's quite a strong statement; I'd hate to know what the combined body-count of every Scorsese mafia flick is. But those movies generally dealt with money-hungry fools who didn't know what we knew; that death is coming for them.<br/><br/>And cold-hearted sociopaths who knew how to avoid it for a little while longer.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie know. Part of it is the casting; Joe Pesci is out of retirement here, most of us haven't seen him since ""The Good Shepherd"" back in 2006, but our most vivid memories of him will always be from ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" as a psychopathic pipsqueak with a volcanic temper, or from the Lethal Weapon series and ""My Cousin Vinnie"" as a quintessential conman.<br/><br/>Here, however, those traits are gone, and though he plays a mobster, he seems like one who is tired of bloodshed, tired of rage, tired of lying.<br/><br/>We first see our protagonist, Frank Sheeran, the titular Irishman, as an old man, clearly on his last legs, and the transition, even from middle age, that we see him make in the movie is remarkable.<br/><br/>This sense of foreshadowing is continued with the use of titles to introduce characters as they appear on screen, followed by a subtitle, telling you how, and when, they'll die - generally by violence, ie. an exploding car, or being shot six times in the head.<br/><br/>And yet the film is quite a bit less violent than the typical Scorsese movie. It still has a pretty steep body count, and no shortage of blood, but there's nothing really graphic like the head in the vice scene in ""Casino"", or the spike through the neck in ""Goodfellas"".<br/><br/>The film is, of course, a truly masterful and riveting jolt of cinema. And yes, it tells the story of Frank Sheeran, a small-time hitman who became personal friends with the infamous Jimmy Hoffa, and may have had involvement in his disappearance.<br/><br/>You're on IMDB. You don't need me to tell you what it's about. So I will tell you something you might not know about ""The Irishman"": it is also something none of the other Scorsese crime films were. It's moving. You really feel for this bad man. Toward the end of the movie I wondered if I might shed a tear.<br/><br/>Think about the casting of Anna Paquin while you're watching this movie. I think it was a very deliberate, and ingenious, choice to put such a well known actress in this role. It leaves you waiting for something. You don't get it. Imagine how Frank Sheeran, her father, feels about that?<br/><br/>Life is like that. You don't always get closure.<br/><br/>But how can you not feel for him?<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" is one of the best movies of 2019."

","This movie frustrates me. I generally try to not take outside factors into a movie with me but between the anti-Marvel comments by Scorsese and the build up, the promises of an epic movie, sure to be an instant classic.<br/><br/>Nope. This movie's boring.<br/><br/>That seems to not be the popular consensus but oh well. The Irishman is 209 minutes. Three and a half hours of Scorsese's overindulgence. This could have easily been trimmed down to a solid three hours by focusing the story, maybe not having a dozen different, forgettable characters.<br/><br/>The fact that it's yet another Scorsese mob movie doesn't help. I feel like I've seen this all before and in those instances I didn't have aging actors trying to act young during scenes where they obviously weren't physically up to the task. It just feels like a lot of really dragged out rehash.<br/><br/>It might sound like I hated this but I didn't. De Niro andPacino are solid, not amazing or anything to me but they're good. RayRomano delivers a very enjoyable performance for the smaller role that he has. At the end of the day though, this movie is absolutely stolen by the return of Joe Pesci in a far more restrained, calculated but no less dangerous role that makes me really wish we'd gotten to see more of him in recent history.<br/><br/>There are also a few scenes that are legitimately tense. Some events that are performed with shockingly brutal efficiency. Character moments that are fascinating.<br/><br/>I've always been fascinated by the Hoffa story. He was a legendary figure whose demise has reached truly infamous levels. Trying to capture all of that is a lofty task and getting the likes of Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino and Pesci together sounds like it should be a home run. It just suffers from being too bland and drawn out for its own good. Part of me thinks I need to watch it again, but at three and a half hours, it will probably be a while before I feel like enduring this one again."
"garethcrook","6","3","7","11 December 2019"," The weight of expectation.
","The Irishman. Well obviously it's too long, three and half hours is nuts, but with a cast like this, where the hell do you cut? Pacino chews the scenery, DeNiro's the slick backbone, Pesci... I don't know how old he is, but he's still terrifying. Age, much has been said about the de-ageing technique used here and how distracting it is. Personally I found it a bit weird to start but it didn't bother me that much. Plot wise there's nothing new, a vast cast of gangster characters (Stephen Graham is also fantastic) who's stories thread together in predictably violent ways. It looks great, slick with no expense spared and it's nice to see DeNiro in something with some real weight again. The pace is slow, familiar, comforting, with characters that feel like old friends... albeit scary ones. Despite all its methodical twists and turns though, it feels a little thin. Everyone is portrayed with surface detail, I wish there was just a little more under the hood and even with its contemplative tone giving it a bit more depth than the more standard Scorsese mob affair, it really didn't excite me and I was quite relieved when the credits rolled. The rating may seem a little harsh, but expectation killed this for me, but it's worth a watch and may even grow on me."

","I watched this movie on Netflix and was utterly underwhelmed by it after the three and a half hours I endured.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is a brilliant actor who has a brilliant history but his talent has certainly faded with age and he can no longer deliver convincing performances, certainly not in this sort of role at least. Earlier scenes where he is portraying the much younger character were almost laughable, his hair and wrinkles were touched up to take years off his appearance but you couldn't help but see an aged man and it ruined every scene. There's a particular one in which he confirms someone for something they did to his daughter and the guy screams in pain but De Nero can barely lift his foot off the ground let alone swing a convincing blow.<br/><br/>Al Pacino was equally as bad, some of his line delivery was worse than kids performing in a school nativity play in primary school. He did have a couple of good scenes but on the whole it was another tragic Pacino performance.<br/><br/>As for the film storyline, there is just not enough substance in there to justify the runtime. I was seriously bored less than an hour into it and at the end of it was left feeling like I'd wasted my time. There is somewhat of an interesting gangster movie in there but there are far more irrelevant and unfulfilling scenes. I feel like there is at least an hour that could have been cut from the film that wouldn't have taken anything away from the story.<br/><br/>It's a shame, I was really looking forward to watching this and bought into all the hype but it didn't come close to living up to it."

"hunter-friesen","8","3","7","3 December 2019"," Scorsese crafts crime epic with ""The Irishman""
","Sprawling fifty years and dozens of features, director Martin Scorsese has crafted one of the finest filmographies in cinematic history. Over the decades, there appear to be two sides to the revered auteur's style of filmmaking. One side is filled with fast-paced and violent storytelling in films such as ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"", and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". On the other side is a more slow and quiet study of the human condition that can be found in ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", ""Kundun"", and ""Silence"". Now after years of being disjointed, these distinct styles have finally melded together in the director's newest Netflix film, ""The Irishman"".<br/><br/>Telling the true-ish story (it's still hotly debated whether any of it is true) of mob hitman Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran, the film places its main character at the forefront of American history in the mid-twentieth century. Over the years, Sheeran became increasingly attached to mob life, eventually leading him to the infamous teamster Jimmy Hoffa, whose fate is still unknown to this day. But as Frank rises the ranks within the mob, we watch as he slowly descends into a life of violence where the riches are short-lived and damaging effects are ever-lasting.<br/><br/>The first thing you'll probably notice when looking up the film is its massive 209-minute runtime, which makes it the longest mainstream movie released in over a quarter-century. That amount of length may be daunting on paper, but Scorsese makes every minute of it glide by with ease. His usual style of kinetic editing and pacing are masterfully employed and keep the film entirely thrilling throughout. By the time the film has finished, you feel as though you have lived a life with these characters rather than just watched it.<br/><br/>Another production facet that the film carries is a revolutionary new technology that digitally de-ages its main cast so they're able to play their characters over multiple decades. Admittedly, the gimmick doesn't work perfectly as the 76-year old Robert De Niro never convincingly looks like his thirty-year-old self. But even with its missteps, the technology is never a bother and seamlessly works its magic in the scenes where the characters are closer to the actor's age.<br/><br/>Adapted by Steven Zaillian from the book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"", ""The Irishman"" is a dense (maybe too dense) and depressing crime epic. Scorsese's trademarked main character narration is here in its entirety as Sheeran tells his life story while in a nursing home near the end of his life.<br/><br/>Even though Scorsese implements his usual gangster style within the script, its use here is for an altogether different purpose than previous films. Instead of showing the often joyous life of criminals with smugness, the script fully exposes us to the doom and gloom that a life of crime brings to someone.<br/><br/>Frank is the main character in our story, but within his story, he's always off to the side as he gets caught up in the everlasting destruction around him. By the time the third act reaches and the characters are reflecting on their past, their sad nature is fully exposed. All the acts these characters committed were paid for in death and despair, with the reward being even more of the same.<br/><br/>Teaming up with Scorsese for their ninth collaboration, Robert De Niro does his best work in decades in the titular role. His performance as Frank is closed-off and internal, further highlighting that Sheeran had little control over his life. The further the story progresses, the more haunting De Niro becomes as he can more clearly see where the road will take him.<br/><br/>On the complete opposite side of the spectrum, Al Pacino plays the infamous union boss Jimmy Hoffa. We've always known that Pacino has fervor in his acting repertoire. His only problem over the years was how to effectively channel it to the right performance. Fortunately, there seems to be a method to Pacino's madness here as his boisterous fire perfectly complements De Niro's coldness.<br/><br/>Playing against type is another frequent Scorsese collaborator in Joe Pesci as mob boss Russell Buffalino. Even if it may be his quietest role to date, Pesci instills fear through his menacing delivery and stares.<br/><br/>Rounding the ensemble cast is Harvey Keitel, Bobby Cannavale, Ray Romano, Jesse Plemons, and Anna Paquin; all of which do great work in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>Proving that the two sides of Martin Scorsese work better together than separate, ""The Irishman"" is a crime classic on par with the greats before. Its extensive tale of remorse and sorrow is worth every minute you put into it. If you only see a handful of movies a year, make sure this Netflix epic is one of them."

On one hand I love that in the scene the director didn't show us Jimmy's face when Frank killed him, but on the other hand I really wanted to see both the great actors showing the complex emotions. Pacino the unbelievable betrayal by his most trusted accomplice and most of all I wanted to see how D Niro would face the man who he owes everything to while taking a shot at him. I feel like we were deprived of a spectacular piece of acting in the movie.
All the major actors and the director of the movie have crossed their 70s, some are well onto their 80s, I fear that we won't see a masterpiece of this Calibre again. We might be bidding farewell to mafia movies for good..."

","The flavour of the movie is like a cake you expect to be great and has a good enough taste to make you feel ok but lacks the icing on top of it like the older classical (cakes) movies. The Irishman I thought would have an Irish accent but nope it was a full tried and tested rehash of older gangsta movies that have worked in the past. I think that's what disappointed me is the fact the plot and storyline have been used too many times and it's getting worn out. The acting was great but the split and storyline have been reused with a few tweaks here and there.

","We often see even 1h20m movies (which is pretty short) that we think that, due to their simplistic choices, could be done in half an hour. What we rarely see is a 3h30m movie that never loses interest. Strong writting, masterful directing, beautiful cinematography and topnotch performances are some of the things that make this movie live up to the high expectations. Despite the old-time-favorite gangster style of Scorsese, which is so entertaining to watch, it has a darker vibe because all the characters really suffer the consequences of their actions. It also has it's moments of comedy which are really funny. The only problem i had is that it became more depressing than i needed at some points. In conclusion it was for sure one of the best movies of the year and i also believe will age very well."

","This movie is Scorsese at his formulaic best.
The initial long shot with the accompanying soundtrack and characters who are given time and scope to develop.
The initial shock of the characters being CGI'd into their prime is initially shocking and a little unconvincing, but becomes acceptable fairly quickly. However there is no disguising that these are now old men and the stiff-hipped De Niro is simply unconvincing, especially when beating up a grocer who has mistreated his daughter. It is probably a scene where a body double could be justified.<br/><br/>The acting from all is, as can be expected, very good, however Joe Pesci is stellar and steals every scene. The look that he gives when a guy has to ""go"" is chilling.
Pacino is also worthy of note and turns in an excellent performance. He has backed off from his ""shouty phase"" and it works.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a very good movie and well worth a watch.<br/><br/>I'm sure that with further viewings much more will surface."

The storytelling is a bit disjointed at times, they put out something onscreen and expect everybody to automatically understand what they're looking at.<br/><br/>The pacing is a bit slow, especially on the first half of the movie. It gets consistently interesting only after Jimmy Hoffa's disagreements with the Mafia got worst and worst.<br/><br/>Overall the movie had a good story to tell, but at the same time I am getting sick and tired of seeing these CRIMINALS being portrayed as ""somewhat decent"" people instead of the animals that they really are."

I could not even begin to ponder what the ages of the characters at any given time. I gave it 2 stars because there were interesting insights presented regarding the history of the Hoffa era. DeNiro does what he usually does in movies: repeating words over and over. Pacino does what he usually does as well, gruff talking and at times maniacal. In other words, they were not very convincing in their roles. Pesci played a character that I felt was not in his typical wheelhouse and I liked his performance.

","Just seeing DeNiro and Pacino joining forces on the silver screen again is enough to bring on the chills. And then there's Scorsese. And Pesci.

A, possibly last, chance to see the giants of old act their hearts out against one another.<br/><br/>And truth be told, I didn't expect much more of this film. Some great nostalgia. Possibly a punch to the gut as I realize how time flies. And that would have been fine with me. I would still have paid to see it.<br/><br/>But it's clear as day that's not enough for them. Because this isn't just nostalgic nod to the past, but a masterpiece in its own right.<br/><br/>The film centers around DeNiro's character Frank, an old mob hitman telling us about his past. Of how he got to work for the Russell Bufaino (Pesci). Of his friendship and ultimate betrayal of Jimmy Hoffa (superbly portraited by Pacino). And of his regrets in regards of to how his children came to view him and his crimes.<br/><br/>The three-and-a-half hour of runtime may scare some, but to me it was worth every second of it. The main trio of actors are excellent. As is the rest of the cast. And the camerawork. And most everything else; the suspense is high, dialogue is sharp and progress steady.

I bow and kiss the boots of Joe Pesci,Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino and even Harvey Keitel in a small roll where all he had to do was look and barely speak.
Thank you Marty for making the type of movie I thought i'd never see again. The dialogue was sublime,it's old school acting with pauses and subtleties that make you think and full of Scorcese signature moments.
True there are no grand surprises in movie making here but as a fan of this genre it does't disappoint.
I spotted 5 characters from the Sopranos in small roles. Steve Van Zandt as the crooner was a laugh.
Then Pesci's character makes an ironic reference to the fairy Ferrie that he himself played in JFK.<br/><br/>This movie feels like nostalgia and it's meant to be.

Robert DiNiro fits his role well but this should've been done when he was younger. Great acting from many actors that I enjoyed but there was really nothing going for this movie. I suffered through the last hour wondering when the movie was going to end.

","In a nursing home Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran recounts his days as a teamster and mob hitman. Included in his history is his association with famed Union leader Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>Incredible story. Based on the book ""I heard you paint houses"" by Charles Brandt and directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie features the usual Scorsese elements of grittiness and engaging storytelling. Quite an intriguing plot, revolving around one of history's most famous mysteries.<br/><br/>Scorsese also surrounds himself with his favourite actors - Robert De Niro (of course), Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel - and actors with ""mob movie cred"": Al Pacino, Stephen Graham (who played Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire), Bobby Carnavale. It's as if Scorsese was trying to include at least one face from every major mob movie or TV series. I'm sure if James Gandolfini was alive he'd have a part! Steven Van Zandt does have a very minor part, so The Sopranos is still represented!<br/><br/>However, in creating this all-star cast the first problem appears: De Niro, Pacino and Pesci are too old for their roles. While some of the scenes are set when the actors are older, much of the movie is set in their middle ages, 30s and 40s. Despite all the best attempts to make them look younger, through makeup and special effects, it is clear that they are not that young, through their movements. It is difficult to imagine Frank Sheeran / Robert De Niro as much of a threat when he looks so fragile.<br/><br/>As much as Scorsese wanted to stay loyal to people like De Niro and Pesci, and remind audiences of his previous work with them, a better option would have been to hire younger actors for the roles. It is easier to make a younger actor older than an older actor younger.<br/><br/>The other issue is the length of the movie. At 3½ hours the film it was always going to be interesting to see whether the film could remain engaging throughout. It mostly is, but there are scenes that could easily have been edited out. While it never really drifts, Scorsese could easily have conveyed the same amount of plot development with less detail.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie, but not perfect."

However, it was nice seeing them all in one place for almost certainly the last time. In that regard, the film feels like much more of a nostalgia piece than anything else. Pesce's performance as a cool, understated mobster was my favorite of the three. DeNiro was much too stiff and emotionless. And it felt like Pacino was playing a hodge-podge of other Pacino characters more than he was playing Hoffa.<br/><br/>There are some solid performances here: Stephen Graham is particularly good as Tony Pro (I was also a big fan of his Al Capone in Boardwalk Empire). Ray Romano is also convincing.<br/><br/>Beyond all that, the film lacks those classic signature Scorcese moments that I think we've all come to expect. The plot is also a bit of a mess.<br/><br/>It's probably unfair to compare so many years later, but Goodfellas and Casino are FAR, FAR better Scorcese gangster films.

Although there is a degree of interest from an historical perspective - particularly matters relating to the union movement, I am not from the USA and they don't mean as much to me as they otherwise may have.
I did find the film a little difficult to follow at times - often the case with gangster flicks, and at 3 1/2 hours in length it does tend to drag a little. I think it may have been better reduced to about 2 hours.
A lot of reviewers have rated this movie very highly, Ratings that it probably deserves for its quality but at the end of day, a movie is primarily intended to entertain - something that it failed to do for me.

It doesn't feel like we are really in a mob setting aside from a few scenes here and there. Pacino does a solid job, when he's angry and better than his recent work but he's a bit done. Joe Pesci did a very good job as the silent but deadly made man, though it's noticeable he hasn't done anything recently. I know it's based on a book, but a little more action and feeling for the world they live in wouldn't have hurt. Not once did you feel DeNiro or Pesci actions had repercussions or that they would be in serious danger. No real rivalries. It was a bit too much like reading a book, some scenes / parts dragged on for too long with all the conversation. Kind of ironic given Scorsese going off on Marvel, maybe he should have focused on this movie. It's solid, but not a masterpiece by any standard. The actors cary this movie, not the production nor the writing nor the soundtrack. I really think people who give this a 8-10 are just excited Pesci, Pacino and DeNiro are finally in a movie after so many years.

Well I saw a lot of great movies by Netflix but when it comes to Bluckbuster kinda movies, I donno.<br/><br/>Even THE GODFATHER Trilogy all together cannot replace this movie.

But as you can see, all of the others were made back in 20th century. Only this one was included just now.<br/><br/>This one was so unique for me because of this one typical scene when Frank(De Nero) kills his old time buddy Hoffa (Pacino). Tha process, the excitement, the everything in his mind before actually doing it. Shall I do it? Shall I really have to do it? It's not like Michael Coleone's first killing from THE GODFATHER. This is a whole different situation. The one who ordered to kill Hoffa is almost the same as the one he has to kill love wise. But he had to do it.<br/><br/>Just like the movie THE GODFATHER, his only excuse was to save his family, he did that all the killing.<br/><br/>When the time came and he is about to die, I felt two things about life.<br/><br/>No matter how much money, power, friends you had, life is just so in vain.<br/><br/>Just don't do anything that you might regret.<br/><br/>Think about it. His daughter (Anna Paquin-Hoffa really loved her like his daughter) the only one who have guessed that he killed Hoffa never met him till her father dies.<br/><br/>What is right and wrong in life? How can you choose between two things? This will be the everlasting question in each and one of us's life until we die.<br/><br/>All the actors 10/10.

The pacing of the movie is deliberately slow, to give a sense of the span of time.

"senor_spielbergo123","Null","2","4","11 February 2020"," Scorsese - The Movie
","The Irishman is an epic mob gangster drama - Martin Scorsese's speciality. It's a genre that isn't fresh anymore, by a director that already had mastered it. The story is about a man who is a relic of a long gone era and it stars actors from a an older era. It plays with themes like reflecting, reminiscing, justification, regret... In short: it's very meta!<br/><br/>It's told slowly in a 70ies fashion, which I usually do enjoy. But I'll address the elephant in the room: 3.5 hours is too long! Well yes, it was released on Netflix, which allows you to pause it anytime. Yes, it's also not uncommon these days for people to binge watch a whole season of a show in one go, I know. But I will still judge it as a movie experience you sit through from beginning to end and 3.5 hours is too long!<br/><br/>The best part without a doubt: the acting of Pacino, Pesci and de Niro is just a delight. They are so familiar to us in this type of movie that you immediately accept their roles. Even the de-aging didn't take me out of the immersion.
It never becomes boring to watch them doing the dirty mob business. But although it is very well made, it never feels like the movie delivers anything groundbreaking - at least if you are already familiar with Scorsese's oeuvre.<br/><br/>You could get in the edit room and cut out 20 minutes and it would hold up nonetheless. So why not just trim it then? It's almost like they were proud of how long they can make it. Around 2 hours and 15 minutes in, it kept banging on about how Jimmy (Pacino) needs to be convinced to give up his career ambitions. That part felt way too long and it was the first time I was starting to get impatient.<br/><br/>Also, the ending could have been a bit slicker and it didn't leave me very emotional. I think Frank's (de Niro) daughter(s), who later in life abandoned the retired gangster, should have had a bigger role in the movie for it to leave a devastating mark.<br/><br/>In an age where Marvel CGI blockbusters are all the rage, I'm glad that Scorsese is still around to make movies like this. A movie that feels like a story about people and not just like a theme park ride as Scorsese has put it. However, it just didn't bring much new to the genre. I'm afraid I have zero interest in ever watching it again and I think Goodfellas holds up for rewatching well. Or maybe I would rather watch Coppola's Godfather 1 & 2 or Leone's Once Upon a Time in America instead. Therefore, I can only give a rating below 8/10."

"bobzmcishl","8","2","4","9 February 2020"," Classic Mob Movie Based on Real Events
","This was a movie we waited until the day before the Oscars to see on Netflix. It is an intimidating 3.5 hours in length. As another reviewed said, the first two hours went by pretty quickly but the last 1. 5 hours dragged. It would have been fairly easy to snip about thirty minutes off and still leave the story intact. De Niro gives a great performance as a real life hitman who gets caught between his allegiance to Jimmy Hoffa and the mob leaders who are distressed that their Teamster pension fund piggy bank leadership is starting to push back on their demands, and doing it is a public way. Some of the movie may be unintentionally funny, as the mob language has become cliche, and is emulated by a certain president of the United States. Think ""Do me a favor."" I had a harder time believing Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa because Hoffa was shorter and so well known that Pacino's mannerisms get in the way of a more nuanced performance. Hoffa comes across somewhat sympathetic as he realizes he has made a bargain with the devil in his dealings with the mob. This may be the last great gangster movie but what a way to go out, with a movie based on so many traumatic real life events. All of the major hits (whack jobs) were fairly famous at the time such as the killing of Joey Gallo at Umbertos Clam House and the assassination of several mobsters in a hotel barber shop. Pesci is also excellent as the world weary mob boss who know what he has to do to keep himself alive and get people to do his bidding. He genuinely likes Hoffa but finds it increasingly harder to defend him because of his outspokeness. Whether the movie correctly depicts what happened to Hoffa, it is certainly plausible and explains why Hoffa disappeared, never to be found. One apparent truism in mob movies is no one is whacked just for the hell of it and not until all other avenues have been exhausted. They also like to use go betweens when they are communicating with others who may pose a problem. The go between, in this case played by De Niro, has a delicate balancing act in translating the responses from the mob bosses and Jimmy Hoffa. He is the ultimate mob ambassador. This is a great move no doubt, but make sure you set aside an appropriate amount of time to leisurely take in some classic performances."

This seriously bothered my friend Dan who watched it with me, but for me, the main character, the Irishman (played by Robert De Niro), is pretty easy to follow throughout. I enjoyed the film for all the usual reasons, but I must admit it's nice to see Joe Pesci in roles aside from Home Alone. Update: my buddy thought the cinematography was awful, so that's interesting.<br/><br/>Some of the 'usual reasons' that I didn't specify previously:
-cinematography
-performances
-script/story progression
-p editing and pacing (for a 3h30 movie, it was bound to get a little hectic, so overall I'm glad it's not worse.<br/><br/>I wonder if the CGI young R.

","One of the worst movies I've ever sat through. It took 3 sittings to get through it, and I only persisted because it kept getting good reviews, so I thought I must be missing something. Only thing I was missing was the 3 hours of my life I can't get back. If you like really long, and boring stories of old men, doing little more than getting older, this one's for you. Is hollywood so starved for actors that they have to resort to making old men look young? Why did they have young actors playing the younger women, and older women playing the older parts, and these sappy old men playing the young and the old? When Joe Pesci calls DeNiro ""Kid"" at the start thought it was going to be a comedy, but that was the only funny moment in a very long and very boring movie. Send it back to the cutting room and cut at least another hour off this thing and it might be worth another run. Just using well known actors and directors doesn't turn  into a gem."
"Rick96","8","2","4","24 January 2020"," In depth review -- spoilers
","Title: The Irishman (2019)<br/><br/>Scorsese's return to Mafialand, is an ultimate slow burn that lasts around 3.5 hours. Scorsese finds himself in familiar territory in this organized crime flick that is led by a hall of fame cast: De Niro, Pesci, and Pacino. This masterpiece of a movie has a very interesting take on the Jimmy Hoffa story -- which is just one of several theories of what might have happened in the real life events of the late 70s/early 80s.<br/><br/>The movie is seen from Frank Sheeran's eyes, a truck driver who got involved with Russell Bufalino and the midwestern organized crime outfit. Sheeran ultimately proves to be a rising star in the crime family and somewhat surprisingly finds his way to the top as the family's top hit man. The narration of this story is particularly interesting when you consider the fact that the latter half of the movie is about Sheeran himself recalling events that allude to his possible involvement with the slaying of Jimmy Hoffa, who was widely considered Sheeran's best friend at one time.<br/><br/>The Special effects in this movie were phenomenal. The de-aging technology paired with the strong acting from this timeless trio is amazing to see. While it is a bit uncanny to see fresh faces on these three men now in their 70s, the battle had just begun for the producers. They were faced with making the three men look 20-30 years younger in the majority of the movie and then allowing some of their advanced age to show as the scenes cut back to ""present day"". All in all, these effects were a nice modern touch on an old-school masterpiece.<br/><br/>I think the only bad thing I can say about this movie is that compared to its predecessor Goodfellas, the crime itself (which is largely true) is just not as interesting. Despite a bunch of small crimes and one-off hit scenes the macro story focuses on stealing steaks. They do a good job of building off of it but steaks aren't as inherently fun as casinos and inside mob stories. All things considered, this is a fantastic movie that can't help but seem like a goodbye from 3 of the greatest actors in Mob movie history. Grade A-"

","There's nothing fresh here. Growing up, Scorsese's movies were among my favorites. Yet, I feel there's nothing new here, no evolution, no depth. These are the same actors, the same script, the same everything, under different tints. In the case of De Niro, literally, with those unnatural blue eyes.<br/><br/>I feel like Pacino, De Niro, and Scorsese have really given all they could give through their art, their talent. De Niro's acting seems to be no different than it was decades ago; maybe it worked out brilliant a couple of times - Godfather II, Raging Bull, Heat -, but there's really nothing here. Al Pacino's mature characters seem to travel from one movie to the next, as an inter-dimensional traveler, giving out the same performances time after time. I was more impressed, though, by Joe Pesci, whose acting has more nuances. And Scorsese, the ultimate artist (lol), should go to a shrink and get over his obsession with the mafia. I, too, come from an Italian family, but there are other aspects in our parents' culture to be explored, Martin! Seriously, get over it!<br/><br/>This movie was incredibly boring and tedious. I have no problem with slow movies. I've watched Tarkovsky and love some lengthy Asian movies, for example.

Maybe he just needed a few decades to get here. The CGI for age changes is very cool but a little creepy at times. It feels like you're watching a high-end video game. It looks very real but there is just something a little off. There is at least an hour spent re-running the same essential story line. Not necessary. Just makes the movie drag on. I like the ending.

","In my opinion, ""The Irishman"" has it all - great actors, great story and a great director. The beginning is tame, and maybe even boring in certain parts. And yet, with every minute the story gets better.<br/><br/>What I like to see in a movie is how every character is important. We get to know the backstories of real-life characters portrayed in a movie, and Scorsese does a great job at showing how they're all connected, and how every single characters plays a part. In the cast we see the brightest stars in Hollywood, like Robert De Niro, as well as lesser known actors, for example Jesse Plemons. What I loved was how good Al Pacino was as Jimmy Hoffa. Many of his recent movies weren't the best ones, especially Hangman, in which the actors didn't even try to save the absolute disaster of a movie. In this one, Pacino shines as bright as in the good old days and shows he still is an excellent actor.<br/><br/>The story itself plays smoothly and precisely, although as I mentioned earlier I was a little bored during the beginning. Fortunately, as the years pass by, everything starts to make sense. It's not easy to show such a big part of someone's life in one movie, even if it lasts 3.5 hours. It came out really well, as the story isn't rushed. I would even say it's beautiful in a way, almost magical and aesthetically pleasing. The ending is an absolute masterpiece, and it ends the story in the best possible way.<br/><br/>It's not the best movie that came out in 2019, and probably not a one I would watch many times. Despite this, I clearly see Scorsese's genius, and without a doubt ""The Irishman"" deserves at least 8 stars."

While Al Pacino can pass as his character and the deaging looks ok on him, making him the most believable of the cast, the deaging really didn't work on Pesci whose neck is a dead giveaway of his real age, and both him and De Niro don't move and talk like younger mobsters with the bodies of younger men. Ultimately, they look like old men using a Snapchat filter, not multi million technology. Additionally the blue lenses on De Niro are just too distracting making him look he's got an eye disease, is high or both. Acting being also through the eyes, the lenses take away from that too much.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, it would have benefited from being shorter. At times it drags on too much making it boring. There are some really good moments, especially the scenes involving Hoffa (Al Pacino) where you get to understand the relationships and personalities. Other scenes don't feel necessary to advance the story or the characters.<br/><br/>It is a good film but with flaws. As much as I wanted it to be, it's not a 10/10"
"fatamorgana-40208","6","2","4","3 January 2020"," I just don't know....
","I read the reviews before I watched this movie and I told myself that all the negativity was just a result of people's personal feelings. I figured that fans had some unrealistic expectations and that this would be a really good film. I guessed that all those negative nellies had to be mistaken....
They were not mistaken. It pains me to say it, because how can you have a film with De Niro, Pacino, Pesci and Keitel, directed by Scorsese, with a plot revolving around Jimmy Hoffa and have it be utterly forgetful? I'm stunned. I'm confused. I feel like I'm being disrespectful to this cast of all-stars....and yet there isn't much good to say.
I really have no complaints about the acting or the directing. The film just seemed hollow to me. It felt empty, like the characters had no significant substance to them at all. Robert De Niro's loyalty to Pesci's character is all because he got his truck running when they first met? The next thing you know, De Niro's killing people for him? De Niro's love for Hoffa is all because he ran the Teamsters? That's it?
It makes no sense to me. There's no insight into Hoffa or his life. It's typical, generic gangster talk, been done a hundred times already. I feel like Scorsese was asking me to care about this movie but he gave me no reason to care about any of the characters or the story revolving around them. By the time Hoffa is killed, I was well past the point of caring.
This is a got-nuthin-else-to-do movie....don't waste a date night on it."

","First off, the scope of The Irishman is epic. This is a mammoth film. With a running time of 3 hours 29 minutes and a production budget of $159 million, this is one of Scorsese's most extensive productions.<br/><br/>The Irishman is a different kind of creature compared to Casino and Goodfellas so there's no point comparing them. The story is enthralling and engaging although it does lag at points and leads to a lack of plot focus.<br/><br/>Where the plot partially stalls, the character acting is second to none. This is the heart of the movie and what keeps you glued to the screen till the credit roll. The dynamic between De Niro, Pesci and Pacino is tense, provocative and emotionally dichotomous. You can't help but watch their respective destinys unravel.<br/><br/>This is a much more reflective mobster movie from Scorcese. Themes of trust, friendship and love flow through the plot. For me the moral of the story is that when trust is broken, you lose love and without love you have nothing.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch."

","""The Irishman"" (2019), written for the screen by Steven Zaillian and directed by Martin Scorsese, was an impressive experience to watch.<br/><br/>Running at three and a half hours, the film covers the events surrounding the assassination of Jimmy Hoffa, with Scorsese taking his time delivering its story. I found the film to be well-paced in spite of the long runtime.<br/><br/>What impressed me the most were the incredible performances from Pesci, Pacino, and especially De Niro, all of whom conveyed the different life periods with great emotional and acting-wise depth.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the film by far was its last 30 minutes, where the glory of mobster life was depicted as grueling and worthless. Here, I strongly believe Scorsese delivered his message of the film.<br/><br/>While I certainly found ""The Irishman"" to be a film of high quality in many respects, such as its production, I did not invest myself as much as in Scorsese's films such as ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" or ""Silence"". Still I recommend film buffs to see this."

"veewatson","8","2","4","2 January 2020"," A mature addition to Scorsese's legacy
","I had a hard time getting into the rhythm of this film at first, it's pace is slower than I'm used to from Scorsese. It feels more subtle and although I personally think a half hour could have been cut from this film, the point was to slowly build this man's (The Irishman) life.<br/><br/>DeNiro plays Frank with such authenticity, I was really sucked in by his performance. His acting really was tightly handled with each expression letting you in on his own inner world coping in the world of the mob. All the performances are impressive. Sometimes Pesci's character is tender, sometimes intimidating and sometimes wise. He is much more toned down than what you've seen before. It's the acting of great talent and wisdom. Pacino turns in a realistic performance that is primed to make you feel as frustrated and yet, loyal to the character as all the other characters around him. You really understand the conflicts, tension and years long relationship between the three main characters.<br/><br/>The direction is unmistakably Scorsese, it has his signature but it seems definitely mature and more patient than many audience members might expect. I think it will be hard for some to understand the choices made in the film. This is a film about aging and time, regret and denial, betrayal, trust and mentorship. It's not really a mob movie, it's about the effects of true to life crime.<br/><br/>Frank's regret is apparent yet he continues to suppress it down, hardly apologizing even in his later years confessional yet, one moment escapes his grasp. ""What kind of man makes that call?"" It's a heartwrenching depiction of his pain in losing his friend and consequently his daughter by not just his actions but by who he became. That's the story and it's a powerful one but it's not going to knock you over with overt story. You have to pay attention.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this was a moving film and one worth mulling over. It was too long and I thought it could have popped more in a few places. Still, what great acting and direction. I will probably watch it again, soon."

","If you're as strong as the sum of your parts, The Irishman is a diamond-clad instant classic.<br/><br/>Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino and Pesci. Together. It's the stuff of dreams.<br/><br/>With the instant excitement and anticipation that comes with hearing about a project like this is a natural worry that it won't fit in with their prestigious collective filmographies or, worst case scenario, that it might somehow besmirch their legacies. The fear was needless; this is as close to the magic of Goodfellas as you could hope for, but with added Pacino.<br/><br/>De Niro plays the titular role as Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran and the film sees him recounting stories from his days as a mafia hitman and close ally of Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino), the head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.<br/><br/>The film deftly jumps from Frank's first encounter with the head of the Buffalino crime family, Russell (Pesci), to present day and everywhere in between with all of the actors aged and de-aged in a really effective way. The eyes, and sometimes the mouths, are the only giveaways, but it's never enough to be jarring. Once you get used to seeing them so excellently aged in line with the timeline of events, you stop even noticing it.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure how I felt about the whole premise of de-aging the cast to such an extent but seeing how much it's paid off shows that this really was the only option; you couldn't have employed a younger cast to cover the early years and come up with something as powerful.<br/><br/>This is very much an epic glory lap for these titans of the mob movie genre and they are all at the top of their games and handing in performances as strong as those from 20 years ago.<br/><br/>The almost three and a half hour runtime may sound excessive, but I could've gladly watched more. The Irishman is quintessential Scorsese and it feels like something special; the kind of film so excellently crafted that it feels both new and nostalgic."

As one observer reckoned: ""Realistic and rather infrequent violence. There are some scenes of killing but not that many. 136 uses of ""f**k"", 20 uses of ""cocks****r"", 40 uses of ""sh--"", and other expletives, smoking and drinking throughout."" There is no other meaning or point with the film. It is unbearably tedious and boring in its consistently slow motion, there are only dirty pathetic old men who murder each other throughout the film, Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa is just overacting all the way, and finally there is a catholic priest absolving Robert de Niro for all his premeditated brutal murders, and there is an alarming lack of any sense of humour - a desert of meaningless human viciousness, the only oasis being his daughter Anna Paquin who finally refuses to have anything more to do with him, the professional cold-blooded murderer, who kills just for being told and paid to do so.

"iandavidrastall","8","2","4","30 December 2019"," Not Exactly A Hit, Man
","Giving this film a wide release at Thanksgiving time makes total sense. This should never have been in theaters in the first place. It uses breakneck pacing to connect three and a half hours of almost all dialogue into a quick watch. Provided you're at home. ""The Irishman"" is the best television movie you'll ever see. It's casually perfect. Nothing feels like a set, its re-creations feel like memory, and every performance is deeply natural. But it bears no fire of genius, as ""Goodfellas"" did. And De Niro is not pushing himself via strenuous method, as he did in ""Taxi Driver"". He's going for inscrutable. Emotionless. You can't fault him per se, as it's the direction. It's the character. But it says something that Todd Phillips was able to get *so* much more out of him in ""Joker"". That was really De Niro's 2019 star turn. Joe Pesci also has none of his unstable menace. Just gravitas, and a weird transformation into Steve Buscemi (which is neither here nor there -- I just think it's funny.) The women and girls in this movie have stories, yet those are all represented as a silent struggle, meaning almost no dialogue. Just meaningful glances. I suspect Scorsese considers it territory he doesn't have a right to explore. Maybe it'll be in the next one, as this seems to be part of a series. (It seems the full title is ""The Irishman: I Heard You Paint Houses"".) Or else it wasn't important enough for him. But it's very strange that the film keeps ignoring the only good characters -- with corresponding actors who can actually emote -- and focusing instead on the history of the drunk uncles. Sure, that history touches on some very interesting things, but in the end Scorsese is still exploring male characters that have gone beyond redemption, which adds up to three and a half hours of caring about someone who gives us little reason to. When I think back, I'm not sure that his films have ever brought me to tears. Which, play to your strengths, but there's been so many amazing movies in the last few years. Flat-out amazing. It's a little boring now to just be perfect. Even TV can do that."

"peeedeee-94281","6","2","4","28 December 2019"," Scorsese Returning to Old Form? Not Quite...
","I've all the different reviews, and much of the negative ones made me not want to watch the movie. But I finally checked it out on Netflix. It didn't hold my attention in one full sitting, I broke it up into 3.
Now, I'm not sure why Scorsese needed to use deaging technology in this movie. Just because you can do it, doesn't mean you should. Why not give some young, up-and-coming actors a chance? They could have done a good job playing the younger versions of the characters. Everyone looked like the old versions of themselves, except with darker hair. It was bizarre, like they were already old.
The story about Hoffa was interesting enough. Seeing the stuff that happened behind the scenes. And of course, one of the theories of what happened to him. That part of the movie was pretty good.
Some extraneous stuff that seemed unnecessary or padded the movie and could have been removed. Harvey Keitel - why was he in the movie? I guess he had to play Russel's boss, but was it necessary to even have him? He didn't really do much. He wasn't even menacing, if that was the intention. I love Keitel, but if you're going to have him in the film, at least give him a more lines.
The character of Peggy was unnecessary. I guess they wanted to have a central, family figure in Sheeran's life to show how his work took it's toll on them. But it felt forced, and unnecessary. Why have so much focus on Peggy as a little girl, weird focus. I didn't even realize Anna Paquin was playing that character until much later. It seemed pointless to have her play the older version.
Then there's the stuff that happens after Hoffa, it just drags on. The movie doesn't seem to know where to end. An extra 1/2 hr right there.
So while this movie had it's moments, and told an interesting story, the movie could have done with some generous editing."
"samwillpearce","8","2","4","20 December 2019"," Truly the Mafia movie to end all Mafia movies
","I'll be up front and say that I haven't seen an overabundance of Mafia movies, nor of Martin Scorsese movies, so it's difficult for me to judge ""The Irishman"" in that context. That being said, the Irishman is undeniably epic in scale, mafia-y to the core, while still feeling relevant and meaningful.<br/><br/>The three-and-a-half hour film examines most of the lifespan of real life union official and mafia hitman Frank Sheeran as he becomes more powerful and influential both within mafia circles and in the public sphere. Everything one would expect from this kind of movie is present and in full force--fantastic performances from de Niro, Pacino, and Pesci, gritty violence, flashbacks and non-linear storytelling galore, powerful direction from Scorsese--so let me skip praising all the given elements of this movie and get to what really makes it special.<br/><br/>Firstly, the aesthetic of the movie is wonderful. Scorsese and the cinematography team masterfully selects a color palette fitting of the film, giving it a vintage, engrossing look. It's fitting that a movie so much about the 20th century looks and feels like it was made in the 80s or 90s. In addition, the CGI de-aging of the three stars for the flashback scenes is incredibly well done; it is truly Oscar-worthy work.<br/><br/>Despite the serious nature of the film, the dialogue remains snappy and funny when necessary. The movie isn't overly dark and serious; it knows exactly when it needs to be comedic and satirical and when to take itself seriously. Thus, it remains entertaining throughout despite the humongous runtime.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Irishman"" feels very germane and loaded with meaning and emotion, which is one of the critical factors distinguishing this film from others like it. As it shows Frank Sheeran age and change throughout his life, he gradually becomes more distrustful, and even in old age he continues to be somewhat paranoid, protecting mob compatriots who are no longer alive. Although the film appears initially to glorify violence and life in a crime ring, Scorsese gradually subverts this idea by showing just how exhausting and painful it can be to live a criminal life. Although Sheeran's character never fully appears to grasp how difficult he has made his own life, it becomes apparent to the audience just how much harder his life is now that Sheeran must constantly be watching his back, scheming, and betraying other crime families. For this reason, the epic runtime of the film actually works to the film's advantage in a big way: as the audience becomes more worn out by watching Mafia activity and crime, it parallels how exhausting, inescapable and never-ending a life of crime feels to the characters.<br/><br/>The film also deals with themes of political corruption, which feels especially relevant in the current political climate. Throughout much of the film, the Mafia makes a huge impact on the campaign of whichever candidate they want to win, and it's clear just how much elections, presidential or otherwise, are influenced by those with money and power. In addition, the film discusses how the ""top"" of society is loaded with backstabbing, crime, and general immorality in the name of winning, no matter which side of the political spectrum. This is one of the most relevant-feeling aspects of this movie; that on top of all the other fantastic themes and smart direction, Scorsese also includes biting modern political commentary as part of the narrative.<br/><br/>There are a few issues with the film (few and far between as they are)--mainly its lack of importance for the female characters, the seemingly random usage of ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" as a title card early on in the movie, and de-aged Robert de Niro's eyes being way, way too blue (which is super distracting)--but ultimately these don't detract from a film that is epic, brilliantly crafted, and exceedingly thoughtful. It really feels like this is what Scorsese's career has been building to in some ways; it's a statement, both thematically and cinematically that will undoubtedly be discussed and praised for years to come."

"faroukgulsara","7","2","4","15 December 2019"," Daddy loves you! It is what it is.
","This movie received brickbats even before it came to the screens (or rather Netflix). Scorsese, maybe on purpose, stirred the hornet's nest by making a statement about the genre that seems to captivate the imaginations of the Millenials - the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). He asserted that the MCU world is not cinema but mere theme parks. To quote Scorsese, ""cinema is about revelation - aesthetic, emotional and spiritual revelation. It is about characters - the complexity of people and their contradictory and sometimes paradoxical natures, the way they can hurt one another and love one another and suddenly come face to face with themselves. Marvel movies don't encapsulate those criteria.""<br/><br/>To be fair, even Alfred Hitchcock's and P Ramlee's movies were criticised in their days. There were said to be gruesome or too violent (Psycho) or crossing the social norms (Ramlee's Gelora). Even though the new franchises are said to be final products of market-researched and audience-tested, as well as a matter of supply and demand and giving people what they want, there is still place for good old storytelling set in reality.<br/><br/>'Irishman' is based on by Charles Brandt's book 'I heard you paint houses'. It is supposed to be a confession by the protagonist of the tale, Frank Sheeran. He admitted having killed Jimmy Hoffa, a unionist and a mobster. In real life, Hoffa is said to have disappeared since 1975 without a trace. Since then, many have come forward to vouch that they had killed Hoffa and had their versions too. Sceptics have accused Sheeran of making the last kill (money wise) for the family as he struggled in the nursing home counting his end of days.<br/><br/>
It said to be a presentation of septuagenarians trying the reminisce the good old times of the genre they are familiar with - Scorsese, De Niro and Joe Pesci and mob movies like 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino'. For good measure, they roped in Al Pacino, Don Corleone himself.<br/><br/>As the story spans over almost 30 years, and they were utilising aged actors, the filmmakers had to use digitally de-ageing technology on them. MCU fans had a field day attacking Scorsese as it was in one of MCU films that this science was initially introduced - Michael Douglas in 'Ant-Man'.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
This three-and-a-half offering tells about Sheeran, a WW2 veteran, who gets entangled with the mafia. He finds it rewarding to support his family. In the course and subsequent to this line of duty, he has to make many life-altering decisions. There is only so much of Mafia-related movies one can watch, the loyalty, the killing and all the coded talk. But still, there are some valuable points to ponder while watching the movie.<br/><br/>People can make a living or make a killing for a living. Ultimately we all work hard to ensure that the generation after us is not deprived of the things that we yearned and never got. We do not want them to go through the similar 'hardships' that we went through. But no, the offsprings will never appreciate this. They would look at the actions of their elders through a different prism quite contradictory to what the adults value. They (the youngsters) fail to appreciate the environment upon which their elders made the decisions they made.<br/><br/>Morality and kindness do not matter in desperate situations. When your next meal is not a given thing, your yardstick of what is right and what is not is malleable. This type of innovation can be seen in slumps and refugee camps. People become imaginative on how to survive, to fulfil their primal desires and acquire money. Somehow, money still remains the panacea of all woes.<br/><br/>This must probably be what Sheeran must have been thinking when he was sending his last few days in a home. All his friends and mentors were dead. He was the only person who would probably carry all his secrets to the grave. He was alone. His wife was dead, and his daughters shunned him for his association with the mafioso.<br/><br/>The question remains. Did he concoct the whole story for his children to savour the fruit of the returns of the royalty of his story? Even though Sheeran admitted in the book to have made the difficult decision of putting a bullet in the head of his mentor Jimmy Hoffa, many others claim to have done the same. Sheeran's story, it seems, did not collaborate with police records. Was the tale spiced up to show Sheeran making the difficult decision of following the orders of Russel Buffolini, his guru, versus killing Hoffa who was a thorn for the mafia? Haffa was possibly going to leak the secret of unionists monies being used to finance Mafia's Las Vegas casinos.<br/><br/>The movie also suggests that JFK's assassination may have been arranged by the Mafia."

"acole0228","9","2","4","15 December 2019"," A Swan Song of Sorts
","Martin Scorsese's movies often examine the lives of those involved in nefarious activity. Movies like Goodfellas, Casino, and The Wolf of Wall Street on first glance may seem like they are glamorizing the lifestyle of the gangster or the wall street banker. The appeal of these lifestyles is only part of the story, and there is always the eventual downfall. The Irishman may seem like a retread of movies such as Goodfellas and Casino initially, but it is a far different story. The Irishman examines Frank Sheeran, who was involved with mob activiy, a friend of Jimmy Hoffa and (allegedly) the man who killed him. The first 2 and a half hours run like any regular Scorsese gangster flick with the first person narration. The rest of the film deals with the inevitable, death. Being forgotten and becoming a relic of a certain era from a long time ago. There's a funny gag throughout the film where when characters shown up it's told how they die (most of the time it involves bullets), but beneath that it's a stark reminder of the frailty of the mafia business and what the inevitable cost of being involved is. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci are all great in this film. Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa is a larger than life character who is not afraid to go after what he wants, even if it eventually becomes fatal. If Joe Pesci is engraved in your mind as the hot head from both Goodfellas and Casino, then you should be pleased to know that Joe Pesci's character is the exact opposite in this movie. He is a quiet but strong mafia leader who delivers his message not through outbursts but through subtle glances and a calm demeanor."

Thus it could appear to be boring because in reality, life isn't some super exciting mind blowing story. It's dull at times, even for people in the mafia.<br/><br/>While the story attempts to tell you what happened to Hoffa in the end, it is indeed a theory going by what various people have said/done that hinted in real life.

Many of the people who knew Hoffa gave the opinion of knowing what happened but as they say in the movie, pleading the fifth. Including Frank. His own family seemed to know what he did in real life and that he seemed to know what happened to Hoffa.<br/><br/>Again, watch the movie. It is long but was very enjoyable.

","Either driven by instructions coming from people on the top - you know, high up - to make this one set in celluloid for certain reasons - ($) - that can not be overlooked, especially not in Hollywood...or out of pure joy to amuse both themselves, the ol' good fellas and us, the audience, Scorsese returns to his beloved genre, assembles an A-list cast that has the reputation of occasionally reappearing on the big screen in the very same type of roles for the last few decades for the man himself especially.
As we cut into the story, narrated by the reminiscing mob hitman Frank Sheeran (played by De Niro) we find ourselves in familiar territory. Almost feels like a bit too familiar. A career of a relatively nobody, a veteran truck driver who one day accidentally bumps into Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), head of a crime family who takes a liking to him and helps him rise up in the ranks of the crime lords of the era becoming the personal bodyguard and best friend of the infamous Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) while trying to provide for and protect his family at the same time, not surprisingly also failing to be a good father in his daughters eyes.
The plot stretches over about 30 years so we get to know certain historic figures, eavesdrop on their most secret conversations, learn a thing or two about the Kennedys while Scorsese provides us with memorable background information - now we understand that even a .32, a 'woman's gun' can be ideal for a hit and that we shouldn't put fish in the car since it is going to smell forever. We revolve around events that had impacts on both the average American, the mob and even the world if you like. All that if we get to pay close attention and keep up for the almost 3 and a half hour-long runtime.
As the years fly by throughout the movie we are being helped by modern computer-technology to bring credibility to the aging characters by de-aging their face first than slowly remove some filters on the way as we progress to eventually arrive at their present looks. Maybe even go a bit further. It can somewhat feel like we are being cheated on though as deep down we know these people are not in their forties and when it comes to physicality it also becomes visible that they don't move or perform so either.
Some spectacular work from behind the camera by Rodriego Prieto and Robbie Robertson's sweet-sounding melodies, both of who Marty have often collaborated with before, help us ease back to a bygone era where hitmen carrying guns broad daylight served as instruments between opposing ideas.<br/><br/>verdict 6/10
An overwhelming storyline, more so with it's weight in minutes than emotions, has the lack of surprising elements and character depth. We do get some never-before historic insight to that much talked about age of conflicts delivered via great camerawork. Unfortunately all the glare we get is from the shiny automobiles and Robert De Niro's digitally de-aged, glowing blue eyes. A piece from masters of the art form who played their parts but hardly a masterpiece."

","Scorsese's latest artistic attempt to create the world of mobster mafia, with all it's familiar motifs, here surprisingly transferred into a geriatric phase with more melancholic than violent consequences.
I enjoyed very much to see all of his protagonists working together again, and Al Pacino joining this famous team of actors. They're still giving powerhouse performances, led by De Niro, portraying a character under growing pressure, torn between loyalty and betrayal, and true friendship doesn't mean anything.
But does it have to last for almost three and a half hours?
I appreciated Scorseses uncompromising vision, but I can understand that for some people it's an excessive demand on their patience.
I was a bit unsatisfied with the CGI make up results, sometimes they looked convincing, but sometimes not. But nevertheless another masterpiece by Scorsese! He's still one of the best!"

","It's not just another Scorcese mob film. Don't expect dramatic car chases, raucous shootouts, scandal or bombastic violence.
This film is a smooth rolling, low-key story that isn't hurried and is more concerned with dialogue and character interchange than with exciting effects and ""money shots.""
The criticism that this film is boring and slow is far from the truth but I can understand how some viewers receive the movie that way.<br/><br/>The script and acting is top notch. Scorcese never takes himself too seriously and he interjects some playful creative filmmaking elements along the way in classic Scorcese fashion.
He also masterfully makes use of subtle... almost subliminal motifs that add depth and richness to the story (i.e. the use of bread and wine {grape juice} to evoke image of The Last Supper directly before a certain character dies).<br/><br/>I didn't think the movie was boring at any point. I enjoyed every minute of it. But I symopathize with the critique that it could have been tidied up a little, especially in the final act.<br/><br/>The feel and pacing of this movie is best compared to slowly sipping a glass of wine on a lazy evening (as opposed to the frenzy of Mountain Dew and strobe lights Hollywood insists on force-feeding audiences).<br/><br/>8.5/10"

It is a poor man's Good Fellas really. Acting top notch and great to see legendary actors that redefined the gangster on the big screen at it again but ultimately it feels we have seen it all before; the mafia hugs, the staring, conversations involving people doing a thing for someone. On the plus side the CGI de-aging is pretty impressive with only the odd dodgy moment. Still should have had younger actors doing some of the physical stuff though as a younger De Niro still moves old. The other plus is the period detail for street and road scenes and of course cars."

"canadagoat234","5","2","4","2 December 2019"," My first review since taking down the user forums.
","I used to contribute to the forums before they were taken down and never did feel the need to sit down and write a lengthy review (until I saw this film yesterday).
I am a Scorsese fan and consider him to be one of the best American directors of all time (perhaps that's my problem - expectations!). Having put out gem after gem in the past, one's expectations sore high, too high. You expect nothing but the best in every department and I can't help to compare and contrast this to his other works, it's just human nature. So to start off, the film is just plain, not great by any stretch. Is it Goodffellas, Casino and Taxi Driver caliber? Absolutely not. Well at least not in my opinion but I'm sure many people would disagree. Let's start off with what the film did right, no one can deny the acting was superb, from Deniro, Pacino, Pesci and Keitel (I wish we saw more of him). The narrative style, notably Deniro's voice-over was reminiscent of Scorsese's old films; it gave a touch of nostalgia that brought us back to the 90s and made us feel young again. Not forgetting the amazing music which had the same effect. It certainly reflected the time period and set a perfect mood for what was to be told. For me it started off well and finished somewhat well, however everything else in between to me was just filler... and lot's of it, hence bringing me here and starting this review. I'm not exactly sure why this film was 3.5 hours, but with elements missing to make a great film, it was just way too long. Goodfellas managed to get its point across in just under 2.5 hours with a richer narrative, why couldn't this? So what was it missing? Well for the me, the most important was this: 1. THERE WAS NO FEMALE PROTAGONIST or ANTAGONIST to either drive the story or act as a deterrent to the story, it felt flat without a male/female dichotomy. Can anyone not say that what made his previous films so great was the Stone/Deniro relationship. The Robbie/Dicaprio relationship. Can we not agree that while Ray Lliota made for a terrific gangster his relationship with Lorraine Bracco provided the needed contrast to drive an engaging story. There was nothing like that here. In fact it was the opposite, did Anna Pacquin even have any lines in the script? It was just three old guys who got along pretty well telling a story of how bad-ass they were. This bring me to my next point. 2. NO CONFLICT between the main characters. There was nothing to threaten the integrity or existence of Deniro's state. No dramatic lash outs, no struggle for survival, he just put his head down and played a pseudo yes-man avoiding any sort of confrontation, after all this was Deniro's story not Pacino's, right? I'm confused now. 3. The story was NOT RELATABLE. Sure the teamster's union was an interesting organization but it shouldn't have been the main focus of the narrative, not many really relate to and or know exactly what that was unless you've lived through the 50's, 60's and 70s. (I had to read up a little bit on the worker's union to be able to follow the story) In Casino it acted as a backdrop (like a crust to an apple pie, but the pie itself). 4. The least important point and it wouldn't have been an issue had the other elements been sorted out. YOUNG DENIRO was pitiful. He looked and moved like an 80 year old, I don't think that bringing in someone younger to fill that role would have taken away from the story (it worked in Godfather 2). Was it necessary to spend all that money on CGI just for that? I don't think so. To finish my point, Hollywood should embrace aging actors and not ""youthify"" them, it just doesn't work. We see through the stained glass, it's not believable. Schwarzenegger can no longer be the same terminator he was, in the same way Deniro can no longer portray the same young gangster he was. For goodness sake he was de-aged in Goodfellas some 30 years ago already, So lets leave it at that. I'm sure this film with garnish a whole load of oscars and awards, and I certainly hope it won't. There are better films out there. I love Scorsese, I'll watch everything he'll make, but sometimes it's hit and sometimes it's a miss. I truly believe that the imdb score will level out in the next few months to something that it more reflective.
Many thanks,
A film fan."

","A great movie, since it is from Scorcese, which means a quality standard. It is a film very similar to Goodfellas, but with a more human touch, and a more nostalgic for the director's farewell to the gangster subgenre, which undoubtedly increases the rating for many filmmakers. Great address. Very good script although by repetitive sections to what Martin has accustomed us to, but very well condemned, although by sections it becomes heavy due to the large number of characters, but very well carried out: especially with the comic situations, exhibition of the story and ... without a doubt, the best scene in the movie: Jimmy's murder. Awesome creation of atmosphere. Very good sound mix. Impossible rejuvenation effect by sections. Very vain performances, which we have seen a lot in Scorsece cinema, without a doubt the most notable is the great performance of Al Pacino. Excellent lighting. Anyway, a great movie, but nothing new or exotic, one more gangster movie but with a different countenance: nostalgia. Which makes it overvalued too much. But it's not Martin's best movie, far from it; His best film works in the subgenre are, without a doubt: Good fellas and The Departed."

What he does in this movie is just a toned-down version of some of his other characters. I'm not saying he's not good, but his acting isn't what makes this such a great movie. Also, the length of the movie is necessary to tell the story. Well worth the time."

He well and truly relishes under the freedom Scorsese gives him.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci is everything you want and think of when you watch a film about the ""mafia"". His characters is perfectly quiet but intimidating, and I just wish the film focused on the relationship between his and De Niro's character a bit more.<br/><br/>Al Pacino brings energy and charisma, reminding me a lot of his character he played in Glengarry Glen Ross.<br/><br/>Scorsese, well it still works. A film truly built on trust and the consequences of ones trust.<br/><br/>I hate to say it but by no means can this be compared to the likes of The Godfather, Casino, and Goodfellas.

","I am a patient man and I usually don't get disappointed and bored just by watching a very long movie. In fact, I hate too short movies. I am also a fan of gangter movies, I really do like them.<br/><br/>First of all, due to the well earned fame that the main actors and the director himself have, may be a reason for some to love and praise this movie, no matter what the content is. There's almost an obligatory you-must-love-it-or-You-are-weird hype around the movie these days. Well, I am the weird guy.<br/><br/>I find this movie unnecessary long, very boring and lame. The story doesn't have anything special, surprising, entertaining or interesting in it. Even the historically well placed Kennedy ""side story"" cannot save it. Basically, to put it real simple, nothing is happening here except for killing people or blowing cars every ten minutes, talking about plans and giving orders in fancy restaurants, and totally boring, worn-out betrayal clichés within the story.<br/><br/>When I watch movies, I set it to full screen, because I do not want to know how much time is left from the movie. This time I broke my own rule. At a certain point, I found myself exteremely pissed off and bored, so I decided to check how much is left. And it was 50 minutes. FIFTY minutes. Of course, I took a deep breath, popped up a beer and made through the remaining 50 minutes, but this is a movie that I will never ever watch again or advise anyone to watch it."

It was better than Casino, but it can't touch Goodfellas, Raging Bull, or Taxi Driver. In my opinion it wasn't as fun or entertaining as Once Upon A Time In America. Because of the probably fabricated factual storyline, it reminded me of JFK but without the cartoony over the top feeling which made it slower.<br/><br/>Anyway, like I said, it's Scorcese so if you're like me you're obligated to see it and it's definitely not a waste of time or anything.

"fopfopfop","7","2","4","30 November 2019"," Martin Scorsese makes a good made for tv movie
","Martin Scorsese has given us some of the best mob movies ever. Goodfellas being the gold standard. This movie has one hell of a pedigree, Pacino, deniro, pesci, bobby carnivale, even ray Romano who has been showing his acting chops since he did men of a certain age. So deniro is very deniro and Pacino is very pacino. Scorsese is also very scorcese in directing this movie. And steve Gallian has a great pedigree having written Schindler's list and gangs of new York among other oscar winners. And I give this movie a 7, a 7 to me is the floor of a good movie. A 7 will generally not disappoint. A 7 is good, but just good. And to me that's what this movie is a 7, its good not great. Why not great like so many others seem to think? One its awesome seeing the gangster greats act but they are really old. And no amount of makeup makes a 70 something year old man appear to be 30. Its just impossible. There is one scene where deniro beats someone and he looks well like an old man beating someone but we are supposed to buy him as 30!! Just didn't work so the visual of the timeline becomes blurred. Hell when pesci meets deniro he calls him kid!? He looks 70 I can't even tell what age ""kid"" represented. 20? I just couldn't suspend my disbelief. Then There is Scorsese, the directing felt very made for bbc television. It didn't feel like his past features. It was underwhelming especially the soundtrack. The story is the best part of it, but even that beautiful written script felt too familiar with the same actors reading the lines the way they do every time we see them. Don't get me wrong, still a Scorsese movie, still masters of their craft doing the roles they are known for, still great story, but just too familiar feeling. At times I felt like I was actually watching goodfellas out takes. When I saw the departed I was blown away, as I have been by almost every movie he has ever made. Even the wolf of wall street which isn't a gangster flick was original and captivating. Scorsese is a master at reinventing his style constantly. Not here, this felt like a Scorsese but felt run of the mill and made for the small screen (relatively). And so though I am sure i will take some flack from many this movie is good but just good and not worthy of the praise others are bestowing upon this."

","Based on ""I Heard You Paint Houses"", a remarkable true account of the life and times of a Mafia hit man, Frank Sheeran, written by Charles Brandt, this is a wide-screen, vertiginous vision of America from World War Two until almost yesterday. That's a lot of years, something like half of The American Century.<br/><br/>How much you enjoy this movie depends on whether you lived through the period depicted and how much you know about it. A lot happened: it was the heyday of the American Mafia and the zenith of the USA's economic and military power.<br/><br/>There was the unexpected election of JFK (fixed by the Mob?), the ill-fated invasion of Cuba (The Bay Of Pigs, a ""reward"" for JFK's election, intended to get back Mafia assets lost as the result of Castro's revolution), the concerted assault on the Mafia and the Teamsters by JFK's brother as Attorney General (a breach of a promise to the Mafia), JFK's assassination (allegedly a Mafia payback for breach of promise) and Teamsters' boss Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance (knew too much about the Mafia, obstructed the Mafia, started saying too much about the Mafia...). The Mafia was everywhere: Teamsters' pension funds helped build Las Vegas, for example.<br/><br/>I remember a lot of the major events, albeit as a youngster, so, for me, this is an engrossing trip down some dark, neon-flashing streets of my memory. Cinematically, it's meticulously portrayed - from the fashions, to the cars, to the music and even the lighting: this is truly what it was like. Or, in a chillingly anodine phrase ""this is what it is"".<br/><br/>Very little of Frank Sheeran's youth makes it onto the screen, except for a couple of flashbacks to his 411 days in combat in Europe, intended to explain why and how he found killing people so easy. Today, you'd say he had a very bad case of PTSD which he used, and was used, to his and the Mob's advantage.<br/><br/>He killed at least two dozen people. The book's title is a Mob code for killing someone. If you replied in the affirmative and added that you did all your own carpentry, that meant you disposed of the evidence as well. Sheeran became so senior that he stopped having to do the carpentry quite early on.<br/><br/>The movie pivots around the (im)famous Union Leader, James R Hoffa, aka Jimmy, and his building of the Teamsters into an empire, more powerful, almost, than the Government or the incredible wealth and heft of Mafia. Frank and Jimmy became close friends.<br/><br/>In fact, through the Teamsters' huge pension fund, they became fatally entwined. In the USA, traditionally, Labor relations between workers and bosses were lethally violent and both sides used hired muscle to make their case. Inevitably, there was a lot of dirty money washing through it all. Corruption, high and low, was everywhere. It ends badly for just about everybody.<br/><br/>This movie is a staggering achievement and could be used effectively as a dramatic teaching aid on modern American Studies' courses. There's no doubt that Scorsese's intense love of the period has overruled his matchless skills as a fine movie maker. It is too long. Nevertheless, it's an outstanding chunk of personal and national history: it will never be done better."

SYNOPSIS:
Based on a novel titled ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" and the true and mysterious disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa.
Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) tells his story of when he became a hitman for Russel Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and what he remembers from the mysterious death of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).<br/><br/>DIRECTION:
Before your head explodes, no, I don't have any issue with the directing. It's Marty Score-say-zee. For those who say ""Score-sessy"", shut up. Even if that's the correct pronunciation, shut your mouth. You just sound like a valley girl saying ""hawt"" instead of ""hot.""--------- Anyway... Scorese- Marty is a phenomenal Director blah blah blah. We all know. That run-time though. Give me a break! This could've been 45 minutes shorter EASILY.<br/><br/>WRITING:
I want to extend on the run-time here. Cause though I didn't feel the writing was bad, by goodness should this script have been cut down far more. I have this theory that Marty loves the the structure of TV series where you can build characters over a long stretch of time and so he likes to add multiple scenes of his characters doing average day things to make you feel like they're not just cold-blooded, money hungry killers. However, most of these scenes don't move the story forward, it just slows the pace way down. I'm sorry, but is it a crime that while watching a film like this I want to learn more of the core plot and not watch a family Christmas get-together? Unlike a TV series where filler episodes are necessary at times, with a movie you have the luxury of cutting that out.<br/><br/>ACTING.
Robert De Niro (or Bobby Money), Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel, Bobby Cannavale, Jesse Plemons. Am I good for this section? If I had to choose a standout for who I feel would have the best chance at an Oscar it would be Al Pacino. He definitely had the most showy role of every character, but he did a great job as Jimmy Hoffa. Loved his performance and they'll all get nominated. Maybe.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:
Look, the direction is great and the acting a top notch, but for my own personal satisfaction I need a story that keeps me going. ESPECIALLY for a 210-minute run-time. The Wolf of Wall Street is a perfect example of using the most with a long run-time and that was Marty too so I know he's capable. There was a great story here, but unfortunately for me it was clouded far too much by unnecessary filler scenes that ultimately didn't make me any more connected to the characters. Speaking of characters, there's about 37 characters you're introduced to and the script finally focuses up on the 3 main character in the last hour to and hour and a half. Was really looking forward to this film and I'm disappointed."

I know Scorcese admires DeNiro a lot and has a lot of experience of working with him, but that doesn't make him the right cast.

","One of my favorite movies of the entire year, maybe even my favorite, although I haven't seen the lighthouse. What can I say, other than this feels like prime Scorsese, even after so many years still making great movies. This film has all of his trademarks, making it impossible not to realize that this is his work. Pretty much everything in the film works like magic.<br/><br/>All of the performances are great, I though De Niro, Pesci and Pacino all delivered their best performances in years, although I wasn't as fascinated with Pacino during the first half of the movie. And I do have to say, I was really enjoying the film up to the halfway mark, but somehow felt a little slow when they're introducing all of these characters. Not boring, but a little slow, which will maybe change upon a second viewing. However, I can confidently say that the entire second half of this movie (which could even be considered a feature length film) is extremely riveting and really went into an emotional direction that I was not expecting.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for the movie is also great, the original theme made for the film fits wonderfully and the music from that time is, kind of like in Goodfellas, one of the major driving forces in the film when it comes to the way it flows very smoothly. The direction here is, of course, on point, as expected from Scorsese. It's worth mentioning that they did some digital de-aging to De Niro and quite probably to many of the other characters and I have to say that it's done wonderfully and while you may notice it at times (with the right trained eye), it definitely didn't take away from the experience, at least for me.<br/><br/>Like I said, The Irishman goes in a very emotional direction by the final act of the film and it made me feel, which is more than I can say for a lot of movies. And even though the pacing might be a little (if only a tiny bit) during the middle segment of the film, man is this movie worth every second of your time and attention. I loved it."

A world of never-feeling-safe.<br/><br/>I shudder at the thought of being part of that total and utter insecurity.<br/><br/>Thank God I am not living my life with mobsters and gangsters.

I finished the film thinking it was well done, but not well done enough for my taste. This movie made me want to watch the much better HEAT from 1995, which is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time and brilliantly directed by Michael Mann. In HEAT we get both Pacino and De Niro in their prime. They are now washed up and too old to really shine, although they do well in THE IRISHMAN. If you want a long, drawn out mobster film that drags and drags on for 3 and a half hours with minimal entertainment then this is for you. If you want an epic film with these 2 actors that never lets up and never disappoints and holds up to this day, watch Michael Mann's HEAT again.

"Cineanalyst","9","4","12","28 November 2019"," Old Man's Story
","Viewing a movie that runs nearly three-and-a-half hours long, I demand it grapple with weighty subject matter; I have little patience for laborious trivialities. Fortunately, ""The Irishman"" deals with no less than issues of life, aging and death, and it's framed fundamentally by the art of storytelling. While the story of Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance has held long-term interest, it's secondary here to the gang of old men who come together again to tell another story about the mafia and brutality, with Martin Scorsese directing a cast led by Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino. This is well-trodden ground for them all; Scorsese previously helmed De Niro and Pesci in ""Raging Bull"" (1980), ""Goodfellas"" (1990) and ""Casino"" (1995), has frequently collaborated with De Niro and Harvey Keitel since ""Mean Streets"" (1973), and while this is the director's first work with Pacino, the actor has been in plenty of gangster films made by others, beginning with ""The Godfather"" trilogy. This filmic heritage is what truly bears weight in the narrative's historical expanse, and it finally allows for some intelligent use of de-aging CGI--a technology that up to this point has been mostly employed for action, superhero and otherwise stupid flicks.<br/><br/>Sure, I agree with others that the reverse-aging process here is more convincing than past attempts. Most recently, I complained of ""Captain Marvel"" (2019) (I have yet to see ""Gemini Man"" (2019)), that young Fury's inflexible skin transgressed the uncanny valley, which wasn't helped by conspicuously hiding him under various lighting schemes. And this despite such a comic-book movie already being largely animated. One would think for a picture more purely photographic as ""The Irishman"" that the technology would be even more distracting, but I didn't find that the case. The one big exception for me has nothing to do with any facial ""sheen"" mentioned by others, but with movement. This is most evident in scenes of fighting or other violent actions. A 70-year old Samuel L. Jackson doesn't throw a punch like he would over 20 years ago, and so it looks off when his de-aged self does just that in the 1995 setting of ""Captain Marvel."" In ""The Irishmen,"" De Niro and Pacino sometimes look like young and middle-age bodies walking around like the elderly men they really are, but the scene where De Niro throws a grocer onto the curb was the one scene that put me off the effect technically. How to put this not delicately... De Niro looks like the Frankenstein monster, a re-animated body of dead parts stitched together, lumbering after his victim. I was almost afraid he was going to toss his daughter into a lake next. But, besides that, it looks fine.<br/><br/>More importantly, the digital fountain of youth is well integrated into the narrative structure. This isn't just about exploiting stars (and, sometimes, long-since-dead ones--looking your way, ""Rogue One"" (2016))) for blockbuster time-traveling gimmicks. Here, the plot is established as the remembrances of a disabled and elderly Frank Sheeran (De Niro) sitting in a nursing home, addressing the camera but no other character in particular. Narratively and technically, this is an old actor--Sheeran and De Niro--reflecting on their younger selves. Not as they were when young, either, but how one mutates their current identity into the memory of their past self. And, by extension, the same goes for Pacino and Pesci, all of whom are on-screen surrogates for the film's auteur, Scorsese. In turn, we the spectators bring our own memories of these artists' past films to the process. To only look at this as the story solving Hoffa's disappearance is to not see the whole picture. Indeed, that assumes De Niro's Sheeran is a reliable narrator in the first place, which I'm not taking for granted. This a man nearing death, left with only strangers (FBI agents, a nurse, a priest and, through the camera, us) to confess to. He's either outlived everyone else, including those he may've murdered, or been abandoned by a family revolted by his violent ways. The story itself revolves a lot around gangsters relaying stories to others and through intermediaries, employing code words and speaking in riddles (including the original title, ""I Heard You Paint Houses""). Sometimes these stories are understood, others are tragically not, as with Hoffa, still others turn out to result from misinformation, such as with a ""bad hit,"" and still more are lies, beginning with the missing meat, and confabulations. That's what the de-aging CGI and the movie itself are, too, after all: a fiction.<br/><br/>Bringing your own memories of past films from these master storytellers makes this something of a culmination of the filmmakers' oeuvres. It's more about the life, aging and inevitability of death of gangster filmmakers (and us viewers) than it's about the gangster characters in the story. Furthermore, Scorsese and his ""New Hollywood"" ilk radically changed film beginning in the middle of the last century (around the same time that the story in the movie takes place, by the way). Now, movies are more often digital rather than film. Even live-action pictures that aren't action and superhero fare are substantially animated and made by computers into photorealistic imagery. Although most are made to look like they were made on film, they aren't. These movies, too, are seen less and less in cinemas. Like most viewers probably, I waited out its limited theatrical release, to see ""The Irishman"" streamed on Netflix. Heck, even if you see a ""film"" in a theatre, it's likely to be from a disc, hard drive, satellite or Internet stream--like Netflix on a bigger screen. Indeed, the narrative's passage of time is further reflected in the style of the picture, down to its TV images, aging and de-aging along with the actors and characters. In the end, perhaps, it's film's mortality that is most striking. As ""The Irishman"" indicates, its life to its death has already had a profound impact on our reminiscences and continued storytelling. We're left mostly only with the myth in place of its disappearance."

All four are great in their roles.<br/><br/>To my surprise, Ray Romano was a standout.<br/><br/>The best scene involves De Niro, Keitel and Pesci sitting together which is a first in movie history. It is also the first time De Niro and Keitel have acted in a scene together since Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>The screenplay and dialogue are not up to par.<br/><br/>This project was doomed from the start because the story is ridiculous and was finished by the writer after Sheehan died.<br/><br/>The Hoffa case remains a total mystery and many of the ideas floated here are non-plausible. Some of the major known facts about this case are left out.<br/><br/>There are a lot of historical inaccuracies presented and a lot of sloppiness. The dialogue is extremely weak. Many of the scenes are pointless.<br/><br/>Scorsese shamelessly rips off the Anastasia/Godfather scene which has no place in this story except that he attempts to transform one character into being a major person involved in that storyline which wasn't the case.<br/><br/>For a 3 and a half hour film, this film left a lot to be desired and could have easily lost an hour.<br/><br/>There are some interesting thoughts on aging which are pounded in during the last 30 minutes which is what I think most of this is really about which makes for two separate movies. There are some reminders at the end of De Niro in Awakenings. It is no coincidence this movie shares the same writer as Awakenings.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, the Hoffa mystery is interesting and it is not a bad subject to tackle but it was tried back in 1992 with Nicholson and DeVito and was a total boring flop. This movie was paced even slower than that one.<br/><br/>It felt like a mix of Forrest Gump and JFK with two of the characters seemingly everywhere at all times and involved in all things. There are also all of these conspiracy theories that start turning it into an Oliver Stone film. Scorsese made the mistake of buying all the way into this book and turning two of these people into more than what they were.<br/><br/>I wish De Niro, Keitel, Pacino and Pesci had done something a little better together.

The film relies heavily on some spurious history, glorifying people that created misery where ever they went. This is not a new concept and ordinances do like blood and guts and some sinister dark hero figures to imagine that they could interact with in real life, but with the obvious caveat that that would never happen because these people are just animals in the real world. If you take the famous faces out and the big budget, what kind of story are you left with, it is slow and painful, a rewrite of a thousand that went before and doesn't leave you thinking anything apart from maybe lets go to the pub and have a drink before they shut if you happened to see a late show.

It's actually hilarious like he can't think of anything else to do so he does his face, and everyone just goes along with it, without thinking ""why would his character make that face during this conversation?"". I would love to see other actors start doing this to see if they can sneak a totally random de Niro face past the director and the editor."

Great work in cosmetics and transformation. De Niro was still looking an old lad despite of great work in making him a young guy. Its obvious you can not change how a person walks and move.

Al Pacino and 'The Returning' Joe Pesci are astonishing, but If I wanna pick someone to be nominated for a supporting role Oscar, I would pick Joe Pesci, not because he returned for this role, but because he is the guy who steals the show everytime he is on screen. And for those who says the movie is too long, you won't feel the length of it, because it is extremely entertaining. At the end of the day, A COMPLETE MASTERPIECE, that will 99.8% be the Best Picture of 2019, and about the 0.2%, its beacause I haven't watched Parasite and 1917 yet.

","As somebody who loves crime and gangster movies I had high hopes for this movie and really wanted to enjoy it, unfortunately this movie is incredibly disappointing.

I'm so relieved I didn't go to the cinema to watch this. In my opinion this is the worst movie that Martin Scorsese has ever made. Don't let yourself be suckered in by all the glowing reviews. This movie is nothing special!"
"jtindahouse","7","3","8","11 December 2019"," Well made but overly long and lacking memorability
","I can't remember the last time I watched a movie as long as 'The Irishman'. They just don't make films of this length any more. Mostly that is because audiences don't have the time or patience for it, but I think it is also because it can take away from the film. I feel that once you start approaching the three hour mark (and in this case going well over it) you start to lose some of your power. There is less impact and punch in the product you are providing. Shaving an hour off 'The Irishman' and just leaving in the necessary bits could have made this a whole lot more enjoyable of an experience.<br/><br/>The film uses de-aging technology on its actors, and though it is very well done, it is also quite distracting and I found it took me out of the movie a lot of the time. As good as it was, it was still noticeably creepy how people looked at times. There was a woman early on who I thought was straight out of a horror movie the way it made her look. Also there was a scene where De Niro is kicking a man outside a grocery shop and it was about as poorly filmed as you will ever see in a modern film. You could visibly see the kicks missing by a mile. How this wasn't picked up on I'll never know.<br/><br/>The film is extremely well made from start to finish, but I don't feel it has the same memorable moments that the likes of 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas' had. Those were films with moments that you could never forget. I didn't feel that way about 'The Irishman'. It was good to watch once, but I suspect it will be entirely gone from my memory by tomorrow."

"jacksonjent","10","3","8","10 December 2019"," If Casino is the unofficial sequel to Goodfellas, The Irishman completes the trilogy
","In my opinion, this movie absolutely lives up to the hype as one of the last mobster epics of a dying genre.<br/><br/>Based on the bestselling book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"", this tells the tales and stories witnessed firsthand by Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran (De Niro) who was rumored to be a mob enforcer that went from truck driving to a mob hitman to later being Jimmy Hoffa's (Pacino) bodyguard and right hand man. Frank eventually meets Pennsylvania mob boss Russell Bufalino (Pesci) who becomes his closest friend in the mob and helps gets his start in doing mob work.<br/><br/>The movie includes a Goodfellas like timeline that spans from the 1950s to the 1970s and features Frank's stories of his involvement in The Bay of Pigs In 1961 to Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance in 1975.<br/><br/>The movie's runtime might be too long but it is certainly worth the hype and the long length."
"kmq102","2","3","8","9 December 2019"," Scorsese and DeNiro fail a great story
","Scorsese and DeNiro took the story of Frank Sheeran and tried to force themselves into the film. Sheeran was known as an imposing figure due to his 6'4"" frame. He was overly confident, charismatic, and sadistic. DeNiro's version of Sheeran was timid, unsure of himself, and below average size. Despite the CGI to make DeNiro look young, he moved like a guy in his 70s. Frank's vivid blue eyes came across like DeNiro had cataracts. The story line was poorly developed with important events barely mentioned. After reading the book I was extremely excited for this film. I was disappointed throughout the movie."

"zechariahhall","9","3","8","7 December 2019"," One of Scorsese's More Somber and Reflective Works
","Getting right into it, if you're a fan of Scorsese, and you love movies, I would say you gotta see this. But I don't think it will be for everyone. For some, it will run a little too long. Personally, I think the running time is justified and works to great cumulative effect by the time the credits roll.<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" is story based on some real events surrounding Frank Sheeran, a real life WWII vet played by Robert Dinero. This feels like a real performance. A summation of both the kind of roles Dinero plays very well with a real sense of finality to his body of work. It feels like a grand finally performance, yet is so subtle and so subdued, I doubt it will get attention in that way. The story revolves his relationship with Jimmy Hoffa, a guy from history you don't know about, played by Al Pachino, and maybe my favorite performance from Joe Pesci as a mob overlord named ""Russel"". Everyone here is absolutely wonderful with Joe Pesci giving my favorite performance in the movie. He's a terrifying, quiet, little man. He never raises his voice.<br/><br/>This movie takes it time. It allows scenes to play out in real time in a few places. And this is a story about time. Don't you love movies that make you think about the nature of your mortality and your legacy on this earth and the fact that you're going to die? It's a story that provides perspective, from all angles of the conflict. It's one of my favorite forms of storytelling. The main character here who is caught between two sides, both of whom have his complete trust. So the conflict here gets very messy. And I think having that three and a half hour run time benefits that main conflict that builds and falls gracefully.<br/><br/>This is one of Scorsese's more somber works. Between his last film, SILENCE, and this one, there marks a noticeable shift in his direction. I pegged the director as the guy who made cautionary tales about the dangers of ""excess"" of young men. And while this movie has certain elements of that... it's told from a man at the end of his life's perspective. You get the sense that this is a filmmaker who's getting older who not only wants to entertain, which he does in spades, but wants to pass down something. Wants to say something of substance. As I mentioned earlier with Dinero, all the actors here are seasoned, giving performances that are filled with subtitles and no doubt their real life experiences.<br/><br/>The CGI de-aging was noticeable at first. I don't know if I just decided to roll with it, or if it just got better as time passed, but it worked for me and it didn't seem to detract from the movie in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>But yes. This is a great movie.<br/><br/>Over the past month, I've mostly purged myself from watching any major franchise movies and went back to the classics like 12 Angry Men... and I just find myself starting to understanding what Mr. Scorsese said regarding Marvel not being ""cinema""... Cinema is about small moments rather than huge battles. Not to say that all battles aren't cinema. ""Battle of Peilnor fields"".<br/><br/>Do I think his comments were a bit narrow minded? Probably, I mean, I love Marvel for what it is, which is a good time at the movies with my friends...<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>There is a difference between this... ""Worm hole""
And this... ""12 Angry Men""<br/><br/>Scorsese's climax are in the small moments of tension that you can feel 10 times more than a climax in a blockbuster with flying space ships. Why is that? Scorsese would say ""cinema"". An undefined term of a filmmaker using writing, cinematography, and performance to illicit an emotional response from a viewer. And that's powerful.<br/><br/>So while Marvel is cool. And I enjoyed Endgame as much as the next guy. Let's not forget about the smaller movies that are reaching for something just a little more. But hey, to each his own.<br/><br/>I watched this on Netflix, but it should still be out there in theaters so if you have the chance to go support this movie by buying a movie ticket, then go do it. Or if you want to write in the comments that I'm a hypocrite and that I should go buy a ticket I get that too."

Made it through in one sitting and am happy to have been generously rewarded for the experience. This film is a masterpiece, and probably one of Scorsese's three greatest films ever. I enjoyed it immensely and highly recommend it. Pacino is fantastic, as is De Niro and Joe Pesci, all of them performing at the absolute top of their game. I don't usually cotton to such long films, but this was a masterfully told tale, well paced, and incredibly well edited by his long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, with not a single minute wasted. I was gripped the entire time and hung on every scene, every line of dialogue, all of it unlike anything I've seen in quite some time. I think it played in some theatres in the US, but most people will watch it on Netflix, which is a more than adequate way to experience it. This is one film well worthy of setting aside some time on a weekend afternoon this month."
"brandonwhitton","5","3","8","7 December 2019"," 2 hours too long, a bloated ponderous movie short on action
","Let me just say that I love mafia movies. Goodfellas (the earlier Scorsese masterpiece starring De Niro and Pesci) is one of my favourite movies which I have watched in excess of a dozen times. The Irishman was probably my most eagerly anticipated movies of 2019. I expected this movie to be every bit as good as Goodfellas, boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>The Irishman is slow and several hours too long. It is devoid of much action and it misses out on most of the other elements that make a good mafia movie. It did have its moments, so it wasn't a complete waste of time. I particularly liked Pesci's role which reminded me of Uncle Junior off the Sopranos. Overall though, I cannot recommend this movie. It just wasn't that good. As for it being an Oscar contender, dream on. This unfortunately over hyped movie is probably best avoided. Do yourself a favour and watch Goodfellas instead!"

Furthermore, the music was very good and added a lot to the flair and the good mood. The classic camera movements you know from Scorsese were also outstanding.
Besides the CGI I definitely have to criticize the story. The plot only got off to a sluggish start. In the middle of it, I was thinking, what does Scorsese actually mean? The idle at some points didn't make things any better. All in all, with the drastic deductions of the story I can give 5 out of 10 stars."

"slightlymad22","8","3","8","4 December 2019"," Pesci Steals The Movie
","I just watched The Irishman<br/><br/>I really enjoyed it, possibly a Top 10 of the year for me, but it is more than a tad self indulgent. It's ridiculously over long, it could have lost half an hour (if not 40 minutes) and it wouldn't have missed a step. It shows a lot of similar scenes a few times, just to hammer some points home.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is great!! its not one of his best ever performances, but he is the best he has been in years. Joe Pesci is wonderfully understated, he has lost none of his acting ability during his retirement, and is awesome (I think only the sheer amount of competition could keep him out of a best supporting actor nod) and like De Niro, Al Pacino is the best I have seen him in years (although I think Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is the only movie I have seen him in this decade) I think him and Pesci have the best chance of Oscar nominations, and I'm surprised that I'm saying that, as De Niro is great!! But again, I think the amount of solid competition, could keep him out.<br/><br/>The Deaging is not up to the quality of Michael Douglas in Ant-Man or Smith In Gemini Man (except that awful last scene) which for me is the high bar set for deaging!! For me, it is not THAT distracting once you are into it. What is a bit of a problem is they still move like (and have the hands of) a 70 year old man. It is very apparent in a scene where De Niro beats someone up early on.<br/><br/>Harvey Kietel is simply window dressing here. I think he has three scenes. Bobby Canavale is also under used. Someone I did like was Ray Romano, he surprised me with a fine dramatic turn. As has been mentioned a lot, Anna Paquin does not have a lot of lines. I think she only spoke once. But she does a lot without talking!! Stephen Graham (an actor I like) is solid too.<br/><br/>Mesmerising at times, dragging it's feet at others!! There was a period of about 60 minutes where I was busting for the toilet, but I don't want to pause it lol I do not get why it was hoping all over its time line, if he is telling the story, it should have had a more straight narrative line, but its so good seeing De Niro and Pacino in something good again, as they have both being coasting/sleepwalking through their movies, but here they knock it out if the park!!<br/><br/>The soundtrack is not on par with Scorcese's best, far from it. La Vie En Rose and In The Still Of The Nights are the only tracks I noticed and the score didn't register for me.<br/><br/>For me it's behind Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed, as it's pacing really bogs it down, but I enjoyed it."

"Lewis_Heather787","8","3","8","29 November 2019"," Did we expect anything else?
","Did anyone really expect anything else from Martin Scorsese?? Of course this film is brilliant but not only that its a return to the form of films like ""Casino"" and ""Goodfellas"". This film definitely has the feel of those two films for some reason maybe its the mobster/gangster sort of story connection............but first and foremost this is definitely its own film and absolutely shines with uniqueness. However I would say that it does have its faults !!<br/><br/>I cant go too into detail because there is so much i'll miss out but the directing is superb as I knew it would be, its not like you forget to direct a film over night........and Scorsese definitely still knows how to shoot a great film from start to finish.<br/><br/>De Niro, Pacino and Pesci, who would have thought that all 3 of them would be in a film together in 2019!! Let that sink in for a moment, that is a truly once in a life time event that 3 of the greatest actors to have lived, still continuing to deliver fantastic work so late into the careers. All of them brilliant again ! Trust me when I say this because I was skeptical to begin with, you definitely forget about the de-aging of De Niro pretty quickly because the story and characters are so riveting!! Now and then it does stand out but for the most part it works!!! De Niro is De Niro was else can you say, Pacino is Pacino but the surprise for me is Pesci who isn't really Joe Pesci. Gone are the days of being loud and being a very cantankerous, he is a much more reserved character, but one that definitely is formidable. Overall its so good to see all of them together !!<br/><br/>The story is fascinating and has some many avenues it goes down, in the form of time jumps. Now that sometimes can hinder a film but not for this one, it is very easy to tell which time period you are in and what story thread you are following. The editing of this film is sublime, it must have taken ages to do, I cant imagine how much of the film was actually cut because this run time is long.<br/><br/>And that is where I have my two faults of the film, the pacing and the runtime. The pacing is incredibly slow.............I mean incredibly slow, I'm just glad that you can pause Netflix and have a break every hour. Due to the fact that the story is so intense, it needs you to focus all the time......can be draining. The other is the runtime which at 3 hours 30 minutes even for Scorsese is very indulgent.........its simply too long, easily could have been trimmed 30 to 45 minutes here and there, might have had better pacing that way.<br/><br/>Overall its 80% out of 100 its very good, I think in time will definitely go down as one of Martin Scorsese's classics along side ""Taxi Driver"" , ""Goodfellas"" , ""Raging Bull"". To me I think it will be looked upon better than ""The Departed"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". There is just something special about the film, the story and its characters..........along with the performances from 3 of the all time greats!! I may disagree on his view of comic-book films but he does sure know how to make a film, you cant deny that, whether you agree with him or not !"

The idea that 80 year old men can play half their age (or younger) digital selves is laughable at best and ruins any credibility the characters have. One thing though, this movie is worth watching is the absolute magnificent Joe Pesci who blows out of the water Pacino and DeNiro combined. Harvey Keitel, in the short time he's on screen, is better than those, too. Al Pacino is playing himself, the old, tired, loud himself, and De Niro is the usual mess of incoherent blabber and wincing facial expressions. The other good thing about the movie is its subtlety in visuals and character actions. Bottom line: not the proper goodbye for a cast that made cinematographic history."
"ElMaruecan82","10","5","17","27 November 2019"," The stuff Scorsesian greatness is made off...
","""In the Still of the Night"" is playing as the ending credits are rolling; I can't process my thoughts to express how beautiful ""The Irishman"" was. True I'm a Scorsese, Pacino and De Niro fan, a gangster movie buff too but it sincerely doesn't take these predispositions to appreciate the film.<br/><br/>Its historical value is undeniable. In fact, ""The Irishman"" is a fine companion piece to movies like ""Nixon"", JFK"", the original ""Hoffa"" of course and Scorsese's gangster biopics and you got to credit Hollywood directors like Oliver Stone and Scorsese to have enlightened us about the intricacies of the political underworld and their connections with the mob during the second half of the last century. And ""The Irishman"" came to fill a few blanks about Hoffa's disappearance with a little detour through JFK's election and elements barely suggested in Hyman Roth's speech in ""The Godfather Part II"" (hey, another film starring Al and Bobby).<br/><br/>Still, ""The Irishman"" is also the spiritual successor of gangster or mob-related biography classics that made Scorsese's legend, decade by decade, from ""Mean Streets"" to ""Raging Bull"", from ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" to the Best Picture winner ""The Departed"" in 2006 though (for me) the closest he ever came to his stylish and turbulent creativity was ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". It was a close call but Scorsese had a last trick under his sleeve for the 2010s, making a last but instant classic. And ""last"" is the word and that's why I was submerged by bittersweet feelings when the film ended.<br/><br/>Scorsese accomplished the miracle to reunite again false-acting-rivals but real-pals-in-life Pacino and De Niro, he also got Pesci here (who's extraordinary) and hell, he even got Harvey Keitel, the star of his directorial debut. There's a sense of coming full circle with ""The Irishman"" as the film isn't just about but it IS the end of an era, for we might never see these actors together again. But it was worth it. No trailer, no teaser could ever do justice to how great and extremely nuanced this film is, not even that revie.. And I guess it took time for Scorsese to get back to his roots because he needed it to gain some wisdom, something subtler than maturity.<br/><br/>Scorsese understood that style is one thing, but when we get an ordinary story but well-played and well-written characters, their arcs is the best storyteller. Still, ""The Irishman"" is full of Scorsesian archetypes, the narration: less an artistic license but a necessary device to insert vital information so we keep track on who's-who, the music is full of melancholic romantic ballades and generic doo-bah songs, the editing takes us back and forth from a decade to another... and we never feel dizzy, there's just something solid and smooth in the way the story goes. And it doesn't take more than one viewing to get the big picture.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of a hitman named Frank Sheeran, a steak truck driver who meets Russell Buffalino (Joe Pesci), and later answering phone calls starting with one of the most memorable lines of 2019, the title of Charles Brandt's original biography actually, ""I heard you paint houses"" and I felt stupid not to get it before Scorsese gave the clue. The film is wise enough not to sugarcoat Frank's action, but we see him from his relationship with his mentor and father-figure played again by an extraordinary Pesci. Both are men of a few words so they choose them carefully, sometimes they elevates them to unlimited and delightful euphemistic summits, sometimes they just talk like gangsters (you know ""the thing or the other thing"", ""which Tony?"", the ""summer"" line echoing the ""how am I funny?"" scene etc.). Sure Marty has wised up, and so did we, but there's something cozy and ""enjoyable"" about the film, we feel like family watching it.<br/><br/>But if ""Mean Streets"" had Johnny Boy and ""Goodfellas"" Tommy De Vito, ""The Irishman"" had Jimmy Hoffa. As usual with Pacino, and he's my favorite actor, it takes a while to appreciate his work, you always feel as he's at the edge of overacting a little or letting some weird reading pop up erupting, with that rapsy voice of his and his menacing eyes even when he's friendly, but no, after a few minutes, I was at ease because despite the showiness of his role (speeches, anger, monologues, intimidations), we could perceive the vulnerability behind his tough charismatic faÃ§ade, Pacino can be heartbreaking in this film.<br/><br/>So is De Niro. His Frank is just a guy whose job has brought a sense of belonging that gave a full meaning to his life (more than his family and his daughter Peggy played by Anna Paquin), that's what we all long for, belonging and meaning. In a certain way, that's what drove Hoffa to wherever his body is, some would call it hubris: he didn't listen, his death is tragic because inevitable but also stupid because avoidable, but as Hoffa repeated, it's his union and he couldn't imagine being stepped over. Ironically what also drove these two men was friendship, Frank and ""Russ"", Jimmy and Frank, but to one friendship he owed more, nothing personal, strictly business.<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" concludes on that deep and melancholic note that makes you wonder what the purpose of all this was after all, but so do many Martin's movies that starts with a glamorous and flashy observation of the mob world even (some inserted titles giving us the eventual fate of a local mobster reminded me of these boxing stats appearing in the ""Creed"" film) but at the end everyone dies, with more or less natural causes and what's left are regrets, pity and sorrow... the stuff Scorsesian greatness is made off.<br/><br/>I don't want to mix this review with Oscar considerations, I'll just use one of the film's irresistible euphemisms and hope that the Academy won't demonstrate a failure to show appreciation..."
"Theedg3","6","5","17","20 November 2019"," The Irishman
","If you are a cinephile like me you have been waiting for the Irishman to be released for a very long time, even wondering if it will ever see the light of day. Big studios passed on it over and over again, as it seems not many studios are willing to make these kind of films any more. Netflix swooped in like a White Knight to save the day backing the Scorsese lead film with a 170 million dollar budget. With a budget like this, a legendary cast, one of the best directors of all time, expectations were higher than usual.<br/><br/>The Irishman is the story of Frank The ""Irishman"" Sheeran, a mob hitman who recalls his possible involvement in the murder of James Hoffa. Sheeran is played by Robert DeNiro who delivers one of his best performances lately, however that is not saying much if you follow Roberts career lately. He is my favorite actor of all time, but even I admit he has made some strange film choices the last 10-20 years. We are let into Sheerans world immediately, narrated by Robert himself, and shows his dealings with the mob, James Hoffa and everything along the way. This story is very fascinating, interesting and needed to be told.<br/><br/>I will start with the pros for this film. First off, I have to praise Al Pacino's performance as James Hoffa, he shines every time he's on screen, firing on all cylinders with no signs of slowing down which is amazing for someone 79 years old. I did not expect Al to steal the film, I expected Pesci to be that guy based on past success in Goodfellas and Casino. It was also such a joy to see Pesci, DeNiro together on screen again, any film fan has to appreciate what these men have done in the business. I do not know many better. Stephen Graham as Anthony Pro shines in this film, goes toe to toe with heavyweight actors with ease, really impressed by him, excited to see his future work. The scene when Pro shows up late to meet with Hoffa and Frank is one the highlights of this movie.<br/><br/>It is so rare to get a film like this made nowadays, we all know what is popular and these type of crime drama slow burns are not. We really should savor these, push studios to take risks by making them as well. A good amount of viewers only know about Hoffas disappearance, me included, this film fixes that, as we learn a lot about Hoffa. He is portrayed as a larger than life character, a perfect match for Pacino.<br/><br/>Now that the pros are out of the way, let's go to the cons. This film runs 3 hr 30 mins and you feel it, it's almost impossible not to feel the run time when it's that long. I really believe they could of edited out 30 mins of this and had a tighter, crisper film but who am I to nitpick the best director of all time. This movie felt like it would of been better suited as a mini-series. You really have to be a patient person to be able to sit through this in one sitting, a big movie fan. I am worried a good bit of Netflixs customers will not finish it, or have to watch it in 60 minute slices.<br/><br/>So the run time is a serious issue, that was to be expected, a big surprise to me was this movie contained no music to get things going, a sense of dread hung over the film throughout. Things do take a long time to get going, with the run time this is to be expected, do not expect a bang out the gate or Hoffa early. This is the definition of slow burn. If you are expecting this film to be as engaging, entertaining as Martin's Goofellas, Casino, Departed, Wolf of Wall Street you will be severely disappointed. Those movies are four of the best of all time, some of Martins best from work last 30 years, hard to be touched by anyone in film. It simply is not as fun as those, not close.<br/><br/>If this movie was made in say 2005, I really think we could of gotten something a lot different, and I am saying that because of the age of DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino, Kietel etc. DeNiro's fighting scenes looked hard to capture at his age, looked to be not be moving very well, we can't expect Robert to be like the guy in Heat though at almost 75. If Martin would of used younger actors more in this film, say a Matt Damon or Leo, and saved DeNiro for big scenes, limiting his vulnerability, he would of made more of a impact.<br/><br/>Bottom line - Do not go in expecting a masterpiece like Goodfellas, Casino. Do not be worried about the de-aging ruining things, it is not very noticeable, well done. Make sure you have some energy as well before this, take that extra shot of espresso if you have to. It hurts me to say this but I left the theater very disappointed, thinking of watching Goodfellas to erase the memory of this quickly. I think a lot of people are reviewing this based on sentimentality, the love of Scorsese, I am just reviewing the film. Happy Netflix stepped up the plate for this, gave me one more chance to see my hero's on screen, but just like any star athlete past his prime, it's time for my hero's to hang it up for good. It hurts me to say this.<br/><br/>6/10"

Quite frankly, at two and a half hour, this may fit better as a TV mini-series. Only his name makes this a cinematic experience. While it is beautifully filmed, nothing really screams big screen. It is detailed and methodical. The problem is that it is a movie about a cold-hearted character. He is unmoved about his violent ways until the last act. His criminality is not fun. His brutality has no humanity. He is psychopath and not an enjoyable one. It is a movie from the past, by the past, and about the past.

","With 'The Irishman' Martin Scorsese makes an explicit statement that he considers his illustrious career as a director and a producer to be far from final. Besides, Scorsese is not only at the fourth feature film in this decade (plus some musical documentaries, another passion of his), but he is working deep in pre-production phases in two other films that promise to be events in the coming years.<br/><br/>'The Irishman' is an interesting combination. It's a film about the mob, a genre in which where Scorsese has already offered us memorable movies like 'Mean Streets', 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino'. The director does not hesitate to leave the big studios in Hollywood and works with the new channels of film production and streaming distribution, specifically with Netflix. He uses computer graphics - he already has done it in 'Hugo' but here it uses a process of 'rejuvenating' the actors in a story that spans the whole second half of the 20th century. Most than all he brings back together the great actors who are Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, along with other well known actors such as Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel, all (as Scorsese) in the second half of the eighth decade of their lives. They are all happy to prove that they are still here, and that they can add memorable roles to their already impressive records.<br/><br/>Frank Sheeran, the hero of the movie, the Irishman in the title is a real character in the histories of the trade union movement and of the American mob of the second half of the 20th century. Inspired by a 'true story' book, the film can be regarded as a docu-drama. Sheeran (played by Robert De Niro) lives the last months of his life in 2003, on a wheelchair in a retirement house and tells his biography - from a truck driver transporting meat to the slaughterhouses in Chicago to leader union and paid killer for the Mafia. Scorsese builds a specific American historical drama here, but he also takes a place in the series of directors who rewrote on screen the modern history of America, such as Oliver Stone did in 'JFK' or Robert Zemeckis in 'Forrest Gump'. We can see on the screen a gallery of more or less well-known historical figures, from union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) to mafia bosses and their corrupt lawyers. Most of them are introduced with the date and reason of death, and none died in his bed. For American viewers this gallery probably speaks a lot, but for those less familiar with the history of American organized crime, the character lineup becomes at some point repetitive and we do not differentiate them from each other, at best through the actors who interpret them.<br/><br/>The pleasure of seeing De Niro, Pacino and those around them on screen is one of the reasons why I was nailed in the chair for three and a half hours. The atmosphere of the '50s,' 60s, '70s and the blood-stained kitch in witch the mob chiefs lived are very well rendered. The process of 'rejuvenating' the characters using CGI technologies, however, works only partially in my opinion. Its use may bring some technical prizes to the Academy, but neither De Niro's Sheeran nor Pacino's Hoffa seemed credible and authentic to me in the scenes in which we have to believe they were of age. 30 or 40 years. There is still work left in this area.<br/><br/>I don't think that 'The Irishman' is the last of the great mob films in American cinema. The genre is already well-rooted, and as with westerns I believe that it will continue to give birth to new productions and variations in the future. The combination with the genre of docu-drama works well, and the film, without being a masterpiece, is a solid and interesting creation from many points of view. A film that shows Scorsese refuses to grow old and for good reasons."

","Highly recommend people listen to or read the book. After reading the book you can see how well the movie succeeds in its portrayal. A lot of people down rank this movie because of the CGI and the length. However, this story is not something you can tell in less than 3 hours. People complain about the driving scenes but I feel those scenes build the tension that sets the tone for the movie. De Niro's best scenes come later in the film prior to the hit. His portrayal after the hit is raw and real. Frank looks like a shell of his former self and distraught with guilt. The phone call scene and the confessions with the priest show realistic vulnerability and regret. Pacino delivers as he is always does. Pesci gives us a subtle yet powerful performance, almost like Paul Sorvino's in Goodfellas. Scorsese channeled his roots for this movie and was back in element. People should view this movie independently from his others. This is not Goodfellas, Casino or the Departed. Hard not to compare and contrast but I believe it allows viewers to enjoy it more."

I want to enjoy of the production like the final product, then I would care about who participate in his creation. But this time, it was impossible to not know who make this movie. Everybody was talking about who made ""The Irishman"" because it seems like Martin Scorsese is a recognize director. I haven't watched any of his movies and after watching ""The Irishman"" I don't want to neither.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese was the man who said the Marvel Movies weren't cine. So after the hype of this movie, I was expecting to see what cine really is. I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The Irishman is a very well-made movie. It has good shots, great acting and good CGI to make his cast look younger. That's all the compliments I could give to this movie.<br/><br/>The story in the Irishman is just boring. It seems like it will be something good and full of twists and emotions, that it will be a wild ride but I wasn't really moved for anything. This movie is so long, and it doesn't feel like it should have last that much. I didn't feel entertained. I was all the time expecting for this film to end because I never felt like it was going somewhere.<br/><br/>I know Marvel movies aren't artistic or pretentious enough, but not a single person watch Marvel features with an intention to watch the next masterpiece of the decade. People watch Marvel flicks because they know they are going to be entertained. Even though their films are predictable and they don't risk a lot, they are entertaining. You watch Marvel movies because it doesn't pretend to be something that is not. ""The Irishman"" pretends to be a masterpiece, art and one of the most amazing movies in the world. But you need to be entertaining too."

","This movie proves that Scorsese is probably the only director of his generation who can still create masterpieces like this, at this age.

The Irishman definitely ranks among the very best of his filmography.<br/><br/>Eventhough there are a few familiar faces and tropes from Scorcese's older movies like Casino and goodfellas, the Irishman is distinctively different from those movies in its themes. While we see Henry Hill from goodfellas look back at his gangster life as something he deeply loved and missed, here we see Frank Sheeran facing the pain, guilt and regret that his actions has brought upon him because of the life he chose. The movie also deals with complex themes such as loyalty, death, friendship and guilt. Frank Sheeran's life as a hitman and his relationships with Jimmy hoffa and Russell Buffolino forms the central narrative of the movie. Steven Zaillian's exceptional screenplay, Scorcese's direction and the performances, managed to thoroughly flesh out the characters and their relationships. Despite being over three hours long, the movie successfully keeps us engrossed from beginning to end. The performances by De Niro, Pacino and Pesci are top notch and are among the best in their entire career. Joe Pesci, who steals every scene he is in, proves his incredible range and versatility as he plays Russell Buffolino, who is nothing like the hot-headed psychopaths he is known for playing in goodfellas and casino. Seeing these legends together in which could probably be their last on screen performance together, was incredibly delightful.<br/><br/>The digital de-aging was extremely well done for the most part, eventhough it is slightly noticeable in a few scenes. There is also a scene where where De Niro's body movements clearly resembles an old man. But that is such a trivial issue and wasn't distracting due to the incredible performances, direction and screenplay"
"snowfre","9","3","9","6 December 2019"," The Best Movie of 2019
","In Martin Scorsese's ""The Irishman"", he revisits some familiar environments, delivering us a spectacular movie based on the real-life accounts - as told - by Robert Sheeran in the 2004 book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"". Sheeran is played by Robert De Niro and is the central character of the film, set, mostly in 1950s Philadelphia as he, a delivery truck driver, gets involved in the Bufalino mobster family. Eventually, he is lended out to act as bodyguard to eccentric labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino). Unsentimentally swinging the audience between an elderly Sheeran in present day and his retelling of his criminal life, Scorsese gives us amazing settings and scenery - and no, he is not tired of explosions and shootings quite yet. To portray a younger version of Sheeran, De Niro is digitally ""de-aged"" something you forget about ten seconds after you first see it. The compelling story and brilliant writing captivates you to such extant the long running time of ""The Irishman"" is no obstacle whatsoever. A grand standing ovation should also be given to the film's three stars, De Niro, Pesci, and Pacino, all of which makes a superb job in their respective roles. Pacino plays the unconventional union leader in a flamboyant manner infused with loads of humor, without ever stepping into the zone of parody. Pesci delivers some of the most unsettling acting pieces I've ever witnessed as the cold and calculating Russell Bufalino as his power over Sheeran gets more obvious over time. The Irishman himself is played flawlessly by De Niro; he characterizes the truck driver turned hit man's indifference for human life interestingly with large amounts of emotions and reflections. While somewhat slow paced, you never loose interest, much due to the underlying tensions, great writing, and mesmerizing narration of De Niro. This is 100% a Scorsese film, with all the best elements in it, including the large - but discreet - importance of Catholicism. Bread and wine is switched to bread and grape juice as the monsters spend time in prison. Many times this year, Scorsese has criticized the superhero movie genre in general (and Marvel in particular), as he believes they produce movies without any purpose. Now, I'm a huge Marvel fan myself, but Scorsese has a point. There are miles between any recent superhero blockbuster and ""The Irishman"", and a part of me is happy could deliver that. ""The Irishman"" is an absolute pure joy to watch."

Although THE DEPARTED was an excellent film, THE IRISHMAN: I HEAR YOU PAINT HOUSES is a phenomenal piece of art. The cast is a dream come true with Pacino, De Niro, and Pesci. This is an Academy Award nomination worthy for best director- Scorsese, best actor- De Niro and Pacino, and best supporting actor- Pesci.<br/><br/>This film is in the same league as The Godfather both 1 and 2."
"Filmcapss","10","3","9","2 December 2019"," Masterpiece
","A melodramatic, Somber and last of its kind tale about the mafia. Unlike other brilliant Mafia/mob films that Scorcesse has made, this was different, instead of showing you the glamorous side of Mobsters, shows you a heartbreaking story about what that lifestyle leads to. With The master behind the camera and talents like De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci blessing the screen, I don't even need to comment on the performance and directing, it's all brilliant.
In the end a man sits in the end, alone, no one by his side during his final days, Thinking about what he did wrong, while Still of the Night plays in the background. Scorsese's presumably last mob film ends in a poetic and sentimental manner and I wouldn't want it in any other manner."
"srdjbrankovic","5","3","9","2 December 2019"," CGI not for every movie
","Luckily for us ""Godfather II"" was filmed before CGI de-aging of main character. Young De Niro was great as young Vito Corleone.
If there was CGI de-aging back in 70s i guess Marlon Brando could act both (old & young) versions, but i believe movie would lose a lot of its magic.
Don't get me wrong, CGI is great for some movies, but in this case it works against story instead of helping it.
For me story and acting was completely lost due to CGI face flattening.
De Niro can act with eyes alone, but they changed his eyes as well. I really felt sad watching great actors as they try to tell us interesting story, but i could help noticing how they all look like wax figurines, motionless and lifeless."

"alejandroalfaro-37201","10","3","9","2 December 2019"," The Irishman
","A masterclass in storytelling. Scorsese employs flashes of his usual visual style, but this film is reliant on the performances and the layering and complexity of the decades-spanning story. Schoonmaker is on top of her editing powers as per usual. Not only is this an instant classic, but it serves as a wonderful addition to his oeuvre. Whereas GoodFellas is kinetically dynamic in its camera movement and editing, this film contrapuntally unravels with subtle flourishes and a slow-burn methodology, making for a contemplative film. By the film's conclusion one reckons with the idea of mortality and how one may look back at earlier life at old age, which beckons a re-evaluation of life in the present moment. In the end, there is no doubt that this film surpasses its genre tropes and achieves what few films do: greatness. Scorsese delivers a classic to close the decade, and considering his being three years away from 80, I wonder what other tricks he may have up his sleeve, because if he can make something like this there is no telling what's to come. I'm deeply grateful to be on the receiving end of his art. Did I mention how great, Robert De Niro and company are? Folks this film is for all-time. Enough said."

","Big fan of Mob movies and Scorcese in particular. Always been a huge admirer of Pacino and De Niro so it hurts to give a frank review of this mess of a film.<br/><br/>There are far too many self-indulgent scenes which drag on far more than is necessary. The conversations are repetitive and drag on endlessly.
The de-aging works well on the features but it falls apart as soon as the actors move! De Niro moves like the old man he is.
Pacino plays Hoffa with his Michael Corleone character out of Godfather 3 with a bit of ancient Scarface thrown in.
The best portrayal is from Pesci who still has that sinister air about him from Goodfellas and Casino albeit with a lot more wrinkles.
Considering the length of the film there is very little character development and you get no education on where the principles came from to be where they are now.<br/><br/>Ray Romano as a mob lawyer? Just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Visually the film is stunning as with all Scorcese titles but this just isn't enough to lift it above mediocre at best.
Compressed into a 2 hour flick with some sensible pacing this story could have worked but just not enough substance for 3 1/2 hours.<br/><br/>Better watch Goodfellas, Casino or Wolf of Wall Street to see what Scorcese is like at the top of his game. This isn't that."

","Though it's interesting to see a fictional account of what happened to Hoffa, 3 1/2 hours of mostly inane conversation was just brutal. Felt like I was being flogged, but had to sit through to see the end. Really not worthy of Scorsese. If I'm reading it right, Netflix paid over $175 million for this. Wow, did they ever get taken for a ride. Have to imagine the Mob would be envious. Proof that legal fleecing is a far better option than illegal fleecing, since Scorsese and crew aren't even risking prison time."
"mary-46116","10","3","9","1 December 2019"," Thank you, Scorsese and cast, for reminding me what a real movie is
","Scorsese has said that the trouble with so may contemporary films is that they are patched together by committees of writers. I add that those committees are all under the double whips of Management and Algorithms. Not only have Scorsese and this brilliant, fearless and seasoned cast built a world and drawn us in, they have dealt with the hard reality of aging, loss and the inexorable passage of time. There are scenes with the old men which touched me in a way that no bunch of cute guys could have.
Reviewers who critique that The Irishman moved to slow probably need to get off their phone and social media. Real life can move excruciatingly slow, especially when we have the courage to occupy it fully. Thank you, Scorsese and team, for creating a movie that, by itself, redeems 100% of the schlock we are now exposed to. And, thank you for being the polar opposite of somebody who would say, ""Ok, Boomer."""

It's not the Godfather ,just as long.Pacino stole the show as the stubborn Jimmy Hoffa. Joe Pesci is a rather low key benign mafia guy.

And by plot, I dont mean things that physically happen in the film, I mean something our characters are specifically trying to do from beginning to end. They aren't trying to get to Mount Doom, save Zion, save Private Ryan, find the infinity stones, solve that murder mystery, etc. There is no end goal. There is no objective. There is no Point B to their Point A. This film is littered with things that simply happen. But movies have story goals because that clues the audience in on what's to come. It gives the narrative obstacles. It gives characters individual importance. Without that story goal....you have an incomplete story. I feel like the biggest draw for this film is the cast, and sure...big names and strong performances...but do they all feel born to play the roles...? I'm not sure. So, some good, some not so good."

In my opinion his performance was a labour of love ,of his own extraordinary skills and respect of his audience.
I hope he gets other roles as challenging as this but I doubt it.

","I had the opportunity to watch The Irishman in a theater even though I do reckon it may be quite an unwelcoming idea in some countries (like mine); but if you can, even if it that requires some traveling, I will say this is the only way to only take full appreciation of this movie, which it entirely deserves. Don't forget you'll be part of one the cinematic production peaks of the decade with this one.<br/><br/>It's a long running, old-fashioned going pace movie. It takes its time to unwind wholly and that's why it's something definitely rare to find these days, where trends are all about 90 min of CGI in every bit and shooting madness. The Irishiman is revolutionary in this aspect, and that's actually the main reason I wanted to watch it in a theater.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved Pesci's acting, even more than Al Pacino's and De Niro's. They all come from the mob chapter so it'll be no surprise their exquisite ease of fitting the role.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna go into the plot because, as such, it's quite simple and the  description pretty much says it all. The brilliance in this film, indeed, to me lies elsewhere.
What I found most valuable in this film is, somehow, the legacy it leaves. Perhaps it's a sort of acknowledgment of the fact that likely we will no longer see anything like that. The strong presence of time throughout the film as an object being always there -almost as a standalone character-, always watching things go by inexorably and, of course, the characters being part of it, which inevitably defines a road end for them where they must stop. It's sorrowful to notice this resembles so much the reality beyond this movie.<br/><br/>IMHO, what this film aims to say is that we're in front of the end of an era, which definitely Scorsese has been part of with masterpieces such as Goodfellas and Taxi driver. And to me this felt like a way for signing off all that."

In my opinion the 3 and the half hours this movie is long is poorly used.
I like the idea of the movie and what it was *trying* to portray, but with so many characters showing up every 20 seconds in the first half of the movie and the general vagueness of what the focus is on in the partucular act, it leaves you with the weird combination of confusion, anticipation and boredom. The ending was sort of anticlimactic, although it fit with the general atmosphere and I particulary appreciated the symbolism in the last scene.
The acting was superb as expected and Robert De Niro never fails to amaze.
Lastly, I loved the experimenting with de-aging cgi contrary to the backlash and I'm excited to see how it developes and improves in the future of filmmaking."

","Martin Scorsese is obviously one of the most treasured filmmakers in cinematic history, and for good reason. He has a barrage of great movies and has influenced countless. Once I heard he was making a new mob epic with Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino, I was more than ecstatic. However, I'd be lying if I wasn't a little skeptical going in, worrying it would be Scorsese trying to relive his gangster classics such as Goodfellas and Casino. Though, when I watched it, all those worries were completely blown out of the water. The Irishman is one of Martin Scorsese's best movies. The cast is great, especially Joe Pesci and Al Pacino giving the best performances they have given in a long time. The Irishman is extremely entertaining, so don't let that 3 in a half hour run time scare you. I really don't think a minute is wasted in this film. The filmmakers just had a lot to say. The Irishman is of course a gangster epic, but it is far different than something like Goodfellas. I have never seen Scorsese this vulnerable. The film obviously speaks on the mafia, but this is the most I've ever seen Scorsese really dive this deep into the emotional consequences of a life like the one Frank Sheeran lives in this movie. The third act of this movie is incredible and other than the movie Silence, I have never been this emotionally impacted by a Scorsese movie.

On the one hand you have all the legends back together and on the other hand a deeply touching philosophical reflection on guilt, wrong choices and nostalgia on a age long lost. Obviously, Scorsese's directing ability is mindblowing- all the scenes experiment with the form of film on the highest artistic degree- but this time this whole experience has a bittersweet feel to it. This time what lacks in this film, unlike any other of Scorsese's work, is hope. The result is moving, entertaining and brilliant."

","This is a typical Scorsese movie, a movie that stands in the same line with (good fellas) and (casino)... a gangster film that begins with the gangsters seem to own the world: money, power.... every thing seems possible. gangsters are on the top of the society, they have enough power to put whom they want on the top of the unions or the top of the country! and - when needed - the power to remove or even kill them.
That is only in the beginning! as the time passes our protagonists begin to lose what they cumulate, after a while they realize that money is not every thing, money can not buy love, it can buy fear but not respect... this seems like a cliche but Scorsese does it in a very clever way that you will never feel that.... yes; Scorsese movies have a very strong moral message, but he never delivers this message in a direct preaching way, rather, he does that in a very artistic way.... Scorsese is a master in story telling.
The gangsters are always doomed, and whatever power they own, or money they make... all this is destined to fade away, by betrayl, conflict with others and in this movie; by time itself! after many years, Frank Sheeran finds that all those whom he cared for are either dead or don't care about him..... his strength is gone... his friends have passed away.... even his beloved daughter had abandoned him, the same daughter that he was about to murder some one just for her eyes. This is a good movie,may be not quite new, but it still - like all Scorsese movies- a must see."

","I loved this movie as a more in-depth character study of the mobster mentality. It's a movie that delves much deeper into the psyche of the people in and around the mob, and the cost of that brutal lifestyle. I loved its subtle handling of well known motifs in this genre, and it feels like these masters of the genre are deepening their craft trough this movie. It's not as action packed as earlier films from this band of brothers, but I found the film even more compelling due to its in-depth look at aging, and the deepening, and regret, that comes with age."

Scorcese has given us a movie that moves at a snails pace and uses alot of the same old actors he's worked with so many times in the past. there was almost a point where I felt like i was watching a sequel to Casino.<br/><br/>Scorcese is losing the plot in his old age, he's trying to stay afloat and compete with the likes of Spielberg but his direction just isn't what it used to be.

In The Irishman, it's a couple shots to the head and keep walking. A long interlude at the Latin Casino in Cherry Hill NJ sets up what happens as Hoffa loses his grip on the Teamsters but is probably too slow for younger viewers. Me, my grandparents lived down the street from the Latin Casino, so it was like going home again after all these years and I enjoyed watching the maneuvering over the Teamsters that went on while Jerry Vale sang away. Pacino was great - he got to be the old raging Pacino again, raging even more as Hoffa. DiNiro lower key as Sheeran but that's what you want in a hit man, somebody who doesn't stand out in the crowd. I loved it, but I can see why younger viewers would get bored. This isn't the kind of film they are used to."

"WalkdenEntertainment","9","2","5","14 January 2020"," The Legendary Director And Cast Return!
","An old man who is currently living out his remaining days at a retirement home begins to recall his life as a hitman for a mob. Frank (Robert De Niro) begins to open up to the cinema audiences, no secrets withheld, telling a range of stories from his life. A big highlight from Frank's past is the possible involvement he had with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa back in 1975. We quickly learn that Frank developed skills as a young man during his time serving in World War 2. Now, Frank makes a new friend who involves him with a crime family, taking Frank to many new highs and lows throughout his life.<br/><br/>For those who are not aware, this film is a historical drama (not a thriller, not a an action). The Irishman is also based on a well known novel entitled ""I heard You Paint Houses"" written by Charles Brandt.<br/><br/>While the Irishman may spend the majority on the movie portraying Frank's relationship with Jimmy Hoffa (played by Al Pacino), there are still many other stories to be shared. These stories show the impact various incidents had on Frank's life as well as his friends and most importantly, his family. With so many stories to share, this is the reasoning for the film's lengthy runtime- over 3 hours.<br/><br/>From the film's opening it isn't long until you are invested and curious about Frank's youth. This is mostly done thanks to an outstanding performance by Robert De Niro who is truly the highlight of this film. When I recall some of Robert De Niro's past films, I actually questioned if this is some of his best work in years. And honestly, I would say yes. To compliment his work here as an actor, Robert De Niro is also joined by Al Pacino and Joe Pesci who also give unforgettable performances on screen. Seeing these actors united once again on screen is simply a dream come true and it proves that it's ideal to stick with what works best when comes to making films in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Besides the three leading males, I also need to give credit to an outstanding line up of supporting actors who impressed me for the entire film, partially actors Stephen Graham & Ray Romano who are solid stand outs like our leads.<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese once again brings a fantastic, dark and gritty style of filmmaking to this movie. The director does a unique job at building suspense with many key moments which I consider similar to the workings of Quentin Tarantino. As a Director, it's evident that Scorsese knows how to best use the key actors and that everyone gets along behind the scenes. Not only that, I feel the director is generally passionate about this story, particularly from Frank's perspective.<br/><br/>With so many positives and praises I am sad to say it's not a complete gold medal, but the issues are generally minor. The most obvious issue I feel many will have is the film's runtime. While the film is extremely entertaining throughout the duration, I did feel a slight dip of interest and pace in the film's story around the half way mark which thankfully picks up again rather quickly. Another element to this film is the older actors pretending to be in their mid 40's. While the power of CGI is amazing (changing actor's eyes, cheek bones etc) sometimes these effects came off as distracting and other times not as much. Even if the CGI does work wonders for you, the true age of an actor is noticeable in their movements and walking on screen. Any other hold backs from me would relate to a film spoiler which I won't discuss. I will state that some of the timeline as the story goes back and forth in time can also be a little confusing.<br/><br/>Overall, this is truly a impressive Netflix release. Once again director Martin Scorsese proves he still has it and thanks to him the world can witness a powerful historical drama film. With stunning lead performances (particularly from Robert De Niro) and a strong supportive cast, any issues I had with the film are generally the obvious ones such as the runtime and other minor features which seem distracting. Nevertheless, this film is worthy of your time as it easily falls into my top 5 greatest films that are now showing on Netflix Australia today.<br/><br/>9.3/10

"Dirtroadie","9","2","5","10 January 2020"," Add it to the pantheon of great crime dramas
","On the Waterfront. The Godfather. Once Upon a Time in America. Heat. The Departed. Some of the best movies ever made are set in the seedy criminal underworld. It's a great vehicle for drama and Martin Scorsese is the undisputed master of the genre. Having said all that, I was a little skeptical of The Irishman before I watched it. Its run time of 3 1/2 hours is intimidating and there was a lot of publicity about the de-aging CGI used for De Niro, Pesci, and Pacino, all of whom were more than 74 years old at the time of filming.<br/><br/>The run time turned out not to be an issue for me and that is saying a lot. I have to exercise discipline to sit through most 90 minute movies now that I have become so jaded from endless repetition of tropes like jump scares, time travel, toothy monsters, choreographed fights and gratuitous sex scenes. The Irishman is long, but it doesn't wear on your patience, and we should be glad such movies are still being made.<br/><br/>The results of the de-aging CGI were mixed. On the positive side, it looked realistic enough and there were no uncanny valley moments. The downside is that it only goes so far. De Niro, Pesci and Pacino always looked considerably older than the ages of the men they were portraying, and the look didn't change much over the course of the main part of the story arc, which spanned 15 - 20 years.<br/><br/>One could also quibble about casting choices. The very Italian Pacino looks nothing like the German/Irish Hoffa who was actually born in rural Indiana. It is also hard to see how young Peggy (Lucy Gallina) became older Peggy (Anna Paquin) and the mid-30's Anna Paquin looked too old to be playing the early 1970's Peggy, who would have only been in her 20's. It would be a fair criticism to say that the casting was all over the place and was at its roots a love letter from Scorsese to his old friends and not dictated by what the real-life characters would suggest. Nevertheless, the old pros gave their usual great performances and you will just have to suspend your disbelief a little bit more than usual when it comes to casting.<br/><br/>There isn't a lot for women to do in The Irishman, and while it is true that career criminal is mostly a male gig, it is easy to see how women might be annoyed at the overwhelmingly male presence in the movie. One can't help but think that more could have been done, and that is coming from a guy who won't be bingeing the Watchmen series anytime soon.<br/><br/>Now that the criticisms are done, it is worth repeating that The Irishman is just a great movie. The performances are great. The writing and directing are great. The criminal underworld setting is a field day for high drama and themes of family, loyalty and morality. The 3 1/2 hour run time makes it a slow burn for sure, but that just means there is more to love. Yet it isn't simply another mafia movie. All of the characters and events that I bothered to research seemed to be accurately portrayed in the movie. I don't know how much artistic license was taken, but I didn't find any obvious discrepancies. And while the words of a psychopath like Frank Sheeran certainly need to be taken with a boulder of rock salt, his confessions haven't been disproved from what I read on the subject.<br/><br/>In summary, if you like the genera, then The Irishman really is a must-see. It really is that good."
"dpg-87522","8","2","5","6 January 2020"," The old men redeem themselves to bring us a good movie
","Martin Scorsese is a director considered by many to be the best in history, whether for bringing us movies like ""Goodfellas,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" or how he directs and the way he makes use of music, so When they announced that they would release a new movie, many people got excited because Martin Scorsese does not disappoint and this is no exception, this time he brings us with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, actors who had lowered their reputation, a movie 3 h 30 minutes, about Frank Sheeran a former war veteran who ends up getting involved in organized crime becoming his hitman, this is a movie that really is not for everyone because of its long duration, if you are willing to see it you have to prepare , otherwise it won't be possible for you to enjoy it. One of the biggest mistakes of the movie in my opinion are those of rejuvenating the actors, let's be honest Joe Pesci looks like plastic and De Niro is just the same as with the most blue eyes and black hair, I take this as a mistake because they could do much better, I say even a user on YouTube managed to do better. Also to tell the truth the movie is unnecessarily long, it is because the story that it has to tell is a story that frankly can be told in less time, but hey my opinion, maybe for someone the movie feels short and in fact should last longer. Obviously the successes of the film are bigger, the interpretation of Joe Pesci seemed very good, it is different because it is known for playing aggressive characters, in ""Goodfellas"" I play a violent Gangster who was carried away by emotions and In Home Alone I play a violent man who liked to harass minors. The same can be said of Alpacino and De Niro, great performances, as for the story one would think that it is the typical story of a man who is ascending in the world of the mafia and then falls, narrated intelligently using three timelines each with its purpose, what differentiates this from other gangster and gangster movies is that it focuses more on issues such as friendship or oblivion, therefore it ends up being an interesting and engaging story, and as I said Scorsese manages to execute it very Well, I found the soundtrack great, the uses of music and all that, I liked the environment because it has that touch of ""Goodfellas"", several scenes are very similar. And that is all I have to say about ""The Irishman"", so in conclusion ""The Irishman is a 3-and-a-half hour movie, which could last less, with good special effects except on the part of rejuvenating Joe Pesci already De Niro, but with great performances, a good direction, a striking environment, a great soundtrack, and a well-adapted script"
"treydrier","6","2","5","4 January 2020"," Not as good as I expected and too long
","With all the rave reviews my expectations were very high. I thought the movie was good, not great. Maybe it's just me but I thought it was at least 30 minutes too long. Pacino was excellent as Hoffa but DeNiro looked old and at times his acting was a bit puzzling. He stuttered at times, maybe purposely ... I don't know. But it came across as odd. He gets into a fight with a shop keeper and tosses him through a glass door and then pounds him into submission. He just didn't look physically capable. They needed to have someone younger playing the part of younger Frank Sheeran in his 30's/40's. DeNiro just didn't fit the part. Pesci looks REALLY old and tired. Make up and computer wizardry just didn't work in making him look younger. Jesse Plemons was superb as Chuckie, Hoffa's son. I thought Ray Romano was also very good as the attorney. Living in the midwest and knowing many in the Teamsters I had heard this story before. This is nothing new. And of course, there is still no verification that this actually happened. It's a famous director and famous actors playing out one of many tales of Jimmy Hoffa's demise."
"the_wolf_imdb","9","2","5","4 January 2020"," Intentionally boring - exactly as planned
","Many people do compare this movie to Goodfellas or Casino - and describe The Irishman as too boring. Actually I do think this is exactly what Scorsese intended.
The life of crime is boring and kinda pointless. In Goodfellas the main hero ends as a anonymous guy in witness protection program. In Casino the main hero ends as a old gambler. Frank Sheeran is way more successful: He survives everyone. In Casino there is a bunch of old mafioso guys who are literally judged on wheelchairs. This is their story!
Sheeran is fascinating figure. He does not give a damn about murder. He kills fast and very efficiently. This is not torture, cruelty, example execution, he is much more efficient. This is both boring and frightening, because... it is his job. He is absolutely OK with it, has not any problems with that except maybe doubt here and there and, of course, his daughters are frightened by him and they try to avoid him like a plague.
And there is the last part. This is the most boring and the most powerful one. He survives everyone - but there is no redemption, no lessons learned, no need to say the truth or to seek mercy of the God. He tries to speak with his daughter - and fails. They as him to say the truth as everyone is dead already, but he is silent. He sees no need for pardon from God.
He just buys his coffin and the grave site. He is alone and he is kinda calm and okay with it. His life had no meaning, there is just plain boredom and waiting for the death. There is no glory being mafioso hitman. This is the most tense ending of all Scorsese movies, as there is no glory at all. There is no glory even in the beginning - because for Sheeran, murder is just a job, very similar to work in the factory.
Showing that the Scorsese tells the real truth of being mafia man: You just listen for orders, execute the will of others, kill quickly, avoid problems - and if you are ultra successful, you will end up alone, just calmly waiting for your death, because there is no fun or glory in this job. Chilling, really."

"RhapsodyReviews","9","2","5","2 January 2020"," One of Scorsese's Bests.
","Review:
'The Irishman' is a crime film directed by Martin Scorsese. It is based on the book 'I Heard You Paint Houses' by Charles Brandt.
Martin Scorsese comes back to gangster films and brings the big bosses from the genre with him. This movie is a three and a half hour long epic and while it doesn't necessary fly by, you enjoy every minute.
The film follows Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a truck driver who becomes a hitman involved with mobster Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and his crime family, including his time working for the powerful Teamster Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).
The powerhouse of actors in this movie is what sold me on it, aside form it being a Martin Scorsese film. I'm not going to talk a lot about the acting in this movie, we all know who these people are and wat they are capable of and with an amazing director behind them, no wrong can be done. I do want to discuss one actor that when a lot of people think of him, they think of Home Alone, and that's Joe Pesci. He was amazing in this movie. He stole every scene he was in for me and I was in awe watching his performance.
It's not a flawless movie and I wouldn't necessarily call it a masterpiece or something new and innovative. But for an old genre gangster film it's easily one of the best ones out there on recent years. It does have a long runtime and it is an investment, but the story being told is very good.
Overall, the movie has great performances with a very good story. The runtime is long, but if you can be invested in the story that's being told it won't matter. I really enjoyed thee film and think people who liked film such as 'Casino' or 'Goodfellas' will enjoy this movie too.

Still, I don't think it's a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I still vividly remember some scenes, storylines and characters from the Goodfellas and the Godfather. In my opinion, this is what seperates masterpieces and cult movies from decent movies. This movie is like a Michael Phelps or an Usain Bolt race in which the hero wins the event effortlessly. It is still worth to watch, it is still enjoyable yet you can't remember anything from that race to make it a memorable experience throughout your life. The plot of the movie is enough to make it a decent movie yet it doesn't give much to top-notch stars to create a masterpiece. Scenario, acting and production values are just interesting enough to prevent the film of being bland.<br/><br/>It's what it is... Worth to watch but not a must-watch."
"msbreviews","8","2","5","30 December 2019"," Rating: A-
","It might not be Martin Scorsese's best film yet, but it's one more proof that he's one of the most talented filmmakers ever. With Robert De Niro delivering his best performance of the decade, Al Pacino going crazy and Joe Pesci brilliantly coming out of retirement, The Irishman is a wonderfully-written, (very) long story about friendship and life. The best editing (Thelma Schoonmaker) of the year makes the runtime smoother, but it still drags on for too long. I also feel that Anna Paquin's character should have had more impact. The de-aging VFX is mind-blowing, even if it takes a few minutes to get used to it."

But to me it's quite a huge desillusion. There's not much in that film. Al Pacino is a caricature of himself, a clone without soul and guts. De Niro does the job, but at its minimum. The screenplay is as flat as a bad TV film. Isn't it one, by the way?
What's happening here? Do you really find it's a good film, another masterpiece?
Or are you mistaken by the famous names? Is it possible you think it's not too long? Sorry, I won't be the one to give up my convictions for an unbelievable collective manipulation... By the way, isn't it a classic... commercial flop?"

"vinnieboards","9","2","5","19 December 2019"," The Pensioners
","Bravo to Joe Pesci for being persuaded to come out of retirement for Martin Martin Scorsese's soon to be, new classic 'The Irishman'.<br/><br/>Like many, I feared a bore-fest with a run time of 210 minutes and my goodness is this film long. And yet, it plays out like a good book - it's so fascinating at times that you just can't put it down. Scorsese has this unique ability to make a compelling film which could quite easily drift into a world of self-indulgence, and yet The Irishman never falls into this trap. Pesci is brilliant from the start, De Niro's star shines brightly again after several dubious outings and Pacino, as an often 'camp' Jimmy Hoffa, is a revelation.<br/><br/>My only criticism of the film (and it's a tiny one) is that because the three actors are all in their 70s and the film delivers a series of flashbacks, CGI was used to make them look younger. Particularly in De Niro's case, he did look rather odd to me at times. A mob hit or a beating had the look of being perpetrated by a pensioner with a youthful face. But this minor detail which to be fair, was unavoidable, should not detract from the acting masterclasses on show here. With a stellar cast including Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano and Stephen Graham, the master of the mob genre is back with a bang.<br/><br/>A big thank you to Netflix too - the big picture studios didn't fancy this one as it was considered a risk. It is apparent that an appetite for risk-taking is now being adopted by the new kids on the block and thank god they did.<br/><br/>I look forward to Pesci receiving his Oscar for best, supporting actor next time around. He delivered a masterclass and his regular presence on the silver screen is sadly missed."

Robert De Niro and Al Pacino struggles with their roles because ass almost everyone knows, THEY ARE F...... OLD AND CANT ACT AS CHARACTERS THAT ARE WAY YOUNGER THEN THEMSELVES, but I have to say that Joe Pesci can do something that both De Niro and Pacino cant, he delivers a performance that is so intense that you just quickly just forgives his age and just moves on from there. But even if Joe is great the movie just feels most like a fetch quest from a video game where De Niro Character Frank talks to some gangsters and gets a job and then do the task and do the same thing again and again and again, and that's pretty much the entire friking film, Jesus Christ.

"kjcook76","5","2","5","9 December 2019"," Slow, bloated and lacking
","I know this will goi against popular opinion, but I just felt this film relied on a tired format with ageing actors that were far from suitable for their roles. In their heyday, absolutely, but this felt more of an actor appreciation movie rather than a movie made for thr audience.
Absolutely drained out to 3 and a half hours with no real connection to any character."
"gerrysford","6","2","5","9 December 2019"," Not quite perfect
","I enjoyed this movie. The story, writing, and filming was excellent. The primary negative with the film is I found myself constantly confused on the age of the main characters. Scorsese, presumably through his loyalty to Pesci, DeNiro, and Pacino, chose to use makeup and wardrobe to present the age of the three main characters. While I am no film expert and do not even feel comfortable second guessing Scorsese, my experience would have been better served if they had used different actors for the younger stages of the main characters. Is the main bad? No. But it was not near as it could have been for me."
"de_Biafra","6","2","5","9 December 2019"," Looong and slooow-mo
","Scorsese sure knows how to create a story. He makes use of a great cast, and the idea of using old stars in the roles as much younger characters is tempting and fine, but watching a 75yo De Niro act as a 40yo becomes unvoluntarily ridiculous. Camera effects cannot create that illusion when the man walks and moves as a 75yo.
The plot is not bad with the near 80yo hitman telling the story of his life. However, the speed of narration is like watching the weather change, and after 1 hour you start looking at the progression bar to see how long is left. The movie is more than 3 hours but could easily have been cut to no more than 1 hour an a half. The last experience with a long-playing film was ""Once upon a time in Hollywood"" and here t
time just flew away. What a contrast this is. Pacino, Pesci and DeNiro do their best, which is uplifting, and generally speaking, acting, film shooting and plot are fine executions, but gosh it's old school in a not so desirable way."

Maybe, but you can't oversee scorcesse's touches all over the film. From the soundtracks to the cinematography, crane shots and much more gives this film an experience like no other.<br/><br/>The acting is subjective however. Some may find it over the top, some may find it awesome, and some may find it interesting, but nevertheless, these are world class actors so there performances are appreciated. The one that stands out for me was Joe Pesci. Believe what is being said about him. I don't think this movie would've the same effect if he wasn't in it.<br/><br/>I personally didn't feel the 3.5 hours pass by and again that says something about how invested I was in the story and how to flow of the movie carried that dramatic interest from star to finish.<br/><br/>The irishman will have some buzz at the academy awards that's for sure, might even win best picture or best director, but regardless it is a fun and interesting gangster movie that will stand it's place in time.

"Camoo","9","2","5","9 December 2019"," Scorsese's Mafia Meditation
","The Irishman is a really great film, albeit one that took me a couple viewings to fully get behind, and it might, ironically, given Scorsese's penchant for a theatrical experience, be better suited for the small screen than the big.<br/><br/>This film was a challenge in the cinema. Aside from its epic runtime (sans intermission) and languorous pacing, I was fundamentally disappointed with the CGI work on the actors, and how the de-aging process translated to the big screen. It was far less 'obvious' and unsettling on a smaller screen, which it appears designed for. Blowing up aging actors to cinema size, warping their features and expecting me to suspend disbelief was a step too far on first viewing, and I couldn't shake the sensation that in many scenes Joe Pesci looked more like Gollum than Russell Bufalino.<br/><br/>But by the second viewing I had gotten more used to it, and focused more on the story, details, and the acting behind the tech. The actors all shine, and the script by Steve Zaillan, which on first viewing felt had too much lard, now feels full of zest, and taut, essential scenes which amount to an epic meditation on the mob.<br/><br/>Scorsese's signatures are all there and more pronounced than ever - his love of a moving camera, old music and actors from his repertoire. His merging of murder and domesticity, as seen here in Pesci's Bufalino explaining calmly to De Niro's Sheeran how they 'did all they could' for Hoffa, as he tosses and tastes home made salad dressing, or the choosing of an arsenal by laying the weapons out on a bed, a throwback to Taxi driver. And lots and lots of wine, and lots of bread.<br/><br/>The film does appear to fully commit to this particular Hoffa narrative, and whether the reality is as close to the film is impossible to know. There have been many accounts from those in-the-know who have deemed the Irishman Frank Sheeran a fabricator. But the point of this film is not to bring history precisely to life. This is a film about people who have done bad things, and have to live with or die by those decisions. And about how those who outlive the consequences still have to live with themselves."
"davidgee","7","2","5","9 December 2019"," Too loud, too long, too familiar
","As well as Scorsese's own previous trips down Mafia Memory Lane, two other obvious comparisons come rapidly to mind: Coppola's GODFATHER trilogy, which highlighted the Mafia involvement in trade unions, and Oliver Stone's JFK, which detailed the Mob's role in Kennedy's election and his execution.<br/><br/>So, ground already covered and in similar detail. The 'novelty' here is the use of CGI to de-age the principal actors rather than have two players for each role. The de-aging of De Niro is fairly flawless, but Pacino's looks a bit weird and Pesci's (he seems to have been aged rather than de-aged) looks more like plasticine prosthetics. De Niro plays Sheeran much as he played Vito Corleone, a family man exterior masking a ruthless killer. Pesci gives us his familiar slightly shrill gangster ""shtick"". Pacino (who was so subtle in THE GODFATHER, shading from war hero to monster) is in shouty overdrive, reminding you of how loud (and how good!) he was in De Palma's SCARFACE. His Hoffa behaves like the president of a country rather than a union, but that's probably how Jimmy Hoffa was, another kind of gangster.<br/><br/>THE IRISHMAN is loud and crude, way too long. It takes us into territory we've seen before, but it's also very watchable, very absorbing. I hope they aren't, but these may be ""swansong"" performances from some of the finest actors of the last half-century."

"Tushpi","7","2","5","7 December 2019"," Screen legends last hurrah
","What a wonderful gift to be able to watch a Scorsese collaboration with this extraordinary cast. This is an old style gangster film of a time in history now gone. Similar story in many ways to Goodfellas, The Godfather and others of that ilk. It's a story of few surprises but masterfully recreated nevertheless. Great characterisations, full of wonderful dialog such as the quirky 'fish' scene. It does meander along giving glimpses through one man's life, but doesn't explore too deeply the psych of the protagonists or political plays involved. Noticeably absent of female characters, with the father daughter relationship so surface it's appears token.<br/><br/>At 3 hours it is way too long and one wonders if a bit of judicious editing would have improved the pace and tension. The de-aging technology is a wonder of skill, but I felt the main characters all still looked a bit old for the parts they were playing. They did look 20 years younger but not the needed 40 years and it couldn't disguise their movements and physiology, which were of elderly men. The scene showing DeNiro climbing over rocks disposing of a gun is a case in point. In the last part of the movie they were old men so that didn't matter.<br/><br/>All that aside they are all masters of their craft and delivered wonderful performances. Pacino explosive passion, Pesci power contained and DeNiro humble. It felt like a labour of love and to see them together as an ensemble is something special."

It should have reflected the brutal violence of Goodfellas, Casino etc, but end up looking like exactly what is ... and stiff old man, with failing relexes raining slow and weak-looking kicks and punches on his victim.<br/><br/>Anytime Sheeran is fleeing a crime scene, it reminds me of that old advert with Italian pensioners playing football.<br/><br/>Apart from that, it was an absorbing film, with Pacino stealing every scene he's in as the highly-strung and narcissistic Jimmy Hoffa."

"manuel_medeiros","8","2","5","5 December 2019"," Expectations are a double-edged sword
","Given the A-list actors, Scorcese and how much money went into making this film (thank you Netflix for getting it off the ground by the way), I expected more from the Irishman. Or at least I expected not to feel like the movie was very long. Unfortunately I did.<br/><br/>One disappointment was perhaps the infamous de-aging technology. I think it works wonders on the actors' face, no doubt about it. But then you have DeNiro offing a guy supposedly in his prime years as a hitman, and yet he moves like an 80 year old. I even laughed in a particular scene (outside a dinner) because of it, and I am not sure that was the point.<br/><br/>I also did not feel like really merited much the 3h20 run time. Some parts were not needed. They can be weaved in sure, but the main climax of the movie is solved 2h40-50 into it. So the remainder could definitely be shortened.<br/><br/>Still, definitely worth watching it<br/><br/>For one it still has a lot of identifiable Scorcese-isms. In addition to being an anti-hero narrated gangster movie, it also has a beautifully long single shot scene.<br/><br/>Also Joe Pesci is phenomenal as Russ Bufallino, in the exact opposite of his hot-headed Goodfellas character. Al Pacino is intense but since he is shouting all the time makes it slightly easier to notice his acting, I would say.<br/><br/>Overall it is a great movie about a guy who almost inadvertently rose through the ranks of the Italian-American mafia, the challenges he faces along the way and how they contrast with what America is going through (from Kennedy's election to Nixon's Watergate, a lot is contextualised). All through his own rear view mirror.<br/><br/>But still a slight let down given the massive expectations I had going into it."

","This is a very different movie from Goodfellas or Casino, that is, Scorsese does not reuse the pattern he himself created (which is a relief when one remembers the ridiculous The Departed). The movie is basically about an ordinary guy who happens to be a killer who works for the mafia. The focus is precisely on the tension between the trivial and criminal life. This makes Scorsese give up Goodfellas' technical and narrative tricks, making the movie much slower but not at all boring. Of course this causes strangeness. I am sure that the vast majority of the audience will watch the movie expecting to be constantly excited by fast scenes, noisy soundtrack, etc. But the problem here is with the public, not the director.

","I'm sure cast and crew had a blast making this movie, but for us as fans I think we could of benefited from a younger cast, an ambitious cinematographer, and a less patient editor. I feel that so much was let to rest on the dynamism of these once great actors, resulting in stifled scenes that lumber, and the presentation of caricatures quickly assumed, rather fully fleshed characters.<br/><br/>There is little to grasp the viewer and pull them through this movie. Even as a fan of long, roaming, historic and biopic works, I found myself asking just why was I watching this film far too early into its 3.5hrs, and far too often. It is not that it meanders, but plods, with very little justification or pay out. Contrary to some I am in favour of the floating tiles that appear over background characters, informing us of their names and the situations of their eventual death, it shows the knowledge of the film-maker of the history surrounding the event. There are some gold turns of dialogue, and the set up of placing two actors at a table and have them play against eachother sometimes pays out. But rarely.<br/><br/>For the whole the film is spirited, but slow and shallow. There is very little feeling of emotional engagement or risk. It's a history lesson that no one wanted, from a point of view that is out-dated; lacking in any character work other than three, sometimes superb actors, rolling it off the cuff in criss crossing A/B shots of talking heads. My recommendation would be to go watch Casino. It's shorter, it has a more substantial story, and the actors earn their tremendous wage."

Ha-ha.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Irishman is a restrained, Martin Scorsese pic that is his cinematic, greatest hits collection (no pun intended on ""hits""). There's a subtle, master-class piece of acting involving Robert De Niro and a ferocious turn from Al Pacino as labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>As far as late releases go circa 2019, ""Irishman"" reminded me of Scorsese's Goodfellas, his 1995 opus Casino, and The Good Shepherd. Yeah the film runs about three and a half hours but hey, those rise and fall minutes seem to glide right by.<br/><br/>Now would I put The Irishman in Scorsese's top five via his 50-year span as a filmmaker? Probably not. Would I recommend it? Of course I would. ""Irishman"" is a sprawling and calculated epic. It's talky rather than flashy. It's phlegmatic as opposed to being overly violent. Its sense of time and place is sumptuous as opposed to being visibly forced. Its use of flashbacks is pertinent as opposed to being an obligatory gimmick.<br/><br/>The Irishman spans decades while chronicling humble hit-man and labor union lackey, Frank Sheeran (De Niro). Sheeran was once a truck driver in the 1950's until he saw an opening to be part of a high rank crime family. Yup, that's an interesting and dangerous promotion.<br/><br/>All in all, I reveled in Scorsese's remarkable camerawork and his ability to insert one unforgettable tune in the proceedings (""In the Still of the Night"" by the Five Satins). Yeah ""Irishman's"" script by Steven Zaillian is rife with vapid, tough-talking entities. Oh well. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing here is still tight as a drum.<br/><br/>One critic referred to The Irishman as the Forrest Gump of mob movies. This critic thinks of ""Irishman"" as more The Green Mile version. Now that it's Oscar season, it's time to walk ""Irishman's"" long but rewarding ""mile"". Rating: 3 stars."

It's not an instant classic, like Goodfellas was for example, but it's still a powerful film full of great scenes.<br/><br/>Some really good performances pepper the film, Pesci in particular, Pacino too but I was a little less blown away by De Niro...the cgi too threw me a bit because the actors all had old man bodies but not their faces. Still, you get used to it. Supporting roles are less impressive, Ray Romano is just himself and the guy playing Tony Pro is now forever going to be typecast as a bad Italian American impersonator.<br/><br/>What made this less of a clear classic was that it was slightly bitty. It's as if at times they were forcing a scene into the film for context so it didn't flow...the guys seemed a little rusty too at times maybe because it's been so long since they made a film of this type which in all honesty should've been made a decade ago when they were all that little bit younger."

"matija-lozancic","9","2","5","30 November 2019"," The Swan Song of Gangster Epics
","Captivating, slow-paced, and stylish, this mob drama is everything you could have expected from the defining figures of the genre - Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino; but also much grittier, darker, and sorrow.<br/><br/>Loosely based on real events, just like a long book that builds its characters slowly over a long period of time, before taking you in for a twisted turn, The Irishman doesn't force its plot on you; but rather lets you immerse in the narrative at your own pace, trying to bond with characters who are both attractive and repulsive. Scorsese's documentary-like style does a lot to make you aware that the story is based on real events, but also adds that refined stylishness that we're used to see in the likes of Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro plays Frank Sheeran, an Irish truck driver who gets involved with the mob and quickly rises through the ranks due to his sturdiness and coldness, soon to get involved with the likes of the notorious Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) and the local capo Russ Bufalino. The plot itself is told in non-chronological order, following three different timelines as the main character (De Niro) recalls events from his past. You cannot help but smile during some of the familiar scenes, like when he beats a random man for touching his daughter, or when Pacino yells at his employees. The first part of the movie really does feel like it's a tribute to the genre, with a scene similar to the Goodfellas' famous ""Copacabana"" scene, or a mob meeting with some red lamps on the table that resemble the ""Funny guy"" scene from the same movie. The characters are also introduced in a fashion similar to Casino (1995), so you might genuinely worry if that's what this movie is going to be - a nostalgia trip? But as the movie progresses, you realize that it's much more than that. A portrayal of mobsters with their complex morale codes, the incredible feats they are capable of doing with no remorse, all for their ""cause"". Subtlety is what this movie is all about. That oh-so-sweet mafia dialogue undertone that make you terrified of hearing something like ""Tell Jimmy it is what it is""; with knowing what's coming next, even though it is never spoken out loud. The characters grow on you. With each scene the increasing burden that Frank Sheeran carries is revealed, and you wonder and worry, how much is he going to endure. His eyes are watery and foggy (and some criticised the CGI used for the de-aging process, but it might have worked for the cause), telling of a man who is torn, whose dignity is washed, trying over and over to reconcile both sides, to be a father, friend, and a gangster at the same time, but ultimately learning that such thing is impossible and a side has to be chosen. It would be hard to believe that Al Pacino's classic, loud, vibrant character would still work today, but it does. His portrayal of Jimmy Hoffa stands as the most likeable character in the movie, standing opposite of Joe Pesci's cold, calculated, silent boss Russ Bufalino. Not once does Pesci change his facial expression throughout the movie, yet he is able to perfectly convey the cunning, manipulative gangster who feels no remorse for doing what he believes ""must be done"". As old Frank Sheeran tells us his story, sitting in a wheelchair in a nursing home, we see a man behind whose foggy eyes there was once a man who wanted to be honorable, who wanted to be father and a husband, who wanted to choose side, but ultimately failed, knowing he lost his dignity, his family, now lying at deathbed, trying to find remorse for the life he could've had- but failed to choose a side. Here, with the rather long epilogue, the movie reveals itself for what it really is- a character drama, a story about remorse, failed redemption. A father who alienated his family for the actions that he did, and now, while his clock is ticking, desperately wishes he had his daughter's forgiveness. We don't find out if he took his secret to his grave, but we find out how large of a burden one is capable of carrying when he abandons the truth.<br/><br/>This is a gangster saga like from the old times. It has its funny moments, violent action, epic grand scale feeling and at times cynical portrayal of the mafia that we're used to from Martin Scorsese. Beautifully shot, with unmistakable 60's music score, it breathes and lives the gangster life of the America's post-war era.
This is the best that Scorsese, De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci could have given us. It might just be the swan song of these men, well in their 70s now, who defined the genre.
Recently, Scorsese caused some controversy criticizing Marvel movies saying that ""they are not cinema"". Whether or not you agree with him, it is hard to deny that he showed us once again what cinema truly is."

","Positives, de Niros best performance in years, pesci and keitel are brilliantly menacing and pacino is at his very best once again, movie itself, if u like godfather trilogy, goodfellas, casino then you'll love this too, a typical scorcese gangster movie that still works in today's era, the only negative I have is the cgi de-ageing technique they use, mainly on Di Niros character, although its a success de-ageing him facially, the main fault is de Niros character in one scene has the face of a 40 year old which is fine but still has the body movement of his current 75+ years when in the green grocer scene attacks the owner in the shop in a supposed beat down looks kinda silly as its obviously an elderly guy, his body shape and movement sort of ruins the scene, surely they could of used a younger actor to do the younger scene as it was shot from a distance anyway, this alone ruins a very good film that could have been an instant classic"

","On the heels of a glorious Marvel Universe diss, old school filmmaker Martin Scorsese does more than yell at the kids, he delivers a marvellous film. ""The Irishman"" works as a splendid godson to the great mafia melodramas way back in the last millennium, but it also offers up a simple hypothesis to the whatever the hell happened to Jimmy Hoffa quandary. And more importantly, why it happened.<br/><br/>As the big mouthed, wide-eyed teamster boss, Pacino channels his late career one dimensional blustery best into a role perfectly suited to an uncomplicatedly stubborn character, but really, Al jumped the shark when he started smelling women. Then, as the well-meaning, overtly dedicated and stupidly subservient henchman Frank Sheeran, we have Robert De Niro. He IS this movie. A matter of fact narration from the old folks home guides the action that swings from comedic posturing to blunt violence at the slightest provocation. Frank is simple. Frank is congenial. Everyone likes Frank. Except a daughter. That tense relationship is his lone regret, and a vital running thread.<br/><br/>Spanning decades, and with the help of computer manipulation (make up? we don't need no stinkin' make up!), ""The Irishman"" follows these badfellows from virile hoodlums to decrepit, shaky shells. It's a startling bit of cinema magic, especially for the grape to raisin transformation of a shrinking Joe Pesci. Plus, it's pretty cool to see former Godfathers Pacino and De Niro come full circle to rekindle their glorious gangster past.<br/><br/>There's a lot to love and loathe here (in a good way), from the simmering development of lifelong relationships, to silly, seemingly mundane character interaction (""who wears shorts to a meeting?""). Most importantly Scorsese manages to warp time with this film; it is a super quick three and a half hours of your life. A hit."

Martin Scorcese, makes another ""mob film"" with his usual cast of characters, Joe Pesci comes out of retirement and is fantastic in a very serious role for a change, well acted. Pacino, De Niro (friends, no political comments please, this is about the movie, don't ruin the fun), they all were great. Perhaps maybe not an Academy Award winner. Maybe Pesci. There was a character who sort of reminded me of Joe's part in Goodfellas. This was not a repeat of the other Mob movies with these guys in the past, but we do look for similar elements, and maybe some of the other actors who play the usual mob parts from other productions, but not many. Out of 10 I gave it a 7. This cast is getting old and perhaps one of hte last few as an ensemble they might make.

"dpere-82618","8","2","5","28 November 2019"," An Ode to Gangster Cinema
","Martin Scorsese's ""The Irishman"" is an epic gangster film that highlights family, betrayal, and loyalty. This movie is not Casino and definitely not Goodfellas. And this is not such a bad thing. This film is different in terms of relying only on realism and seriousness. Scorsese approached this film in a completely different way and the legendary cast excels with the flow. De Niro, Pesci, and Pacino all did an incredible job. Pacino had the right energetic performance, De Niro was interesting, and Pesci stole the show as a very complex, intriguing mob boss. The cinematography was excellent, of course, and the musical score varied from low to high... in order to fit the overall mellow, but exciting tone. However, there were a few minor issues that distracted my viewing. For instance, the kills seemed a little too cgi or just fake looking. And the one scene... actually, almost every scene where De Niro has to be physical, fell short, showcasing a depressing fail due to his age. This was the one thing that the deaging technology could not fix. But, as an overall film I was impressed. The acting was top notch and it was a great gangster epic encompassing time, history, while moving with a realistic approach to tell the story. This is not the best of Scorsese but it is definitely worth watching. In my opinion, this was more of a tribute, or an ode to the gangster films... could be a classic.. will definitely see it again."
"mvrk","7","2","5","28 November 2019"," A last hurrah before the end.
","This doesn't give you the rush after you've seen Casino or Goodfellas for the first time. It is made in that style, with narrations etc. while not bad, this is more like a farewell movie to Hollywood by Scorsese, Pacino, De Niro, and Pesci. It's kinda like Scorsese saying to the audiences this is my last gangster film, goodbye. Scorsese always wanted to work with Pacino and he finally got his time.<br/><br/>If you compare the acting between Pacino and De Niro, it's not like comparing their acting in Heat, where people still argue till this day who gave the better performance. In this film De Niro acts as the underlining/hitman to Pacino's Hoffa. So by default, since Pacino is the boss, he gives a more powerful performance. De Niro is his underling so his performance is more timid. But I think this movie will get the following Oscar Noms:<br/><br/>Best Movie
Best Director
Best Actor: Both Pacino and De Niro
Best Supporting Actor: Pesci
Best original or adapted screenplay<br/><br/>Now as far as the movie goes, I'm glad I didn't waste $25 to go see it in some art house theater in Dallas. I thought I was missing a major motion picture event. And it turns out that I didn't. Realistically, it's just an ok movie. However the competition this year is very flat so it might win all the Oscars mentioned above.<br/><br/>The only bad thing that I'll say about this movie, is that Robert De Niro's deep fake was horrible. It's a CGI mess and shouldn't have been done. Hair, makeup, and the prosthetics department could've made a better young De Niro. Facial prosthetics are good enough these days to make an actor look young. Thankfully the deep fake version of young De Niro was only in the first one hour, so the next two and a half hours it was back to a normal looking De Niro. Pacino used deep fake for one scene. It was the scene in which Hoffa talks to Frank for the first time over the phone, and you can clearly see that Pacino's upper lip does not move at all, and it looks weird. I mean the deep fake/CGI was ""Mars needs Moms"" level bad. I don't think Pesci used deep fake technology at all and it worked out for him positively. I hope this movie is a warning to other directors never to use deep fake technology to make actors look young.<br/><br/>So as a necessity watch this Scorsese movie, but watch Casino and Goodfellas right after you finish this movie."
"ianfuller-67770","9","2","5","28 November 2019"," Bittersweet

I'm sure there will be more period films depicting that era, but I feel like they will never be able to capture what Scorsese accomplished. Anyways, if you enjoy Scorsese gangster collaborations in the vein of Goodfellas I'm sure that you will dig The Irishman.

"bastille-852-731547","7","2","5","27 November 2019"," Very well-acted but overlong Scorsese epic
","Martin Scorsese's highly anticipated crime epic, ""The Irishman,"" has arrived on Netflix. The film stars Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran (a mob hitman,) Al Pacino as influential union boss Jimmy Hoffa, and Joe Pesci as the head of the Bufalino crime family. The film's story is told from De Niro's perspective and in flashbacks, as he looks back at his life ranging from in his earlier days in combat, to his middle-age years spent in organized crime, to present. For the most part, this structure works. CGI technology was used to ""de-age"" De Niro in select sequences, but such technology surprisingly does not come off as awkward or bizarre.<br/><br/>The film sometimes serves as a tableau (in a few fleeting sequences, quite literally) of American society in the second half of the twentieth century. While this lens of its essence is often interesting, it can also be tedious in places. The film's performances are, unsurprisingly, terrific. De Niro's acting as Sheeran is often low-key to allow his interpretation of this character to carefully creep up on patient audiences for maximum impact. Pacino is extraordinary in his supporting role, managing to convey both the immense power and control over much of American civic life in certain parts of the U.S. during this era. Pesci is very good as well, although I would have liked to see his character developed a bit more, and possibly some more exposition surrounding the direct relationship between his character and Sheeran. The screenplay is strong, although not quite spectacular. The film's production design and attention to historical detail in recreating the crime and corruption present around organized criminal circles and then applying such ills within the context of modern American history at large is also extremely commendable.<br/><br/>With a thoughtful, elegiac retelling of parts of history combined with great acting, one may wonder why this movie has some notable lapses. Unfortunately, it's because of its rather excessive runtime. Scorsese's films have never been short, and a true fan of his work wouldn't want them to be too short anyway. But the film's plot does not quite stretch itself out enough to justify such a long rung time. The film drags in much of the second act, and while much of its third act is riveting, this finale could be paced better. In other words, the film could have been 2.5 hours (instead of 3.5 hours) without missing anything too important, much less liminal. As a result, I regrettably do not believe this film overall is quite able to touch the greatness of other Scorsese gangster films like ""Goodfellas."" I also thought that the film could have used a score, even if utilized in a very understated manner.<br/><br/>Recommended to Scorsese fans with patience. 7/10"

","What's special about 'The Irishman'? With its three and a half long playtime, this is certainly not just another Netflix flick. No, instead 'The Irishman' demands your attention from the second it starts till the second it ends. You'll find no hand holding or plot exposition here (other than the trademarked Scorsese VO of course), this is pure, unadulterated storytelling from the best in the business.<br/><br/>Thanks to the latest and greatest de-aging tech, we follow Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran as he begins his career for the Bufalino family. There he meets Russel Bufalino, played by Joe Pesci and things start to unravel.<br/><br/>While De Niro and Pesci never miss a beat, Al Pacino somehow manages to steal every scene he is in.

Amazing light is shed on Cuba and the role the mob had to play in FDK's election, and the forthcoming Bay of Pig's fiasco. Pacino does well in his role, and there are some smooth laughs. The middle hour of the movie flies by, you can't help but concentrate.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Scorsese tried to milk the family angle too much, as no real connection between father and daughter was ever established - you can't break what you don't have.<br/><br/>AND As per usual De Niro and Pacino REFUSE to act alongside each other if you watch - they only have scenes with a stunt double's back of the head when the other is talking. Look at Heat (1994), it is the exact same. They won't talk to each other, so why act together.<br/><br/>Overall enjoyable yet lengthy, worth a watch."

How they move, how they speak, how the face muscles move independdantly form each other and how ugly it looks. And the movie is boring.<br/><br/>But let me tell you this.

"CatDayAfternoon","5","4","14","3 December 2019"," You can be a Scorsese fan and still admit when he doesn't make a good film
","Too often we become fans of actors and directors and we let our bias cloud our judgment or we simply refuse to admit when our ""team"" isn't up to standards. I'm a Scorsese fan and this film is full of some of my favorite actors of all time. But I can admit that it's not a great film and in many ways it's actually a poor film.<br/><br/>A list of actors we are excited about seeing doesn't equal great film making. They keep it interesting and watchable by simply being present but even with a cast of Oscar winning giants, and a subject matter as interesting as Jimmy Hoffa, I kept dozing off trying to watch this and I saw it in a packed theater. And I'm not one to fall asleep in public.<br/><br/>Instead of trying to make the film one giant Lifetime Achievement Award party for every actor Scorsese has ever worked with, it would have been nice to see a little character development. There is none. Character after character is thrown into the story without proper introduction or any emotional connection. The pacing is brutally slow and the story meandering. There is no tension build up, no emotion, you don't really care who gets killed or who goes to prison. Because these are not characters you care about. Because we aren't given anything to make us care about them.<br/><br/>It seems once directors reach a certain point they start making self indulgent films that only they get. And their fans are so brainwashed they can't admit their hero has made a clunker. Well I can. Scorsese has made a clunker and it's being called a masterpiece because it's Scorsese and because there are so many well known actors involved.<br/><br/>And to add to everything he has used CGI to make them look younger and it's just distracting. Since when did Martin Scorsese go all Benjamin Buttons?<br/><br/>For the first time I found myself checking the time while watching a Scorsese film. He could have easily cut an hour out and nothing would have been missed. I would say skip the theater and just watch it on Netflix but I'm not sure it's possible to stay awake that way."
"wolfghostninja","4","4","14","3 December 2019"," The Emperor Has No Clothes.
","Scorcese rests on his laurels an he hands us an unimaginative cast, all of whom he has directed before in other iconic films. This trite cast, all of whom have played variations on the same characters on multiple films. The film is further hampered by a frankly excruciating runtime of voer 3 hours, and some poor use of computer graphics, which doesn't add anything to the overrall film only detract from it.<br/><br/>Truthfully speaking, De Niro, Pesci, and to an extent Pacino have all been typecast in the third acts of their careers. Essentialy they are playing variations of the same characters, albeit in different circumstances, that they have played in previous Scorcese or other mobster films.<br/><br/>Despite wasting Adam Driver in Silence, Scorcese needs to find and cast new talent not trot out the same old acts again and again. Boring, safe, and ultimately very disapoinnting."

I wasn't convinced he could stomp an aluminum can much less a full grown man. This movie was bad in the same way the Expendables was bad. Men much to old to be pulling off the events taking place in the movie. A group of old actors attempting to cash in on their names one more time for the genre they are known best for.

I've always been a fan of Scorsese's films since I saw 'Raging Bull' when I was in high school, then 'Goodfellas', and so on. This is one of his best, and definitely needs the addendum of it being one of his most subtle in style; it's not like a typical viewing of a Scorsese film, and it's almost like a delicate, yet thorough form of storytelling from a completely different approach of his most famous source material.

Nobody would begrudge Scorsese for slacking off after making so many great films in a stellar career spanning more than five decades now, but he still shows a dedication to his craft that puts every other director to shame. Imbued with Scorsese's characteristic narrative energy, this film chronicling the life of mob hitman Frank Sheeran and his relationship with union boss Jimmy Hoffa is an intimate yet epic slice of American history. As is common with many late works of the great masters, the film is tinged with an added dimension of pathos and resignation; in the words of the characters in the film - ""it is what it is"".

"frenchjuice","9","3","10","24 November 2019"," A Personalized Epic
","""I heard you paint houses...""<br/><br/>Before I sing the praise for this movie, let me begin with its flaws. The film can be confusing and if you are not familiar with Jimmy Hoffa and American gangster history. By trying to cover almost 50 years, the film sometimes skips historical details in favour of moving the story. The run time does feel excessive at times, with some of the scenes and ideas repeating constantly. There were times I wondered about how far along the movie was instead of being focused on the story.<br/><br/>Despite all this, I was never bored, and according to the laughter, neither were my theatre patrons.<br/><br/>One of the criticisms of Scorsese is that he often celebrates the exuberant lifestyle of criminals. Rather than admonishing the criminal lifestyle, he usually revels in the excess. The Irishman does not celebrate nor chastise. Instead, this movie is a sombre reflection of a man following a duty. Frank Sheeran, portrayed by Robert De Niro, is not your typical protagonist. He does not have a glaring character flaw, nor does he learn a big lesson at the end. His character felt more human; his lack of distinct character arc made him feel more human. As we do not have a character arc and when we do learn something about ourselves, it is often too late. It takes Frank 40 years to learn that he put his priorities in the wrong place, and his stubbornness at the end of his life made me wonder if he did learn anything from his life.<br/><br/>In the film, Scorsese forgoes flashy camera movement and cinematography, focusing more on the characters and their relationship. The camera often lingers on what feels unimportant, and you can see the characters ponder about their predicament. However, this does not mean that the film lacks camera work; there are impressive 1 minute long takes peppered throughout.<br/><br/>As always, the use of music was impressive. So many musical choices felt purposeful and did not distract from the visuals. After only watching the movie once, by listening to the soundtrack, I can picture the exact scenes in my mind. As well, this is the first time I thought that diegetic sound was used creatively in a non-comedic way. The use of silence was also masterful. Once again, it was not used excessively nor sparingly, and instead of trying to add suspense, it felt like the director was trying to convey what the character was thinking.<br/><br/>Finally, the acting. With the combined talent of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, it felt like all the acting in the world. Personally, whenever Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were in the same scene, I was excited. With Al Pacino's more boisterous performance with De Niro's nuanced reactions, they told a compelling story. Due to the length of the movie, we could see the natural shift in their relationship over the decades. Every character relationship felt natural and human. It did truly feel like they were improvising rather than reading from a script.<br/><br/>This film is an epic in the vein of Godfather and Goodfellas, but at the same time it feels more personal. It is a film I gave an 8/10 walking out of the theatre, but after thinking about the scenes and the message, I am inclined to give a 9/10. I love thinking about this movie, and when it comes out on Netflix, I cannot wait to see it again."

"sushant0406","7","3","10","9 November 2019"," Pacino-Pesci-Deniro-Scorsese: A 9 year long wait
","I remember that in 2010, when I heard that Martin Scorsese wanted to make a movie with Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, I immediately put this movie in my IMDB watch-list. Even when there were rumors of this film being shelved, I did not lose hope.
So, finally when I got to see the movie, at TIFF, last night, it was a dream come true.
Let's speak of the acting first. It was the best by an ensemble cast, in YEARS!
Robert DeNiro as Frank Sheeran was very good, especially towards the tail end after a surprising incident.
Joe Pesci was impressive in a an uncharacteristically calm mob boss Russell Buffalino. It was a treat to finally see him out of retirement.
And finally... AL PACINO.. stole the show, as Jimmy Hoffa. You have got to see it to believe it. His scene with Joe Pesci, was outstanding! Of all the movie so far, his in my personal opinion, is by far the best in the Supporting Actor category, and he deserves to take the Academy Award home.
Martin Scorsese's direction was trademark and simply brilliant. All the slayings in this movie, seemed like the real deal and managed to shock me every single time. And yes, there was a lot of that tongue in the cheek humor that we have come to expect from all of his movies.
The screenplay for the most part was taut.
The only drawback with this movie, in my view, is it's duration. Especially the last 30 minutes. The whole movie could have been reduced by at least 40 minutes.
Summary: This movie is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. You can watch it now in select theaters or wait till 27th November,2019, to watch it on Netflix. But, DO watch it."

"merylmatt","1","4","16","3 December 2019"," Mobster Mash
","This is one way to condense every single mobster movie since Godfather into one film. It's not a good way, perhaps a mini series would have been better. The pacing is so slow it is torture.<br/><br/>It feels like the writers were tired, the actors uninspired. I read Joe Pesci had to be begged out of retirement for this. Unfortunately for him, he did not say no one additional time. None of the stars here needed to make this film for the money, it seems like they all got together and said why not.<br/><br/>Just because you can do something (ie, de-age-ing) doesn't mean it's going to be good. Especially when the script is so cliched, tired, predictable. At least Joe Pesci's character did not yell.<br/><br/>When you feel like you've watched something that is six hours long (twice it's real length) that's not a good thing. Very glad I did not pay to see this."

"wgingery","6","4","16","29 November 2019"," Think it's long and uneventful? - that's the point!
","""The Irishman"" is about life, friendship and death.<br/><br/>Early on, speaking of his war experience, Frank (DeNiro) sums up for Russ (Pesci) the way he sees things, what the French call his 'philosophy of life.'<br/><br/>Russ: ""Were you afraid of dying?
Frank: ""Always afraid. Everybody's afraid. I prayed a lot. I prayed that I'd never sin again if could just get out of here. But the the fighting starts and you forget about everything. You're just trying to survive, stay alive. Whatever happens, happens. You just follow orders.""<br/><br/>For Frank, then, as presumably for Scorsese, life is mostly just trying to survive. It's just one damn thing after another. And you forget the spiritual.<br/><br/>This is what the movie tries to embody: a long sequence of 'whatever happens, happens.<br/><br/>What redeems life is friendship. In the same scene, Frank and Russ form a sacred bond - sacred because it is solemnized over bread and wine. Basically, the story of ""The Irishman"" is the story of their friendship, how it is formed, strengthened, and tested. More broadly, you could say that the subject of the film is men's friendships and falling outs, as experienced with Hoffa, 'Pro,' and the Kennedys.<br/><br/>Note that, in Scorsese's film, men's friendship stands as a bulwark against a threatening world, a shadowy background of uncontrollable necessity (here represented by the mob).<br/><br/>And then there is death.<br/><br/>""Maybe they thought that if they did a good job, the guy with the gun (Death) would change his mind.""<br/><br/>Scorsese seems to be saying that, no matter how well made your movies, you still end up in the same place.<br/><br/>Against this background, Scorsese plays with a number of metaphors. Life as a journey, a road trip. At the end, what? Thus the long introductory tracking shot suggesting confession and absolution, but also playing chess and putting together the pieces of a puzzle.<br/><br/>The film succeeds as an attempt to embody a mature view of life, But that is not enough. After so many scenes, the viewer asks himself, ""what was that about?"" old actors grotesquely unconvincing as young men; too many of those exchanges where one man drags another's feelings out of him; and not enough action scenes to balance them. Ultimately the viewer leaves with the prime question unanswered: ""What kind of man is Frank? What is his character? What drives him?"""
"tiberius387","3","4","16","28 November 2019"," Marty misses his usual mark?
","Just over 3 hours of run time! tbh could've been trimmed down to 2.5
with such a big well known cast the expectation was high...unfortunately it fell short of it's promise imo, it lacked the grip of story/action that is usual with a Scorsese/DeNiro flick, it felt long, plodding and yawnful for the most part and what little action there was seemed brief in comparison to previous works.
all in all the big catch was pulling Pesci back out of mothballs and uniting DeNiro/Pacino again, the acting was great from the main three as expected and the work on DeNiro through the decades was very well done (except the blue eyes), but in general i felt let down and disappointed, just glad i watched on Netflix rather than at the cinema."

"MovieCriticOnline","3","5","22","29 November 2019"," Unfortunately this has already been made several time..
","By Scorsese himself when they were called Goodfellas and Casino. There was NO reason to make this other than to satisfy perhaps their own self-indulgent nostalgia, which I assume includes some fans, but if you really wanna watch this type of movie, go watch the far superior originals, especially Goodfellas.<br/><br/>De Niro was a bore. Way too passive. Too much details about things that didn't matter. In Godfather they balanced the little details such as how to cook the food with the story, never to extend such details. For example the daughter/father relationship appeared throughout without any really significant meaning. I think his daughter said one word, literally ONE WORD in the entire film. Was she a mute? It may have been more effective if they had focussed the film on that, rather than the conspiratorial aspect of the Hoffa killing, which was stretched out for like an hour of pointless meandering.<br/><br/>Let's be real. Casino was Goodfellas in Vegas. And Irishman was a personal vanity project for De Niro and Martin to work together again.<br/><br/>I had a feeling it was gonna be the same as Goodfellas. This is The Godfather III to Godfather I & II.<br/><br/>All the same stereotypical Italians we've seen in every mob movie around., where they play caricatures, rather than real life beings.<br/><br/>Also, a lot of the acting seemed to have been phoned in. Pesci was good. And like others said, it was boring. Holy mother, it took forever to get to any point.<br/><br/>Disregard all the rave reviews. That is just a sign of how many mediocre films are out and how people are starving for anything above bad."

A gangster movie should ALWAYS be the complete opposite of BORING.<br/><br/>Because director Scorsese as well as de Niro and Pacino have made such brilliant classics in the past, I simply wont settle for a boring movie like this one. I demand / desire EXCELLENCE! But ALL I got was boring.<br/><br/>Beware: this movie is hyped artificially on Imdb (watch out for the 10 star reviews). Never mind the fake reviews though, because my biggest disappointment is the fact that I suddenly realised that Netflix is now dictating the director on how long any movie should last. That's one of the reasons why this movie is so BORING. 3 hours and 29 minutes. What were they thinking? A director, and no one else, should decide how long/short a movie should last. Not a stock market company like Netflix, who has a certain timeslot of 3 hours and 29 minutes to fill up with CONTENT. BORING content...<br/><br/>Opening scene of this movie: a long walk through a home for the elderly. That says it all. This movie hasnt got a beating heart. Every gangster looks old and tired in this movie. The special effects to make de Niro look younger are not natural looking and kind of silly.<br/><br/>My hopes were really high for this movie.

He moves like a old man. So now I'm watching a film thinking why is this young guy moving like a old man. Did he get hurt?

Today the younger generation may not know who Hoffa was but, back in the day he was a well known, respected man. I'm not sure he deserved the respect I just know my Dad was a teamster and they stood tight together. I learned a lot from the movie and have to say, I do believe the story they filled in; It all makes sense.I live in Michigan and the Hoffa story comes up too much. Someone will make a false claim and the government goes and digs up someone's property to find nothing. What would make them think there is a body to find? Whomever did it is far too smart not to make sure it was never found. People tend to think that Union workers retire with a big fat pension and it's not true. They back out the social security they receive so they don't get all the pension they should have. That's because of misuse of the Pension funds as you will see in the movie.

Instead it was a three and half hour slog going over familiar ground covered much better in ""Goodfellas,"" and ""Casino."" Repetitive scenes with actors twenty years too old (even after CGI enhancement) playing morally reprehensible and fundamentally UNINTERESTING characters who never made the right choice was a numbing and desultory experience."
"thompson12001","5","3","11","29 November 2019"," Scorsese given too much artistic control from Netflix
","There were a lot of problems with this film but I'll list what stood out to me 2 weeks later: the facial anti aging CGI was a disaster, no one looked under 50. The editing was poor in the 2nd half and/or non existent. There was no score, only a soundtrack. Anytime Deniro sat down or stood up it was pained and he looked 80. The relationship building between Deniro and Pesci's characters and Deniro and Pacino was horribly executed all the while they're supposed to be these close friends. The pacing was horrendous. There was no point to Paquin's role as the moral daughter since Deniro's character didn't care, 10 minutes could've been cut out of the movie without her. The Anastasia murder could've used some pre exposition, no one under 70 was alive for that event and had no idea that this was such a significant hit. And to further my last point it's hard to relate to Hoffa's time for people not alive during the era. I'm 40 and still am not sure what a teamster is. Other films do a much better job of educating the audience to historical figures they aren't necessarily familiar with, especially with 3.5 hours to work with.<br/><br/>What makes this all the more disappointing is that Mr. Scorsese just wrote a beautiful piece on the decline of film as an art medium due to big corps controlling most of the content. His argument is compromised now after putting out such a slow and bad film. Show the Irishman to a 20 y/o and I can assure you they'll be begging for a comic book movie afterwards.<br/><br/>All masters of their profession eventually lose their touch as Father Time always wins and unfortunately I believe the time has come for Mr. Scorsese as he is showing his age in this film through the slow pacing, insistence to use his aged, trusted muses (Deniro and Pesci) instead of younger actors and his over indulgence in what made his movies great to begin with. It's almost as if Mr. Scorsese knows this is his last film and he said to hell with the editing room and common sense, he was going to ride into the sunset making the film he's always wanted. It's exactly what he did and unfortunately it's a ride I regret taking."

","A self-congratulatory film by Martin Scorsese which attempts to rekindle memories of his mob masterpiece, Goodfellas. This 3-1/2 hour cinematic dirge is largely cast with those who hold both SAG and AARP cards; while these 70-plus year old leads are digitally ""de-aged"" in flashback scenes, their physical coordination and general demeanor make the action feel staged and unbelievable. Worse yet, the non-action drama is typically filled with old men kvetching (whining, grumbling and complaining for those who don't know a few words of Yiddish)."

There is not one scene or twist in the whole movie that remains in the head, not really to bothered its very long , had nothing better to do on a wet Monday afternoon. Film of the year not a chance ( joker ) Oscars ? Sentimentally yea but one for the boys retirement pot.

They become good friends - but as years go by he is asked by his Mafia boss to assassinate Hoffa. The later half of the film deals with the repercussions of the events surrounding the death of Hoffa. The choices we make in life that can destroy our soul - and hopefully God forgives us in the end."

","Its another Godfather type movie from Scorsese. And all his buddies are in it. DeNiro is his usually self acting like DeNiro. Sorry I do not think he is a great actor he just plays the same character over and over again. Pacino loves to yell so he was good playing Jimmy Hoffa. But of all the actors Joe Pesci should have won the Oscar for best actor. He was superb!! Overall the story was good, but way too long. Of course history was re-written in the movie at various parts to make it more interesting to viewers. Added violence always helps. I did speed up some parts because I really could not believe DeNiro as an Irishman even with Blue contact lenses. But its Scorsese's movie so he chose the cast. If they cut an hour out of the movie it would have helped. Better yet, if they got more youthful actors rather than 3 aging 70+ year olds to play the part of the people in the movie who were actually suppose to look like they were in their 30 and 40s that would have helped a great deal more and saved a ton of money on make-up."

","I like Martin Scorsese but this felt like a boring history lesson and I love history. The acting was fine, these guys know how to act like mob guys but it was just a drag for the most part. It's a 3.5 hour movie that felt like five. Some of the de-aging thing killed it as well. Robert Deniro can't look young no matter what you do. There was one scene where he's supposed to be young and beating up someone but he was physically so stiff and could hardly move his arms. It's hard to take someone serious as a bruiser when they have crazy arthritis."
"tashlast","5","2","6","19 March 2020"," Pretty weak...ESPECIALLY for someone as great as Martin Scorsese
","Look, I adore Martin Scorsese's movies as much as the next guy. I mean, how could you forget some of his brilliant films like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and The Wolf of Wall Street ? Credited as some of the greatest of all time and some of my personal favorites. However, I was not impressed by this movie. And quite frankly, I haven't been impressed with Scorcese for a while now.<br/><br/>Those are words I never expected to come out of my mouth, but they did.<br/><br/>So where do we start? Honestly, as far as movies go in general I don't have problems with long movies. Hell, I've probably sat through longer. But for a movie that is almost 4 hours long, this movie in truth should be more like 2 hours long because it kept dragging at the start and towards it end. The movie had some good parts in the middle, but that's it. Only a few good parts and the rest was lacking. The plot was getting over repetitive. And it just became boring to watch. Some scenes were actually laughable to watch.<br/><br/>This movie feels like a remake of Goodfellas with Jimmy Hoffa. Don't get me wrong, Scorcese SHINES in the mobster genre, and it's why this very movie feels like a copy of his previous movies with new characters thrown into the bunch. Bringing back De Niro, Pachino, and Pesci is endearing, cause this feels like a safe guard for them since those kinda gritty roles gangster roles are what they're best at. The whole time watching I didn't feel like I saw anything new, being that you could predict the end within an hour. Scorcese is sticking to his roots, what can I say. He's bringing back his acting darlings. A few good scenes here and there, but nothing really changed for me. I think the last Scorcese movie I was impressed with was The Wolf of Wall Street, and it was because Scorcese showed me he can shine in non mobster films, and it was refreshing to watch.<br/><br/>I have a mixed reception with de-aging actors in film. If you take a 40 year old actor and are trying to make them look about 3-5 years younger, it works fine because the change isn't as noticeable. However, if you are taking a 50-60 something year old actor and trying to make them look about 20+ years younger, you've kinda ruined the realism you were trying to create. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are outstanding actors and I'm not denying any of their acting talent in the slightest. But I feel like they were physically done dirty in terms of the VFX that was done to their faces. Seriously. Is it too hard to find younger screen understudies for Pacino and De Niro? That was the most unnecessary aspect of the movie. Also, there was this one scene in where De Niro is kicking a man out of a store, and it was so awkwardly shot and acted in that one scene, that I laughed.<br/><br/>While in truth this movie could be classified as great, I find it pretty weak for a Scorsese film. Very forgettable. I don't think I'll watch this specific movie for a while. Not worth the almost 4 hours. I appreciate the work, but I'll take that pass.<br/><br/>Final score- 5.1/10"
"kosmasp","10","2","6","15 March 2020"," Not a theme park ride
","You may or may not be aware of what Scorsese has said. And you may or may not agree with what he is saying (let's not forget he made this movie for Netflix, but then again I reckon he would argue, he wanted to get it made and they promised to show it in theatres too). If you like his overall output though, I do hope you can watch this without judgement.<br/><br/>I am a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but I can also appreciate a movie like the Irishman. Seeing Pacino and De Niro together is a treat. But one of the underappreciated performances in this one is Joe Pesci! Especially if you watch Goodfellas and this back to back, which I sort of did (the former at home and Irishman in the cinema).<br/><br/>The runtime never was an issue, even if I was vary beforehand, I never felt it. Yes you can tell it's a long movie, but it never gets ""boring"". Though to be fair, some have a different threshold concerning their attention span.

Like for example The Godfather. Having that as the main criticism of the movie and not anything else shows how good it is and how restless people are today. The movie includes the greatest mob actors alive with one of the greatest ever directors doing what they know best. It's got all the necessary parts for an amazing classic and uses modern technology to do something that wasn't possible before. One of the best movies during the decade and possibly ever. Only thing I'm missing would have been Marlon Brando"
"pfgpowell-1","5","2","6","8 February 2020"," Tinseltown old timers try it one last time (and really should not have bothered)
","Hollywood thrives on cliches: in many ways they are its lifeblood. But the Tinseltown moguls shouldn't be castigated. The moviegoer thrives on cliches, too, and if a mogul is criticised for serving up at the umpteenth time cliche 123/A he or she is perfectly entitled to the defence that 'that's what the punter wants'. They want predictable, they want to see the same storyline over and over again. Give them something halfway original (as in all that dubious European art stuff) and many just run scared: they want to see the world on the edge of destruction saved by the love of a good woman for a man who only had to find that brave core he didn't know was there. Or something.<br/><br/>Cliches are great both for directors and writers and for moviegoers. Cliches mean that neither has to think at all, just fill in the boxes and trace the story from A to Z. They are not required to,use their nut a little. To be fair, if the wind were to blow in the opposite direction and the moviegoing public suddenly decided it won't settle for anything else but pure originality, there is enough talent in Hollywood which could supply that demand. Back in the real world, however, the growth of a demand for originality is as likely as Britain's queen ditching Phil the Greek and marrying Pope Francis. So cliches rule.<br/><br/>I happen not to like cliches. After a lifetime working in newspapers I have had it to here with them. At first they amuse, then they amuse because their use is so predictable. Finally, they irritate as little can irritate.<br/><br/>One Hollywood cliche I spotted years ago and is about as entertaining as a day in the rain without a coat is the 'old timers (whether soldiers, football players, mercenaries, a band or what the hell you like) are summoned to come together for one last time and prove they can still cut it'. And of course they always do. 'There's life in the old dogs yet' is the message. and ageing, geriatric moviegoers leave the cinema relieved that they aren't quite you dead (which, of course, they are, but sshh...)<br/><br/>Invariably the old timers in the 'old timers' film are all themselves old timer actors whose day came and went quite long ago, but who, like the characters they portray on screen, want to prove to the up-and-coming young turks that they can still cut it, boy, we're still around. Well, of course, they aren't. Such films are - for me at least - and embarrassment like watching your grandad on the dancefloor who has no idea how bloody ridiculous he looks.<br/><br/>The film that always comes to mind when I think of the 'old timers' cliche is The Wild Geese: old timers Richard Burton, Roger Moore, Richard Harris, Hardy KrÃ¼ger and Stewart Grainger strut their stuff as mercenaries called out of retirement to make more money for the Hollywood moguls.<br/><br/>It was the old timers cliche which very soon came to mind when I say The Irishman. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and, sad but true, the director Martin Scorsese go through the motions of strutting their stuff and are as convincing as a cheap Walmart toupee.<br/><br/>All five do their stuff, the stuff we once loved when it was fresh and new, but which is no longer fresh and new, not by a million miles. And it certainly doesn't help that all of them, Pesci, De Niro, Pacino and Keitel look way over 70, even when they are supposed to be young thugs on the make - the digital whatever just doesn't work.<br/><br/>In many ways the worst offender is Scorsese in that he is an intelligent filmmaker who should have known better. But he didn't and he pretty much serves up a parody of a Scorsese film: if you've seen Goodfellas and Casino, you've seen The Irishman.<br/><br/>The 'trademark' tracking shots, the convoluted storyline, the freeze-frame to give a brief biographical outline of a newly introduced character, the 'cool' violence, the voiceover - it's all there and it's all a bit sad in that what was once exciting is now terrible old hat.<br/><br/>You might be part of the 90pc who like cliches served up lukewarm, who will applaud a faded nightclub singer warbling off-key because you are nostalgic and you like his hits when you were younger. That's not me. With all respect to Mr Scorsese, he really should have left well alone."

Leaving the door half open at the end explains everything - Jimmy would leave his bedroom door open because he trusted Frank. This door represents trust that must never be broken. (Don't worry, it's not a spoiler.)

"wilkinsonr-11854","2","2","6","28 January 2020"," Why, Scorsese?
","I'd like to know Scorsese's reasoning for making this film, but I think I already know the answer. Nostalgia can be a nice thing. But this feels like a depressing attempt at ""getting the band back together"" when the members are old and stale. Not to mention a plot that hasn't been new for 30 years at LEAST.<br/><br/>De Niro might be de-aged for the majority, but his bent posture says otherwise. Why not allow the cast to portray characters of their own age? To say the CGI is unconvincing here would be an understatement. I don't know how they dragged poor Pesci into this, but even as a supporting character he pulls his weight. Pacino might be overdoing it, but perhaps that was an attempt to fill in the blanks of De Niro's performance.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see Scorsese leave some much-loved ingredients out here. Where was the clever dialogue, the tension, the drama, the skillfull camera-work? Were any of the characters written with emotion in mind, because I don't recall seeing any of them express it.<br/><br/>Forgetting about the plot (there's not much to mention, anyway) if this had been a film centred around the characters at their true, older age, it may have made more sense. Perhaps it would have symbolised the end of an era for Scorsese, or reflected his own aging process. If nothing else, it would have worked far better than having a 76 year play someone in their ""prime"". It may have even been a good movie.<br/><br/>Hopefully we see something better from Scorsese in the future and can forget any of this ever happened."

The Irishman is filled with stellar accomplishments of the arts encompassed in film: actor, cinematography, production design, everything is working at a very high level.
But, it's not an action film, it's not a thrill ride pace in the way that some Scorsese films are. It is the work of long time masters, and may not be your bag if you prefer faster kicks. But, to try and deny this film it's artistic due, because it is not to your tastes is...hilarious to me."

","In an average gangsters movie, one tends to focus on the body count and on the many ways criminals can inflict suffering to each other and people at large.<br/><br/>In this one, we follow the reminiscences of geriatric Irish gangster Frank Sheeran. While rotting away alone in a retirement home, Frank thinks about the good old days of his ascent in the mob and especially, his friendship with Hoffa.<br/><br/>Light is shed on Kennedy's assassination (yet again) and on Hoffa ""disappearance"", even if at this stage few would remember who he was. Sheeran is depicted as a slightly psychopathic killer who somehow managed to save his skin, despite many tricky situations..<br/><br/>Being busy killing people here and there and bodyguarding Hoffa, meant that Frank neglected his family, hence the solitary ending, despite having a few daughters.<br/><br/>De Niro as Frank, Pacino as Hoffa and Joe Pesci as gangster Bufalino do a good job, as it should be expected. Much has been written about their computer generated ""rejuvenation"". I found it distracting, because their younger versions do not look like them as young people. Think about De Niro in Taxi Driver and it is definitely NOT who you will see in the early sequences of this movie, but a younger version of what De Niro looks like now. Very, very weird.<br/><br/>Finally, even knowing that Sheeran was a criminal does nothing to decrease the gloom and sadness of seeing this decrepit man, all alone on a wheelchair, wasting away, forgotten but not forgiven. If ever there was a reminder that crime does not pay, especially if you live too long, this is it. But it does not make for enjoyable entertainment."

Overall there is an immense amount you could take away from this movie. It's a period piece with a touch of emotion here and there, albeit in the flavour of the gruff masculinity of mob men. It has a softer side, and deals with the concepts of getting old, and specifically how this disarms mean, bad, and violent men. It does drag quite a bit, especially in the beginning. I will say this part is necessary to get you accustomed to the characters, but I may just be waning as far as interest in New York / Las Vegas / New Jersey / Philadelphia mobster movies nowadays.

No tiene la película, en ningún momento un aire de buen cine, mas bien de televisión. No consigue mantener el nivel de atención, y es que mantener la atención durante tanto tiempo es muy difícil. No conozco a nadie que la haya visto sin pararla.<br/><br/>Los actores estan muy bien, es de esperar, son magistrales, pero se nota mucho el acartona-miento de los efectos en sus caras. Les quita naturalidad y realidad.<br/><br/>Para mi gusto, como le pasa muchas veces, no sabe terminar la película. No solo es larga, si no que le sobra al final unos minutos. No hacen falta los últimos planos, la película ya ha terminado con la llamada.<br/><br/>La fotografía, que era una de las cosas que mejor tenían sus películas, esta vez, le da un aire de televisión increíble. Solo las secuencias de restaurantes tiene una fotografía espectacular. El resto no es cine.<br/><br/>El vestuario, el maquillaje, estan muy bien. Normalmente esta es una faceta que la hacen siempre maravillosa.
Pero su trabajo de dirigir, pues como siempre, no me gusta. Le encanta hacer planos secuencia, siempre sin justificar y que no estan bien hechos. ¿desde que la vi, me estoy preguntando a quien le cuenta la película? En el primer plano de la película, muestra a De Niro solo en una silla, pero la cámara gira y empieza a contar la historia. Pero esta solo. Consigue dejar demasiados bajones en la película. No sigue el ritmo. Va cambiando el protagonista y eso tampoco ayuda. La cámara, como siempre la usa mal, no la sabe colocar, o hace planos simples.<br/><br/>Bueno es una vuelta un poco escasa"

Charting the rise of this lowly truck driver to union rep, Robert DeNiro is at his taciturn best only conveying information either directly to us or via voice over. Joe Pesci is also top notch as he plays the antithesis of his prior Scorsese collabs, all sotto voce & steely fortitude as he speaks only when he needs to.

Certain internet posts have come down on Anna Paquin, who plays DeNiro's eldest daughter, who has a smidgen of dialogue & conveys her performance through furtive looks & glances as being an underwritten part but seeing she's the conscience her father lacks (at no point do we see him have any remorse or regret for any & all crimes he's committed) that when the eventual reproachment arrives, we're not surprised we've gotten here. Special mention must be given to the extensive use of CG de-aging (the film takes place over a span of decades) which surprisingly was done w/an intricate camera system devised by ILM which can show the youthful fruits of their labor almost instantaneously. Co-starring other Scorsese heavy hitters like Harvey Keitel, Gary Basaraba & Welker White (she played the mouthy babysitter in Goodfellas) w/welcome adds like Bobby Cannavale, Ray Romano, Jesse Plemons, Stephen Graham, Domenick Lombardozzi & Katherine Narducci (who played DeNiro's wife in A Bronx Tale)."

"classicsoncall","8","2","6","31 December 2019"," ""But nobody threatens Hoffa!""
","The reality of the film's luster is beginning to settle in I think. When it first came out, I believe it was tracking in the mid 130's on the IMDb Top 250, and has now settled into the #208 position as I write this. It will most likely drop out of the Top 250 at some point in 2020. That's not to say it isn't a good film. It is, but doesn't merit the hype surrounding it as potentially the best picture of the year. It certainly doesn't surpass director Scorsese's prior gangster epics, 1990's ""Goodfellas"" or 2006's ""The Departed"". The movie is based on the book by a former alleged Mafia hitman titled ""I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran and Closing the Case on Jimmy Hoffa"". The painting houses reference can be considered mob code parlance for 'I heard you kill people', which is what brought Sheeran to the attention of crime boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). The book's validity has been questioned, thus putting the film's narrative into the same scope of reimagining as this year's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"", Quentin Tarantino's take on the Charles Manson family's murder rampage in Los Angeles in 1969.<br/><br/>I've read some disparaging accounts of the de-aging process used in the film to make Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci look younger. If one is intent on finding fault, I guess you could, but I thought the effect for all three was remarkably well done. It goes the other way too when the actors are made to look much older, especially with Pesci. Considering the type of film this is, I was taken aback a bit by the seemingly lack of vulgarity in the dialog among the mobsters as they conducted day to day business. There is some, but considering Pesci's use of the 'f' word in other films while raising it's use to an art form, the tone of the language in the picture is surprisingly kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>The story of Hoffa and the unions is presented in context with the political climate of the eras in which the story takes place, with particular emphasis on the short presidency of John F. Kennedy. The seminal events of that period are all given sway, with mentions of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and of course, Kennedy's assassination. The enmity that developed against the Kennedy's after the mob's help in getting JFK elected is touched upon, with references to Chicago gangland boss Sam Giancana. Knowing a bit of history about the Mafia and it's tentacles into the government would be of help in understanding some of the scenarios presented in the story.<br/><br/>There are some interesting cameos in the picture, most notably by Harvey Keitel as gangster Angelo Bruno, and Steve Van Zandt as lounge singer Jerry Vale. Ray Romano has a somewhat larger role as mob lawyer Bill Bufalino, and it's a treat seeing him in a non-comedic role as he was quite effective. When things get down to the wire regarding Jimmy Hoffa's (Pacino) intention to muscle his way back into the Teamsters presidency, one has to read between the lines of the various mob figures who decide that Hoffa's time has passed and the need to move on becomes apparent. That is, until the picture's single most shocking twist moment occurs with Frank Sheeran's (De Niro) loyalty to Russell Bufalino going unquestioned.<br/><br/>Overall, a good film, and I'm sure it will garner it's share of award nominations, but you should probably temper expectations against the media hype. Fans of the principals might find it better than those who are not, which also can be said for director Scorsese. In any event, check it out and decide for yourself. The Netflix option gives one the opportunity to take a mid-film break, as the length of the picture might leave you feeling antsy with some of the slower exposition."

"desmondchan-02178","8","2","6","22 December 2019"," A true visionary
","When director Martin Scorsese controversially remarked that Marvel franchise films are not 'art forms', he lamented how the unifying vision of the artist and the desire to take cinematic risks was at stake from the onslaught of films manufactured for immediate consumption. The Irishman thrives because of Scorsese's uncompromising vision for the mob genre, where he insists on challenging the viewers' depth of empathy with a deeply flawed protagonist who wields violence to survive in a world corrupted by avarice and power. The ambitious epic that chronicles the rise and fall of mafia hitman Frank Sheeran and his ties with the Bufalino family and union leader Jimmy Hoffa is, however, too sprawling for a deeper rumination on how much agency we have over crimes and the construct of sin. In less capable hands, the strands would have fallen apart, but Scorsese's fearless dedication to his craft runs throughout the film. His astute casting reunites long-time collaborators like the understated Joe Pesci, the austere Robert De Niro and new addition Al Pacino, who burns the screen with maniacal energy. It is classic Scorsese as he whips out all his sleight of hand manoeurvres that define his artistry in Goodfellas and Casino - voice-over narration to get into the character's head, diegetic sounds and montages to weave in political events like the Bay of Pigs invasion and the assassination of JFK to establish a keen sense of the time period, and quick sweeps to enhance the adrenaline in violent scenes. Whether it is the use of de-aging technology or recreating Old World charm, the attention to detail is scrupulous. Although three and a half hours may seem over-indulgent, every single shot is sharply calibrated - from the first scenes of ""painting houses"" to the elegiac ending scene of the frail wheelchair-bound Sheeran waiting stoically for his time to come. Scorsese has hinted that this is his swan song. If it's true, It is a huge loss - especially with the greatness we have seen from this true visionary."

","A melodramatic, Somber and last of its kind tale about the mafia. Unlike other brilliant Mafia/mob films that Scorcesse has made, this was different, instead of showing you the glamorous side of Mobsters, shows you a heartbreaking story about what that lifestyle leads to. With The master behind the camera and talents like De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci blessing the screen, I don't even need to comment on the performance and directing, it's all brilliant.
In the end a man sits in the end, alone, no one by his side during his final days, Thinking about what he did wrong, while Still of the Night plays in the background. Scorsese's presumably last mob film ends in a poetic and sentimental manner and I wouldn't want it in any other manner"

"shaunchatrathfancontact","10","2","6","15 December 2019"," A Moden Masterpiece
","Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is a masterpiece that best epitomizes the monster film genre that was revitalized by Hollywood New Wave filmmakers throughout the 1970s-90s. Films such as The Godfather, A Bronx Tale, Scarface, Goodfellas, Bonnie and Clyde, Mean Streets, etc. At its heart, The Irishman is a story about the long term effects of being involved in the world those films listed above portray. Instead of cutting on a Henry Hill character smiling at the camera and proceeding to title cards revealing the fate of our characters. The Irishman is structured around those end title cards. Even at times having text appear next to random mobsters stating their eventual demise, which is genius by the way. By doing this, The Irishman is saying there's an alternative route to life, where gratitude and a sense of completion awaits, that can be taken in contrast to short term pleasure. It's this thematic nuance that makes films such as Citizen Kane and Once Upon A Time In America so revered. In essence, The Irishman is the film The Godfather Part III wanted to be. The Irishman is the perfect curtain call for a type of mobster film that helped reshape cinema in the late 20th century. While they'll be similar films made genre wise. I think the next generation of filmmakers, including myself, should encourage the making of films that deconstructing current activities which resemble or are a direct result of mob idealism. Corporate, Political, and Infrastructure. All while paying homage to the mobster pictures that came before."

There wasnt much action or 'edge of your seat' moments throughout the film. The storyline dragged and didnt excite at all.

","Eventhough I almost dozed off watching the entire movie, there have been many scenes which were quite amazing in terms of cinematography and direction. The way Scorsese managed to keep me curious till the end, makes it wonderful during a time like this to pull off such a movie. Will have to give it to the cast, especially Al Pacino and De Niro. Classy actors. They know what they need to do and how. The chemistry between the actors and Scorsese was somehow shown through this movie and I think it was change to watch a movie that shows an entire lifetime of a man, who in a way lives out his life and at the end of it all, gets a date for his outcomes. You can't help but feel for De Niro, who tried till the end to be whole with who he was and somehow, also feel how he failed due to who he was. In a way, you realise that what you've done is done, and you can't alter it but rather pray. That you'll get love from somewhere in the end, even if you're all alone. Eventhough the movie did drag a bit, the essence of the movie was not altered, which is something I respect. People want things to get over soon and not absorb the message of a movie's entirety. But with The Irishman, you don't miss out the message that Scorsese tried to achieve. And it was well directed. And well put. So I'd say, it was one of a kind. Sure did transport me back to when I watched Godfather, but it lacked a bit of action. Even if it was subtle, the politics bored me. But all in all, it was okay. Worth a watch."

"jamesrupert2014","8","2","6","7 December 2019"," Lengthy but well-made mob-biopic
","Epic wiseguy drama from director Martin Scorsese follows Irish teamster and hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) from his introduction to mob boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci,) to his waning days in a nursing home, including the years he worked with legendary Teamster Union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The film is layed out in a multi-layered flashback format, with the story being told by an elderly, wheel-chair bound Sheeran reminiscing in a nursing home in the early 2000s, and 'flash-backed' by a middle-aged Sheenan on the road to a meeting in Detroit with Bufalino and their wives in 1975. The 'reverse aging' is pretty good although De Nero looks more than 30 years old when he first hooks up with the mob in 1950. Peschi is unusually understated and quite good as Bufalino, and DeNiro is fine playing his standard mobbed-up tough guy role, but Pacino is a bit over-the-top as a gripey Hoffa and seems to deliver most of his lines at least twice (perhaps the intent was to make Hoffa an irritating guy). Scorsese perennial Harvey Keitel shows up as ill-fated Philly boss Angelo Bruno and the rest of the cast, especially those playing Sheeran's family, are quite good. The story is interesting and the script, while typical of the genre (lots of swearing and tough-guy posturing), is fine. The film does a nice job evoking the decades over which it takes place, both in visual cues and by Scorsese's trademark pop-music soundtrack, and overall, makes for a entertaining mob-based history lesson. The 209 minute run-time seems a bit long for the story and there are a number of scenes that could have been shortened or deleted (IMO, but I may have missed their significance). One contrast to most of Scorsese's films (and the genre in general): the story of 'The Irishman' plays through to the very end, with top mob-bosses finally side-lined, and ultimately 'whacked', by infirmity and old age. There's a great scene towards the end of the film in which an exasperated FBI agent tries to convince the elderly Sheeran 'to talk' by pointing out that there is no one left to protect."

When I heard Scorsese was revisiting the gangster genre, I did wonder, ""Again? What else is there to say?"" Good news: there was, in fact, more to say. This movie is less about the rush of rising in the ranks and more about the utter isolation that is left when it is over. While I found some of the ""de-aging"" effects distracting, every single performance was masterful, and this movie is a perfect epilogue to previous gangster stories. When the lights fade and the violence stops, we are all left to reconcile - with ourselves, with our families, with our morality. What this film lacked in epic tracking shots or peak moments, it made up for with new perspectives on old stories."

In particular he realizes and presents real life mobsters, while bringing out their nuances which few gangster films, if any, try to realize and successfully show on film! This includes the brilliant, as in New York/New Jersey speak and intellect, pitch perfect. Violence serves solely as punctuation, dialogue all-important, and the best-defined gangsters we have ever seen. Based on real life gangsters, arguably questionable confession, and what should be admittedly and pathetic inaccurate portrayal of prison life, Martin Scorsese brings us out of Coppola's gangster heyday to the elderly demise of that culture and characters."

","I could spend a few paragraphs waxing poetic about the merits of the film, about the story of Hoffa, but you can read all that in some of these other flowery reviews by paid shills and perhaps by folks who long to be paid shills.<br/><br/>They couldn't get DeNiro and Pacino together for anything great outside of Heat, but here they are jammed into this mess of a film. Pesci is his normal great self, and he and Al carried the film. Robert needs to be put out to pasture. He played Robert DeNiro playing Robert DeNiro. If you've seen him in just about anything else, you've seen him here. No emotional range, maybe I assumed some feelings at times when he was feeling some remorse about his role, but he's basically a stuttering guy in the film like in real life, and repeats himself just like then. Someone doing a DeNiro impression would be able to do the same role.<br/><br/>The story feels like an epic.. but it's not really interesting. Sure these guys were very powerful in their day, and they died old men in nursing homes if they weren't shot in the face by the others. A lot of code, innuendo and assumptions were made and the audience was left to guess what they were talking about. It's as if you weren't a made guy so you weren't in on it.<br/><br/>It really felt a bit like Ocean's 11, with the inside jokes between actors who knew each other, cared for each other but didn't care at all about the audience. I was the 3rd wheel in this reunion flick. I just wish they picked a better subject, maybe fiction.. something that allowed Robert DeNiro to be himself instead of that stupid CGI red face offering they did where Robert looked older than Pesci even though Pesci was calling him ""kid"". I couldn't suspend disbelief enough to get around that crazy antic, and the fact the director allowed it just shows that they know the audience will buy anything with that cast.<br/><br/>Other than Bob's part, the casting was great. What a line up, 10 years ago this would have been impossible due to the fee each of these actors would command. You have 3 or 4 leading actors playing support roles. I guess when you have DeNiro and Pacino as the main characters, you don't complain about your part and likely many actors jumped at the chance to be in the film. Still, it was too long and I didn't come away feeling anything other than tired for watching it. I didn't care about Bob's character, or Hoffa, or anyone else.. even Sookie Stackhouse and the guy who imprisoned Jessie Pinkman."

"MovieBuff11732","9","2","6","30 November 2019"," Best Crime Drama Of The Year!
","The Irishman is about Frank Sheeran meeting Jimmy Hoffa. Jimmy Hoffa likes him so much he doesn't go anywhere without him. The only problem about that is he gets wrapped up in all of his business.<br/><br/>The Irishman is truly a work of art. One of the best films of the year by far. Loved every minute of it. There was only a little bit of it where I thought it was slow. That had to deal with the runtime. You thought The Godfather was long, well guess what, this film is forty minutes longer. It is crazy. In my mind they just needed to shave off twenty minutes. That is it! Besides that, I loved it. The acting was fantastic. This might be one of the best casts ever. My favorite out of all of them is Joe Pesci. First of all, I thought it was cool to see him back in the game. Second of all, he just nailed his role. He was fantastic as Russell. Robert De Niro also executed his role to his full potential. I think he should get nominated for an Oscar for best actor in lead role. Al Pacino didn't do bad, but he has had better. The cinematography couldn't go without talking about too. It was really good. It reminded me of Orson Wells style that he used in Citizen Kane. The story was also really engrossing. I never found my mind drifting away. I really enjoyed the classical score that they had playing throughout the film too. Another thing they did great, is the CGI. They had to use it throughout the film for many reasons. The big thing was de-aging people. That is one of the hardest things to do with CGI. I could only find one or two shots that didn't line up. Besides that, it was flawless. CGI was also used for most of the blood. I am not the biggest fan of CGI blood because it looks so fake and cheesy. I didn't think it was as bad as Jurassic World, but it still wasn't the best. One scene Martin Scorsese decided to use blood packets instead of CGI. It was obvious when he did, but I found it pretty cool.<br/><br/>Overall, The Irishman is an outstanding film I would recommend for anybody."
"bob-larrance","7","2","6","30 November 2019"," Good not great, doesn't live up to the hype, but see it anyway.
","My one-sentence, bottom-line, conditional recommendation: The Irishman is worth watching, good but not great, and fails to live up to all the marketing hype. Plan on two sittings, since it is rather long. Fortunately, at home one can insert a pleasant intermission.<br/><br/>Long before the Irishman was released it was announced that high tech would be used to shave many years from the physical appearances of the lead actors, so that the gentlemen concerned would appear much younger, looking like the correct ages for the roles. The results of the efforts are mixed. Deniro and Pacino, for the most part, look younger, though in many scenes they still appear too old in the context of particular moments in the narrative. The high tech fix for Pesci doesn't seem to work, at all.<br/><br/>It is clear to me, from following the marketing for the project, that the appearance of the aging stars was an issue to the producers. The fix, for the rather expensive project, was to alter the looks of the stars with technology. The whole matter begs a question, at least for me: why not hire lower-priced, age appropriate actors?<br/><br/>In addition, the actors concerned might have altered 'looks' but in physical movement, etc. they appear to be their actual ages. I found myself reminded of many roles by Jimmy Stewart, years ago, when he continued to play the 'leading man' part in film after film, even though he might have been better cast as the leading man's grandfather. In other words, a distracting internal inconsistency. In one scene Pesci refers to DeNiro as a 'kid'. It just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Perhaps the strongest part of the movie is the script, deserving an 'A' grade. Supporting actors are all up to task, and the overall production is good, as might be expected from Scorsese. One distraction I could have lived without was the old rock and roll inserted into the soundtrack. This particular Scorsese technique is simply over-used, and only amplifies the age-issues with the film's leads."

But I guess all these 10/10 are out of love for Martin, Al and De Niro, since the movie itself is not that outstanding. With The Departed Scorsese breathed new life in the genre. Shutter Island is an absolute masterpiece, from any point of view. The Wolf of Wall Street another masterpiece, and one of the funniest movies ever. Now The Irishman is some kind of a vintage flavor, a farewell to a period when everybody was doing films about mobsters, and Scorsese and De Niro were doing the best ones. But as I said, this doesn't stand out on an historical scale - because that's what Scorsese got us used to."

","Please don't get me wrong because I love films like Casino Good Fellas & Scarface. I love Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta & Al Pacino but they have had their day! This film, if made in the 80's, 90's would have been an absolute classic and, to be fair, still is to a certain extent. The issue I have with this film is, quite simply put, the actors are past their best. It is excruciatingly obvious from the opening scene that Robert DeNiro cannot even walk like a tough guy anymore, let alone portray a genuine gangster! And neither can the others for that matter. This would have been an awesome movie in their day and I would have moved heaven & earth to see it then. Their is absolutely a gap in the market for this type of movie these days but to fill it with the 'used to be's' was the wrong call. With all of this said, god forbid my movie idols should read this, I feel I owe an apology to the absolute legends of their day. Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, and Joe Pesci, I apologise but you of all must understand that a gangster film requires believable gangsters."
"cruise01","8","2","6","29 November 2019"," A sharp crime film but dragged down from an over long run time.
","The Irishman (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>The Irishman is a good epic crime film that delivers a strong direction from Martin Scorsese and the cast ensemble with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. The performances are top notch great. Especially, the deaging the characters with visual effects. The film follows the early years of Frank (Robert De Niro) and his rise of being a mob hitman. Seeing the actors portray there characters throughout the years is great. Definitely, an improvement over other films that try that deaging technology unlike Jeff Bridges in Tron Legacy.<br/><br/>The plot is over long following Frank through the years of truck driving to working for the mobster in cleaning and taking out anyone they want gone. The film is one of the longest with being at 3 and a half hours long. Which does show it when watching. The film does slow down and I felt like they should have trimmed down some scenes.<br/><br/>The script and direction is sharp with the crime epic. The actors did great with their performances. It may not be Martin Scorsese best picture in his list of movies. The movie delivers in a gritty and old fashion filmmaking."
"blanche-2","9","2","6","29 November 2019"," brilliant film with a gimmick not ready for prime time
","I won't go through the plot. I will say it was a joy to see Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino. Joe Pesci, Bobby Cannavale and others in ""The Irishman."" There are many reasons to praise Scorsese's work but I think for a film to last nearly 3-1/2 hours and move so quickly is amazing and a tribute to his artistry.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. The three stars manage to create characters that are completely fleshed out. In many ways it's a sad story, with DeNiro's character, Sheeran's, last scenes heartbreaking.<br/><br/>In actuality, according to a Hoffa expert of 40 years. the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa didn't quite go down as portrayed. Like ""JFK"" the source is one person, and there are conflicting stories. Nevertheless it's compelling.<br/><br/>Now I'll go into why I gave this film a 9. I'm sorry and I don't care what anyone else thinks, CGI isn't there yet. Both DeNiro and Pacino looked as if they had scoliosis and no necks, wearing clothes too big for them. I found it very distracting. In one of the first scenes, DeNiro is a young man driving a truck. I didn't recognize him. Too gimmicky. The aging - and I think they made these guys look older than they are - was much better than the deaging.<br/><br/>If it didn't take away from anyone's experiences, I'm glad. You can do so much with actual makeup and lighting -- it was at least worth a try."

","De Niro plays a small time tough guy sponsored by top gangster Pesci. It charts his career with particular emphasis on his relationship with Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa played by Pacino.<br/><br/>This is a very fine film indeed and the finesse with which Scorsese brings the story to life with relatively few grandstanding events is hugely impressive. The performances are all great - De Niro carries the picture quite gently as the lead, with Pacino ideally cast in a shouty role and Pesci all nicely understated. Stephen Graham is also excellent in a smaller but key role.<br/><br/>The running time at 3 and a half hours is actually pretty painless as you are very rarely not completely absorbed. I think perhaps 15 minutes of trimming might have helped in the final act which seems determined to cover off extraneous detail."

"MichaelMRamey","10","2","6","29 November 2019"," A Beautiful End To An Era
","The appeal and glamour of the gangster lifestyle evaporate in The Irishman as Scorsese washes his hands of the genre. This truly felt like a bookend to the gangster films as we've come to love from director Martin Scorsese and it ended up being one of his best. The fact that some theatres wouldn't play it because it is a Netflix streaming film is a travesty to filmmaking. You would think they would have learned from Blockbuster's mistake, but here we are once again.<br/><br/>The Irishman is about former mafia hitman Frank Sheeran played by Robert De Niro and the disappearance of Al Pacino's Jimmy Hoffa. This is a movie in which Scorsese doesn't sugar coat anything; showing how this life can affect your family and your livelihood provided you live long enough to die of old age.<br/><br/>The strongest performance comes from Joe Pesci, who was talked into coming out of retirement just to do this film and for someone who hasn't acted in over a decade; he eases back into the craft like a fine wine. If he doesn't score a Best Supporting Actor award, why are we even having the ceremony? It also amazes me that the only scene between Joe Pesci and Al Pacino was the one and seemingly only scene the two will have shared in their legendary careers.<br/><br/>I felt the same way I felt the first time I watch Goodfellas while watching The Irishman and that is one of my all-time top five films and in a way, this is an anti-Goodfellas film. At a staggering three and a half hours, I only looked at the clock once with a well-paced storyline that you have to praise Editor Thelma Schoonmaker for. While we're on the subject of post-production, the de-aging technology was incredibly implemented.<br/><br/>One scene that stood out to me was of Frank in the war; discussing how the soldiers would dig their graves unwilling to accept their fate as if they were somehow going to escape death. This foreshadows the entire story of Jimmy Hoffa. He is a man who we watch continually dig his grave deeper and deeper while continuing to believe he'd escape death. I mean even when he walks into the empty house and is standing on the plastic wrap; he is standing in his actual grave and still tries to escape. This particular scene reminded me a lot of Joe Pesci's scene in Goodfellas as he walks into the empty room, however, he immediately recognizes and accepts his fate.<br/><br/>The final half-hour was unexpected and hits you like a ton of bricks. It was one of the only times I watch a movie and felt fearful about growing old. This is a man whose friends have all died before him and his family wants nothing to do with him as he sits as a decrepit man stripped of any power, alone as it nears Christmas day. When his nurse admits she's never heard of Jimmy Hoffa, it seems as though all the power and money, in the end, wasn't worth it while Frank struggles with mortality as he reflects on his life.<br/><br/>These are actors I love in a film genre that I came to love them in most likely their final performance together and I couldn't be happier. This truly was a beautiful and incredible film and by far the best film I've seen in 2019. As Dr. Seuss said, ""Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened."""

","I so wanted this movie to be a masterpiece a 9 or 10 out of 10 movie. It's been in the works for quite some time. I think the script is excellent, the problem is Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, let me say that i am massive fan of De Niro and Pacino they are actors in some of my favourite movies of all time and if they were 30 years younger it would have worked brilliantly, but unfortunately they are not and the roles did not suit them, even with the facial effects.<br/><br/>DeNiro just looked and moved so unrealisticly as Sheeran, similarly Pacino with Hoffa, they did whatever possible with their faces and you could kind of forget about it after the first hour or so, but the bodies let the movie down. There was a scene at the beginning when DeNiro is supposedly a young kid maybe late 20s and he looks and walks like he is in his 50s. There is another scene with an altercation with the grocer, it's laughable, how Scorsese let that scene in the final cut i will never know.<br/><br/>Its a shame as i think this movie had all the makings of a masterpiece, i understand Scorsese wanting to use his old friend DeNiro and the chance to work with the legend Al Pacino but i can't help thinking if Bale played Sheeran and Leo played Hoffa this would have been one of the best films of the decade. I must give a shout out to Pesci who i thought played his role brilliantly and the facial recognition was pretty good on him, he was a shining light in this movie and to think he has been out acting for a long time.<br/><br/>Its a solid movie and Scorsese always tells a good story, to me it's a case of what could have been. 7/10"
"iamtheonewhoknockss","Null","2","6","28 November 2019"," a bit Alzheimery
","You're going to be extremely confused watching this movie. Characters are haphazardly introduced with no explanation as to who they are, what family they are attached to, what position they hold in the hierarchy and why that matters in relation to Hoffa.
The movie was enjoyable to me, as I've watched every mob documentary under the sun and I literally fall asleep every night watching the ""Inside The American Mob"" docu-series (seriously!). So I had a base with which to place these characters inside the story.
Another issue I have with this movie is, it tells a story revolving around Jimmy Hoffa and never discusses Detroit or the Detroit family, who I could argue were more powerful than most of the New York families because the Detroit Mafia controlled The Teamsters. And thus, the Teamsters pension fund (as well as the Teamsters trucks, which were importing all the heroin into the U.S. from Canada at that time).
I found De niro's mumble mouth, stuttering narration to be extremely obnoxious and distracting. That guy is falling apart.
Pacino sucks in his old age. Nicholson crushed him in his portrayal of Hoffa.
Pesci was absolutely incredible in this. The man has still got it! A true master of his craft, unlike De niro and Pacino, who are all about the money these days and not crushing their performances.
All in all, a meandering, but enjoyable movie if you have a strong base knowledge of the New York mob."

I couldn't get to see it on the big screen so I had to wait for the Netflix release but safe to say that wait was worth it. The Irishman is one of the best films of 2019. The writing and narrative is spectacular and the performances are amazing (obviously). I have to say, De Niro was the heart and soul of this film. Scorsese (yet again) nails the directing. There were sequences which were just perfectly shot and just a beauty to watch it unfold and play out. Also I don't think many people mentioned the score but that was very well done.<br/><br/>Now the main discussion point: that runtime. This movie is 3 hours and 29 minutes long. And for a movie like this with a lot of talking that clocks in at 209 minutes, I was never actually bored throughout the movie.

The opening hour or so is all you could want from a mob movie, the middle treads a tiny bit of sTer when Jimmy Hoffa is introduced, but his dueling with Stephen Graham's character makes up for it, the last hour is a masterclass in tension, what you'd expect from Scorsese followed by a tiny bit more treading water to get to the end. The de-aging CGI is only jarring for a moment then it's actually quite amazing, especially in Joe Pesci looking like Leo Getz's father in early scenes. Everything about this movie is on point, every character has purpose, it's definitely not Marvel film making, and it will have its haters, especially amongst the blockbuster crowd, this isn't the same 3hr movie.

","I just finished watching The Irishman on Netflix, and all I can say is wow. Just wow. Martin Scorsese has officially just made himself my favorite film maker of all time. The fact that he can make this movie today, make it 3.5 hours long and have it be one of his best is incredible. The way he moves the camera and at points lingers on characters faces for extra time so the viewer can take everything in is extraordinary. Everyone in this film is amazing. Pacino, Cannavale, Sebastian Maniscalco. But most of all the standouts are Pesci and De Niro. Pesci came out of retirement for this film and while I still think Goodfellas is his best performance(obviously it's Home Alone but we all know that), this is a close second. The way he creates and embodies his character is special. This performance isn't like what he usually does. No yelling, nothing. And De Niro, of De Niro. Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors of all time. No question. He is superb in this film. Both Pesci and De Niro shine throughout the entire movie, but in my opinion is towards the very end that they shine. The closing shot of this film reviles that of The Godfather. Not going into spoilers, but the deeper meaning in it is excellent. Thelma Schoonmaker seems to be able to take any film and make it 100 times better. She edits this wonderfully. Lastly, in my opinion, Pesci and Pacino should be nominated for oscars, but Pesci should win. De Niro should win the best actor oscar and Scorsese deserves one as well. The Irishman is a perfect example of a top director making an excellent film. One Scorsese's best, and the best of the year(so far). 10/10"

It's quite a compelling tale about an aging hitman's (Robert De Niro) telling of his association with a mafia boss (Joe Pesci) and Teamsters Union head Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The movie is a little more than three hours so it takes it's own time in going over several decades of the narrative. In doing so, it also uses new technology when depicting those three actors being much younger and older. Quite convincing, those aging and de-aging processes are.

"andrewloydepasquale","9","1","2","30 May 2020"," A more sobering, mature view of the gangster
","Martin Scorsese's newest film, the three hour and twenty-nine-minute gangster epic, The Irishman is the somewhat confession tale of teamster-turned hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) and his life of crime over a span of nearly twenty years. The film focuses on the relationships forged in this line of work and in particular, on a relationship Sheeran develops with famous union president Jimmy Hoffa prior to his disappearance.
Similar to other gangster films the Irishman has several characters coming in and out throughout the narrative and a few interwoven plot threads that all add up to tell the story Sheeran wants to tell you. DeNiro plays the character with an earnestness and a soberness that is lacking in Scorsese's earlier mob film Goodfellas. Whereas Goodfellas at times glorifies the lives of its mobsters, The Irishman does not. The business Frank Sheeran and Russell Bufalino engage in is so matter of fact. These men have families and feel they have no choice in the matter. ""It is what it is"" seems to be their mantra. I appreciated this sober depiction. It allowed for the reflection that these things do happen to and by real human beings.
he Irishman is about older gangsters and older men and the importance of friendships,alliances, power, and ultimately betrayal. Sheeran is torn in his loyalty to two different men: Pittsburgh mobster Russell Bufalino and union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Though both men are shrewd, Hoffa's line of work is more dignified: he helped people live better lives. The character is played flawlessly by Pacino-though and outsider to the friendship between Frank and Russell Hoffa is still aware of how business- even Russell's business is run. Hoffa is the foil to Russell in many ways especially in the eyes of Peggy, Frank's oldest daughter; and yet the film does not make you side with any one character as relationships deepen. Frank is devoted to both men albeit perhaps to two different ends. Scorsese also highlights the necessity of death in the film. As it is a film about older men and their line of work Scorsese points out how many characters eventually met their demise ;this is done for a few reasons. First, it reminds us that death comes for us all; second it serves to deglamorize any notion of gangsters we might have as this line of work will not end well for anyone, and finally these definitive statements of characters' cause of death is up against the shroud of mystery concerning Hoffa's own disappearance.
With the lengths Scorsese goes to remind us all that death is coming, from those inter-titles described above, to the opening song, to the entire last after the film-which is just under an hour, it is clear he is preparing us for the final days. The last third of the film depicts the man Sheeran has become beyond his years of crime. He is old,white-haired, crippled, ultimately in a wheelchair in the halls of a nursing home. Having lost nearly everyone he was at one time close with, Sheeran is shown to have some regret, but it is unclear by the end of the film whether he has made that decision of the will to ask forgiveness"
"anselmdaniel","8","1","2","30 May 2020"," A sweeping epic
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Irishman is a 2019 American epic crime movie. The movie is directed by Martin Scorcese and is based on the book I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt. The movie stars Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. A delivery truck driver, Frank Sheeran, in Philadelphia sells the contents of his truck to a crime family. This introduces Frank Sheeran to the world of organized crime.<br/><br/>The Irishman is a wide sweeping epic crime movie. This movie paints a broad stroke with its 209 minutes of running time. This running time tells an epic story across the 1950s all the way to the early 1990s. The story follows Frank Sheeran and his interactions with the crime families and Jimmy Hoffa. This story is grand in scope and the movie executes this incredibly well. The actors and actresses have ageing and de-ageing technology that is applied to their faces. As the years continue they also act according to their age. It makes for an involved story as the audience can see that characters ageing before their eyes. It also reflects the changing nature of the characters as motivations and goals change.<br/><br/>The relationship between Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa is reflected incredibly well in this movie. The movie centers on this relationship as the movie unfolds. Both Robert De Niro and Al Pacino as Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa are believable and astounding in their roles. I bought into their relationship and it was painful that Frank Sheeran had to kill Jimmy Hoffa. Up until that point Frank Sheeran came to a respectful relation with Jimmy Hoffa and vice-versa. The two men and their families have chemistry on the screen. They also care about one another.<br/><br/>The directing in this movie is not as electric as other Martin Scorcese movies. This movie is much more flat in its direction than the movies such as Goodfellas or The Departed. I felt that the direction could be improved but the direction ultimately has the grand scope that makes the movie involved.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'The Irishman'. The length of this movie is definitely felt by any audience. However any audience that is willing to watch this movie needs to be patient and in the mood for a slow-burning story.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"timmyminh","9","1","2","28 May 2020"," A mafioso genre at the twilight of its life
","Scorsese is a titan in the motion picture industry ! I have watched this film maybe 6 to 7 times in a short span of time already. I am a huge fan of the mafioso cinema, from 1962's Mafioso to GoodFellas, Casino, The Sopranos, Once Upon A Time In America, The Godfather trilogy. And this film definitely, without a shadow of a doubt, stands up there with the legends. It pays homage to the gangster and mafioso genre and instead of romanticizing the world of crime, Scorsese shows us the vulnerable end of that world. The last 30 minutes impact me more than any films have had for a very very long time. It shows the fear of old age, reflecting on a lifetime of crime, killing for an ideal you believe is for the good of your kin, but it only deprives you of your kin. The fact that this picture took 10 years or so to make because Scorsese was having difficulties allocating the funds for it, while Hollywood greenlit remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels, Disney live-action, superhero flicks, and CATS... just show how ridiculous it is. If I heard there is a film being made starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci, directed by Martin fucking Scorsese, I would have handed over my rent money ! Those who says this was too long or too boring are probably the same people who the next thing they do is to continue to watch 7 hours of a dumb rom com. The only reason why I regretfully gave it a 9/10 was because of Scorsese's rather conservative way of keeping the original character in their original physique while playing younger versions of themselves, this could have easily been resolved with a stunt double."

"correiodatardeparaanoite","10","1","2","9 May 2020"," I Heard you paint houses
","Martin Scorsese put together Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino to present the public with a true master piece, it might be to soon to say but n my opinion Irishman is already a classic, a truly must see movie.
Robert de Niro plays Frank Sheeran, a unionist with connection with the mafia. De Niro give us an amazing performance, during the movie he show us a lot of layers since the relationship with his daughter and the attitudes that he have during he's paintings and during he's mafia business. We can notice the layers during the paintings, you can see that Frank Sheeran is very effective and does it right (the paintings) but despite he doesn't feel comfortable doing what he does he never have second thoughts on doing it, and the relationship with his daughter isn't good but he thinks that he doesn't deserve the caring of his daughter.
I was so happy to see Joe Pesci doing this role, he show us a character so secure and he knows about he's power and always seems to know more that we think, notice the scene where the De Niro and Harvey Keitel character are discussing something and without saying nothing he shows the power and influence that he haves in that type of life and he does that only looking to one side and then the other. Despite all that he give us some frustration when he tries to have a nice relationship with Frank Sheeran daughter and he knows that the type of life that he chose and he realizes that there's some things that u cannot buy.
Al Pacino plays Jimmy Hoffa and what can I say, if there was someone that could play Jimmy Hoffa so well was Al Pacino. He knows the power and influence that he have, for one side can make him unstoppable but for other side can make him vulnerable and naive. And the details of his performance are amazing, the confidence that he shows give us the idea of power and it's really funny.
Anna Paquin show us a very good performance, she has the ability to give us the true on her eyes. We can see without her even talking that she despise her father because his life style and she also give us true admiration when she's with Jimmy Hoffa.
All things considered I only can give 10 to this wonderful movie and a big thank you to everyone involved to make this movie happen, The Irishman is a true mark of mob movies and despite all the classic characteristics of Scorsese movies this is one of the greatest and unic movie. This lady's and gentleman's is true cinema."

","If Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was a take on middle age via the conceit of an actor (& his stunt double) looking around and asking himself, ""Is that all there is?""...The Irishman is a reflective take on old age as 3 players in and around the Mob face the consequences of their choices, with the last man standing having the final say.<br/><br/>I started out in children's theater, and our best writers used to say that the stories were really about real people - but it's more fun to tell them through the lives or royalty, witches, giants and such.<br/><br/>In The Irishman, the stories are about real people from history. And there is plenty here about unions, gangsters, politicians. In one of his last interviews, Gore Vidal told Bill Maher that grade school writers of classroom textbooks really don't get enough credit for the great care and skill they take to make history dull. Nothing dull here.<br/><br/>But the metaphors are also there for the average person, and the not-so-average alike, in the changing relationships between the 3 main characters (De Niro, Pacino and Pesci). Friendship & betrayal, over a lifetime - what life and death are all about.<br/><br/>In what little criticism I heard about the CGI de-aging that was used in a more advanced way for the 1st time here, I was impressed and glad to see I disagreed. The critics miss several points. The fact that the changes are so subtle is a marker of how good the tech is. Also, the high quality of the actual aging for the final scenes deserves credit - that may have been traditional makeup. But the remarkable thing is you cant tell whether they are using makeup or CGI. Scorcese is right, they were able to use CGI as if it were makeup.<br/><br/>As always, among the celebrated filmmaker's mastery of skills is his use of music - one could write a nice chapter on his choice of songs alone. I'll just mention that he's set ""In the Still of the Night"" as a kind of theme song, opening and closing the picture with it. Among other things, as a colleague with a guilty conscience once said to me, it's at that hour, alone, that one thinks about the awful things one has done to those one claims to love.<br/><br/>As a last thought, on this 1st viewing, I noticed that the film began to take on a disturbing urgency in Act 3. This is notable because we all know more or less what is going to happen. And as with every great tragedy, I found myself rooting for an outcome that I knew was not possible.<br/><br/>That's how good this movie is.<br/><br/>As always, Scorcese works with the best - and the best are happy to work with him. No need for me to list them here, but thank you everyone, especially writer Steven Zaillian, DP Rodrigo Prieto, editor Thelma Schoonmaker."

","The Irishman follows over 30 years of the life of Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran, a Teamsters Union truck driver and hit man for the Philadelphia mob. Robert De Niro, as Sheeran, is taken under the wing of mob boss Russel Buffalino (Joe Pesci). Once he gains Russel's trust, he is offered a job as bodyguard to Teamsters Union president Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). A natural friendship grows between the two as the lives of Sheeran, Buffalino, and Hoffa become more and more intertwined. As he serves two masters, Frank faces the question who he will hate and who he will love. Robert De Niro offers a subtle, but chilling, portrayal of Sheeran. Without the move of as much as a muscle, we see him methodically execute his tasks with no remorse. Joe Pesci plays a character unlike what is his norm. Unlike the insufferable and rambunctious mobster so often seen in Scorsese's films, Buffalino is soft spoken. He need not raise his voice to make himself heard. The silence of his presence carries an eeriness with it. Al Pacino's portrayal of the larger than life figure, Jimmy Hoffa, not only captures all of attention when on screen, but it stays with you. Once past a myriad of swearings, once his eccentricities fade away, Hoffa is revealed to be a true and loyal friend. The de-aging technology for the film is nearly flawless so that it is barely noticeable when the jumps from different time periods are made. The cinematography, costume/set design, and editing work exceptionally well for the story that is being told. The screenplay is exceptional. At times, it makes the audience laugh and then fall dead silent. It captures the dangerously light hearted mood the mob has about their crimes. Lastly, Scorsese's direction of the film is simply brilliant. He ensures that a glance or even a sharp breath tells the audience everything. He is a master story teller. The Irishman is a modern epic."

"thesuf","7","1","2","10 January 2020"," Scorsese delivers
","Ask and you shall receive. And we did receive. A star studded, Martin Scorsese mob movie.<br/><br/>This was a great movie. It starts slow: De Niro's acting, and overall appearance, were stiff frankly. The movie picks up pace just after the mid-point. Where the actors' appearances are concerned, it was hard to tell the characters' ages in this piece, film makers having digitally altered the actors' appearances to make them look younger or older according to the movie scenes' timeframe. For when the characters were supposed to look younger, I found this unnatural and outright distracting, especially with De Niro's character. The illusion is lost somehow and in essence there's only so much make-up and digital enhancing can do for an actor.<br/><br/>Naturally actors will move as smoothly as their bodies allow them. Ultimately the actors' ages were telling in this movie. There was one scene where De Niro's character was giving a beating to another character but the way he moved around in that scene really showed a much older guy than the character's age, to a point where it looked like the other actor taking the beating was actually helping De Niro with the action. You can't help but cringe watching that specific scene.<br/><br/>Acting wise worth mentioning both Al Pacino's and Joe Pesci's performances were stellar and totally made up for the early stiff start of the movie. For me Al Pacino has not lost a single drop of energy with age. Ray Romano's and Stephen Graham's performances were the surprising show stealer in my opinion.<br/><br/>This is really a good movie, worth spending the 3 hours to watch in its entirety. Some are calling this a masterpiece. Frankly I've seen far better Scorsese movies. It's not the classic Scorsese movie that Taxi Driver or Goodfellas are, and it may not be historically accurate, but it's an entertaining, thought provoking, and star-studded movie."

After the first hour though, things got dull and slow, I almost fell asleep. I actually had to stop around the 2nd hour because I couldn't concentrate anymore. I'm not the kind of person though who can leave a half watched movie behind, so the next day I sat down and finished it. And boy am I glad I did! The very last hour was the best part, where you understand what the whole 2 hours before were really about and what the director was working towards from the very first minute. And after having watched the whole thing, I could see why it lasts this long and it even makes sense. This is a slow film and a very interesting one, but it's surely not for everyone. I didn't have an issue with the CGI, even though it was not very well done, but I could see past that. I'm very glad that I had the chance to see these wonderful actors once again - and maybe for the last time."

It is great in it's script, cast, story telling, editing, cinematography, and background music.<br/><br/>the visual effects in the movie - The movie has a difficult task, because the entire runtime takes place in the past and occasionally it will cut back to a present day/older De Niro, aka what he looks like now, Special mention must be given to the extensive use of CG de-aging (the film takes place over a span of decades) which surprisingly was done well.<br/><br/>
The Irishman exactly puts the story of the 90's in an impeccable manner, Robert De Niro's smooth story narration. From his young age times to old age situations, the movie is thoroughly connected by small incidents which in turn make it an hitman, teamsters members.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro plays a cold, yet charismatic gangster, Frank Sheeran - a friend of Jimmy Hoffa &
Russell Bufalino.<br/><br/>Al Pacino plays a loud month Jimmy Hoffa that's a huge ball of energy and reeks of desperation, which Pacino portrays beautifully.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci plays Russell Bufalino, a silent and collective man who sniffs out trouble and takes care of ""business"".<br/><br/>Talented acting, acting legend & terrific amazingly subtle and soft spoken performance that many have been calling tremendous.<br/><br/>Aside, I'm struggling to remember other characters' but who played
Crazy Joe - Sebastian maniscalco

Peggy sheeran - Anna paquin supporting characters played Well even though they have 10 to 20min screen timing in movie. Other than it's not able to remember others characters.<br/><br/>Frank's relationship with his daughters, especially Peggy, shows just how dicey parenting can be, that the best possible choices may not necessarily give the best result, and that a sheltered upbringing is more of a handicap than a positive in helping children truly understand the world.<br/><br/>Good Movie, enjoyable but not a best of Martin Scorsese.

","So it is a bit late, but you know the saying better late then never, so this is my review for easilly Netfilx's biggest project to date The Irishman. The premise of the film documents the life of a gangster as he tells the audience his life story of how he grew in the criminal Underworld.
Main Character
Robert De Niro plays the lead character in this film and he does a really good job in the film, you can tell he really cared about this role and it felt like a role that fit him very well. After this performance and his performance in Joker I think it is fair to say that De Niro is back on form and taking roles he actually cares about. At first the de ageing CGI distracted me but you get used to it as the film progresses and it fits De Niro as lets face it he has always looked the same pretty much.
Supporting Characters
Al Pacino plays Jimmy Hoffa in this film and he does a really good job, he is very charismatic and charming in his role, his and De Niro have really good chemistry together and you care about their relationship in the film and he is probably the most interesting character in the film. Joe Pesci plays the Mob Boss in this film and he is also great in this film, again he and De Niro have great chemistry in the film and you do care about their relationship and seeing these three gentleman give great performances is a very welcome sign indeed. There is also some other smaller but great roles such as Ray Romano, Stephen Graham and Bobby Cannavalle who aren't huge parts of the film but they add a bit of class and top quality performances in these roles.
Story
The story is interesting as it documents this gang culture and the different inner workings of what is going on in higher society in this time period. If I am honest this films story is further enhanced by the performers then the actual plot. This film's plot jumps over multiple time periods and it can become a bit convoluted and you are introduced to lots of characters, some who just aren't given enough backstory for you to care about them. Plus this film has easily 30 minutes on there that just isn't necessary and it makes this film feel more indulgent then it could have been.
Script
The dialogue in most Martin Scorsese films is excellent filled with smart and witty dialogue to make you feel like these are real people even though they are in ridiculous scenarios. The drama especially between the main three characters feels very real, like they are real friends and their relationships do feel very real. The dry humour also works and again makes this film feel quite a bit funnier then it had any right to be.
Style
The style in this film has a really cool gangster feel to it that fits the performers and the director incredibly well and you can tell they are very passionate about how this movie should be made. Also as mentioned before there is de-ageing CGI in this movie and for me it was used well and wasn't distracting to me at all. However, to the big thing about this film is that it is 3 Hours and 30 Minutes long which is absurd for any movie even if the quality of the movie is high. This film definitley drags along and you kind of just wait for the ending to come.
Overall
This film is another great addition to the gangster genre and if you want to watch a superbly acted but long film then this is a film for you, but just remember that you cannot watch this casually and must fully invest in it."

","The Irishman stars Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, and is directed by Martin Scorsese. The Irishman tells the true story of Frank Sheeran and his relationship with Jimmy Hoffa. I'm going to start this review out by saying that Scorsese directing gangster films is like french fries with ketchup. And him directing a gangster film and reuniting Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro, is like Christmas. Another thing is that the Irishman tells the story of Jimmy Hoffa who i have no clue who that is. I only know his name because I've seen tv shows or movies mentioning this character. So for Scorsese to bring this character to life, I thought to myself what could go wrong? The problem I have with this is that he doesn't show up until an hour into the movie. By the way the movie is three hours and twenty nine minutes, so if you have the patience and the energy to sit through a three hour and twenty nine minute movie, then hats off to you. I know that this is more to do with the life of Frank Sheeran, and I have no problem with that except that the first hour is repetitive just like all of Scorsese films from Goodfellas to Casino. I was more interested in Jimmy Hoffa, and part of me wishes that Scorsese would focus on this man rather than cramming down an entire history class of Sheeran and Hoffa in a movie that's three hour and twenty nine minutes. But I will say that on a positive note that the run time could've been a lot worse. It could've been slow paced and have scenes that would have nothing to do with the movie and leave us bored out of our minds. But Scorsese knows how to entertain an audience and knows how to pick off which is important and which isn't. And this has been his passion project for quite some time, but part of me feels that he added the extended run time to show us how much he really cared for this. This could've been better if it had been a tv show instead of a movie, because there is a lot to process and I think telling this long epic tale of Jimmy Hoffa and Frank Sheeran deserves to be in t.v. rather than on a big screen. So in the end, while it was nice seeing Scorsese direct a gangster film and reuniting these legends, I think in the end he should've stuck with a specific era, and just made a movie out of that."
"ajm5072","5","1","2","8 January 2020"," So boring
","This is the slowest moving movie ever. The de-aging / aging of the characters looks so fake. Pesci's performance carries the movie but Deniro ruins it."
"JohnBuckWLD","7","1","2","7 January 2020"," This movie is not a masterpiece
","Compared to most of the crap out there, it's good film. But when put side-by-side with Scorsese's most famous works, The Irishman misses by a mile. While most criticisms focus on the 3 1/2 hour length, the pace overall was nothing to find fault with. As most viewers will not see the movie in the cinema, and instead watch it in the comfort of their own homes, the duration won't be numbing in an uncomfortable theater seat.<br/><br/>As a general rule, film snobs will be the first to trash CGI in films, yet surprisingly there have been relatively few negative assessments of the digital nips and tucks to all three main actors in the story. Expensive as ILM's plastic surgery was, Pesci, DeNiro, and Pacino all looked, and unfortunately, acted like old men throughout.<br/><br/>What qualities do you, the viewer, look for in a film? If it's things like nostalgia, you'll probably love The Irishman.<br/><br/>But if you're the type of person that wants an emotional connection to a character or subplot, a surprise / twist, interesting camera angles, or something riveting that pulls you in, The Irishman fails on all counts."

","This movie is well made, it just went on for far too long. The acting was excellent, the production was top notch, but the pacing is slowwww. It's a story that could and should have been told in 2.5 hrs or so. The scenes that cast De Niro as a younger man were unbelievable as well; he's an old man and looks that way. Make up and hair dye or special effects cannot change that fact. Otherwise the movie was pretty entertaining."

"sterlinrivera-2000","9","1","2","28 December 2019"," A Great Return & Reunion
","The Irishman I felt was a great comeback for Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino, Pesci, and Keitel to be in the same movie together. It really took me by complete and total surprise.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in the 50s, and deals with truck driver Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) that is involved with a Pennsylvania crime family led by Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). Frank climbs to the top of the ranks to be a massive hit man, and also works for Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), who tied to organized crime. Frank then now has to double his crime careers.<br/><br/>The Irishman was very good. I thought the story was great, the acting was great, and actually ran in a pretty impressive pace for 3 and a half hours long. All the cast members did a great job, but I was a bit disappointed by Joe Pesci. He didn't get to be a foul mouthed hothead like he was in Goodfellas or Casino, which was a bit sad because Joe Pesci wasn't in a big Hollywood film for two decades, and he makes his return here, and he plays a calm character. He did a great job, don't get me wrong, but I wish he got to be more funny and humorous. De Niro and Pacino did a fantastic job together. It was also really cool to see Ray Romano and Harvey Kietel in the film as well. I wish they brought actors like Ray Liotta and Paul Sorvino in the film to make it even more of a purified gangster film, but it still turned out great in the end.<br/><br/>The film is as long as Godfather Part II, which is kind of unnecessary. For the story they had, they could of trimmed it down to a mere 2 and a half hours.
But nonetheless, The Irishman was basically a great reunion for the wiseguys, and I highly recommend you check it out."
"lumieretrain","8","1","2","28 December 2019"," The Irishman by Martin Scorsese
","The stories about the hitman mobsters, are one of the most thrilling ones to explore in the books, graphic novels, television series, movies and so on. Especially to see how the main characters rise, from the beginning at the young ages to then fall in the end at the old ages. Most of these stories are usually either fictional stories but still have realism on the narration, or are based on real events which make several references on the historical happenings to be as accurate as possible. The more the audience would follow the story the more they get surprised, to see how the main characters had to follow dangerous orders which they have been asked for. As well as to see how some brutal events were connected, in the political way or even in the financial way, of how the mobsters have been organized to commit what they committed. After the making of the movie Casino, Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese have tried for years to collaborate again in another project. It seems complicated as each of them moved forward with other projects, while the audience were really excited and waited until they both would collaborate again. Until Robert De Niro have found the book I Heard You Paint Houses, which have intrigued him to offer Martin Scorsese to direct the story. But there were also complications about which studios were interested to finance and release the movie, until Netflix have been interested in Martin Scorsese's new project. After a long time of work, in 2019 came out The Irishman by Martin Scorsese with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. The movie's plot: The former hitman mobster Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) narrates his long journey, from being a young truck driver. Until Frank Sheeran becomes a hitman for the ferocious mobster Russel Bufalino (Joe Pesci), as well as for the powerful Teamster Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The movie from the beginning to the end, would just intrigue the audience, without ruining the narration's rhythm. Especially to see how the main character narrates his story, in the specific details, for how he moved to follow orders he get asked for. As the main character in the course of the story would get his hands dirty, with more or less risk without having any regrets for what he committed. As well as to see how the relationship between his family and the mobsters would move forward, either in the good way or even in the bad way till the end. The voice-over was specifically elaborated to be compatible with the camera, lightings and editing, as they all create scenes with unforgettable shots in every angle shots and in every camera movements. The score and the specific songs help to create some of the most impactful as well as the most powerful scenes, needed for the narration's rhythm to surprise in the most unexpected ways the audience. Robert De Niro was extraordinary as Frank Sheeran, the former hitman mobster and the narrator of the story, who gives so many details of the story to be clear how things went, without missing any specific historical happenings connected with his job. Al Pacino was excellent as Jimmy Hoffa, an impatient and aggressive Teamster who would never allow anybody to stop him and the only person he can trust is actually Frank Sheeran. Joe Pesci was extraordinary as Russell Bufalino, a ferocious mobster who gives most of the time orders to Frank Sheeran and he would give facial expressions to be clear enough to be quiet scary. The special effects were elaborated to be in every single details, by de-aging the main characters as well as making them older. Without getting helped by the makeup which is usually used, in the stories about a long journey from the beginning at the main characters' young ages until the end at the main characters' old ages. The Irishman is one of the best movies 2019, as well as one of the best Martin Scorsese's pictures."
"jabberwhack","9","1","2","28 December 2019"," A mature, masterful offering from Scorsese
","If The Irishman is Scorsese's last word on mob movies, then this is a thoughtful, profound one from the master of the genre. It has the characteristic Scorsese liveliness, wit, humour, cool tracking shots, surprising and dynamic editing, awesome soundtrack, but there's more. His previous movies did show the consequences of the life of a gangster, but they never went this far. You never saw the wise guys playing bocce in jail, looking old and frail, or the boss who used to call the shots, being unable to eat bread because of his dentures. The last shot - a clear reference to the end of The Godfather - doesn't have the grave, somber but super cool vibe of Michael Corleone becoming the new Don. The Irishman ends with an old man, alone, morally bankrupt, emotionally incapable of true remorse, someone who murdered his best friend in cold blood. It's a reckoning, and a fitting one in the age of The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and other works which explore the ethical fall out of the actions of corrupt men. Scorsese's movies have always touched upon violence, redemption, faith, but watching The Irishman, these issues are now dealt with through the perspective of a director who's lived long and seen much.<br/><br/>As a fan of Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Casino, or Mean Streets, it's such an incredible treat to see Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel, and more coming together on screen. All of them are giving their very best. Pesci always looks true to the name of ""wise guy""; there's an intelligence, a cunning, a foreboding to his eyes at all times. De Niro's tough guy impassiveness is a form of art. What those eyes, this twisted down scowl can tell! (His face, when he's boarded the fateful plane to Detroit, speaks a thousand words). Al Pacino is unbelievably charismatic as Jimmy Hoffa - it's a gift to have him in a Scorsese flick, the missing player to an all-star roster. Watching them all interact adds to the rewarding feeling The Irishman provides to any mob movie fan.<br/><br/>In sum, The Irishman is a masterpiece by a master. If God blesses Scorsese with more time on this earth, I am curious to see what kind of movie he'll do at 90, 100 years old!"
"fastfurious03","9","1","2","27 December 2019"," Brilliant

"Spike_the_Cactus","9","1","2","27 December 2019"," The Great Re-Union
","I deliberately avoided reading reviews of this film as I wanted to discover it for myself. I knew Scorsese had assembled a classic cast, and it would be familiar mafia territory, but beyond that I really didn't know what to expect.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge Scorsese fan, but I recognise his ability to make great films. It took me a while to muster the enthusiasm to sit through a film of this length that would no doubt be yet another glorification of the seedy side of humanity (Wolf of Wall Street is bordering on evil with the way it glorifies the very worst of us), yet this was a piece of brilliance.<br/><br/>De Niro is wonderfully pensive and human throughout. Pascino nails the part of the manic but paranoid Hoffa. Between him and De Niro we get a beautiful display of emotional interaction featuring the greatest actors of their generation. Pascino gets to chew the scenery, but De Niro offers the perfect foil of the concerned onlooker that knows where his friend's actions will lead to. They were together for seconds in Heat, but this was the real coming together I've longed to see.<br/><br/>Intertwined within all of this is Pesci. He hardly says or does something throughout the film, but that's what makes his performance so superb. I think that part of it is Scorsese choosing an actor so well known for his aggression. We don't need to see it in action because we know it's there under the surface. The dead eyes, the assertive but calming words, the intent communicated with the minimum of facial expressions - he represents the unspoken power of the mob like an oracle.<br/><br/>I had no idea that this was a film primarily about Jimmy Hoffa. I've been intrigued by that story for many years, and it reeled me in at lightning speed. The A-List performers all turning up and striking gold with every hit simply left me smiling and appreciative. Thank you to all involved."

Just watch Goodfellas again and you will be happier."

Even after having killed so many during life and having betrayed his closest friend, the protagonist does feel remorseful at all.<br/><br/>This is the director's touch of Martin Scorsese (just like Stanley Kubrick's anti-war movies) where his mockery of gangsters of the 19th and 20th century were so full of themself that they were totaltly shut off from they misery they had casued to their near and dear ones."
"spirulinajamie","8","1","2","26 December 2019"," Awesome movie, what if...........
","Loved this move. Amazing acting and great cinematography. I think Joe Pesci deserves an Oscar for his performance. One what if is .... I wonder how things would have panned out in history if these men had counselling or psychotherapy. Anger management particularly for some of the characters would have changed things. This disease of 'honour' and ' you disrespected me' if discussed with a therapist would have had a different outcome in history. Luckily most kids now are taught from an earlier age to work through and avoid holding on to past trauma and avoiding holding on to 'holding grudges'.
Ok, those are my thoughts following the movie. I loved the scene Harvey Kietel , Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci's scene- which in my opinion should be a movie clip classic . Joe Pesci remains silent but it is his non verbal communication which is an an acting class and a half along with Harvey's 'now's not the time to not say' line - pure genius."

"wailelkabbadj","10","1","2","21 December 2019"," About The Irishman: Analysis
","Martin Scorsese's art of narration is when Robert De Niro's lips talked only after a short narrative
sequence; As if he went from the third personal person ""He"" to the first personal person ""I"".<br/><br/>« The Irishman » is an unconventional road movie with many flashbacks. Two couples in car for a trip
where only Joe Pesci knows the finality.
Robert De Niro the driver will not be informed of his mission until the same day he will have to
accomplish it: the execution of Al Pacino Alias Hoffa.<br/><br/>Francis Scott Fitzgerald said: « Show me a hero, and I'll write you a tragedy »
Scorsese managed three heroes and delivered a tragedy issued from a Greco-Roman line.
This three hour and thirty-five minutes feature movie whose facts happened in the second half of the
twentieth century in the United States is composed of four chapters:
▪ De Niro and Pesci
▪ Pacino
▪ Execution of Pacino
▪ And epilog<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" starts with a metaphor: ""I heard you paint houses"" and we laugh about it. But as the
movie goes on, we can see other metaphors, more serious this time:
▪ Veal's meat transport and the expedition of humans to the beyond
▪ The cigarette's smoke and self-vigilance
▪ The alcohol and the vigilance of others
▪ The watch is eternal time
▪ The ring is a sacred alliance
▪ Sunglasses are protection
▪ The transported fish and the expected fishing of Pacino-Hoffa
▪ And finally, death that prowls around the one who personifies it from the beginning
Scorsese brushes us with an anthropological vision of three men's profiles:
▪ De Niro who has chosen converting passivity to activity following the metaphor mentioned
above
He had one slip in his mournful career, not completed though: the laundry affair. De Niro is
put back to his place
He is the FAITHFUL DOG of his unique master: Pesci. Since the order of this latter, He
changed to a Hemachatus haemachatus, famous SPITTING COBRA with the only difference
that De Niro gives an instantaneous death without any latency.
The scene at the grocery store is not useless. De Niro bragging the power of his new social
status has brought DOUBTS to his daughter who started searching for CERTAINTY. Thus, De
Niro missed his speech like a sophist.
De Niro is a workforce. He has as a big weapon his fingers that push the trigger.
Not to mention many extras whose death is announced with few bullets received below the
cranial vault, signature of De Niro.
▪ Pesci as a hypothetical god of stratagems has two knowledges:
o Pragmatism, allowing him to make THE DIAGNOSIS. The sequence of fixing the truck
is a good example.
o Psychoanalysis, allowing him to read in the minds of others. The sequence of De
Niro's daughter who knew a little something is another example.
Pesci has a big weapon: INSPECTION, making observation a mean of truth
One and only paradox, it is De Niro's daughter, like a deaf-mute having recourse to
KNOWLEDGE by SIGHT.
In different settings, she could have been the spiritual son of Pesci in this phallocrat
organization. She is like a mirror that reflects a judged and judgeable image defining one's
identity. She recalls the reflective mirror-like shield of PERSEUS.
Pesci is the cleaner of the organization, if not the regulator. All his decisions are executed by
his faithful dog.
Later, he will introduce this latter to Pacino to control him, manage him and finally execute
him.
De Niro and Pesci are winners. They will wait for death in their respective chairs like kings.
▪ Pacino, President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, flirting at high levels
with the organization is an extravert personage handling rhetoric with brilliance as the attic
speaker DEMOSTHENE. His major weapon is therefore his tongue.
However, he always needs third parties to exist. He forbids his interlocuters to drink before
or during interviews.
Also, his intransigence with respect to the accuracy of his meetings reveals his weak control
of flexibilities.
Pacino, after getting out of prison claimed his union as Julius Caesar changing the Republic of
Rome to a dictatorship.
Pacino is a looser. He died at the hands of Brutus - De Niro with the approval of the majority
of senators-chiefs of the organization.
The betrayal of his adoptive son recalls that of Caligula towards Tiberius.
The epilog is a long adagio assai that recalls Beethoven's marcia funebre.
De Niro who personifies death from the beginning has finally a legitimate meeting with it. He
has lost everything, even contact with his beloved daughter; he only can turn to the
ETERNAL, like JUDE APOSTLE. He watches the arrival of the reaper leaving his door half
opened.
The camera's movement as if death is roaming around, has been seen three times: opening,
ending, and when De Niro, who was DEATH, was looking in a restaurant for a person who
was not there.
Not to mention the close and deep relationship between the organization, the union and
politics. However, that is another anthropological aspect of the story and history.
About the rejuvenation of our three actors, we were left hungry. We would have loved to see
their faces from Godfather, Casino, Goodfellas and other Serpico. However, this
technological feat at its first steps is far from reaching the Jupiter's Fountain of Youth.
By contrasting the three men's profiles, the difference between their acting can be revealed:
the theatrical acting of Pacino, being an extravert character is opposed to the
cinematographic just acting of the couple De Niro - Pesci.
The soundtrack of the movie is a nostalgic long trip in this America in a discomfort state.
In total, Scorsese gave us a REALISTIC vision of the organization, this time without the
exuberant luxury of Goodfellas and Casino.
One last sneaky metaphor: life is a metaphor of death.

Pacino's big outbursts are staccato and forced, but you can feel the whole of age-free hollywood cheering him on with tears in their eyes. Out here in the real world, they all just looked a bit odd.

The film is a homily to the old Scorsese mob films like Goodfellas, and while The Irishman does new things with the concept, I still think the two films are quite alike. I am not blown away by The Irishman, and the deft direction kept me nodding my head, but not dropping my jaws awe. I feel like there are a lot of missed potential, rooms for more emotion. Too subdued and subtle for my taste. The story feels a bit unfocused in the grander scheme of things, and its unique structure actually hampers it a little.<br/><br/>I rank this considerably lower than Scorsese's best films, and a rank lower than Goodfellas."

No doubt many of them have profited in some way from this film being made as well. Pathetic.<br/><br/>That being said, yes, it was good seeing these actors come back together for one last hurrah. There are problems with the age depiction sure, but whatever.. each and every one of them did a fantastic job in their roles.

"demented_peruvian","7","1","2","4 December 2019"," Scorcese revisiting prior movies to explore Final Impenitence/Contrition over Obstinacy
","As one watches ""The Irishman"" (apparently not Scorcese's preferred title) you are eventually hit with the same criticism that audiences had with ""Casino"" 24 years prior: this is fun and interesting, but feels an awful lot like a retread of Scorcese's prior DeNiro/Pesci modern mobster movies. So the question, especially in light of Scorcese's protracted rants about what is and isn't 'art' in films is: why bother doing a re-tread so familiar that if someone else did it, they would be accused of being Scorcese-like (e.g. ""Blow"", ""Black Mass""), with the only apparent novelty of it being full of CGI typically used in movies he criticizes? It turns out that audiences have to wait almost 3 hours to get the answer: a new epilogue, which gives a Catholic closure that other Scorcese films lack.<br/><br/>As famous as they are for their violence and depiction of sleazy behavior, Scorcese's movies are centered around Catholic concepts. If you take out the rock documentaries and ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", you have a couple of Paul Schraeder tales centered on wrath and envy; a tale of revenge and honesty; a tale of lust; three nightmares, one about lust and two about guilt; two tales of pride vs shame; 3 religious epics exploring virtue versus humanity; and a long series of criminal bromances which deal with Greed, Gluttony, Wrath, dishonesty, and jealousy. Four of these are directed in a signature dynamic style, which have influenced Tarantino and Danny Boyle, among others. ""The Irishman"" is a 5th addition, but the main focus of this bromance is Killing. Starting with 1 hour into the movie, characters are only introduced and defined by the way that they will die or mysteriously disappear.<br/><br/>Between killings and mobsters mouthing off about respect, Scorcese's Netflix opus is casually filled with Catholic rites, showing baptisms, weddings, funerals, and a banquet akin to a Confirmation ceremony. It is easy to miss until the last half hour, which more openly focuses much on last rites and Confession. The sin in this case is a mortal sin of Killing (spilling the blood of Adam, if you will), among others, and its lead character descends into purgatory. Scorcese has not found salvation for his criminals before. ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" left off suggesting Obstinancy in Sin, ""The Departed"" suggested heavenly punishment for Mortal Sin without Final Impenitence, and ""Raging Bull"" suggests purgatory (originally defined as externally living in isolation) for its somewhat repentant character. Whereas ""Shutter Island"" suggested the acceptance of guilt, and most recently ""Silence"" had its main characters possibly finding a way out of Despair and Impugning the Known Truth. ""The Irishman"" wrestles with escaping Purgatory via trying to make ammends and build a legacy, but the movie suggests that only proper Confession will do. Perhaps most revealing that this is the part that Scorcese was most interested in doing, is that in this last part is that DeNiro finally seems more comfortable in showing his acting chops, and Rodrigo Santoro's cinematography occasionally makes an effort to give more stylish images, after 3 hours of mostly shots of the actors from the chest up at a 60 degree angle, employing a dull green palette. Unfortunately, it ends suggesting that the character will only tell you half of the truth, but in an anticlimactic way that might make you react 'that's it?'.<br/><br/>But three hours to get there is a bit much, more so when the narrative becomes unfocused and repetitive, and occasionally shots are added or scenes unnecessarily extended to pad out time - or so it feels. If it was to build on a feeling, it must have been hit/miss. It starts out strong, as Joe Pesci comes out of retirement but surprisingly plays the serene, fatherly criminal boss, and the maniacal greedy hothead role goes to someone else. Pesci is great, and bonds well with DeNiro, and this chemistry keeps the story going for about 40 minutes. When it feels like it is running out of energy, in comes the actor doing the 'Pesci role': Al Pacino as... Jimmy Hoffa? Pacino is a lot of fun at first, and easily steals the movie. Unlike Robert Blake and Jack Nicholson, he doesn't even try to look (other than a haircut), act, or sound like Hoffa. Replacing Hoffa's squinty eyes and Transatlantic accent is Al Pacino in full 1990s mode, with a wide-eyed surprised look and thick eyebrows that make him look like a Muppet, as he rants and raves. He gets away with it for the first hour, while we get an entertaining alternate tour of political history of the 1960s. Whether Pacino's performance was meant to be a commentary on 2010s politicians is up for debate. I am already used to Scorcese's casting of stars who do not look or sound like who they are supposed to be. Unfortunately, during the 2nd hour of this, Hoffacino's repeated insulting feels more like Triumph the Insult Dog, and, unless you are really a fan of mob movies where tacky characters go on and on and on about demanding respect from each other, it gets tiresome. Pacino hurls an insult that ends in ""sucker"" so often that it becomes drinking game fodder, and one might start rooting for him to make his celebrated disappearance.<br/><br/>The screenplay is at its best, as usual for Scorcese's kinetic crime flicks, when it goes through details explaining the modus operandi of the crimes, the slang, and behind-the-scenes details of known historical events. As engaging as most of the story is, the narrative itself has a couple of issues, the first one being structural. It starts off a character recalling an event (which eventually unfolds into the actual plot), and then goes further back in history, occasionally returning to the other later event. This is probably meant to reflect the way a person might tell a personal anecdote, and it works at first, but it gets a bit messy later when going back and forth between times, especially when it involves events where the narrator is not present. We are also left wondering: to whom is Frank telling his story? Are we the confessor? The other issue was an underdeveloped subplot regarding another mystery killing in the mob world for which the main character takes credit. The background is not well explained, and I had to stop and do some research to fully understand what was going on. There are some repetitive exchanges or unnecessarily prolonged scenes that could have been cut down to make room for at least 20 seconds worth of explaining the American Italian Anti-Defamation League, and another 10 more on Crazy Joe. There is a third element that has drawn some criticism from others, but I didn't mind: the daughter as mostly silent witness, serving as a form of conscience, and/or representation of ideals.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the visuals. Scorcese has been requesting that the movie be seen in a screen no smaller than 'a large iPad', without further explanation. Unfortunately, most of the visuals are quite standard or uninspired. Scorcese earns some credit for filming in authentic-looking locations, correctly capturing the houses and neighborhoods of eastern Pennsylvania. The 'wall paintings' are done quite effectively. There is the occasional varied camerawork, but it feels unnecessary: zooming in and out during court hearings; the camera spinning around inside a car to observe through the windows how Jimmy Hoffa is walking towards it; following a minor character down a hallway without good reason, then turning back down the hallway in a lame attempt to trick the audience that it's a continuous shot. Some crane shots of Hoffa in court and of Frank Sheeran walking into places work fine, but are not memorable. Then there are some visual homages to other directors: a couple of scenes (an assassination on steps off a plane; golfing) are done in the visual style of early 1990s Oliver Stone, whose political historical films of that era intersect narratively with this one. There's a key scene of Frank beating up someone in the street, clearly imitating Sonny beating up his brother-in-law in ""The Godfather"", except that it hits a clumsy point as DeNiro's physicality betrays him, and a character yells in pain when DeNiro fails to connect a kick. Which brings me to the main question: does the Anti-Aging work? Somewhat. Overall, the characters always look 10 years older than they are supposed to. The CGI is seamless if watched in a good quality large cell phone or a low resolution TV, but in a larger, new TV (e.g. 48 inch), the CGI looks off in the first 40 minutes. DeNiro's face looks strange; in what seems at an attempt to simultaneously de-age him and give him some of the real Frank's features, he looks vaguely Asian at times or eastern European. Then there's the color of his eyes, which feel inconsistent, and notably glow bright green in some scenes. There's some discussion whether this is an artistic decision, and marks emotional states or moral decisions of Frank, but I did not catch on to a consistent enough pattern; you can decide. Regardless, it was sometimes distracting. So no, this is not one of Scorcese's visual epics, like ""Raging Bull"", ""Kundun"", ""Hugo"" or ""The Aviator"". And sonically, it was Scorcese's standard collection of well-placed oldies.<br/><br/>In summary, ""The Irishman"" is a mostly entertaining tale, especially if you like his similar-themed/structured films. The pacing is uneven, and he could have trimmed down many repetitive scenes; this is the 2nd film in a row of his that I felt that he didn't know when to stop in the 2nd act. The final act is the notable difference from very familiar territory, and Pesci's different performance stands out as one of the year's best, in an otherwise fun but not very inspired retread."

"mickclarke48","8","1","2","4 December 2019"," The Irishman (2019): The End of a Saga
","In as much as it closes the circle begun with ""Mean Streets ""The Irishman ""is much less the typical stylistic bloodfest gangster movie and more a somewhat nostalgic and sobering look at what it means to be human, exploring ,as it does, some universal themes of loyalty ,friendship,weakness,power,love ,and most of all mortality. All within the construct of the gangster idiom.<br/><br/>Is frank's soldier mentality a weakness or a strength ,especially since it leads to the deaths of others.? Does his love of his family and loyalty to his friends make him any less of a psychopath,who feels no remorse for his crimes but can nevertheless tear up at the assasination of his boss's enemy Jack Kennedy.<br/><br/>There are of course many references to earlier chapters in the saga. The opening tracking shot introducing us to the care room reminds us of the dolly shot in ""Mean Streets"" where Harvey Keitel seems to float through the air in his entry to the night club to the music of the Stones. The racist slurs from Hoffa echo Keitel's concern about being seen dating a black woman in"" Mean Streets.""<br/><br/>Whilst there are several reminders of""Goodfellas""-Frank's stomping on the grocer,his excessive reaction to his daughter being pushed,reminding us of Liotta's pistol whipping the guy who makes a pass at Karen ,and the near kicking to death of Billy Batts. Hoffa's comment on everyone being called Tony reminds us of Karen's ""everyone's called Paulie or Maria ""in ""Goodfellas"". There's a garotting in a car in both films and various shots to the head.<br/><br/>But the difference is that these fellas are not outsiders/outlaws ,but part of the very fabric of power and all the more sinister and chilling for that.<br/><br/>It is a typically grandiose production from the master with all the usual suspects doing what they do best with Pesci for me the standout in one of his most understated performances as Mephistopheles to Frank's Faust,the brains behind so many thrones. De Niro by contrast comes over as a bit one paced at times. Pacino climbs to the top on several occasions, threatening to go over as usual but only just restraining himself. Several excellent cameos from supporting characters Tony Pro,Salerno, Joey Gallo,contribute greatly to the real life feel of the whole enterprise:as does the blackest of humour,much of it of a racist hue. Sepia tones and ambient lighting ,together with the usual trademark effective use of contemporaneous music helps ground the action in the time periods covered ,whilst Robbie Robertson's original soundtrack contributes atmosphere.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the lack of an intermission but it would have been hard to locate a suitable juncture.<br/><br/>The slow protracted build up to the Hoffa assasination was very effective in heightening what was for Frank his most difficult and tense moment,but perhaps some trimming could have been done thereafter as we proceeded to follow the rest of the cast to the exit door.<br/><br/>A great watch."
"Adityaaaaa","9","1","2","4 December 2019"," A beautifully filmed, outstandingly presented and powerfully resonant masterpiece of an epic...
","'The Irishman': Martin Scorsese directing a three-hour plus biographical-gangster epic starring Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci with an abundance of supporting roles including Harvey Keitel, Anna Paquin, Ray Romano and many, many more. It wouldn't be far from the truth to say that I was hyped as anything to watch this movie. And I was truly not disappointed. If anything, I was rewarded.<br/><br/>Despite it's hefty run time, the movie never feels slow. Now, the first half of the second half is a bit uneven in the sense that it's time jumping montages aren't too clear and make the movie feel a little bit sprawling, but it never for a second seems to drag or feel boring. In fact, it's as brilliantly entertaining as anything. The lengthy duration is needed for the emotional weight and to introduce, build on and develop the complex relationships between its characters, and even then, you barely feel the run time thanks to how explosively fun this movie makes itself. Every scene is packed with either information, tension, comedy or character-development, and it never feels like a chore. The dialogue of the screenplay, first-off, is amazing. It feels real and gritty, but also stylised and epic. I don't know how Steven Zaillian managed to pull that off, but he did. Scorsese's direction is constantly electric, packed with energy when it needs energy, and melodrama when it needs melodrama. He knows exactly what to show the audience to bring suspense in later scenes, while also knowing what not to show the audience to keep the mystery. The lush production design cannot be understated either.<br/><br/>Another point that adds to the entertainment value, is of course the cast. This is probably my personal favourite DeNiro performance I have ever seen, and that's saying something. His character isn't one with too much emotion, but you can feel what he's feeling and think what he's thinking even when his character's face is blank-slated and his character's mouth is silent. You can fully comprehend the complex emotions of their characters without a single expression or a single word. I don't know how, but both those guys manage to do it. Pacino and Pesci are undoubtedly great as well. DeNiro is full of bleak emotion, Pacino is full of energy, and Pesci is full of mystery. Anna Paquin's character doesn't have too much to say in this movie, but her character's presence is strongly felt throughout thanks to the immediate sympathy we feel for her character, played both as Paquin as an adult, and Lucy Gallina as a child. And her character might just turn out to be the most resonant of all.<br/><br/>The cast brings me on to a commonly discussed aspect of the film: the CGI de-ageing. You can sometimes tell when the CGI has been used (particularly in the eyes), but honestly, it's never distracting. It just looks like a super high-quality video-game and if anything- it's good.<br/><br/>Now onto the flaws. I talked a bit about how the narrative sprawls about a little bit during the start of the second act, and that's the only real flaw I have, but there's many VERY small, VERY picky flaws that I think I should so for the sake of the review. Thelma Schoonmaker is, of-course, legendary for her editing, and the editing in this film is great, both in the smaller, tighter scenes, and the sprawling, time-jumping montages. It's not only perfectly timed, but also rich with subtext. But there are just two choices she made that I didn't fully agree with. There are many instances in the movie where characters discreetly attempt to hear other's conversations, but there's no change in camera angles to signify them doing so, and I didn't understand why. It was most probably intentional, knowing she has the capability to change conversation scenes, but I don't know why. The second choice is a VERY picky one, but I'll say it anyway. The character of Hoffa has, understandably, a lot of build-up, and it pays off tremendously thanks to Pacino's performance, which always feels enthusiastically charismatic and larger-than-life as it should be, but the first shot we get of him could have used more build up. It just feels so casual. Sure it's with an immediate close-up, but as it's on a phone scene with DeNiro's character, I just think it should have taken it's time to reveal the character, like maybe hear a few of his words first, to keep us anticipating, then BOOM- showing Pacino for the first time. I guess it was to give it an element of surprise? That's probably why. But that's about it, really. There's one more REALLY picky nitpick I have, but this time, about the cinematography. It's fantastic, both visually and artistically, but, without trying to give too much away, there was one thing I wish could have been added: There's a scene where two characters are talking about how much trouble another character is getting into, while he's on the other side of a railing. This was a great opportunity to use put the camera right behind the railing, and make it appear as if the character was caged, or barred, to symbolise his troubles. Scorsese has done this many times before, but I don't know why this particular shot wasn't shot this way. Maybe to make it seem like the character is free in his own sense and doesn't know how much trouble he is getting into? I don't know. I hope so.<br/><br/>Now these flaws are REALLY, REALLY picky, and I'm sorry. But I still gave this film 4.5/5 stars for a reason. Now I would have probably only given 4 stars (still good) if it wasn't for one thing: the third act of the film. The third act of this film is probably my favourite of any film I have ever seen in my whole life. It lasts just over an hour and is a complete redemption of any flaw, big or small this movie may have. It starts off with a gripping conversation that changes everything we ever thought about how this film would go, and then, Scorsese enters a roughly 20-minute long sequence that's easily one of the most suspenseful, heart-pounding and intense sequence ever put on film. Instantly classic. It shifts between silence, thought and a conversation about fish, and it ends with an absolute bang. By the, the plot is practically over. Yet there is still around 40 minutes of the movie left. It is like an epilogue to tie up all the loose ends and give an emotional closure, and I would go as far as to say that the epilogue wasn't a conclusion to the film. Rather: every second of the film lead up to this gigantic epilogue. It is in this epilogue that we see the main philosophy, the main moral compass, and the main theme that this movie was exploring. It's genuinely one of the most profoundly poignant and emotionally resonant end I have ever seen. And the sad ending lingers on for a long, long time. Now this is the not the kind of sad that makes you want to cry- it's the kind of sad that makes you sit completely still in silence, and just think, as all the complexities of the movie are allowed to wash over you. And that feeling is only added thanks to one of the best closing shots in film history, that can be interpreted in a number of ways. Truly amazing cinematography shown here.<br/><br/>It really is a beautifully made masterpiece with a profound moral message, and it's honestly one of my favourite films ever.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:
'The Irishman' is genuinely a beautifully filmed, outstandingly presented and powerfully resonant masterpiece of an epic from Martin Scorsese and an explosive all-star ensemble cast, with two and half hours of truly extraordinary development of its many full-fleshed characters and their relationships that bridges and builds up to an hour-long third act which masterfully contains an overwhelming amount of tension that then explodes into a sombre, melancholy and deeply emotional epilogue that easily redeems the film of it's small flaws with an ending that lingers on in the transfixed minds of the audience long after the credits roll."

I was eagerly looking forward to a crime flick that would be a fitting addition to Goodfellas and Casino, both movies that are faultless.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was left less than impressed, the movie still has the fingerprints of greatness, and from
Any other director it'd be their crowning achievement, but Scorsese has previously set a high sets serf for himself and this did not live up<br/><br/>The anti ageing SFX in some scenes looked uncanny, but in others looked like the same animation used in the Tintin movie, not helped by the fact that the 'youthful' DeNiro still moved like an elderly and arthritic old man, especially evident when he gives a beating to the store manager that shoved his daughter<br/><br/>The running time was excessive, normally I'd hope for longer running time but this was about an hour longer than necessary. This is the first Scorsese movie I actually got bored watching.<br/><br/>DeNiro's character was supposed to be a hulking menace, a man that had killed many in the war, and killed many on the streets as a hit man and yet he portrayed the character as an eager to please guy who lacked conviction and seemed to not have a great degree of confidence, he seemed a reluctant passenger to Pacino<br/><br/>Speaking of Pacino, he stole the movie with his performance, dominating every scene he was in.<br/><br/>All in all, too long, dodgy SFX didn't quite do it and DeNiro didn't bring his A Game"

Cinematography and background score is menacing and equally full of suspense.i especially like those shots when de niro throws guns in the canal after getting the job done.Joe pesci 's character is astonishing as a mentor and equally secretive as a mafia leader.
Al pacino's character is energetic ,funny & strong in morality just like his good ol young days.
What is great about this movie is the entire cast & their phenomenal one time acting & The director.
Gangster,crime,drama genre movies will soon go extinct if we dont appriciate these movies within time.<br/><br/>

","I was prepared to watch this movie for months now, but it has been released and I started watching the film with as few expectations as possible, and I made sure to not compare it to Goodfellas while watching. I was interested in knowing wether it would be worth a length time of 3 hours and 30 minutes, and it was!<br/><br/>I can list multiple positives about this movie. The acting quality was amazing and it was fantastic to see Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino come together and put hard work in the acting of the film. I was also quite surprised to see Joe Pesci play a different role than what I was expecting from him, but it worked, and in my opinion he played the role at the same quality as he did in his role in Goodfellas.<br/><br/>The historical context was great to see, and the flashbacks were great to see too. The cinematography was thought out perfectly and the film looked accurate for the time it was set. The makeup was not bad and the actors were performing their roles accurate to the age they were supposed to be playing throughout the whole movie. What stood out to me the most was the dialogue, and that is what kept me immersed for the whole duration of the film, I enjoyed it. The sound and lighting were used to add to the experience in a good way too.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised if this film wins at least one Oscar. Martin Scorsese did a great job with directing this movie, just like he did in his other movies.<br/><br/>Don't watch this film expecting to see too many action/gangster moments because this film has the full experience. 9/10 from me!"

Led by Martin Scorsese, De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci have pulled it off again. They created a powerful epic spanning almost 50 years. And yes, it's a mobster movie!

","Not only boring, but offensive. Scorsese sucking up to gangsters in some juvenile revisionist rubbish. The lack of nuance or exploration of the dark side of these real life monsters in this disaster is simply unbelievable.<br/><br/>At least a third of the scenes do nothing to drive the plot or develop the characters, and several of those pointless scenes are just awful.<br/><br/>The performances from the entire cast are Mediocre at best, not a single stand out, and a few actors are just parodying themselves (did they think it was a comedy)? It was as if Scorsese said to them ""OK choose one of your favourite previous roles, and then give me 50~70% of that"", and then they all said ""Naaaa Marty, I'm old, how about I just show up, and do a lame impersonation of myself""? And then Marty just said, ""Sure, but don't over do it, why the heck not<br/><br/>I would have given it 4 or 5, but the production values, attention to period specific detail, and soundtrack are goodish.An hour too long suck up to murderers, just awful."
"DjfunkmasterG","9","1","2","28 November 2019"," Probably the last great classic gangster picture we will ever see.
","Ok, so the new Scorsese film... where to begin.<br/><br/>I hope that anyone truly interested in cinema watches this picture. The Irishman is not like anything we have watched or witnessed in 24 years.<br/><br/>Scorsese, always a fantastic director has always had a tight hand on the gangster picture genre. While he has not visited this material in its true form since 1995's Casino, you can still catch glimpses of his great handling of gangster material in The Departed.<br/><br/>Scorsese has managed to assemble a gangster-esqe Avengers of sorts. Bringing out all the heavy hitters for one last show of a genre of cinema which has been long lost in the carnival of superhero films that have cluttered cinemas for the last 20+ years.<br/><br/>
The Irishman, clocking in at 3.5 hours moves with a sustained pacing that never wastes a single minute of its running time. DeNiro, serving as the narrator gives the audience a ghostly performance as a working man who rose up the ranks of the Philadelphia crime families and the Teamsters union by not just stepping outside the law to cut side deals to feed his family but to later rise up the ranks to become one of the most powerful non-mafia/italian born characters in this tale.<br/><br/>The Irishman, clocking at 3.5 hours moves with a sustained pacing that never wastes a single minute of its running time. DeNiro, serving as the narrator gives the audience a ghostly performance as a working man who rose up the ranks of the Philadelphia crime families and the Teamsters union by not justt stepping outside the law to cut side deals to feed his family but to later rise up the ranks to become one of the most powerful non-mafia/Italian born characters in this tale.<br/><br/>DeNiro effectively portrays an emotionally closed-off family man who has grown so immune to the brutality he not only witnessed but carried out that you really start to think that his self inflicted mental state was something he carried through his entire life. Now, some can easily say he is Irish and like most of the Irish (Myself being half) we kind of never show emotion or air our issues because it can convey weakness  in the armor. No matter how you look at it, Deniro effectively pulled this off to such a great length he truly has to be commended for his ghostly approach to the character.<br/><br/>Pesci, normally know for being the off the hook, crazy as hell gangster is actually playing 100% opposite of his previous work with Scorsese, and let me tell you, his crack at Philly Crime Boss Russell Bufalino is one of the best performances he has given since Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Even Harvey Keitel and Bobby Cannavale who are used sporadically embrace their respective characters and bring the full game to the court and it shows.<br/><br/>What you do not get from The Irishman that you do from other Scorsese gangster pictures is a perspective from the wives (Lorraine Bracco and Sharon Stone roles from the previous films). The wives are merely a backdrop to fill int he family picture and have no real purpose or resonance in the film. However, this is being told from the perspective of Frank (DeNiro).<br/><br/>A note must be made that crim historians have been vocal in stating that Frank Sheeran may have embellished, at great lengths, his total involvements in everything depicted, but I am not here to do a comparison of truth versus fiction. This story by Zaillian is based on the book I Paint Houses. Which is supposed to a biography of Frank. So take the complete story depicted in The Irishman with a grain of salt when compared to historical facts.<br/><br/>In closing, I urge my friends and fellow readers to watch this film and embrace everything it gives to you from the cinematic POV that is portrayed. Films of this nature are not going to be found as we move forward in cinema and this may be the last great motion picture from the gangster genre ever created.<br/><br/>My overall score, a 10 out of 10, which is rare for me to give in this day and age.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

","Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King Of Comedy, Goodfellas, Casino, Cape Fear, The Departed, Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence and now The Irishman. Most Directors would give a limb to have made just one of these magisterial films. That list numbers 12. And then there's a bunch more of note sitting just below these.<br/><br/>The cinema industry is up in arms at Netflix pinching surely one of Scorsese's last great outings from under their noses.<br/><br/>£200m was pumped into this movie that's been sitting around, unmade for a decade.<br/><br/>It tempted Joe Pesci out of his retirement and put Pacino, Pesci and De Niro under Scorsese's gaze for the first time.<br/><br/>And what a gaze.<br/><br/>In a 210 minute film that gives about 5 to women this is a man's, man's, man's outing to outman all of its lofty predecessors, but there were many women in the audience of the big screen showing I attended and they loved it.<br/><br/>Anna Pacquin, De Niro's daughter, is the only female character of note in the movie (the wives are fairly incidental). Her single scripted word screams volumes from the screen and makes her appearance meritorious despite its paucity.<br/><br/>Pacino and Pesci are wonderful, but it's a De Niro movie. Scorsese's real muse this bookend's both of their careers starting with Taxi Driver and surely ending here. It's a massive performance full of grit, humour and pathos. It's simply breathtaking. Especially when you consider the mid - late career crud that De Niro has been serving us. Note this, Phoenix has competition for the Oscar that we all thought was surely a shoo-in only a month or two ago.<br/><br/>The humour is unexpected and one scene, in particular, where an absurd conversation about a fish takes place in a car, reminds us of the Chicken Royale scene in Pulp Fiction. Clearly Scorsese has been noting the competition and, here, matches or possibly even exceeds them.<br/><br/>This demands to be seen on the big screen. The monumental running time sits better with a cinema screening where you can tackle it in its full immensity without trips to the teapot (or wine cellar - it's a two bottler). What it allows Scorsese is the time to tell a complex tale languidly. It gives him room to explore male relationships, bonding and latterly reflection on a life that has much shame.<br/><br/>That Scorsese takes maybe 30 minutes to conclude a movie that in other hands would last five is telling. But it's exactly this that lies at the heart of an epic that sadly many will just say is boring.<br/><br/>It's anything but.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the 'de-aging' technology, mostly critically, but it really helps to tell a four decade story using the same actors throughout. OK it made De Niro a little rosy cheeked at times, but it gets away with it. And the ageing of Pesci, in particular, is amazing. His final scenes of a man in very old age are moving and gripping.,<br/><br/>I was blown away."
"Professr-4","3","4","19","29 November 2019"," A Hoffa You Can't Refuse?
","This plays like a warmed-over collection of Scorsese's greatest hits-the long tracking shots, the voiceover, the script which has every character speaking the same way (not just the same as everyone else in the movie, but the same as everyone in every Scorsese movie), the masterful but repetitive scenes of violence. The two supposed driving forces of the film are never fully justified, those being Sheeran's motivation for being a hitman, and his daughter's extreme disdain for him. The justification for Sheeran's life of violence seems to be nothing more than his wartime experience, where ""I seen things, man. I seen things."" Peggy's dislike for her father is shown to be due to his penchant for brutality and spontaneous violence. She transfers that to Russ as well, presumably because her father works for him and he has the same tendencies. But then she becomes completely infatuated with Hoffa, who is cut from the exact same cloth as the other two, the only difference being he buys her ice cream. The fact that this movie is phoned-in Scorsese does not mean it isn't fun to watch, although it really drags the last 45 minutes or so, as we wait for the main characters to die off, the only saving grace being being our relief in knowing that they can finally shut off that damn CGI machine."
"Martinito_08183","9","2","7","8 March 2020"," Another classic from Martin Scorsese.
","Back in the 1970s there were five filmmakers that gained so much attention not only by the critics, but also by the audience as well and all five of them received huge critical praises that even today are considered some of the greatest in film history and of course those five names are Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and Brian De Palma. Those names changed films forever and even the way we tell stories in general, but sadly nowadays out the five filmmakers only Martin Scorsese has retained the most vitality in his filmography, he rarely had a misstep and he still retains the voice and energy in his films that he's never lost, while the other four somehow just lost the magic of what made them fantastic in the first place and one of them is clearly trying so bad to bring back his old self, but doesn't succeed all that much (i'm looking at you, Steven Spielberg).<br/><br/>The film is very long and it is something that will definitely be criticized so much by many people for it's runtime. To be honest - i didn't had any problem with the runtime at all, since some of my favorite films of all time are super long, so i'm very used to it and i don't have complaints here. If a director wants to take his time to tell the story the right way, then they have my full support. I still find it weird that today not many directors make long films and people complain about a film being too long, since back in the twentieth century we had films that lasted over four to five hours. After watching the film, it didn't felt like it was three and half hours long thanks to the fantastic editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. For me it felted like it was an hour shorter. If you're still not convinced about the runtime, then my only suggestion is this: if you have a day that you're not studying at school, university or you've taken a day off from working, then the best option is to watch the film in the morning (this is exactly what i chose to do today) and by the time you finish the film or any film that is three hours long or more, then you have a long day ahead of you. Yes - the night time is always the best time to experience any film, but it does exist a moment, where you realize when the film is over - it's already the time that you have to go to bed.<br/><br/>What Martin Scorsese was able to bring to the big screen is truly incredible and with his masterful direction and Steven Zaillian's screenwriting talent (""Schindler's List"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""Moneyball"" and David Fincher's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"") were able to bring this story to life. Originally i didn't know what to think about this story that Martin Scorsese chose to adapt and tell, since i'm not all that familiar with Frank Sheeran, Jimmy Hoffa and the Bufalino crime family, but i did find it very interesting and after seeing the film - i really want to do a research to know more, because not all films that are based on true events cover everything in full detail and sometimes they do change things on purpose. Probably some things don't translate very well, when you adapt true events into a film.<br/><br/>I'm so happy to see Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci in a great film again, because De Niro and Pacino have been in some shockingly terrible trash nowadays and Pesci is basically retired, so it's wonderful to see them give their best as actors once again. It's the case of when you have the right person behind the scenes showing how passionate he (the director) is, when he makes the films that he wants and motivates the actors to make something truly amazing, so that they can give their best as professional actors. The way they deliver their lines of dialogue and how all of it comes out from their mouths - it doesn't feels like it's scripted and it flows so naturally. It's so amazing the way these fantastic actors disappear and in their place the characters that they play came alive.<br/><br/>Alongside with it's amazing camera work, fantastic music (which perfectly reflects the time periods that the film is told), great sound, mind-blowing visual effects (i don't have the best eye for CGI, since i'm one of those people, who can't really notice bad CGI, unless it's very terrible or very noticeable (there are still times that i can tell, but when they are done so well - it's very hard to notice), but i was still surprised of how incredible all of it looked, even thought there was one moment where the physical performance of Robert De Niro wasn't all that convincing) - all of those aspects come together to make this film.<br/><br/>The only complaints that i have with ""The Irishman"" is that some of the side characters were very underutilized, especially Anna Paquin's character (Frank Sheeran's daughter, when she's older). When Peggy was young she had more screen time, but when she got older we don't see her enough. I understand why, since we're experiencing all of the events through Frank Sheeran's point of view. She looked up to Jimmy Hoffa and when she realizes that her father killed him - she doesn't want to have nothing to do with him and her father wasn't involved all that much in her childhood along with her sisters, which is very understandable, but i think it would have been better if we had the chance of knowing her more, but we don't and because of that - it doesn't have a huge impact to Frank Sheeran's arc. The other complaint that have is very small: scene where Frank Sheeran goes with his daughter to beat up a store owner of a supermarket, because he shoved her. He goes inside the supermarket and starts beating him up and the beat up continues outside. The punches and the kicking didn't look convincing at all and i wanted to point that out. Even though i did praised the CGI - i do have a small problem with that aspect. I did notice that they used CGI blood and those moments are the only time where the CGI was noticeable.<br/><br/>In short - it's fantastic that Martin Scorsese is still doing great work at the age of 77 (by the time i'm writing the review) and has this energy of continuing to make films that he's still passionate. If the film was directed by a different person, then the whole thing would probably not have worked in the way that Netflix was expecting. ""The Irishman"" will definitely be considered by many as a classic like the previous films by Martin Scorsese and each generation will have the chance to experience the tale of Frank Sheeran. I'm giving ""The Irishman"" a 9.4/10."

","There was no specific character building which I was expecting since it's such a long movie. You go with the story and sometimes the scenes are too stretched or are even unnecessary at time. Scorcese could've easily mould it into a 2 - 2:30hr movie but maybe that was important according to his perspective. The movie goes quite normal till 1hr then the protagonist is like perplexed and doubtful of his own company/people he is with. It does not show but maybe that was happened when he took a different turn because his other friend made him understand that way. Story was derived from a book, so I guess this is the best it could've been. There's no way you won't like it if you liked Goodfellas. Only thing, here's no substance involved. Maybe you'll wanna watch it for Scorcese. I'm gonna conclude it's a solid 8 from me."

","At present it was very convenient a film as such, which deals with mobsters and the murky world surrounding it (unions, politicians and others), it´s the world where words as nasty, bs, rats and other vulgar words-expressions are quite common. The good thing here is that these elements always finish in prison, they mock the law but up to a limit, and usually the rats are all trapped at once. Hoffa was a powerful man but supported by other groups. With no support of the power Hoffa, union´s boss, would've been nothing. That's why it is a good film for reflexion, moreover for those who claims victory early not taking into account that support can sink any time. Interesting film and plot, congrats to Martin Scorsese for bringing together a group of experienced actors, who, as usual, excelled in this film. Joe Pesci was simply outstanding, Al Pacino and De Niro also but a little bit less than the first mentioned. The make up of these actors was also extraordinary. They look young, then a bit older and finally ancient, magic make up."
"Offworld_Colony","7","2","7","5 February 2020"," The Irishman is an interesting experiment made by a Veteran who isn't afraid of trying new things for better and worse...
","...The film didn't seem too long despite the fact that objectively the running time is very long. It also felt very much like a film, I'm glad it wasn't cannibalised for TV.<br/><br/>It's a solid film, impressive sometimes and ordinary other times, the Jimmy Hoffa posturing in -front of a microphone business was sometimes a little rote, Pacino coming off a little one-note at first despite the fact that the book hinges on it and it's a story that (as raised in the film) has passed out of public consciousness now. Maybe it's because it's called The Irishman that I went in not expecting it to revolve entirely around Jimmy Hoffa until a wikipedia on the source material afterwards. (Who am I kidding, it was during).<br/><br/>Which brings me to the Title Card that flashes up: I Heard You Paint Houses, which at first I thought must have been a title card, but by the end I knew was Scorcese being subversive and subtle as usual, having his cake and eating it. I enjoyed that.<br/><br/>More subversion for me comes in the form of (eventually) Anna Paquin's daughter character. Much maligned recently for its lack of dialogue, I actually think the role has more presence than any of the other nonsense. Most dialogue is as sociopathic and soulless and workmanlike as the man himself, Jimmy a man broken and remade as a killer by the War, and so much of it is meaningless. Anna Paquin's stare, her broken accusatory look, pained but as if suppressing permanently, was actually very powerful, and to be able to link the child and adult actors wih the same feeling inside their characters is an inspired bit of casting and directing.<br/><br/>De Niro is stunning and every bit the actor throughout that he has been his whole life. Unlike Pacino who blossoms half way through, he's incredible from the start. His V/O is very very good (incidentally the device that makes it look like he's talking to no one is excessively effective and cheeky) and he manages to (unlike Joe Pesci) act young. With exception of the bit where he crushes the man's hand where he walks and moves like a 70-year-old man.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the CGI, undeniably groundbreaking, and sometimes effective to a wonderful degree, and other times completely jarring and awkward and pulls you straight out of the movie. The eyes feel wrong, almost throughout, too blue, too CGI and sometimes too doe-eyed and glasssy, and sometimes the lips are terrible. And that magic of having DeNiro play a young Brando in The Godfather has been completely removed, now a young actor can't prove his grit when an old actor can be rendered younger, it's a real shame, especially when the old can act young, but the young *are* young. That's a different spirit. But when it works it's seamless and often I couldn't tell when they were aged up or down and by how much.<br/><br/>Overall the film is quite good. That phone call scene is maybe the single best scene I've seen in a year, DeNiro is brilliant. The use of titles explaining the deaths of characters makes it more the special that in this film, Jimmy is still alive. It brings links between the Mafia and the Unions that I never knew, and the banality of some of these people and their lives mixed with the violence of their ends is effectively transmitted.<br/><br/>Also. Action Bronson is in it. The ending, regardless of the protracted runtime, is a riveting and subtle closing of the circle, the quietness of it struck me and stayed with me, an elegant master has created out of a handful of lines, how Jimmy sees himself and his end. To the Priest, and by proxy possibly to Saint Peter: ""Don't shut the door all the way"". Can an unrepentant man go to Heaven? Is Frank that man at all?"

Fans of the stars in this film will stick with it because they love these guys. Others may find it so drab that they'll only watch half of it and never finish. There's a good reason why this had a very limited theatrical release. Because it's not that great or interesting of a movie. It fits into a platform like Netflix and I'm sure many people will enjoy this movie on that platform. But it's not good enough for the big screen. It would have flopped badly and embarrassed all of the big names in the production. These three guys have been in movies that are much, much better than this.

","There is no director in all of cinema who can so accurately and realistically describe the era of American mobster better than Martin Scorsese. This we already well know.<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" is a tour de force in character study. Patiently directed ( and too slow for Millenials), it is so richly layered, you spend as much time reading the minds of the actors as you do watching the artfully framed scenes and listening to the stunningly honest and very realistic dialog. Others will certainly review this movie better than I but so am writing here today with a concern.<br/><br/>There was something so terribly sad about having the royalty of cinema portraying characters in their ""sunset"" years. Something disturbing. Scorsese lives through his characters and I didn't like what he was saying about himself. He made this film for the generation that remembered it all. Those of us who lived through the Kennedy's assassination, Castro's Cuba and even Battista, The Cuban Missile Crisis and of course, the question of just what the hell actually happened to Jimmy Hoffa. Scorsese doesn't care that Millenials need Google to look up all this stuff. He made this film almost like it was his last and for the audience who remembers. But as I said, this disturbs me. In ""The Irishman"", he no longer wrestles with the morality of it all, like he wrestles with the mysteries of his Catholicism. In this film, he seems to say that he's done with it. There's a finality here that worries me, as Scorcese is a National Treasure and I do hope that he continues to direct films that continue to define who we once were and who we are as a culture.<br/><br/>As someone has previously stated, this is NOT a film for the generation brought up on Star Wars, The Marvel Universe, Scarface violence or 140 characters. It's also not a film for young people who apparently HATE older people. ( The Agism in the reviews herr neglect the fact that they too may get old).<br/><br/>But here, Nobody does this kind of film better than Martin Scorcese."

","After years of hearing about Martin Scorsese returning to the gangster/mob sub genre, using groundbreaking CGI/de-aging technology, re-teaming with De Niro & Pesci, and collaborating with Pacino for the first time, The Irishman ends up being a little bit disappointing. To me, it's not the best picture material we all thought it might be, but it's certainly worth watching. Some fantastic reflective (and impressively not showy) acting and directing from the film's main attractions, though I will say I didn't think the de-aging was effective at all. You can't de-age movement, nor can you really make De Niro look and feel 50 years younger than he is in real life, which is what they tried to do for the first section of the film. Ultimately, it's not a film I would ever re-watch or root for to win an Oscar, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to watch it at the very least.<br/><br/>8.2/10"

"ianpalmeiras","10","2","7","13 December 2019"," Just the best movie of the year!
","Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema, it is undeniable the filmography that he built one of the greatest filmography of cinema. Here he returns to a mafia movie, a genre he's already well used to working with. But here he brings a mafia different from '' Goodfellas '' and '' Casino '', in this feature film the director takes one of the most mysterious stories about mafia of the twentieth century and opts for something more melancholic and dramatic, focusing a lot on the relationship. of his spectacular trio of protagonists.
As expected, the cast of the living legends of the seventh art did not disappoint.
From Niro here plays a war veteran who becomes one of the most important figures in the Pennsylvania mafia, despite being a character whose is shown as badly regarded and tough, throughout the film his weaknesses are showing and affecting the character until the your bed, as is the case with your relationship with your daughter. It is this emotional with the actor's coach that Scorsese leans against and builds the plot in the most dramatic way possible.
Perhaps the actor who was most involved in the character was Al Pacino (playing Jimmy Hoffa), from appearance to accent he creates, shows a true dedication of the actor to the character. He can interpret this important political figure well, it is worth highlighting the attacks of anger that the character has that will show importance in the plot. These and other small details show the affection that the people involved have in this project.
Every relationship in the movie has a chemistry and an extremely remarkable friendship bond that revolves around Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is well built and sincere, especially the relationship with Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Here they star in one of the most beautiful, sincere and honest friendships of cinema. Undoubtedly the main merit of the script is to develop such a bond well to result plot events.
For those watching Scorsese mafia movies with Joe Pesci (here playing Russell Bufalino) you will notice a lot of difference in character due to his tone, unlike in movies like '' Casino '' and '' Goodfellas '', Joe Pesci lives a much calmer mobster and aware of his actions, his experience knows what may or may not happen due to strategies or even the manner of speaking. Maybe because I don't expect that from the actor, my highlight of the movie goes to him, but it's hard to pick one that stands out in front of the others, knowing that both 3 perform well.
The ambience of the time (or better of the times) is well done and detailed, the storytelling is good and well told. Something that I thought would be a problem for this movie, would be the long duration, after all who sees that the movie has 3 hours and 30 minutes may end up with the foot behind, but not even that small factor has come to disrupt the work in a all. The movie has the perfect rhythm and knows the time to 'put your foot on the accelerator and take off', at no point did I feel tired during the almost 4 hours of the movie. On the contrary, here Martin Scorsese uses the duration as something good, to make the audience to experience more the situations lived by the characters.<br/><br/>Although revival technology bothers you at first, over the course of minutes it is easily accustomed, so it would be quite irrelevant and not give a full note for a small detail, which at some point is insignificant, because you almost notice the difference. The script of the film is well written and highlights the small details, as well as the exceptional dialogues that the plot brings. Based on Charles Brandt's '' I Heard You Paint Houses '', The Irishman is not only one of Scorsese's own best films, but one of the best films of this decade and easily shot the best movie of 2019. As the director himself he said, all 60 years of career reach this point, the partnership that had not happened for over 20 years (from Scorsese with De Niro, Pesci and Al Pacino) ends beautifully here, and realizes the importance of these legends for the movie theater."

Even the way he worded his confession in the book shows he was being careful until the end. He was obviously protecting his family from mob retaliation. Plus the quote from some mobster trying to discredit Frank is a useless biased joke. I also trust the intuition of the detective that took his interview and Robert DeNiro's, that both believed him, far more than any of the overinvested or shallow critics."

Trying to CGI the actors as young men didn't quite work either. He probably should have gone with some actors they could scale both younger and older. The incredible cast made it worth a look, but some of the actors were completely wasted on this. I too was surprised Anna Paquin was all but cut from the movie. Seems like an incredible waste of talent that was needed to balance out the older characters."
"Wwmbrd","4","2","7","3 December 2019"," Martin Scorsese might be disappointed with the lack of new ideas in Hollywood, but I am severely disappointed with the lack of new ideas from Martin Scorsese.
","I've wanted to put my thoughts together on Marty's Mob Fetish for a while now, and this movie finally left a bad enough taste in my mouth to get me over the hump and do it. In short, if you've seen Goodfellas, Casino, or Wolf of Wall Street, you've already seen ""The Irishman"". Detractors would say this is a reductive argument, but I posit that this is a truth as absolute as ""crime never pays"", and there are several elements that I will lay out as to why I feel this way.<br/><br/>Each of these four stories has an overarching plot framework that can be applied to each film individually, and as a group, due to their similarity. Martin Scorsese has honed his craft down into such a science that it's become formulaic. That's not to say that the movie is poorly made, necessarily, but rather that it's not anything original, exciting, or worthy of a three-and-a-half-hour runtime, especially with how it beats over a path we've seen many times before.<br/><br/>To understand the formula for the movies, one must first understand the repetition of roles each of the principal actors plays in the film. Pesci is always the made man, calling the shots. Deniro is the recent convert- a young*, borderline criminal with no conscience, and even less remorse. Pacino: the big boss, always. *More on this later.
These roles remain unchanged from any previous Scorsese film involving Pacino and Pesci (""The Irishman"" is Al Pacino's first production with Scorsese, somehow). In Goodfellas, Ray Liotta takes the position of the young upstart, and his associates/bad influence friends Deniro and Pesci pressure him into getting deeper into unhinged mob activities. In Casino, Deniro gets his first turn as the impressionable quasi-mobster, with Pesci again playing the crazed made man.<br/><br/>I mentioned a formula, and I'll try to keep it brief:
1. A young, poor, impressionable, borderline criminal man with no conscience (Liotta, Deniro, Leonardo Dicaprio, Deniro)
2. A sidekick that's a terrible influence and involved in organized (or disorganized) crime (Deniro and Pesci, Pesci, Jonah Hill, Pesci and Pacino)
3. A beautiful wife who's either a terrible person, addict, a victim, mob related or any combination thereof. (Lorraine Bracco, Sharon Stone, Margot Robbie, Stephanie Kurtzuba)
4. This combination of a principal trio of characters engage in increasingly criminal activities, beginning with insidious thefts and petty crime up to, and including wanton murder with seemingly no consequences, other than the alienation of their family and increased drug/addiction problems.
5. Many decades into the future, the wealthy life of crime comes undone from the ineptitude of some bottom tier criminal that the now-upper-management Deniro and Pesci have to deal with.
6. Somebody squeals.
7. Someone, or everyone, goes to jail, and the squealers end up dead
8. The now-old main character is recounting his story to some biographer, cop, or court.<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" doesn't even pretend to deviate from this path laid before it by greater films. Adding to this formula, you need some family drama- because what Italian American couple can stay together without cheating? To even out the infidelity balance, rather than the drug addled, cheating wives of Wolf of Wall Street (Margot Robbie), and Casino (Sharon Stone), Scorsese flips the script back to where it began: Ray Liotta's unfaithful husband in Goodfellas, and now Deniro as the offender in ""The Irishman"". Naturally, their children hate them, because their fathers are consciousless monsters. But, of course, family life is no matter to a mobster- there are people to kill for little-to-no gain other than to satisfy the bloodshed quota for the film.<br/><br/>To that end, the violence in ""The Irishman"" is toned down heavily from the previous entries. This largely has to do with the age of the actors attempting to emulate the movements of much younger men; unsuccessfully, I might add.
---From the ""Decider"" article: Scorsese didn't want to cast younger actors for the flashbacks because he felt they wouldn't understand the world of the mob. The flashbacks-which for (Deniro) comprised like half the picture-would have to be played by younger actors. (Scorsese) said, 'What am I gonna be doing? I gotta explain everything to them?' Here, you don't have to explain,"" Scorsese said, laughing. Then he added more seriously, ""It's about behavior: It's about how you sit, how you stand, how you say hello to somebody, how you digress in conversation.""---
My BS meter started going off as soon as I saw that there was an attempt at a rationale for not casting younger actors to play a 30, 40, or 50 year old man. Even with the marvels of CGI de-aging (which is heavily utilized on Deniro, Pesci, and Pacino, to the level of uncanny valley inhuman visage), the movements of these men look like my crippled grandpa. An early scene, with Deniro kicking the hell out of a shop owner who assaults his daughter, actually made me laugh. He's so stiff and can't even raise his knee up to a 45 degree angle to stomp on a man's hand. He also supposedly throws the man through a glass door, which has to be hidden from inside the shop. It's honestly ridiculous seeing these nigh-on 80 year old men acting as men less than half their age. As the story progresses, and the age of the characters finally catches up to the actors- the makeup comes off, and the movements and their looks finally match what they're supposed to be, and for once, the suspension of disbelief returns, and it's satisfying to watch.<br/><br/>On the subject of the temporal- the narrative jumps around far too often. Chalk it up to an ""unreliable protagonist/ramblings of an old man"" but that doesn't cut it. ""The Irishman"" doesn't define years, decades, or ages very well, leaves a lot of details out about how people meet or become friends - such as the relationship between Deniro's Frank Sheeran, and Pacino's Jimmy Hoffa. The overarching car trip with old man Deniro and Pesci also takes place in some undefined time- the film builds up to it being a meaningful apex moment in the story, but it ends up being yet another disconnected narrative thread. There are many of these in the story. The characters age 10-15 years between scenes, and with no real understanding of where or when, (other than the period appropriate dress and the cars, which are nice attention to detail pieces) it turns into a bloated mess very quickly. I was fortunate to be able to watch this on Netflix where I could rewind and piece together who was where with what between scenes. The flow improves later in the film when everyone is introduced, but the movie also relies HEAVILY on the audience's outside knowledge of the happenings- who Jimmy Hoffa was (they joke about this, too), what his involvement with the mafia was, and if the audience had read ""The Irishman"" book, many more of these details would make sense, because they were certainly left out of the movie. It also doesn't help that the real life Frank Sheeran is a liar, and his story is untrue anyway.<br/><br/>Perhaps the ending, with its depiction of age being a real bitch, slowly creeping up on every mobster, and being a killer without fail was more poignant than it first appeared. Perhaps Martin Scorsese himself has reached the end of his creativity, and put a final nail in the coffin of the gangster flick that we were so obsessed with in the later decades of the 20th century. Hollywood is obsessed with a remake, after all."
"BirdmanT7","Null","2","7","3 December 2019"," Much Ado About Nothing but hype?
","Is the hype surrounding this film ""The Irishman"" justified? Not in the least. It is a case of much ado about nothing. I read some of the reviews here and I am just at owes at how much people praise this mess ?!. I question the validity of these people who leave these reviews here on IMDB and so should anyone who reads them, because these people could be working for the Hollywood industry to create more hype created by Martin Scorsese's marketing team and himself to brag about his own film with the cast on a video on Netflix. I think people in this country follow social media and just media like sheep and believe the BS before they even get a chance to see the movie. The same thing happened here on IMDB with the mess Tarantino made called ""Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood"" where there was instant reviews here on IMDB before the movie even had wide release. Look how long that lasted in the theaters, not even 3 weeks for just hyped up crap?<br/><br/>I say the same thing is happening here again that even someone ""Martin Scorsese"" has to rely on social media hype to promote a mess he made, because that is the way the only way to salvage a mess, is to keep a lie to become a mindset for the mindless masses whose life is spent on social media. But enough on that subject let's just focus on this bogus film about a guy ""Frank Sheeran"" whose story was debunked by FBI and dismissed as he was questioned before and after he wrote this book, that FBI found that he lied over and over and none of it added up together. Furthermore, due to the history of mob killings; they would never hire a person outside of their organization who was not an ITALIAN and a made to take out someone like Hoffa, that's just does not happen and over the years the evidence found proved that Frank Sheeran's story is partially true that he knew Hoffa and was close to the mob but he didn't kill Hoffa.<br/><br/>But Martin Scorsese didn't care about the truth, he cared about the DRAMA of how this story translates on the screen and to make a comeback with what he knows best from Mean streets to Casino, the lives of these Mafia and the crimes they were involved, he makes these people to be of such importance, people whom had less than high school education and committed some of the most monstrous crimes in this country such as Killing the President (JKK).<br/><br/>Watching Al Pacino with that cartoonish make up and hair, or the rest of the cast made me just feel embarrassed for these people that looked hideous like something you saw cartoon or Sat Night live parody. I urge you to back and watch ""Dick Tracy"" 1990 version that Warren Beaty made, see the performance and make up of Al Pacino as ""Big Boy Caprice"" is not as a comical as him playing ""Jimmy Hoffa""...Lol I would still rather watch Dick Tracy than the Irishman, because to even cast Pacino as Hoffa was a joke to begin, he was a White Irishman, and Jack Nicholson in ""Hoffa"" was more believable than Pacino, first for the physical appearance and Nicholson was much closer ethnicity than Pacino with that weird accent and hairdoo that was you could not see any Hoffa in Pacino performance.<br/><br/>To me De Niro was just as comical with this CGI de-aging because he just looked as pathetic and hideous as Pacino. The dialogue was just repetitive and tedious. I can go and watch Good Fellas and Casino and enjoy them, but its the format of the film that makes it flow, I love slow films but the Irishman is not like watch Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"", where the film camera movement and zoom are slow for a reason to slow down time but the film still flows smoothly, with the Irishman you don;t know where it's going to end? there are so many scenes that it should have ended the film within 2 hours but how the studios would even allow or not question why this film is so long, filled with scenes that don't go any where, most of it just voice over with De Niro talking as if his character has any moral latitude to even feel sorry for that you care what he is even saying, compare to Goodfellas where the ending, when Ray Liotta is talking to the audience directly, it was unusual and different that grabbed your attention that his witness protection program was worse than prison because he was a no body anymore, but the film had a punch to it that a life of crime is a dead end but for Frank Sheeran he still had the priest to repent to? WHO the F cares?<br/><br/>This entire film was based on hype and the cast of these Actors who really should really be retired, I personally refuse to see another film with PACINO or DENIRO in. I just want to remember them in Godfather, Taxi Driver, Heat, but not this mess. I will say that the only reason I stayed watching this film was mostly for ""Joe Pesci's"" performance who not only surprised me but kept me interested to watch to the end, I would not be surprised if he gets an Oscar for that performance at the end in prison as the old man, that was just outstanding for someone who really has been absent from acting for so long."

"jscadutobelmonte","8","2","7","1 December 2019"," A bit of a disappointment.
","I really wanted to love this film but I didn't. Which surprised me considering the pedigree of the movie. The three princes of mob movies, De Niro, Pacino and Pesci, with Scorsese the king directing, I expected a block buster film, sadly for me it didn't deliver. Pesci was the standout of the three, Pacino and De Nero, appeared to be just playing themselves or composites of every mob character they ever played. It was far too long, a bit of concise editing could have been done without any ill effects and would have upped the slow pace without taking anything away from the overall impact of the film. The de-aging process, was the best I've seen used, although in the more physical scenes it's obvious the actions and movements are of older men, not the younger ones portrayed on screen. As awards season approaches, this film may well dominate, but will it be deserved?"

","It seems that Joe Pesci had brought the arc that is his career of mob roles to a fitting climax. His most recent character; although not nearly as full of rage as Tommy and Nicky, is just as cold-blooded. He should get Oscar consideration for it. DeNiro is great as well as Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa. The period pieces are reproduced wonderfully. The story moved well despite a 3:20 run time."
"s-maniatopoulos","9","2","7","30 November 2019"," Scorsese's magnum opus
","Surprisingly, it's been a long time since Martin Scorsese made a masterpiece. In my humble opinion, the Wolf of Wall Street was the last time he came close to making one for the ages.
I did not expect the Irishman to be a masterpiece. Actors past their prime, questionable CGI to make them look young so they can reprise roles they are too old to play, and one more gangster movie with De Niro and Pacino.
But the thing is, I was so wrong. Scorsese's film is a masterpiece of layers upon layers upon layers of narrative, one of the most complete character studies I can recall seeing.
Granted, the film is slow. But I could not get enough of it. And if I regret something, it's that I wanted it to keep going. But then, like in life, everyone is a mystery. No one can see inside a person's soul.
This is a unique film, and his greatest moment since Goodfellas.
The fact that he pulled this off after all this time is testament to the man's genius.
In my opinion, this is one of the great movies of our time, and in certain ways, possibly a future contender for Scorsese's greatest work.
Of course it will never surpass the Taxi Driver, but in 30 years from now, I believe many people may consider it even better than ""Goodfellas"".
And in terms of telling the story, looking back on time, this (mostly) reflective movie, narrating a man's life, is exceptionally beautiful, sensitive and true.<br/><br/>I give it 10/10.<br/><br/>Kudos to NETFLIX for allowing mr Scorsese to tell this exceptional story his way."

","The Irishman is a swan song to the gangster film, and method actors of the past. A bygone era of filmmaking by a masterful legendary director. The de-aging technology is hard to adjust to at first but I got used to it.<br/><br/>Netflix allows Martin Scorsese's The Irishman to exist by providing funding for the project other studios could not due to the limitations if their business model. They have to make break even to even start to make a profit, that with marketing costs makes major studios releasing films in theatres risk averse.

"danielcereto","5","2","7","30 November 2019"," Goodfellas 3.0
","I am a big fan of Martin Scorsese's movies. Goodfellas, is my favorite one. So, I was pretty excited about this one. After watching it I have mixed feelings. Not sure if the formula doesn't work at all, or I'm not the same person anymore.<br/><br/>First, the acting is fantastic coming from veteran actors. The average here is around 75 years old. On the other hand, I think Deniro's choice was not appropriate. He can't even kick asses (grocery store scene). I think Pacino should have been the main star. What a great actor.<br/><br/>Second, the movie's pace is extremely slow, like mostly Scorsese's movies. But what works in the 90's (Goodfellas) it does not work anymore.
Martin should not expect audience from 2019 can stay 3h 20 minutes without getting distracted. It's sad but it is what it is. Even me (a fan) I couldn't watch the whole movie without get a little bored because of the slow pace.<br/><br/>Third, I really love the ambiance, and the execution. It is impressive. I got back for an instance to the 60's mobs world. Pretty real, not stupid Fx's. Also music and dressing is amazing too.<br/><br/>To sum up, a good movie for fans, but a wasted opportunity to make a masterpiece again. I think next time, Martin should go and get some cast from Peaky Blinders, like Cillian Murphy, and create a great Goodfellas 3.0."
"supernig95","5","2","7","30 November 2019"," Very long and very underated.
","Love the director, and love this genre of movies, Goodfellas, The Godfather and Casino would all be in my top ten movies. The movie was just too long, unsure whether it wanted to be a mini series or a movie, very slow in places , could have done with editing by at least an hour. Also the cgi wasn,t quite a 100 per cent, a young Robert de Niro wasn,t really convincing and this took some of the shine off the movie.
I think that we would all love to see more of Robert de Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino and all the great older actors, that starred in so many great movies. However at some point we have to move on, and where are the new actors coming through to take these roles on."

"jacobywarner","7","2","7","29 November 2019"," Incredible Craft with a Poor Pace
","Turning on this picture my attention was all on the screen, but as the film progressed I suddenly found that my eyes were more focussed on my cellphone just counting the minutes till this movie would end. So after my first viewing I came to the conclusion that it was not the film that was the problem, it had to be me so I decided to watch the film again without my phone in my pocket. Without distraction I still had wondering eyes meaning that it in fact wasn't me.<br/><br/>So before I jump into the bad I will start with the good. Every set had immense detail, it was not quite the on location type of pictures that we have grown to expect from Martin Scorsese. Another great aspect to the film would be the score that he uses, he has always been an expert when it comes to his use of music and this movie is no exception. I think that one aspect of the story that I did enjoy was the way they incorporated the political climate of the time showing how corrupt all politicians were and have always been.<br/><br/>Now on to the Bad. Acting... with such an incredible lineup of great actors it just seemed like they were going through the motions. The one exception to this movie would be the performance of Joe Pesci who played a very reserved character that we don't often see from him. Another poor aspect from the film would be the story itself, not only is it unbearably long there are many scenes that aren't important to the plot. This not only creates some problems but with the editing style that they chose to employ had a terrible pace. This for me was the absolute worst part of the movie, there were cuts where there should have been pauses and pauses where there should have been cuts.<br/><br/>It is for those reasons that I am only giving this movie a 7/10, I also just want to add that it just didn't have the Martin Scorsese vibe that we as fans were craving when this movie was announced. I personally was very upset after watching this film and writing this review really upsets me but I am going to overhype a movie just because of the director."
"arunbarik","10","2","7","29 November 2019"," Absolute Gold, Masterclass phenomenon you don't wanna miss.
","Pure Masterclass, the narration is just so absolutely the driving force of the movie, credit goes to Scorsese for such excellent direction.

","Well, after all those years from Mean Streets to Taxi Driver, New York New York to here the story of an Irishman, watched by me an Irishman who lived in the New York of the late 70's and early 80's. Before it all changed, when the clubs and bars I worked in where full of Bookies, Runners, guys you never talked to, the guys who stood in the doorway. I lived back through my young days, like my 21st birthday and all the guys surprised me, throw me in a car and took over the bridge to Peter Lugars, what a night. What guys, they lived in way that I could never explain but the mo vies of Scorsese, De Nero, Pesci and all the cast of hundreds with the music coming in right on cue, well they told the story of those times and when the historians want to know whats what, they wont look anywhere else. Let nobody say these guys got away scott free, they paid in every day for the life they lived, but complain, never. This movie I think in time will go down as the very best of Scorsesse's. As always it was the little things that made it so real, he may have had crash bang wallop moments in his movies but the tender parts are what makes him a truly great artist, so here's to all the guys and gals who made the telling of the life possible.

","This movie is excellent in every way, I was afraid of it being a lot like Goodfellas but it wasn't at all thankfully. I don't want to spoil the film so I'll keep it brief. All the technical aspects to a film are there; acting, direction, music, writing etc. but what really surprised me was how invested this movie kept me in it's characters. Most of the film is these guys talking and you really get to know these characters, which really invests you in the story. It was also very interesting to learn about Jimmy Hoffa and how important he was, since I knew nothing about him before hand.
This film is brilliant and trying to find flaws in it is like a needle in a haystack, one of Scorsese's best."

As for the acting, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci did a magnificent job in portraying all those characters and they truly should be rewarded for their effort.
In my opinion, everyone must see this film as it is satisfying in ways that not many movies are so go and watch it!!"
"barisayhan","9","2","7","28 November 2019"," It might be a different movie than you'd expect.
","We waited a long time for this film. Expectations have risen considerably. There were people waiting for a new The Godfather. But it looks more like a documentary shot. Martin Scorsese's style is reflected in this film. It has a similar narrative style to Goodfellas. The shots are impressive, but simple continuity errors have been made in editing some scenes. There's nothing exciting about it being biographical.I liked the use of CGI technology for Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. For Robert De Niro, it wasn't complete. I can't say masterpiece, but it's worth watching. He could fit in two and a half hours."

","Calling this overrated will probably be controversial on here, but I have to say it when I read reviews of people calling this the best film of the decade etc.<br/><br/>I love Scorsese, Goodfellas is in my top three films of all time. At times The Irishman flows just as well as that, and when its singing that tune it's a pleasure to watch. However, it struggles a little during the middle of the film. What I mean by this is that the film slightly fails to keep you engaged because it's the timeline moves so quick. I got a little lost in understanding exactly what was happening on screen (Who was tied to what organised crime etc). I got the gist of it all eventually but the film expects you to understand what The Union of teamsters is, I'm from England so not familiar with American history. Despite some flaws I know it's a film which will get better with repeat viewings<br/><br/>I really did enjoy this film and it proves that these types of productions are still better than the majority of blockbuster trash we are fed at the cinema today. But just don't set your expectations rocket high, it's a very good film but it won't knock Goodfellas off its perch.<br/><br/>One last thing I will mention is that this could possibly be Robert Di Niro's best ever performance.

I'm not sure if that's down to me getting older or down to Scorsese's direction. For instance: Harvey Keitel doesn't have a lot to do and he has a hard job breaking free from Winston Wolf who he is still playing on insurance commercials. In no way does he come across as bad ass or intimidating.<br/><br/>At first I couldn't get used to the de-aging. It didn't look right on those old bodies but after a while I stopped noticing and just went along with it.<br/><br/>I spent a large portion of the picture wondering how much time had passed.

","Was this really necessary? A three and a half hour trope fest leading to two shots with a 38 in back of head. And guess what, the mob did it.
Of course, no well-established film reviewer will dare to mess with the Hollywood royalty, so let me tell you: you've seen it all already. The only difference this film makes from the rest of Scorsese's work is De Niro CGI-ed to a ridiculous extent so Pesci can call him ""boy."" The reason why this was called for is beyond this reviewer since ""The Irishman"" runs through almost five decades and the young (ish) Frank Sheeran could easily be played by an actor who is spry enough without computerized augmentation.
Other than that, the film seems almost as though Scorsese went around collecting and re-editing scenes from his greatest hits ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"", ""Mean Streets"", ""Raging bull"", borrowing a few strokes from (what the hell) ""Hoffa"" and ""JFK"" - you get the idea. I'll bet, the director's cut is going to be named ""The Passion of The Irishman"", but we'll just going to have to see."

I myself have never heard Robert de Niro speak Italian in any of the mafia movies he's stared in, with the exception of a few words.

","Frankly, I am happy I'm alive in a period where such artists like Scorsese, De Niro, Pesci exist... I watched Raging ball back when I was younger, and then Goodfellas, after that Reservoir Dogs, A Bronx Tale and Casino, and they were the last mob movies that moved me, that gave me something I could never feel in the new mob movies... I patiently waited for The Irishman since its first trailer last year and desperately prayed that it'd move me like the ones I mentioned on the upper list.... I just finished watched it... God! It's a 03 hours 25 minutes movie and it's worth every moment of its time. Hell of a movie, a one that takes you back in a time machine where mob movies used to mean something... The scenario, the performance, the production, Scorsese cleverly took a good care of every little thing. God! The man is a genius.... The whole movie is a mix of bunch of genius. It's a Masterpiece.

","It's Frank (Robert DeNiro). The whole movie centers around him. From a meat delivery guy to mobster, he have come a long long way. Martin Scorsese's The Irishman gets into the same line with 'No Country For Old Man', 'There Will Be Blood' and 'The Godfather series'. Flawlessly performed and with a masterclass screenplay (that should win the best original screenplay Oscar), The Irishman is one of a highest kind of cinema. Might be long but the minutes are not wasted. The moments are well crafted in the hand of experienced Martin Scorsese. And it seemed like Robert DeNiro didn't even had to memorize the dialogues that how much he is used to Scorsese's characters. Not only just of 2019, it's one of the most impressive movies of this decade and surely gonna be remembered. After all, I personally found The Irishman emotionally drowning and so much humanist till the end. It's not just too much focused in the gore and violence but also takes time to have a look at the real and simple world through the doorway that is slightly opened."

","Just stumbled upon this on Netflix - and it's the BEST Netflix has done in a long time! This would definitely better be viewed on the big screen; thankfully our home screen is quite large, with excellent audio.
I saw something where 'some viewers' thought it was boring on Netflix; and all I can say about that is they must not have lived in that era, and have no idea about the underlying currents within the movie itself . . .
Outstanding performances by ALL cast, their portrayal of the major players was spot on. You can literally feel the angst of De Niro as he struggles internally with his loyalty to Pesci and Pacino. I found not one iota of this movie boring. It is one of the few 'recent' movies I've watched lately on Netflix, that in spite of it's 3 1/2 hour run, did not lull me to sleep, as is often the case with some of the other fare. That is not to say that all Netflix movies are boring; it's just my own lack of sleep and nodding off, only to have to get up at some point and re-watch what I missed. I definitely did not have to do that with 'THE iRISHMAN' - Loved the movie, and would actually like to see it on the big screen. You are really made to wonder how interconnected all of those events of the past were actually intertwined - food for thought definitely; and portrayed splendidly by Scorsese! A true master of the craft, as well as the actors whose roles seem so perfectly suited. It is always a treat to see De Niro; Pacino, and Pesci in the same genre film. Thank YOU Mr. Scorsese. KUDOS!!!"

","Well, I have mixed feelings about it and hear me out here. The actors, movie, script, Scorsese are amazing in this film and made the best out of it.
Hovever I hated the fact that my belowed actors are old now and the story itself.
Here are examples of what I mean:
Everyone loved Godfather 1, did not liked so much Godfather 3 (I love all 3 parts). The story in par 1 is about youg Al Pachino who fights to get to top. Same for Scarface, same for other mob films. And that is engaging and interesting. Nobady watch a movie about old mafia bosses get even older. Name any other good mafia movie that is about old mafia bosses that get old?
And the important part - I hate to see Al Pachino and DeNiro old. I mean when DeNiro plays old man in any other movie, fine by me, love it, but mafia movie and still try to be tough guy? Same is with Arnold and Terminator. New Terminator sucks, because everyone wants to see young Arnie there, if he is old, it is painfull to watch, does not matter the story.
Well, these are my thought after the movie. It is great, but it left also a bitter taste afterwards."

There is not much action considering the length of the movie but the story does keep you engrossed.<br/><br/>We all know the legends of De Niro, Pesci and Pacino and they all put in another excellent performance, I don't think you will ever see these 3 icons in the same movie again, so cherish it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie and I'm just glad I got to watch it from the comfort of my home, the length will put a lot of people off but it's a well made movie with a good story and as mentioned an excellent cast, although I don't think I could watch it all again like a Goodfellas, once is enough."
"khan6666","10","2","8","27 November 2019"," An astonishing and unforgettable masterpiece!
","Not enough words can describe this movie. It's very long but never boring, thanks to 3 outstanding performances by legends DeNiro, Pesci and Pacino. They all deserve to get Oscar nominations. In Pesci's case, he deserves to win Best Supporting Actor. His Russell Baffalino character is totally different to his Tommy in Goodfellas. Soft spoken and never raises his voice but just as menacing and scary. A pleasure to see him on screen after 11 years. An incredible performance by one of the best actors ever.<br/><br/>Cameos by Stephen Graham and Keitel were brilliant too. I wish Keitel had more scenes. He had one big scene and he stole it. The last 1 hour of the movie is what makes The Irishman a truly great movie. Its Scorcese at his very best. Movie of the year and movie of the decade. They don't make movies like these anymore."
"usedcarcowboy","8","2","8","5 November 2019"," A few flaws, but EXCELLENT overall. Very funny too.
","Perhaps not quite the masterpiece many critics have said, but still an excellent movie. Must-see for Scorcese fans. Every actor is in top form, especially DeNiro and Pacino (who's Hoffa portrayal was the stand out for me). Many laugh out loud moments. Top notch drama. Fascinating story. The editing couldve been tighter given the 3+ hour runtime. A few parts do drag out a tiny bit. Still captivating though. The de-aging isnt perfect, but is effective. Faces look good, however, the actors bodies show their true age in some wide shots (makes me wish they used body doubles or different angles for some parts). Don't expect Goodfellas or Casino type movie. This is a slow burn with little to no rock music/Stones songs and standard camera work. Ultimately, I think a condensed/tight 2 1/2 hour movie focusing more on Sheerans relationship with Hoffa wouldve been masterpiece material. Although this is one I'd highly recommend."
"lee_eisenberg","10","3","15","1 December 2019"," Marty does it again
","Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro worked on several movies together over the years, and it was inevitable that they would have to work together again. And the result is a masterpiece. ""The Irishman"" looks at the life of Frank Sheeran, a truck driver who became a hitman. The movie portrays just about every type of mafioso that existed from the '50s to the '80s.<br/><br/>The movie has made news for the de-aging of its stars (and Bobby D's eyes look bizarre here). But I'd say that the cast itself is equally important. In addition to DeNiro, we have Joe Pesci making a triumphant return to the screen as Russell Bufalino, head of a crime family. And then there's Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa. With these three - how had they never all appeared in a movie together? - you know that you're in for some intense stuff.<br/><br/>Although I'd heard of Hoffa before, I'd never known about the rest of the people depicted here, let alone all this history. Who else but Scorsese could've directed something so forceful and gritty? All that I can say is that you can't claim to have seen a complete set of this year's movies unless you've seen ""The Irishman"". Definitely check it out, whether during the day or in the still of the night."

"arabnikita","4","3","15","30 November 2019"," You really got to love truck driver unions to enjoy this one...
","The Irishman (2019)<br/><br/>This review is probably going to make a lot of people angry but honesty is what I preach on this account so here it goes. Irishman is a colossal disappointment by Scorsese standards whom I consider one of my favorite directors. I understand the dream of reuniting three iconic actors for one last gangster ride but sometimes the past should be left in the past. The film feels like forcing a Ferrari that won many races in 1970 to compete in 2019 Formula 1 and expecting it to win by painting it in a different color and making it drive in the desert.<br/><br/>Out of the 3 legends, the CGI worked best on Al Pacino who looks and acts like back in his prime. De Niro on the other hand plays a 30 year old hitman with horrendous blue eyes who looks and moves like he is 70. Any time he had to walk, I was afraid that he was going to break some bone. Pesci looks 75 the entire time but thankfully his role is mostly sitting around and as a result he gives a good performance. Overall though, CGI takes away the authenticity of the film and makes it feel soulless.<br/><br/>Scorsese is known for crafting terrific plots with multiple simultaneous events fuelled by juicy dialogue and exciting scenes. The first 40 minutes pass in a breeze as we are introduced to an hitman who narrates the plot by describing his early work with the mob. Then we get immersed into the ""wonderful"" and ""exciting"" world of truck driver unions and their political struggles during the 60s which becomes the main topic for 3 hours. I repeat, 3 hours of truck driver unions and no matter how they try to connect Kennedy or Cuba to it, they are still blasted truck driver unions that no one cares about.<br/><br/>People call it a masterpiece because of the filmmaking nuances, beautiful shots and character growth but sadly all of this art gets lost in this mess of a predictably boring plot. Yes it is Scorsese, Yes it is De Niro, Pacino and Pesci, Yes it is their swan song but in the end it is an extremely dull movie and being 3.5 hours long does not help it. Sometimes it is better to look at the old videos of the Ferrari and remember how good it was instead of destroying it in a race."

"samuelrcgerrard","8","2","9","19 January 2020"," A great achievement!!!
","A beautiful, well crafted, contemplative movie. While many people were expecting something with a bit more excitement, I think it's important to watch this film for what it is, an interesting, reflective look into Frank Sheeran's life. Yes, it's long, but I think that works in the film's favour. It allows you to sit back, watch it unfold and absorb yourself in it. This is helped by the sheer beauty of the film. The Irishman is brilliantly made with stunning cinematography, production and costume design while utilizing an intoxicating 50s/60s setting. The movie is brimming with stars and talent with two especially brilliant performances from Joe Pesci and Al Pacino. They're on top form and working with a great script. Also, I think the de- ageing, (one of the reasons for the film's controversy) works very well and after a while, I completely forgot about it. Overall, I think The Irishman is a beautifuly made and brilliantly crafted film that absorbs you in this world entirely. It's a great achievement and will be talked about for years to come."

With both films you could easily cut out 2+ hours and still miss absolutely nothing. Boring story. Boring characters. Boring movie."
"thomas196x2000","7","2","9","3 December 2019"," A 9 or 10? Afraid not, been here, done this.
","Even bad Scorsese films (""The Departed"", 1/2 of the ""Wolf of Wall Street"") have some interesting elements. This is not a bad film, but it is not a strikingly good one either. If you are coming into this thinking you will be entertained like you were in ""Goodfellas"" or even ""Casino"", you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. This is a top-notch production. The sound, the look, and it was long enough to take its time and give a lot of detail to things. I appreciate that. But the narrative is lacking here; it is not that interesting a piece. All of us, every one of us, has seen all of this before. It's the typical mob stuff. I knew what De Niro's final job was going to be long before it happened.<br/><br/>There are no surprises here, no curves. The characters learn nothing, there are no character arcs here. De Niro plays a boring, not very bright truck driver that finds himself largely through chance getting sucked into the Mafia. That could have been a great adventure, but the character just meanders through, then executes a quick violent act. The guy is the worst kind of sociopath, and only his final big hit do we see any fleeting remorse.<br/><br/>The Hoffa character, played with great enthusiasm by Al Pacino, is much more interesting. But his story here is played rather blandly too. Joe Pesci's plays his mob boss character quite well, but again, we've see that ""guy"" time and again. There is no new, interesting story here. It seems like the story tracks along, then out of nowhere someone gets shot in the head. Repeat. There is no suspense, no real surprise, the police work is only on scree for a few moments. The best times are the intimate moments between the Pacino and De Niro characters, as one might imagine. But the movie has no dynamics, it has no heart. There is absolutely no humor, just tons of closeups of DeNiro's odd faux CGI eyes and face. Worth a look but do not expect too much.<br/><br/>As I watched this movie, I was really thinking of two things. How glad I am not a part of that world, where even a little store that sells fur coats has to pay off some creep from out of state, and how the world would be better off if every character depicted in the film, even the wives, were blown to bits at one of the parties they all intended.<br/><br/>The only upbeat part of this film is, like the ""Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"", is every single character gets what's coming to him."

It's not that fun but I prefer to get inside the mind of people who live like this and I think the movie delivered. I like the actors so much I miss them, we all know they are legends though. Why this movie is so special to me is because usually these types of movies are about the violence or the money. Money is usually the main motivator. In this movie the main motivator is power. Power is what these people are living for. It's not an action movie it's a thinking movie, each mobster is thinking about what's the right move, and I feel that's more accurate to reality."

","I love Martin Scorsese movies, but this has got to be one of his worst. The movie is way too long, and filled with too many senseless scenes that add nothing to character development. It made no sense to have the younger DeNiro, Pacino, and Pesci being played by themselves. You can tell that they were 70 year old's trying to act like they were in their 30's. Their eyes too, DeNiro must have cataracts, his eyes look foggy. Especially when the younger DeNiro beats up on the grocery store owner. You can tell it was an old man with no agility kicking at the guy. The death scene of Hoffa was so anticlimactic. I compare it to the Hoffa (1992) death scene, Devito's scene was much better and more of a nail-biter."

Many scenes were long and meandering, and not really that necessary for the story development. As a movie, it probably could have been (and should have been) wrapped up in a few minutes (five or so?) after Hoffa is killed. The last half hour or so is very slow and self-indulgent.

The director (Martin Scorsese), made a great job as usual.

","At face value, it's like a long version of Forrest Gump, rebuilt as a dark and bitter stage play, with none of the interesting parts.<br/><br/>The first hour is so bad, it would've had to have been done like that on purpose, for an effect that isn't clear. None of the characters have any sense of emotion. Sociopaths they may be, but it's like watching a propaganda news reel from 1942. The second hour starts to offer a story, but there's no overall context or background for who is now the lead role, so it becomes Al Pacino enjoying himself yelling at stuff. In the final hour it's as if another movie starts, about a group of tired old gangsters with massive egos dying of old age, but by then no one cares and it's just pointlessly drab.<br/><br/>You could watch it out of curiosity, but maybe try watching it in one hour instalments unless you desperately need to fall asleep."

"mamamellon-43089","10","1","3","21 May 2020"," Great Movie
","The Irishman is a three and a half hour movie but if you find the time to watch it you will not be dissapointed. It has everything needed to succeed times two. It has one of if not the best cast of the decade with legends like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel one of the best living directors, Martin Scorsese and an intriguing story. It follows Robert De Niro as Frank Sheran a loyal mafia hitman, good friends with powerful mob boss Russel Buffalino (Joe Pesci) and bodyguard to Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Frank Sheran becomes best friends with Jimmy Hoffa over the course of working with him, until Hoffa and the mob have a falling out. Hoffa wants the presidency at his union back put he offends a connected member in the process. He wants the mob to back him up but the mob wants him to cool it off, and Frank is caught in the middle. But Hoffa is hot headed and stubborn and won't cool off, and despite some serious diplomacy on Frank's part the mob decided if Hoffa won't calm down they're going to have to kill him. Frank is caught in the middle between following orders like he's been trained to do and his best friend, but in the end he follows orders. At the end of the movie in the retirement home Frank asks the nurse if she's heard about Jimmy Hoffa before and she said she hadn't which make Frank relasie that he went through all of that pain and lost his family for something that is now insignificant just like he is, he is going to die alone without family or friends and the only things that remind him of his old life are the ring given to him by Russel and the watch given to him by Jimmy. Those are the only remiders of how powerful he used to be and how pointless that power is now. In the end The Irishman in not on the same level as Goodfellas or The Departed but there is something that makes it special and uniqe, it has a deeper meaning and is one of Martin Scorsese's best and most important movies."
"btoews","4","1","3","5 May 2020"," Ridiculous
","Maybe my experience was tainted by having read the book this movie was based on-I Heard You Paint Houses (which was a great read)-but this thing was just sad all around. The main character was this huge (like 6.6 250) tough as nails Irishman who basically could beat up just about anybody in a streetfight. Hoffa himself was short but very strong and tough. Having these two guys both in their mid 70s playing these guys as younger men was absurd-in one scene Frank (the Irishman) meets Buffalino when he is like 19 or 20-Russell helps fix his car-De Niro looks like a guy in his late 70s with a weird face-he doesn't move at all like an athletic 20 year old guy. Anyway the whole movie is like that-it just seemed ridiculous-especially when you consider Scorcese had the budget to get a proper cast and do a proper movie."
"rowanmaillot","10","1","3","2 May 2020"," The *BEST* Movie of 2019
","No doubt, simply the best Netflix film ever made and the best movie of 2019.
Where do I even begin? This film is so entertaining and perfect, the run time of 3 hours and 30 minutes feels more like 2 hours and 45 minutes, because I was having a blast with every single scene. De Niro plays Frank Sheeran, he ends up getting involved in the mob which technically speaking destroys his life, his daughter thinks of Pacino's character Jimmy Hoffa more of a father to her. Frank gets involved in Joe Pesci's character which ends up with bad blood between the father and Peggy. She ends up accepting the fact he's part of the mob and goes out killing people, so she approaches Jimmy Hoffa as more of a father figure. The story has its fair share of sad moments, like when Pesci's character passes away, and most importantly the death of Jimmy Hoffa. Obviously, in real life, Frank never killed Hoffa himself, the case of who really killed Hoffa still remains a mystery, but Carlo Licata is the suspected murderer.
What is also amazing and unique about this film, is how when it introduces its characters like Angeleno Bruno, it addresses how they died. Also, its use of CGI, I wouldn't have noticed if I saw the film not knowing it was made by Scorsese, because it looks so realistic, it's actually fantastic! This is definitely my favourite of the decade, no doubt in my mind, there has been no other picture exploring such an in-depth real life story and that ahs had me as engaged as The Irishman did.

"sebastianschlicht","9","1","3","5 February 2020"," ""I heard you paint houses."" - A modern classic? I guess so!
","Martin Scorsese's new film ""The Irishman"" is a little miracle in my eyes. The film is obviously very good, but what makes it so special for me are Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and even Joe Pesci: While Pesci has been retiring from the film business for nine years, De Niro and Pacino have been in a lot of trash recent years. In the past, they were legends and even today there are great actors slumbering in them, but what is missing are the right films and, the right directors such as Martin Scorsese, who still delivers great films at over 70 years old. It is remarkable that he brought these three old gentlemen together for his ""Netflix""-film. Scorsese deserves great respect for that alone. But why is ""The Irishman"" so good on top of that?<br/><br/>The film deals with the story of Frank Sheeran, who immerses himself in the world of the mafia through the help of Russell Alberto Bufalino. It doesn´t take long, ´til he meets the union leader James Hoffa. Both Russell and Jimmy are almost like father figures for Frank. Fathers who demanded everything from him...<br/><br/>Based on the true story of Frank Sheeran (the ""Irishman"") and the book by Charles Brandt, Scorsese shot a three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic that is not a copy of earlier films by him, such as ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino"". Scorsese does not focus on how ""cool"" the gangster life can be. We as viewers see a lot of the everyday life of Frank and Co, but that's exactly how it is with many mafia bosses and followers. The bloodshed, the killing, and all the other criminal things that go on there are an important part of it, but there's much more to that. And I love ""The Irishman"" for illuminating the quiet moments that you rarely see in these films. For a Scorsese film, ""The Irishman"" is very reserved, but no less powerful.<br/><br/>Sometimes I felt like I might have needed some background knowledge for the story, but in the end you understand pretty well what the film is about. The focus is also not on the political events in the film, but also on the characters and their relationships with each other.<br/><br/>De Niro, Pesci and Pacino are all great and it's just a dream to watch these legends together in a movie. The supporting roles are also wonderfully cast and well played, but I honestly don't expect anything else from a director like Scorsese. Like Tarantino, he can get so much out of every actor. But of course, the three gentlemen are the stars here and, in my eyes, celebrate their big comeback in a film that was made for them. De Niro convinces with his reserved, naive streak, Pacino is wild and his actions unpredictable and Pesci is the calm, loving but also highly dangerous man in the background. This combination justifies the film's long playtime. Of course, this is very high with almost three and a half hours (209 minutes), but firstly, Netflix naturally gives you the option to watch the film in episodes, and secondly, almost every minute in the film is valuable and important. I could hardly have imagined cuts now that I saw the film. And the time just flies by, but of course everyone can decide for themselves how they want to watch the film.<br/><br/>Robbie Robertson's soundtrack is strong, the song selection is also contemporary and the CGI effects, especially those used to digitally ""rejuvenate"" De Niro & Co, were really strong. It was recognizable here and there, but at some point, I didn't care due to the great story and the great actors. Some green screen-effects weren´t that convincing and the biggest problem with the effects is the movement of the actors. While their face is de-aged, there body speaks a different language, which was very noticeable in a ""kicking scene"" with De Niro. Yet it is amazing how much money this film cost and even more astonishing that ""Netflix"" financed it without hesitation. However, the end result speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Conclusion: ""The Irishman"" tells a well-known story and takes a look at it from a different side. Martin Scorsese stages everything so extraordinarily powerful and with attention to detail that I never really noticed the long running time. A masterful director, fabulous editing, great music and three great actors who are making their comeback and have made themselves even more immortal."

","Telling the story of this man seems kind of boring, and yet I didn't turn it off. It was strangely engaging. I'm not sure if the story of Frank required the 3.5 hours it too to tell it, but I can't think of anything that should have been cut out. You needs to know most of what was presented to us the audience to understand why Frank does what he does. I did enjoy the non-linear timeline and the acting was great. That being said, mob stories are not my favorite. I didn't love this movie, but it was still good."

In my eyes, Deniro should've played Pacino's role and cast someone younger (possibly Tom Hardy or DiCaprio). That or better de-aging like they used ironically in the Marvel movies. Also, way too long. Several scenes could've easily been left in the cutting room."
"jeroboam-26661","6","1","3","31 January 2020"," For Scorsese fans only
","Although the film is Made well enough I think Scorsese's career has become almost synonymous with gangster pictures. There was a reason why film studios didn't want invest in this movie and that's because they know the public has already seen this stuff multiple times and aren't rushing back to see it again.
Having said that this movie has a lot of the same genius as Marty's other gangster pics as far as acting and cinematography but I really wasn't that engaged until about two hours into the movie. Those first two hours were about as interesting to me as watching a documentary on a subject I didn't care about. Unless you are a fan of gangster history it probably wouldn't be that interesting to the average person. There was really no reason to be sympathetic to any of the characters until the 3rd hour. I would recommend this only to Scorsese fans because the time invested in this movie is barely worth the reward for the average viewer."

De Niro finally played in a Scorsese movie after 24 years and with De Niro's will Joe Pesci came out of retirement and a ""tour de force"" was delivered by Al Pacino(at age of 79).I don't know are we going to watch masterpieces like it in the future but if there won't,don't regret that you didn't watch The Irishman.Just watch it."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","29 January 2020"," Martin Scorsese indulges himself a bit too much
","The Irishman sees Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci reunited to film yet another epic gangster film. This time with the addition of Al Pacino.<br/><br/>And these are great actors and a great director. Which means that there's bound to be some really good scenes in the film. And there are. Whenever any of the three actors share screen time, it has that awe to it. The rest of the cast is pretty forgettable, on the other hand, and even with such powerhouse actors, you need a good story to really prop them up.<br/><br/>Which is unfortunately the greatest failing of this film. Clocking in at three and a half hours, it's one of the longest films I've seen in years. And I have nothing against long films per se. Once Upon a Time in America, another gangster film of epic length, is one of my all-time favourite movies. But you need to keep it moving. You need to keep the story evolving. But in this film we learn the overall moral very early on. We learn the eventual fates of its key players very early on. So it's just a simple matter of going from dot to dot, until we get to the end. Which just about kills all the tension there is to be had.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese obviously wanted to talk about growing old. He wanted to talk about looking back and regretting the choices you have made in your life, the paths you didn't take. And putting such a theme into a gangster film is not a bad idea. Especially when the one to do so is one of the acknowledged masters of the genre. Unfortunately, in this instance, I think we could have gotten a better movie out of these characters if we had kept the whole ""growing old sucks, guys"" stuff out of it.<br/><br/>Still, there are a lot of people that rave about this film. So I guess it must hit some notes with them that it simply didn't with me. And it has some really impressive stuff in it, I freely admit that. They just didn't come together for me. But perhaps they will, for you."

I give that book and 8.5 and this pezzo di merda movie a 2.<br/><br/>First of all Francis Sheehan was a big ox of a fellow and he was an Irishman. He married a very Irish woman and they had Irish looking kids. So where was casting?
And speaking of casting anyone remember Godfather II where they had the problem of portraying Marlon Brando as a young man? Can you imagine if they had rigged a Madame Tussaud version of old Marlon Brando with putty and other ""Six Feet Under""-type beauty aids to play young Vito Corleone? The same goes for Pacino as Hoffa. Jimmy Hoffa was a thick headed ""dutchmen"" as the guineas said where I grew up in northern NJ....he was in no way Italian.<br/><br/>But let's forget all that (as one should do with this whole cazzata movie.) I want to talk about the music. Frank Sheehan, Jimmy, and Russell were grown up already for WWII just like my dad and all my Italian uncles. At parties in the 50's, 60's and 70's they listened to Perry Como, Jerry Vale, Jimmy Roselli , Sinatra et. al...they did not listen to the gritty Black R&B music in many parts of this soundtrack. Even though the music was of that time it was not of that culture."
"toonyjakes","6","1","3","25 January 2020"," Nominated for 10 Oscars??? Psssht
","Just like many Scorsese fans, I was waiting for this movie to come out since the day I heard of it. I didn't know exactly what it would be, even though I knew who was going to star in it. But once I spent a grueling 3 and a half hours (divided into 2 days) I just found myself sleepy, bored, let down.<br/><br/>Plot- The story follows the memory of an assassin that had something to do with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. I think it's extremely drawn out, like, I was yawning an hour in. Doesn't matter how flashy SOME scenes can be, doesn't matter that we have the gangster actor aficionados of our lifetime on screen, and most importantly- it doesn't matter that it is directed by one of the finest filmmakers ever. It was just underwhelming. Scarface is 3 hours and feels like 2, just like Casino. I was bored.<br/><br/>Characters/Acting- You know, I love DeNiro, but the guy never plays anyone but DeNiro. He's like a glamorized Seth Rogen at this point. I know the main cast is elderly, but dude, we get it. Pesci plays a quiet guy, barely hear him half the time. Pacino, on the other hand, kills it. He's the only guy I observed in admiration. Otherwise all the other characters could have been yanked right from a bad episode of the also highly overrated 'The Supranos.'<br/><br/>Writing- It was good, nothing I remember though. Yada yada, bunch of tough guys talking. Some parts are tense near the end. Otherwise it's just kinda bland.<br/><br/>Quality- Great cinematography, great editing, but I mean some parts weren't believable. There's a scene where DeNiro is kicking someone and it just made me laugh. Lazy stuff.<br/><br/>Overall, I turned on this film being a solid Scorsese fan- I loved The Departed, Goodfellas, Casino, Wolf Of Wallstreet, Taxi Driver, the George Harrison documentary. But this is seriously, immensely overrated. It's like an effect that diehard Kanye West fans experience- no matter what your favorite artist does, you love it, you praise it. I can finally say that Scorsese is capable of making not so impressive films. He should shut up about Marvel and make something super himself."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Another high quality gangster film entered into this plump genre. It was a special delight to have Scorsese direct De Niro, Pacino and Pesci in the same film. The film revolves around De Niro who plays Sheeran, a labor union leader turned hitman and Pacino who plays Jimmy Hoffa whose lives were intertwined for many years. Primarily told in a series a long flashbacks, the film shows how the two men started and became linked in crime. It was more an introspective look at these aging gangsters and the choices they made in their lives. Clocking in at a beefy 3.5 hours, it had ample time to develop the characters and follow them through many events and prison stints. It had all the tried and true gangster film characteristics, told the story well yet failed to truly impact my emotions. There were very few memorable scenes or lines found in other notable gangster films. This was certainly very good yet it didn't exceed my lofty expectations and (speaking of Irishman) I actually enjoyed Kill the Irishman more despite the acting firepower in The Irishman. Ha"

"meganjack-23247","2","1","3","21 January 2020"," A Meagre Imitation of Bygone Hollywood Patriarchy
","Far from a masterpiece, this three hour sluggish meander into overly familiar territory by Martin Scorsese is nothing more than a desperate bid to cling onto old Hollywood patriarchy. Whilst this may seem like a bold claim, it is evident that Scorsese is eager to not only play homage to his career, the stalwarts of his repertoire such as Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, but he is also bidding a reluctant farewell to a bygone era of male, white dominance.
Frankly, this narrative does not seem to hold the same weight as when its predecessors dominated screens. This is in part due to the fact that this is a story which has been told to death and executed to perfection, by none other than Scorsese himself, so anything afterwards leaves a trite, tired aftertaste. The result being a dated, irrelevant and tediously meagre imitation, which falls short of any substance due to its lack of paramount significance.
The Irishman's story is as expected; a well-meaning working man gets in with a mafia boss and starts working his way up the ranks, as a result he starts to suffer the consequences of being involved in such a lifestyle. This has been done countless times within Goodfellas, The Godfather, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Departed, Casino etc. And it goes without saying that every single one of these execute this with a particular perfection that The Irishman cannot capture. Told through a mixture of flashbacks, flash-forwards and present day narration, one would assume that the story would progress, however, these ploys only serve to highlight the flaws which exist even more. The narration by De Niro's main character, Frank, has an air of indolent detachment, and you can almost believe that Scorsese plucked De Niro straight from his own retirement home to narrate.
Throughout there is an unshakeable feeling of stale, trodden water, as you watch the events (or lack thereof) occur. Irksomely for the mammoth run-time, there is very little to non-existent character development, which leaves one wondering what exactly it is Scorsese has invested his time and effort into. The script is dry, highly unimaginative and frankly superficial especially since characters come and go quicker than Ricky Gervais' being blacklisted from the Golden Globes. The little Italy setting is trite, irrelevant and underexplored, feeling as though Fat Tony would've been more threatening or at least entertaining. Not to mention women have virtually no role in this film, apart from a moment where Welker White is noted as being the brains behind Al Pacino's Jimmy Hoffa. Anna Paquin has a silent role as the disapproving, passive daughter of Frank, in all that this is meant to speak volumes, her silence is resoundingly symbolic of an industry notorious for shunning women.
For the first hour of the film, we follow Frank in a series of flashbacks, depicting his initial meeting with mafia boss, Russel (Joe Pesci) through to his full integration. It is here where we are led to believe that Frank is ""young"" man, maybe late twenties, if that, by the use of CGI de-aging technology. There is a plethora of issues with this, including De Niro's detracting soulless eyes, which are severely distracting considering the realism this is supposed to achieve. However, this is indicative of a film completely dead behind the eyes, lacking the heart and soul which made Scorsese a master of a genre he can at best now only imitate. The use of this technology highlights a fear to give-way to a changing industry, awoken to the anxieties and issues within multicultural modern society.
Context aside, the technology does not do the actors nor the characters any favours. Exemplified in a scene, which I believe will go down in notoriety for how not to execute dramatic action, whereby De Niro threateningly beats a grocery clerk. However, this looks as though it was filmed in slow motion and is unforgivably obvious that this is geriatric body struggling to act with the gumption of a vengeful, twenty something gangster. It is both insulting and startling that in the age of deep fakes, an acclaimed director has billed this as acceptable. Not only does this undermine his reputation, audience's intelligence but it serves to perpetuate the longevity of hegemonic power. Scorsese could have used younger actors, fresh actors but instead he has stubbornly stuck with ""his"" actors, refusing to give up on an industry crumbling and deteriorating, even forcing Pesci out of retirement to work on the film.
Everything feels tired, and stuck in the past, entangled in old Hollywood traditions. Far from playing homage to these great veterans, it has served to undermine them, whether that be De Niro's apathetic performance or Al Pacino's comical over acting. Only Pesci seems to save this, his scenes being the most charismatic of them all. Perhaps this is a sign more than anything else, to let Hollywood patriarchy die."

","Loong, boring movie about men at their worst, that is, long scenes of subdued, indirect, emotionless dialog, punctuated with quick scenes of violent bloodshed.

The most interesting performance was by a woman who played the Irishman's daughter in a brief scene where she told him what a crappy dad he'd been. Other than that, it was all as dull as the 50s, 60s, and 70s interior set design. And, OK, maybe that's all historically accurate, but it wasn't great storytelling; great storytelling shouldn't put you to sleep. The only thing it has going for it is the historic aspect (the only reason I kept watching)."

Anna Paquin has a silent role as the disapproving, passive daughter of Frank, in all that this is meant to speak volumes, her silence is resoundingly symbolic of an industry notorious for shunning women.<br/><br/>For the first of the film, we follow Frank in a series of flashbacks, depicting his initial meeting with mafia boss, Russel (Joe Pesci) through to his full integration. It is here where we are led to believe that Frank is ""young"" man, maybe late twenties, if that by the use of CGI de-aging technology. There are plethora of issues with this, including De Niro's detracting soulless eyes, which are severely distracting considering the realism this is supposed to achieve. However, this is indicative of a film completely dead behind the eyes, lacking the heart and soul which made Scorsese a master of a genre he can best now only imitate. The use of this technology highlights a fear to give-way to a changing industry, awoken to the anxieties and issues with multicultural modern society.<br/><br/>Context aside, the technology does not do the actors nor the characters any favours. Exemplified in a scene, which I believe will go down in notoriety for how not to execute dramatic action, whereby De Niro threateningly beats a grocery clerk. However this looks as though it was filmed in slow motion and is unforgivably obvious that this is geriatric body struggling yo act with the gumption of a vengeful, twenty something gangster. It is both insulating and startling that in the age of deep fakes, an acclaimed director has billed this as acceptable. Not only does this undermine his reputation, audience's intelligence but it serves to perpetuate the longevity of a hegemonic power. Scorsese could have used younger actors, fresh actors but instead he has stubbornly stuck with ""his"" actors, refusing to give up on an industry crumbling and deteriorating, even forcing Pesci out of retirement to work on the film.<br/><br/>Everything feels tired, and stuck in the past, entangled in old Hollywood traditions. Far from playing homage to these great veterans, it has served to undermine them, whether that be De Niro's apathetic performance or Al Pacino's comical over acting. Only Pesci seems to save this, his scenes being the most charismatic of them all. Perhaps this is a sign more than anything else, to let Hollywood patriarchy die."

","All the elements were in place to produce a great mob-style movie. Unfortunately, Scorsese' latest entry into this field falls just short of being memorable. While certainly not a bad movie, The Irishman felt to me like a movie made by a guy who has lost a little off of his fastball. Even the iconic actors populating this movie seemed to be moving in slightly less than full speed. Most of Scorsese' monumental work was an amalgam of kinetic energy with violent undertones that seemed inn inhabit the viewer's very being. The intensity was so overbearing in Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Casino, etc. that I often found myself literally gasping for air and looking over my shoulder for fear that I would be the next mob-hit victim. Not so in this movie. Maybe it's time for Marty to put this genre to bed."

"theojoannou","9","1","3","9 January 2020"," A riveting ride through history led by three masters of their craft.
","The Irishman steps away from modern cinema, and takes us back to the glory days of Hollywood, with legendary performances by De Niro, Pesci and Pacino which we've become so accustomed to. Scorsese' trademark style is evident throughout the film providing us with the old school gangster feel which he has so elegantly mastered throughout his career. All this being said, it was crucial for Scorsese to find a script worthy of harbouring some of the greatest actors of our time, and it was easy to look no further than the astounding life story of Frank Sheeran 'The Irishman'. One reason as to why this film was so special without even commenting upon the stellar acting, screenplay and music, is the way the Irishman dives deep into American history, seemingly exploiting some of Americas best kept secrets. As an avid fan of history and politics, I found myself blown away by some of hidden complexities involved in some of Americas most notorious historical moments, The Irishman goes deep into the exploits of Jimmy Hoffa and his mysterious disappearance on July 30th 1975, the election of Kennedy, The Bay Of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis, exploring all these topics from the view of the mob and the impact they had upon all of them.<br/><br/>Although Hollywood has tackled all these topics before, what elevates The Irishman to another level is the impeccable acting by the legendary cast Scorsese was able to assemble. I can honestly say it was a pleasure watching three iconic actors share the screen and deliver masterful performances whilst being expertly supported by the rest of the cast which did not lack masterful actors in itself. Even though all the acting was done impeccably by every cast member, it was Joe Pesci who stole the show starring as Russel Buffalino, an Italian-born American mobster who became the crime boss of the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family known as the Bufalino crime family. We've all grown to love Pesci as the wild and erratic little man as portrayed in films such as Casino and Goodfellas, his characters have always wore their heart on their sleeves and always made rash violent decisions. The Irishman sees Pesci completely step away from that dynamic, he captivates the audience with a calm, collected and controlling demeanour throughout the film, a true Wise-guy. Someone who inspires fear without the threat of violence, but through respect and authority. As stated in the film: ""All roads lead back to Russ"". Pesci put his stamp on every scene he was in and gave a performance which will truly cement his legacy as one of the greatest actors of all time.<br/><br/>Even though The Irishman has multiple layers, themes and storylines, the one which truly captivated me was the testing loyalty and betrayal thrust upon Sheeran whilst working for both Hoffa and Russ. Two characters who were his mentors and who he respected and adored more than anyone else. This was highlighted right at the start of the film, although not evident at that particular time. Sheeran removes a watch from his wrist given to him by Hoffa and a ring given by Russel. This symbolises his allegiance to both men early on and for the rest of the film we see his relationship with both men grow, and his struggles to contain the growing tension between Hoffa and Russ (The Mob). The revolutionary age altering technology only allowed the actors to add different layers to their characters and allowed them to develop in way that could have never been done before. Although the Film is very long in its nature and the last 40 minutes do seem to drag out, it is essential to be able to explore Sheerans outlook on the events, the ending shows how Frank reflecting on all the events that have happened, and gives you the an outlook on life from a cold blooded mobster.<br/><br/>The Irishman is a farewell for most of these legends, a love letter to the genre, and the last of its kind, which goes out exactly how Scorsese wanted it: in true mobster style."
"petematheny","7","1","3","6 January 2020"," It's just ok

"LiamDoesntLikeMovies","9","1","3","6 January 2020"," Scorsese has not lost it
","The Irishman is a classic gangster-mafia film in the genre of Goodfellas and Godfather, delivering a faithful yet fresh experience. The movie tells the story of Robert De Niro, the Irishman, and his place in the Italian mafia, led by Joe Pesci, and his relationship with work union icon Jimmy Hoffa, Al Pacino.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is stellar. After being disappointed with De Niro and Pacino in recent years, I was more than pleasantly surprised with their performances, with Al Pacino being a standout, captivating in every scene. Huge credit to Scorsese's direction, bringing out the best in De Niro, Pesci and Pacino with a visible passion in each of their performances.<br/><br/>The movie takes place over 5 decades, and the makeup and performances really selling the different ages of the characters. 76 year old Robert De Niro seamlessly transfers from being in his spritely 30s to his crippled 80s.<br/><br/>I had one issue with the movie in one of its action scenes, where at kicks to the face and stamps on the foot, the lack of contact and timing with the sound was laughable. But that sequence is less than a minute long, with other action pieces being much more polished.<br/><br/>A main concern I had going into it was the runtime. However, knowing the runtime, you should be alright. The pacing in the writing dragged at no point, never feeling slow, and consistently investing me into the story. The runtime is definitely not gratuitous, with no scenes able to be cut without meaningful sacrifice. I have definitely sat through many 2 hour movies that felt far longer than this. I would highly recommend this film to be watched in one sitting if possible."
"donaldricco","8","1","3","6 January 2020"," The film is better than the book!
","Excellent movie with amazing talent! And De Niro and Pesci are calm throughout!?!? Pacino, not so much. I could have used more Keitel, but that's splitting hairs a bit. Love the way Scorsese makes a movie, and as per usual, the music plays a big part! I could swear I heard ""The Godfather Theme"" in here, and maybe some bit of score from ""The Untouchables""? I also liked the whole story with Hoffa, the Kennedys, Cuba, and all of the other real life events that weaved in and out of the plot. What kept me from giving this 5 stars is that it really peters out at the end, stretching much too long into Frank's declining health. And the whole thing with Peggy seemed purposeless, and overwrought, and really, had little, if nothing, to do with the overall plot."
"Turfseer","6","1","3","3 January 2020"," Scorsese's tale of famed union leader hit compromised by slow pacing and a sense of déjà vu
","The Irishman is based on the life of the film's narrator, Frank Sheeran, a truck driver turned hitman, who claims he killed both the notorious Mafioso Joey Gallo and famed Teamsters union leader, Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>
Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) begins the narration as an old man in a nursing home. His account presents two flashbacks: the first recounting how he started out as a Teamster union truck driver in his 20s and a second, when he's driving with his mentor Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), the head of a Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family, along with their two wives, to attend the wedding of Bufalino's cousin's daughter in Detroit in the 1970s.<br/><br/>
The ""drive to Detroit"" foreshadows the events leading up to the second act ""dark moment"" (where Sheeran ends up murdering Hoffa). Like many scenes in this 3 ½ hour film, the extended ""pit stops"" depicting the banal conversations between Bufalino and Sheeran in the car (and on the road), just end up slowing the film's pace down considerably. It's designed to emphasize one of the film's major themes: the banality of evil of Mafia goons-a point made in almost every scene in this film ad infinitum.<br/><br/>
Scorsese uses special effects to de-age his principals in the flashbacks, so DeNiro is supposed to look in his 20s when we first meet him. Unfortunately, he looks nowhere what he used to look like (in real life) when he was in Taxi Driver back in the 70s. Here he looks more like he's in his mid-40s. But Scorsese is much more successful in de-aging Pesci, who appears true to his chronological age in the early part of the film.<br/><br/>
The first part of the film-the expository scenes- is long-winded for sure but it kept my interest. This is where the Teamsters' union lawyer Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano) gets Sheeran off the hook when he's accused of theft by his company after a load of meat disappears from the back of Sheeran's truck following a delivery.<br/><br/>
You could say that the film's ""inciting incident"" occurs when Sheeran is formally introduced to Russell Bufalino. It's under Bufalino's direction that Sheeran gets further immersed in crime to the point where he begins murdering people.<br/><br/>
Unlike DeNiro, who not only does not look Irish but basically recapitulates his usual gangster performance, Pesci steals the show as Sheeran's low-key protector, who appears quite menacing despite his demeanor as an insincere mediator.<br/><br/>
The break into the second act is when Sheeran begins working for Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) as his assistant. The first half of act two proves to be the weakest part of the film since the focus is lost on Sheeran as our protagonist, with Hoffa suddenly emerging as the key player. Pacino's acting, like DeNiro, is already too familiar, to convince us that we're watching Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>
Instead of dramatizing the conflicts between the characters, Scorsese resorts to his old bag of tricks, using narration to move the plot along. What it all amounts to is a history lesson about Bobby Kennedy's vendetta (as attorney general) against Hoffa, which only ended after JFK's assassination.<br/><br/>
Things pick up again at the midpoint when the focus is back on Sheeran who ends up killing Joey Gallo in Little Italy. While this scene effectively recreates the Gallo ""hit""-necessary to emphasize the escalating nature of Sheeran's growing involvement as a mobster--Scorsese also appears to revel in the violence which he appears to condemn (why is the 1971 murder of Joseph Columbo filmed in slow motion?).<br/><br/>
There is a good scene in prison involving Anthony ""Pro"" Provenzano (Stephen Graham), a union boss, who has bad blood with Hoffa over being denied his pension (Hoffa explains he gets his due to the more violent nature of Pro's criminal conviction).<br/><br/>
Eventually a group of mobsters conclude that Hoffa, once released from prison (and now trying to get his old job back as union boss), has been manipulating pension funds and cutting them out of profits in their respective rackets. Bufalino in one of the best scenes asks Sheeran to ""talk some sense"" into Hoffa, but the hothead ex-union boss ""won't listen to reason.""<br/><br/>
This takes place at a testimonial dinner for Sheeran where Hoffa is the keynote speaker. With more judicious editing, Scorsese could have gotten right to the point in the dramatic scene where Sheeran attempts to ""read the riot act"" to Hoffa. But the dinner scene just goes on for too long which is the case for many of the scenes here in this movie.<br/><br/>
The same slow pacing applies to the scene leading up to Hoffa's murder. Often Scorsese resorts to seemingly improvised dialogue, again highlighting his ""banality of evil"" theme. Particularly ineffective is all the patter about the smelly ""fish"" in the car right before Hoffa is driven to the death house. The comic relief might have worked in ""Good Fellas,"" but now it all seems shop worn.<br/><br/>
Scorsese does a good job recapitulating the various fates of his mobsters. Sheeran, in his final days, comes off as an empty vessel, particularly in highlighting the estrangement of his daughter Peggy (she blames him for Hoffa's murder, a man she was close to during her childhood).<br/><br/>
Probably Scorsese's best point about Sheeran is that he's unable to acknowledge his own involvement in immoral acts-instead he rationalizes his behavior to another daughter-by claiming he was simply trying to ""protect"" his family.<br/><br/>
The Irishman could have been much better had Scorsese used more judicious editing but even so, his tale of gangsters' banality of evil also seems to have been told one too many times before."

","This movie is good, let there be no doubt about that. However it is being dragged down a notch by the main casts age and the solution they came up with to get around that fact. The de-aging tech they used from Star Wars/Captain Marvel etc. is good but not good enough to pull them out of of the uncanny valley. Which is basically a cgi effect mimmicking reality very closely but not good enough for our brain to spot the difference. This movie suffers from that greatly. De Niro, Pacino and Pesci are all respectable old men and great actors, but they can't hide that they have tired old bodies. The De-aging works on the face but not on their posture. The uncanny valley hits you because they look like 49, but they movie like 80 year old men. Especially De Niro suffers from this. Of all 3 actors De Niro looks the most tired, while he actually has the most active role, which causes a disconnect with the audience. I agree with lots of other reviewers that the younger years should have been played by younger actors, which would have increased the energy of this movie. As it stands right now it feels like a nostalgic project between 4 tired old friends trying to relive their hay days."

"fscouto2001","9","1","3","30 December 2019"," An instant (modern) classic
","The Irishman proves to be one of Scorsese's best. It's a slow-telling story with its own pace but it just makes us feel the reality of what truly happened in the depths of the American mafia. It reminds us of The Godfather, there's no question about it (in a dining scene you can almost swear you hear the chords of The Godfather's theme song), with some subtleties of Tarantino's humour.
The story of Frank Sheeran is a story of a man who ranks up to be the hitman and friend of the headmaster of a mob family, Russel Bufalino, and of his friendship with the president of the teamsters' union, Jimmy Hoffa. To properly tell this story, Scorsese joined Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci all together; and may I point out they are truly remarkable. Al Pacino gives us one of his best performances of a man who is relentless and refuses to give up of the things he fought for. His character is balanced by the calm but intimidating presence of Joe Pesci's Russel Bufalino who always keeps his profile up no matter the problems.
Besides the actors, one must talk about the directing and the editing: the intelligence of how the cameras move and jump from the past to the present show us the ability Scorsese possesses to tell a story in the right way, which only a few can. One of the other things worth talking about is the production design. Nowadays, everything can be made, but The Irishman has a large period range (50s-80s more or less) and sincerely captures the essence of these times.
So, even if it's long and slow paced, The Irishman just makes you immerse in the story and enjoy one of the finest modern directors' work. One among the best of the year."

"Xaero_EST","5","1","3","28 December 2019"," Not Really Cinema at All
","Ironic how Martin Scorsese recently critiqued comic book movies for not being ""cinema"" because they do not ""convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being"" (1), while he himself is fresh off the release of ""The Irishman,"" which does none of what he thinks cinema is really about (2).<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" is an interminable 3.5-hour film whose main focus is a mouthbreathing Robert De Niro with an immutable on-screen frown (which is actually a good fit for a character with ""the emotional range of a teaspoon"" (3)) whose character is a crook through and through from beginning to end: with no tangible ""emotional, psychological experiences"" worth the mention. And the same applies to the whole cast of characters who populate this film, all of them singularly unsympathetic (and this includes the superficial non-gangster characters as well). The only semblance of emotional tension in the entire film is at the very end when De Niro's character questions one of her adult daughters about the emotional toll his life as a gangster may have had on his family. Yet even that brief scene fails to deliver anything of substance so what you're ultimately left with is a movie that disappoints on all fronts, with the possible exceptions of cinematography (and even this aspect was subpar for a Scorsese film), the score, and Joe Pesci's portrayal of a person who has had a stroke. If Wikipedia is anything to go by, then there even was a factual error shown on screen regarding the year when one of the characters was murdered in real life.<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" is a two-bit remake of ""Goodfellas"" with none of the character and barely any of the style that made ""Goodfellas"" such an enjoyable cinematic experience. Recent comic book films that I have seen have almost wholly been trash (""Logan"" was pretty good though) but somehow Scorsese has managed to piece together a film that is even a bigger waste of time and effort for anybody that actually shares Scorsese's own infatuation for the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Sam Fuller, Don Siegel, Ingmar Bergman and the rest, and his appreciation of classic, quality filmmaking (2). Scorsese can wax eloquent about cinematic auteurs all he wants but ""The Irishman"" goes to show that simply having good taste does not inoculate against bad judgment and bad directing."

"ArmenPandolaITSJUSTAMOVIECOM","5","1","3","25 December 2019"," The Long and Winding Road to Nowhere
","THE IRISHMAN<br/><br/>The Irishman is about the relationship among three main characters: Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) and Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). Hoffa was head of the Teamsters Union in the 1950s and early 60s, but it's his connection to the Kennedys that is at the core of this movie.<br/><br/>In 1961, with the help of his father's mob connections, John Kennedy was elected President. He appointed his brother, Robert, as Attorney General. Robert Kennedy made the arrest and conviction of Hoffa a top priority. Hoffa was jailed for trying to bribe a juror and fraud, then pardoned by Richard Nixon in 1971 (he gave Nixon a large contribution). By that time, he had lost control of the Teamsters and was banned from holding office in a union, but he refused to retire and was fighting to get back 'his union' when he disappeared on July 30, 1975, never to be heard from again.<br/><br/>The Irishman is Martin Scorsese's fourth movie about the mob or gangsters (I don't count The Gangs of New York as a mob movie) among over fifty non-gangster movies, but this is what he is known for. It runs for three and a half hours - or I should say, strolls, leisurely cutting back and forth in time from the early 1950s to the turn of the century. Veteren screenwriter Steven Zaillian wrote the script from Charles Brandt's book, ""I Heard You Paint Houses, "" the title of the book being mob-talk for a hit man.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese loves voice over narration and most of his mob movies have voice-over narration as does this one by Sheeran. He starts out as a truck driver who helps things fall off the back of the truck - in his case, sides of beef - and ends up a mob hitman. Along the way, he marries, divorces and has four daughters, one of whom refuses to have anything to do with him when she gets old enough to understand what he was - a murderer.<br/><br/>The Irishman is not primarily the story of Jimmy Hoffa which has been told in a major film before, Danny DeVito's Hoffa (1992) from a script by David Mamet and starring Jack Nicholson in the title role. Hoffa was neither a critical nor commercial success.<br/><br/>In The Irishman, Scorsese has bigger fish to fry than the story of Hoffa - he wants to connect the election of John F. Kennedy, the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the CIA's undercover operations to kill Castro, the assassination of Kennedy and the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>He doesn't quite make it, but that doesn't stop him from trying very hard - like the fact that Sheeran in 1961 is ordered by Bufalino to take a truck to Miami that is loaded with military weapons and deliver it to 'a guy with big ears.' When Sheeran gets there and talks to the 'guy with big ears' we see that the guy doesn't have big ears because, as the big-eared guy explains, he had an operation to fix them. The weapons are loaded into a van with Spanish writing on its side - apparently these are weapons that were used in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. All of this is done so that thirteen years later, when Sheeran is watching the Watergate hearings on TV and sees 'big ears' testifying, it can be revealed that he is Howard Hunt, a Watergate conspirator. So instead of just telling Sheeran to deliver the weapons to Howard Hunt we have a lot of time wasted on hiding who that person is just so we can be 'surprised' that it is Howard Hunt of Watergate fame.<br/><br/>There are very long scenes about ...nothing much. For example, the core of the movie is a long car trip that Sheeran takes with Bufalino and their wives. There is a lot of talk about taking 'cigarette breaks' and the fact that Bufalino makes many stops along the way to collect money from various people. All of this has nothing to do with anything.<br/><br/>Scorsese's use of the same actors playing their characters' decades-long relationships is made possible by using CGI to change the actors aging face. I don't know if it was a conscious decision, but all the actors look like they are wearing masks. And the fact that peoples' faces change, not just wrinkles, over time is a real hindrance to this technique. I was never distracted by it but I did wonder, at times, where we were in the story - is this older Sheeran or younger?<br/><br/>DeNiro and Pesci have the same great chemistry that has made them a delight to watch since Raging Bull. Pacino enters the movie about a third of the way through and gives it a boost. Ray Romano gives a solid performance as Bufalino's lawyer brother and Bobby Cannavale does his crazy mobster bit as Skinny Razor. But the best performance in the movie belongs to Stephen Graham (Capone in Boardwalk Empire) as Anthony 'Tony Pro' Provenzano, a rival of Hoffa's.<br/><br/>Is it worth watching? Of course - but don't get your hopes up. This isn't the crowning gem of anybody's career. It a long, too long, poorly told story of some very bad people who did some very bad things - things that Scorsese seems reluctant to touch. For example, Hoffa helped destroy not only the reputation of the Teamsters Union, but unions in general. Movies about union bosses rarely show them for what the vast majority were and are - leaders working to make life better for the working people of America. Instead, Scorsese's union bosses are all corrupt - or fools.<br/><br/>A final note - a lot of the action takes place in South Philadelphia where I grew up. There is not even a slight attempt to make it realistic and there are no South Philly accents in the movie. But there is Angelo Bruno (Harvey Keitel). I never figured out why he was in the movie. Local color I guess.<br/><br/>A final final note - a lot of the mobsters on display are introduced by a blurb on screen telling us what happened to the mobster e.g. for Bruno: shot in the head sitting in a car outside his home.

","Going into the 2019/2020 awards season as one of the favorites for taking home accolades ranging from ""best director"" to ""best picture,"" Martin Scorsese's long-winded period drama 'The Irishman' is surely a film that will capture the attention of a wide, diverse audience.<br/><br/>Sure, the main cast may be comprised of cinematic dinosaurs, but they've all earned the right to be referred to by their last names only: De Niro. Pacino. Pesci. As Scorsese proves here, there is no better actor to play an Irish-American than an Italian-American, with De Niro's Frank Sheeran proving to be one of the most honorably vengeful confidants that lived in the 20th century. At the center of 'Irishman' is the struggle between the Teamsters and the Federal government, with political infighting among the union's leadership serving as the backdrop for much of the on-screen action.<br/><br/>For many, the major takeaway of 'Irishman' is its length. Clocking in at three-and-a-half hours, the film is quite a time investment. But in true Scorsese fashion, this runtime is not for the sake of keeping the audience in its seats - it's all deliberate. For one, the timing allows for proper character development, as we get to see the real ups and downs in the relationships between Sheeran, Pacino's Jimmy Hoffa and Pesci's Russell Bufalino. And there are definitely a number of ups and downs. And what goes hand-in-hand with solid character development is smart dialogue - which there is plenty of to go around here.<br/><br/>Some may accuse 'The Irishman' as being a Scorsese vanity project. And to be fair, it totally is. But it's a very well done vanity project, and for that, it should be appreciated."

Except it's with hall-of-famer players who are already retired and way beyond their peak so it's just for fun and all the money goes to a charity or something. De Niro looks super awkward throughout the movie due to his body condition and the young make up doesn't help a whole lot. Al Pacino completely overacts in a bunch of scenes that it almost felt distracting. The story and characters felt unbalanced at times. Story points and characters that initially felt important got no screen time or got too much when not needed.

"MuckyMuckMan73","9","1","3","13 December 2019"," Engrossing epic crime drama in both runtime and scale
","Scorsese returns to the gangster genre with the epic The Irishman.
Told through flashback and present day we follow Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran (DeNiro) form a close relationship with mobster Russell Bufalino (Pesci). After becoming Bufalino's trusted right hand man Sheeran is given the task of helping union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) where a long lasting friendship is forged.
Scorsese has made a film that's epic in both runtime and scale. Set over decades from the 50s to 80s The Irishman is predominantly about ageing, loyalty, loss, regret and conflicted friendships within the criminal underbelly of the mafia.
At 3 1/2hrs The Irishman is long but never feels that way thanks to the captivating performances of DeNiro, Pacino & Pesci (who steals every scene he's in and makes you wonder why he retired so early). Pesci must be favourite for an Oscar for sure! The supporting cast is also excellent, especially Ray Romano, Bobby Cannavale and Brit Stephen Graham but Anna Paquin is severely underused with barely a line of dialogue to deliver.
The CGI is also to be commended. Flawlessly taking years off the three main protagonists.
So, The Irishman is a compelling drama, a little hard to follow at times with so many names to remember and criminal shenanigans going on, but which Scorsese strikes gold again in a genre he is so familiar with. A film I will definitely revisit and one of the best films of the year."

There is no memorable scenes from this movie in my opinion except for the fish/wet car seat scene which turned out to be an anticlimax and completely pointless.<br/><br/>The last half of the movie is so boring too when really I was expecting it to end with something dramatic or a bit of a bang.<br/><br/>Would I watch it again? - Absolutely not

","The ticket of admission (or streaming fee) in this case is not to watch a gangster movie. It is to watch a Scorsese movie with De Niro, Pacino, Pesci, Keitel... The Band, together again. It's like visiting an art gallery or a museum because it shows work of a particular artist. And when you know it's 3.5 hours long, you prepare accordingly. Simple as that.<br/><br/>The Irishman is the onscreen faithful version of a book, a book that recorded actual history and actual persons but offers a conclusion that is not proven to be as depicted. Nobody knows what happened to Jimmy Hoffa. The ending of the book and the movie is a possible version of history. The characters, each and every one is delivered in masterful portrayals. Absolutely enthralling and totally believable, interesting and disarming. Except Hoffa. Pacino does a superb job as Jimmy Hoffa but, without holding it against him, Pacino's Hoffa is not the Hoffa we know from historical photographs and documentaries. Nicholson's (1992) Hoffa was more true-to-life (sorry, Mr. Pacino).<br/><br/>The de-aging software did not bother me any more than makeup does in any movie, to age or de-age. It's what it is. You know it's ""make-up"", so, see it as part of the ""wardrobe"".<br/><br/>Scorsese's oeuvre is true to form but there is no innovation, no auteur's new signature that was not already established in Goodfellas (1990) or Casino (1995). In fact, I do believe I would rate Casino higher than The Irishman. The several references to the Kennedys serve also as Scorsese's way of establishing that the gangster culture seen in his films is not the exception in the shadows but the norm in the mainstream of our society. Martin Scorsese, from Taxi Driver (1976) to Raging Bull (1980) to Goodfellas (1990) to Casino (1995), to The Departed (2006), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) is showing us that crime, gangs and organized crime is not just somewhere out there but it is everywhere, at a every level, an integral part of how society functions. Wit The Irishman his statement uses a Union boss with mob connections that was, as the film claims, as big as The Beatles in his time.<br/><br/>What The Irishman has that Goodfellas and Casino do not have to the extent we see it here, is the study of the protagonist's character, the look into Frank Sheeran's soul in the last sequence of the film. And yes, it was necessary to watch the first 180 minutes in order to fully feel and understand the last twenty minutes ( the film is three hours thirty minutes including ten minutes of end titles).<br/><br/>How does this man feel about the life he led? Is there remorse? Is there introspection? Is there guilt or salvation? Is there a forgiving God? The Irishman is indeed about the last twenty minutes and I thank Mr. Scorsese and the gang for taking me through the first 180 minutes. Although all the devices and brilliant, masterful Direction were honed in the earlier movies, what is new in this latest Scorsese offering was the depth of the study of the character at the end of his life.<br/><br/>And this is where Mr. De Niro's performance becomes the equivalent of Itzhak Perlman performing Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. Those last twenty minutes is the soloist's finest moment under the watchful eye of conductor Scorsese."

"theredsky","9","1","3","1 December 2019"," The Irishman Review
","Martin Scorsese is still at the top of his game even after directing for more than 50 years. This is one of my favorite Scorsese films that he has directed behind Goodfellas and Taxi Driver. This film came so close to becoming a masterpiece if it wasn't for the first 30 minutes being a little too confusing. It was a little hard to understand what was going on but I eventually caught on to what was happening. There is not one bad performance in this film. Every actor brings their A-game especially Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino. Each of them is incredible in their roles and adds many different layers to their respective characters but I felt Joe Pesci did the best job. He made Russell Bufalino seem like an intimidating but kind character that was always intriguing to watch. Robert De Niro made his character, Frank Sheeran, seem like a hardcore badass who didn't make enough time for his family and Al Pacino made Jimmy Hoffa feel like a kind yet hotheaded and naive man. The script and de aging effects done on these characters is great also. Most films that use de aging and aging effects don't like that great in the light but Martin Scorsese found a way to make it look really good. The actors make these effects even better. When they are made to look younger, the actors use their physical performance to look younger and the same when they are aged to look older. They use their physical performance to make themselves feel older. Even though the movie is 3 and a half hours long, I never felt the runtime. The story is always investing even when it is confusing. I was never bored throughout the course of the film. The last hour of the film was fantastic. If you have seen the trailers then you know the film has Jimmy Hoffa in it played by Al Pacino and the last hour ""deals"" with him. It's beautifully executed and acting and the final scene is heartbreaking yet intriguing. Although this is far from Scorsese's first look at mobsters and gangsters, this film does enough that is unique to differentiate itself from his other works. The soundtrack choices were great and fit the tone of the film pretty well and all the other technical aspects were done pretty well. Overall, The Irishman is yet again another great look at mobsters with fantastic performances, a compelling story, and fantastic direction from Martin Scorsese."

3. The cinematography is awful. It's like he wants it to look bad and the use of colour/shadow is poor.<br/><br/>Watch it or don't watch it, you miss nothing from not bothering with this movie. It is instantly forgettable. Such a pity considering the great cast."

","After watching the movie I just felt sad, not because it was a bad movie but because it was the realisation that it's the last time we will see a movie like this and last time we see this amazing cast.
Al Pacino De Niro and Keitel but a special mention to Joe Pesci who was just incredible. Loved seeing him playing the boss and opposite of what we have seen him play in the likes of Goodfellas and Casino.
These pwerehouses of their industry will be a huge loss but at least we got to see them at the top of their game in so many movies.
All hope is not lost though with some great performances from a younger generation of actors who play fantastic roles in The Irishman. Stephen Graham (needs an Al Capone movie just for Stephen by the way) once again really shows what a quality actor he is and i really liked Domenick Lombardozzi as Fat Tony even though it was a small part.
I see some reviews saying oh was too long and could have taken an hour if easy. Well they are all wrong and obviously have the attention span of a small child. Personally I hope Marty brings out a uncut version 6 hours long as I wish I could have seen more and learned more about other characters ie fat Tony as well as others.
I found the story very interesting as I never knew how the mafia used the unions for cash. Every scene just seemed to suck me in and was listening intently to every word.
If you are a movie buff you will love this movie, if all you like to watch is fast and furious or just violent gangster movies with no story or just a bad story maybe The Irishman isn't for you.
All in all it was a joy to watch and can't wait to watch again. I've seen Goodfellas god knows how many times and I'm sure The Irishman will be in the same category."

Defo not the Pesci power we love so much.<br/><br/>Movie could have been a bit shorter, a bit, well, at least 1 hour ... It dragged on quite a bit.

USA of the 70ies is great to see, I bet it didn't look as good back when it was real.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie, is that none of the characters are likable.. It's not like Casino or Goodfellas where you can somehow root for the guy despite being a gangster..Not this time, Anybody in this movie, could have gotten randomly blown up at any time during the movie and you just wouldn't care one bit.

","Let's start with full disclosure about me and Scorsese. Taxi and Fellas appealed thru artless violence. Silence and Last, conspicuous attempts to ""teach us"" about God and/or religion, were sophomoric and poorly paced. Some of his other films I have never seen. Bull was hilariously cultish, and I loved it, but it was not stellar art. Departed, Aviator, Fear, Wolf, and Gangs are some of the best movies EVER made. EVER. EVER. Woops! 80% of those star Leo.....!! So I am a fan but I do not worship The Martin.
Irishman starts slow, really slow, and the de aging process is a spectacular fail. If we could make a dinosaur 26 years ago, we should be able unmake a dinosaur today. It actually looked like a ceramic face mold, not even made out of rubber. Whoever was in charge of this blew it; the Emperors have no clothes, and look like hoes. Old hoes.
I have never seen a mafia production after GF2 that was not a pale and predictable imitation of Coppola, except the Sopranos. In fairness to Scorsese, we have seen all possible mafia permutations, so the genre is already played out. I am trying to figure out what makes this movie special. And, come on, I adore Pacino, but he has been playing himself for 47 years.
Maybe the high score is due to millennials being so weary of MCU that ANYTHING is a relief."

","Best movie of Pacino, Deniro, and Pesci's last twenty years. I was annoyed at the beginning and within the first quarter I was so drawn in I didn't realize. All three should win a tie for best actor, cause they cometely fuel each other throughout the movie. All three are preserved legends after this masterpiece!"
"Andrew-Alan-Scott","10","1","3","28 November 2019"," Scorsese's best since Goodfellas
","Full of that rich, slick yet subtle sense of menace that Scorsese is so good at, wonderfully detailed and visually period-on-point.
At 3.5 hours the film still moves at a comfortable and constant pace. Where in past Scorsese has relied a bit too heavily on voice-over, he lets this story play out in action and visual story telling, which contributes to the length, but the film bears it easily.
Both De Niro and Pesci give great performances, aging so convincingly with their acting (and great makeup.) De Niro is stellar in his phone call to the widow, stammering and stumbling through his guilt. Great dialog all around... the conversation about the fish is hilarious. Special mention to Ray Romano, who will hopefully do more serious roles."
"amirmustafaa","Null","1","3","28 November 2019"," A Meditative and Well Made Goodbye to the Gangster Genre
","First of all, this is not Goodfellas or Casino. While those movies were fast and exciting takes on the gangster genre, The Irishman is a slower and meditative take on the gangster genre. Those movies are about excess, but this movie is about regret and the emptiness of the gangster lifestyle. We've seen this type of meditative gangster movie before with The Godfather Part 3 and Once Upon a Time in America, but The Irishman is head and shoulders above those movies because of the history between the actors.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie are the performances. i got a little emotional seeing all of these incredible actors and knowing that this might be the last time they're all on the same screen together, and there is one scene where Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, and Harvey Kartel are all in the same room, and it might be the best scene of the year. Joe Pesci gives a quiet performance that will shock people who's expecting him to give another Casino type performance, Al Pacino gives an energetic and memorable performance, but this is Robert De Niro's movie and he's absolutely brilliant definitely in the last few scenes when he's grappling with his sins.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very well made and well acted goodbye to the genre that made nearly everybody involved with this movie who they are. Also, the last hour of this movie is some of the best filmmaking of Scorsese's career. Yes this movie is slow and yes it's long, but if you give this movie all of your attention, you will find that there's something powerful about it."

"faboyolo","10","1","3","28 November 2019"," One of the year's finest
","The irishmen: a awesome scorsese epic that is the best scorsese movie since Casino.<br/><br/>The good: the story is very complete, it shows you the whole like from Frank, it show you how it started, and how it ended.
The actors are outstanding, Robert Deniro hasn't been that good since Casino. He is a character that express him selve with the eye looking, he is quiet but you feel he's pain and what's he's going trough. He starts as an intimidating assassins but slowly begins to have a relationship with he's friends and family, and he begins to make himself soft. Al Pacino is brilliant, this is the kind of characters he is meant to be, screaming, yelling , cursing and being stubborn. Joe Pesci is not that much in the movie, but when he appears, he steals it, in a slow, quiet but intimidating characters. All these actors have a remarkable ark and their lines don't feel scripted. The story is Martin Scorsese style it has some serious situation but some funny ones. It has many characters but it adds such a unique style. The soundtrack is amazing, is such as good as casino. The editing is gorgeous, it's impress how many things they can tell you in a single shot. The CGI is quite impressive, they look 30 years younger.
The bad: yeah it's very long, hitting with a 3hr 29 min, but personally I don't find it long, it was very interesting and impressive to see.<br/><br/>Conclusion: the best movie of the year so far, amazing Scorsese epic, drama, that is on the top 5 of Scorsese best films.

A masterpiece in every department, the Plot, The Acting, The De-aging technology, the Cinematography and the Masterful Directing of Martin Scorsese.
The movie is so immersing that although it's 3:30 hours long, Time flies. Every one of those great names played their role to perfection. I'm so glad to see Joe Pesci back and as usual he never disappoints. He's simply a legend and he truly deserves his place between the best actors in history.
Bob and Al have so much in common, they are two of the greatest actors of all time and they did brilliantly in this movie.

","This movie is like Once Upon A Time In America, but as much as I love Once Upon A Time In America, I think The Irishman tops it. Just like Once upon a time in America, it's long, stars De Niro and Pesci and is the story about group of underground people or ""mafia"" or ""mob"", about friendship and betrayal.
Shame on companies like Paramount for not financing this movie. This movie is beyond perfection. This is easily the best movie of the last two decades and stands near the top among the best movies ever made.
De niro's and Pacino's best performance in a very long time and Pesci doesn't disappoint as usual. This movie has the best chance of taking the Best Picture and Pacino has the best chance of getting his second oscar for Best Supporting Actor. De Niro is also an strong contender for Best Actor. If I had to choose between Joaquin Pheonix and De Niro, I would choose De Niro.
I highly recommend this movie for everyone. It was the shortest 3 and half hours of my life. (And my fellow teenagers you all are missing out on a lot by sticking with superhero, watch this!)"

We have seen these top actors in the same roles dozens of times, and watched similar mob films hundreds of times; unfortunately there was nothing new in this film.<br/><br/>The director had stated that ""only netflix would fund his film"".

And the screenplay crackles with mobster patter - arguments about fish, time-keeping and business echo ""funny like I'm a clown, I amuse you?"".<br/><br/>De Niro and Pacino especially have lowered their standards over the past decade, but here they (and Pesci) are recharged. These are stunning performances. De Niro's shifts in mood are barely perceptible, but by the end something profound has changed within him. Pacino, meanwhile, bristles with energy, without edging into his sometimes self-parody. And Pesci perhaps never better - here a quieter man but with just one knowing look can change the entire course of a man's life. And despite the brouhaha over the CGI to de-age its leads, it's only briefly distracting.<br/><br/>So a different pace and tone to Scorsese's back catalogue.

","You should know anytime you have legends Scorsese, Pacino, and De Niro working together plus when you add Joe Pesci you know you have an A plus movie! Plus this film is long and much detail as it looks at the life and times of mobsters during three decades. The story spans from the 1940's to the supposed 1975 disappearance of Hoffa. First starting with the early days of Frank Sheeran(Robert De Niro) being a union truck delivery driver that would transform into him becoming a brutal mob hit man. All of this begins when Frank becomes friends with Mr. Bufalino(Joe Pesci). Much and most of the film is told thru flashback and Frank's point of view.<br/><br/>Along the way Frank is soon introduced to the powerful Jimmy Hoffa(Al Pacino) and the underworld of backroom dealings and killings are the norm all while being tied to business, money, greed, and politics as the tension with the Kennedy's is highlighted and showcased. As usual plenty of blood, and changes await most of the cronies in the form of either death or jail time! Also look for good supporting turns from Bobby Cannavale and Anna Paquin.<br/><br/>As the film progresses you see regret as Sheeran goes into old age and I must say the acting and chemistry was top notch and in all pro form from all involved it's very detail as the scenes and words are near flawless really this film is a masterpiece maybe somewhat of a send off for all of the legends involved. ""The Irishman"" is an epic journey the film is certainly true mobster style in a vintage old throwback way as it shows the past of true gangsters."

Apart from the book the film was adapted from, there was little to no further research on the era, locations, even proper pronunciations. Everyone sounds like they're from New York. The CGI de-aging failed to account for turkey necks and old man postures. Overall, this film is lazy, cinematic sentimental hogwash. But the Scorcese fanboys will disagree vehemently.

","Martin Scorse's new NetFlix movie, ""The Irishman"" was, to a certain
extent, a national event. After all Martin Scorsese, like Woody Allen,
and some others are national treasures and it is not everyday that
one of our national treasures puts out a virtually free movie that all
Americans can see and dicussion - a national cinematic forum to make
some kind of moralistic, artistic or at least patriotic statement. Instead,
blah, nothing, boring, and on top of all the negatives, there is nothing
to really verify that much of it or any of it was true.<br/><br/>This could have been a really good movie if they had just shifted the
plot and conflict to be more about Hoffa, who no Americans know about,
and whose history affected so many Americans. Americans should know
a lot more about history but especially a lot more about this history because
it has affected them so negatively. Few know who Jimmy Hodda was, and
or course nothing about the lying selfish criminal scumbag liar no one can
trust, Frank Sheeran.<br/><br/>Since the framework of the story was mostly based on a kind of nonsensical
story from Frank, who is the book written about him seems to be all about
Frank trying to take credit for every big Mafia crime or hit.<br/><br/>It seems like it would have been better to contrast the soul and crimes
of Frank Sheeran with the soul and crimes of Jimmy Hoffa. Hoffa was
no saint, ( or was he ) and consorted with and ultimately got run over,
chewed up and spit out by the mob by using them to stand up to the 0.01%
who were beating up. ripping off, stealing from the middle class of
America. What else could he do? ... or we never would have
heard of him or the Teamsters.<br/><br/>I don't think the writers of this movie were skilled enough to
tell that story, so they just re-did Casino and Goodfellas.<br/><br/>America was traumatized by the assassinations of the 60's
and 70's and as we can all see from the path of the country,
the bad guys won. They took over the unions, screwed over
the middle class, took their money, made them pay the taxes
for the rich, made then fight their evil wars, and bought up
the media and the news, bought up the military contractors,
bought up the drug and pharma, and now we are all paying
for it ... and dying for it, thanks to stupid sell-out, scumbags,
creeps like Frank Sheeran, the Mafia, etc.<br/><br/>In fact you can really say pretty catagorically that this was
a crappy film because it was situated so close to the rudders
and currents and captains of American history - and yet missed
the whole point to pander to a stupid unverified story about what
happened to Jimmy Hoffa and the minutia of Frank Sheeran's
evil life."

Is the Irishman his best picture? I say no, but it's still a masterpiece none the less.
I always thought that DeNiro was the better actor than Pacino, but watching these two on the screen together has given me more respect for what Al can do. All three men were fantastic. It was great seeing Joe Pesci do something again.
It is cool that Scorsese is cool with using visual effects. The de-aging he did to his main cast was pretty amazing. It really shows how far we can go with filmmaking that they were able to go from like 40 year olds to 80 year olds that was cool. Scorsese showed that it can be done successfully, cause I saw them do the same tricks in Gemini Man and they messed up the lip motion and it throws you off.

"darklydreamingrahu","6","2","12","30 November 2019"," Not Worth the Buy-in
","Let me start by saying that the Irishman is incredibly acted and flawlessly shot. From a purely cinematic standpoint, it's gold.<br/><br/>That doesn't stop it from being meandering, self-indulgent, overly-long, and derivative.<br/><br/>Even more so than this year's far superior Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Irishman is a grueling test of patience. Gone is the frenetic energy of Scorcese's better films. The bones of Goodfellas and Casino are here, but those bones are dried and decayed.<br/><br/>The pacing of the Irishman is a downright slog. If you thought the Godfather was slow, you ain't seen nothing yet. The Irishman overstays its welcome telling a story that should have been wrapped in half the time. Many pointless scenes go nowhere, and they do it slowly. This within itself isn't always a bad thing with the right pacing, but here it is lazily delivered and indulges in the star-power on the screen without ever giving the viewer a second thought. Some scenes are virtually repeated multiple times saying the same things between the same characters with almost no variance in a mind-numbingly boring manner.<br/><br/>Call me an uncultured swine, but the Irishman is just boring. And the payoff is non-existent. Don't watch this expecting to be gripped like you were when you watched a dozen of Scorcese's better movies.<br/><br/>Had they cut an hour from the runtime and tightened the script, this could have been a masterclass. As it stands, it is a bloated but well-acted snoozefest with some interesting parts that make up a less-than-interesting whole.<br/><br/>I'm being generous with a 6.5/10. The acting really is incredible (Pesci!!) once you get over the CGI plasticity of the flashback scenes, and the look and feel of the cinematography is undoubtedly the classic work of Scorcese. However, this is a derivative shell of his better works and it spends 3 and a half hours saying the same things over and over while it slowly walks in place getting nowhere."

Obviously, ""The Irishman"" had good director so despite its flows, it is well-made, but I'm just not over the moon with its final result. Female companions are barely seen no matter that mobsters usually do have passion for women. The one we do see is (De Niro character daughter) Peggy with almost no words to speak in it. Oddly enough, good thing here is that the film was not as long as you might think after seeing its runtime: three and a half hours.

It's a long movie but the flow and the pacing are consistent and there's always something happening, and so I never felt bored, which is a possible issue for a movie 3 and half hours long. Thanks to his length the movie can takes its time to characterise well every protagonist and makes them feel like people and not only some mere characters. The performances are also great (De Niro, Pacino and Pesci were fantastic) and Scorsese did a remarkable job. The major flaw I found is that there's too much stuff, a lot of names thrown in one time and then touched again one hour later, or a lot of stories the narrator talked about which only scope was to contextualise something. The problem isn't that all this stuff isn't interesting, but at one point there's some confusion about what's going on or what character is who and so on. And I'm sure that a second/third watch would provide all the clarification but in theory it shouldn't be necessary. But other than that a very well made movie, surely worth checking out."

","This film produced by Netflix was a reunion for Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, The Wolf of Wall Street) and leading actor De Niro and supporting actor Pesci have worked together in 24 years, since Casino, and one that was getting attention during Awards Season. Basically, elderly World War II veteran Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is in a nursing home, he recounts his time as a hitman for powerful criminal families and mobsters. In 1950s Philadelphia, Sheeran works as a delivery truck driver and starts to sell some of his shipment contents to local gangster Felix ""Skinny Razor"" DiTullio (Bobby Cannavale). After his company accuses him of theft, union lawyer Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano) gets him off. Bill introduces Sheeran to his cousin Russell Bufalino (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Joe Pesci), head of the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family. Sheeran begins to do jobs for Russell and members of the local South Philadelphia underworld, including ""painting houses,"" a euphemism for murder. Soon, Russell introduces Sheeran to Jimmy Hoffa (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino), head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who has financial ties with the Bufalino crime family and is struggling to deal with fellow rising nominee Anthony ""Tony Pro"" Provenzano (Stephen Graham). Hoffa becomes close with Sheeran and his family, especially his daughter Peggy, and Sheeran becomes Hoffa's chief bodyguard. After the 1960 election of John F. Kennedy, Sheeran is tasked with delivering weapons for the CIA in their failed attempt to overthrow the Cuban government. Kennedy's brother, Robert F. Kennedy, named the Attorney General, forms a ""Get Hoffa"" squad to try and bring down Hoffa, who is arrested and convicted for jury tampering in 1964. While Hoffa is in prison, his replacement, Frank ""Fitz"" Fitzsimmons (Gary Basaraba), overspends union pension funds and makes interest-free loans to the Mafia. Hoffa's relationship with Provenzano, himself arrested for extortion, also deteriorates beyond repair. Hoffa has his sentence commuted by President Richard Nixon in 1971, but he is forbidden from partaking in any Teamsters activities until 1980. Despite his parole terms, Hoffa undertakes a plan to reclaim his power. Russell becomes concerned with Hoffa's growing disrespect for other Teamster leaders and crime families. Sheeran is honoured at a special dinner in 1973, he asks Hoffa to present the award to him onstage. Russell tells Sheeran to confront Hoffa and warn him about his behaviour displeasing the heads of the crime families. Hoffa informs Sheeran that he ""knows things"" that Russell and others are unaware of, he claims that he is untouchable, for if anything ever happened to him, they would all end up in prison. In 1975, while on their way to the wedding of Bill's daughter, Russell tells Sheeran that the dons have become fed up with Hoffa and have sanctioned his murder. Russell reluctantly tells Sheeran that he has been chosen as the man to kill, fearing he may otherwise warn or save Hoffa. Hoffa, who had scheduled a meeting at a local diner with Provenzano and Anthony ""Tony Jack"" Giacalone (Patrick Gallo), is surprised to see Sheeran showing up in Detroit, along with Hoffa's unsuspecting foster son Chuckie O'Brien (Jesse Plemons) and gangster Sal ""Sally Bugs"" Briguglio (Louis Cancelmi). Hoffa is told that the meeting has been arranged in a house where Provenzano and Russell will be waiting for them. Hoffa enters the empty house and realises he has been set up. He turns around to leave at which point Sheeran shoots him twice at point-blank range. After Sheeran departs, two younger gangsters have the body cremated to eliminate all traces of him. There is a grand jury investigation into Hoffa's disappearance, during which Sheeran, Russell, Provenzano and others deny any knowledge. They are all eventually convicted on various charges unrelated to Hoffa's murder, and one by one the elderly criminals die in prison. Sheeran is eventually released and placed in a nursing home. He has alienated himself from his daughters, especially Peggy (Anna Paquin), who suspects his involvement in Hoffa's disappearance. Sheeran tries to reconcile with them, but they sever all contact with him. Whilst in the nursing home Sheeran is given absolution for crimes committed over his lifetime by a Catholic priest. As the priest leaves, Sheeran asks him to leave the door slightly ajar, emulating one of Hoffa's habits. Also starring Harvey Keitel as Angelo Bruno, Stephanie Kurtzuba as Irene Sheeran, Jack Huston as Robert Kennedy / RFK, Kathrine Narducci as Carrie Bufalino and Domenick Lombardozzi as Anthony ""Fat Tony"" Salerno. De Niro gives an interesting as the truck driver turned hitman, Pacino almost steals the show as the charming but equally sinister Hoffa, and Pesci came out of retirement to play a terrific supporting role. This true-life based story is really watchable, with great performances, the splendid playful but classic direction by Scorsese, and the period detail accompanied by gripping moments of violence of criminal activity and violence, and of course the extraordinary special effects to ""de-age"" the actors, it just about uses the three and half hours running time pretty well, a worthwhile epic crime drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Very good!"

","Storyline - In the 1950s, truck driver Frank Sheeran gets involved with Russell Bufalino and his Pennsylvania crime family. As Sheeran climbs the ranks to become a top hit man, he also goes to work for Jimmy Hoffa -- a powerful Teamster tied to organized crime.<br/><br/>This proves that Scorsese has the skill and longevity to be considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The Irishman is one of Martin Scorsese's best films, that is all that can really be said. He is able to return to the gangster genre with a brand new outlook that makes this film wholly original. The Irishman examines the ideas of death and time through retrospect ; Pesci, DeNiro, Pacino are at the top of their game. The use of Groundbreaking VFX took Anti-Aging to the next level, whether it be from CG or makeup, is overall incredible. The editing is as phenomenal. While featuring three terrific lead performances the film also features many wonderful supporting ones as well. Ray Romano, Stephen Graham, Harvey Keitel, Bobby Cannavale, etc etc!<br/><br/>A fine curated piece of art, that's what Scorsese put before our eyes, he brought out everything in his arsenal of skills, every move is calculated to the teeth, every work is accounted for, it never skips a beat, it comes packaged in a smart setup which is not surprising with a director like Scorsese, in its over three hour runtime, not a single second is wasted, every little thing meant something, every frame worked towards the story, whether it's a one-second still or a ten minutes sequence, everything clicks here.<br/><br/>A blend of historical gangster storytelling with the main character weaving throughout it unobtrusively. Excellent cinematography with authentic backdrops, music, references. Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano demonstrate why they are such revered actors. A brilliant film that is a must see, destined to become yet another Scorsese classic.

","I went into watching this movie cold; I knew nothing about the story line. All I knew was it was a mob movie with Marty Scorsese directing along with actors that he's worked with in the past - De Niro, Pesci, Keitel. Throw in Al Pacino and I figured what's not to like? The big payoff for me was that the script was right out of two books that I read a long time ago - ""The Quiet Don: The Untold Story of Mafia Kingpin Russell Bufalino"" and ""I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran & Closing the Case on Jimmy Hoffa"". When you add to this the fact that I grew up 10 miles from Philadelphia and have relatives that live close to the upstate town of Pittston where Bufalino ruled it became a movie I only dreamed would be made.<br/><br/>Given all this, it's obvious that I'm going to be heavily biased in favor of ""The Irishman"". Be that as it may, I still think - objectively - that it's a really well made Scorsese film. You can read all the pros and cons about it in the other reviews listed here. All I'll say is watch it, it's worth your time."

","During his 40's and 50's, protagonists of Scorsese-directed gangster films wound up back where they started (Casino), ordering spaghetti with marinara sauce and receiving egg noodles and ketchup, average nobodies, ""schnooks"" (Goodfellas). Now approaching 80, Scorsese goes further with The Irishman, examining the longer-lasting effects of life inside the mafia - regret, guilt, isolation, and in a series of on-screen text gags, often premature death. The Irishman feels like the culmination of Scorsese's gangster pictures; a crowning achievement."

"Jack_C_","6","1","4","22 January 2020"," Epic film ruined by digital Botox
","This film continues the fine tradition of past their prime directors trying to remain relevant by using unnecessary CGI to spruce up their work. The kindest words I have for the digital botox on De Niro, Pesci, and Pacino is that they looked slightly more believable than Jar Jar Binks. The acting was probably good, but you really can't tell under the CGI skin.<br/><br/>The screenplay is long, but engaging. As a fan of epics like Cinema Paradiso, Joddha Akbar, and Seven Samurai, the 3.5 hours passed easily. Plan to watch it over two days. It is not as bloody or violent as most mafia pieces, more a biopic of the tragic life of Hoffa and his bodyguard.<br/><br/>Still on the fence on whether it was worth my time. The CGI cringe factor may be too much for most audiences."
"GabeDoesReviews","9","1","4","21 January 2020"," Depressing
","Martin Scorsese and epic mobster movies pretty much go hand in hand with each other. It's not like Scorsese's only good with mob movies; but when its been a while since his last gangster film, it's almost euphoric seeing this movie come out. The Irishman is almost similar to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, where the director puts the same amount of love in his movie but instead of paying a tribute, it's more of what I love about his storytelling. Similar to Scorsese's other mob movies, it's extremely long and filled to the brim with history and details about the characters' lives. The long running time can easily deter people from watching it, so releasing it on Netflix can be both a positive and a negative. I wish I could've caught a screening to this film, I feel as if being trapped in the theater would've tempted me from not using my phone, even though I rarely used it either way. What kept me from being bored was all the history about Frank Sheeran's mob involvement, which is captured beautifully by Robert De Niro. It's amazing seeing his life being invaded with other mafiosos such as Russell Bufalino played excellently by Joe Pesci, who essentially came out of retirement for one last gig. The story takes its dramatic turn once Jimmy Hoffa, played by Al Pacino, is introduced to Frank. After that it becomes everything I love about Scorsese's mob films. Old School Music, dinosaur aged actors, and an overall meaning behind all the madness. Seeing the rise and fall of Frank Sheeran is extremely bleak compared to Henry Hill's in Goodfellas which almost lavishes itself with mobster lifestyle. The Irishman never glorifies the mob but instead shows its dirtier side, especially when its revealed what Frank did in his mob life. The movie left me in a pretty depressed state after seeing it all unfold but it nonetheless left an impression I won't forget."
"quietgrave","9","1","4","21 January 2020"," Oldfellas
","It takes its time, it's shot phenomenally, every single actor brought their best, the direction was absolutely perfect and the score was utilized very well. The only issue I had were some of the odd and confusing editing choices, but they didn't detract from the enjoyment I took away from the movie. It's extremely long and if you're watching it all in one go it can be rough, but you'll never be bored for even a second, there's not an ounce of fat to be trimmed from this script, please give it a go if you liked Goodfellas."
"Maleplatypus","7","1","4","17 January 2020"," Mob as a job, again
","I find nothing so special here. Just another more or less the same Mr. Scorsese movie. He did much better jobs regarding this (say, Boardwalk Empire, with much better developed characters) and this is, simply put, nothing special. Characters are again the same, story more or less also and so on. Traditional casting with good but deja vu performances, as expected from them, etc. The whole topic is a bit worn out by now, however the standards are still high. Definitely nothing for the Academy Award that should not have been given before (in general, to cast members and so on). Truly nothing special, although a good watch. But, nothing more than that."
"Neptune165","4","1","4","17 January 2020"," it's actually more a documentary
","The Irishman tries hard to be a ""classic"" like ""casino"" or ""Goodfellas"" with some scenes that try to be similar, but somehow struggle to have the same impact. I was wanting to love this film and my expectations were severely let down. Puting aside the slow pace, the great cast of my favorite actors (especially in this type of film) just felt flat where it should have been cool. I don't know what went wrong,..script, story, acting, old age! But this film just does not compare to the previous excellent ""classics"". The film was simply boring after tow hours you will be interested in this movie!! And the scene where DeNiro beats up the store owner has been the worst scene I've ever witnessed, he looked like an old, really pretending to kick the owner, and when the owner smashes the glass on the front door he doesn't even hit it hard, they obviously only did one take and he was meant to go flying through rather than just slapping the glass with his hand. The character are way too old to be playing these parts DeNiro looks like a 75 year old trying to play the part of a 45 year old but looks like a 55 year old guy that really is 75. I hate to say it but it's pretty bad all I'm going to say is that they tried hard but these guys are way too old now the aging looked weird especially on Deniro and their movement and body language was off this was a role they should have done like 30 years ago in my opinion Pacino was really the only bright spot of the film but everything else was just boring and uninteresting I just didn't care about nothing in this film or the characters at all it was just very boring honestly"

","THE IRISHMAN: (On Netflix and in limited release) Scorsese directs, with a cast of DiNero, Pacino, Pesci, Cannavale, Keitel and a bunch of other guys who's names end with a vowel, one would think this has got to be one hell of a fantastic movie. Guess again, movie fans. With the possible exception of Pacino, who, at least, tries to embody a character, everyone else is doing that thing that they do. DiNero does his same frowny face thing, Pesci does .... Pesci. All the other stock hoodlums, crime bosses, hitmen, gangsters are right out of Central Casting's 'Thug Book'. (Can't believe they couldn't find a role for Ray Liotta.) Scorsese's direction was sure handed but nothing to write home about. Not only that, it's nearly 3:40 minutes long, to the point of boredom. The plot supposes what could have happened to Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa, whose real life disappearance remains unsolved. What's presented here is certainly a plausible scenario of what could have happened and demonstrates how easy it was to commit murder in those days. Just walk up to a guy, two quick pops to the head, walk away and throw the gun in the river. Done. The standout is the period costumes, outstanding production design and cars, all of which appeared to be accurate in every detail, but that doesn't make up for the lethargic pace and the phoned-in acting by the principals. The narration devise from the survivor's point of view is right out of the Good Fellas playbook. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. Score: 7. Don't knock yourselves out to see it. 1/10/20"
"Lejink","8","1","4","6 January 2020"," A Farewell To Arms
","I'm reasonably familiar with Frank Sheeran's story having some time ago read the book on which it was based. I suppose if anyone was ever going to film it, it would have to be Scorsese. He assembles his age-no-object three acting principals De Niro, Pacino and Pesci, using the new de-ageing technology to literally take years off their physical appearance and once you stop looking for the join in this, it's possible to settle down and enjoy this engrossing movie centring on Sheeran's life which saw him become the New York Mafia's main hit-man and along the way become the friend and confidante of the powerful but controversial Teamsters Union leader Jimmy Hoffa, whose sudden disappearance and almost certain murder in 1975 makes for the inevitable climax to proceedings here.<br/><br/>At three and a half hours long, I don't mind admitting it took me two nights to get through it, but Sheeran had a long life living and killing and it was never likely that Scorsese was going to telescope it into a two hour film.<br/><br/>Scorsese of course has made some of the most iconic gangster movies of the last forty years usually with DeNiro and Pesci on board and clearly this is his goodbye to the genre for which he'll principally be remembered. That obviously also goes for DeNiro and Pesci too, as well of course for Pacino who's certainly added to the genre in his long career too.<br/><br/>The framing device for the narrative is an innocuous-seeming journey involving DeNiro's Sheeran and Pesci's Russell Bufalino characters taking a long drive to Detroit with their wives, the true purpose of which starts to become obvious as they progress. Through a series of intermittent flashbacks we get to see the story of Sheeran's recruitment as the Mafia's assassin, his rise up the ranks and along the way his introduction to Hoffa. There's a long epilogue where we see all the gangster bosses still living, Scorsese with subtitles having handily told us the date and usually violent means of death of the ones who didn't get that far, only by then they're all finally incarcerated and by the very end so aged and infirm that you wonder at the power and fear they once exerted.<br/><br/>Which of course is pretty much the point of the film. These dealers in death will themselves be reduced to ashes and for all their attempts to make peace with their God, you have to wonder at their minuscule chance of redemption in the next world, if there is one.<br/><br/>All of the big three do their bit to carry the load of the movie. De Niro as Sheeran is the blue, or should that be congealed blood biding the narrative together, Pacino largely reins in his sometimes hoo-hah acting style for who is the biggest character in the film while Pesci for me steals the accolades with a performance of almost avuncular menace in his part. It's significant that Sheeran's oldest daughter all through her growing life never takes to Pesci's Bufalino character as if even as a child she can sense the malevolence behind his kindly old man facade. Instead she and Hoffa become firm friends making the point that behind all his criminal abuse of power, he never killed or ordered the killing of anyone. The film is otherwise noticeable however for the almost invisibility of women in this man's, man's, man's world of criminal activity cloaked by a veneer of respectability.<br/><br/>I found Scorcese's direction to be commendably non-flashy with mostly conventional set-ups concentrating a lot on the faces of his actors. The period recreations of time and place are meticulous and authentic. I would however have liked to have seen more evidence of the background criminality as at times it just seems to be all about hierarchical or territorial jostling at the end of a gun, when behind it all fuelling the ill-gotten gains lurked prostitution, gun-running, drugs, protection and trafficking no doubt amongst many others.<br/><br/>I haven't always been a fan of Scorcese's big budget gang films like ""The Departed"" or ""Gangs Of New York"" but this one works for me as it seems less exaggerated in focus and is at pains not to glamorise these still despicable old-school gangsters.
If it's to be his farewell to mob life, while it's certainly a long and largely unsympathetic one."

This opening sets the tone for the movie and from then on, I viewed the film in a different manner.<br/><br/>Instead of the previous gangster films mentioned directed by Scorsese, the film has more resemblance to films like Barry Lyndon and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button where these films were more reflective and it felt as if you've lived Frank Sheeran's life first hand.<br/><br/>The stellar acting by De Niro, Pacino and Pesci help keep the characters exciting and the jam-packed, witty dialogue that only a few will fully understand keeps the film fresh and aids audience in breezing through the film. The camera shots, sequences and editing are A grade in this flick which help build on the specific emotion that Scorsese intended the audience to feel.<br/><br/>The poignancy is what stands out in the final hour of the movie and personally I would put this film in my top 5 Scorsese films based on 3 separate viewings which confirms my judgement.

I don't know why DeNiro, the real star of the movie and the main character, isn't getting accolades he deserves in nominations thus far. I hope the other award shows make it up to him because he is a virtuoso- a damn master class of pitch perfect acting. He has many scenes where he just conveys it all through his eyes. The standout scenes where he realizes he must follow orders and another when he calls a widow, he doesn't really have much dialogue yet the performance is staggeringly superb.

"proud_luddite","7","1","4","26 December 2019"," Good but with missed opportunities
","Based on the novel ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" by Charles Brandt: beginning in the 1950s, Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is a meat delivery truck driver with a young family in Pennsylvania. Gradually, he is recruited into the world of organized crime via Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and later via Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.<br/><br/>Legendary director Martin Scorsese does a great job in orchestrating the many scenes in this crime saga of three-and-a-half hours especially scenes involving violent crime. And his trio of legendary lead actors also live up to high expectations. Pacino is especially a joy. No other actor can shout and swear as well as he does. He can make the viewer envious with the desire to rant as perfectly as he does.<br/><br/>Despite the massive length of the film, there is never a dull moment including a superb dialogue scene between De Niro and Pacino during an awards ceremony. However, the film has missed various opportunities. Little is done to explain or even hint at how working-class family man Sheeran could convert to a life of crime without even the appearance of inner-conflict. A Wikipedia article on Sheeran explains how his experiences in World War II were ""when he first developed a callousness to the taking human life"". Exploration of this connection would have given the film more depth.<br/><br/>Something else is missing that would have made the film richer: more feminine presence. The best films in the organized crime genre include ""The Godfather"" (1972), ""The Godfather Part II"" (1974) and Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" (1990). While men were clearly in the spotlight in these films as in ""The Irishman"", the older films gave prominence to female relatives of the main characters including roles played by Diane Keaton and Talia Shire in the ""Godfather"" films plus Lorraine Bracco in ""Goodfellas"". The inclusion of solid, supporting female roles enhanced those older films adding to the many other riches that made those films great. The female presence is lacking in ""The Irishman"". The role of Peggy, one of Frank's four daughters, is one that clearly could have been expanded. As a girl, she has a quiet charm that attracts special attention from her ""uncles"" Russell and Jimmy. She also seems to have an intuition as to what her father does for a living and she does not approve. But she is rarely on screen and when she is, she says too little. In the film's later section, there is good discussion between Frank and one of his other daughters (Dolores) but by this time, it feels like too little, too late.<br/><br/>Where ""The Irishman"" seems to advance the genre is in scenes of Frank as an older man looking back on his past trying to reflect and take stock. This element is welcome in a genre that rarely reflects the damage of lost lives: not just those who were killed and brutalized but also those whose souls were lost in perpetrating the wicked acts."

"andrewburgereviews","9","1","4","18 December 2019"," The long goodbye
","When it comes down to cashing in your hard-earned chips, Martin Scorsese made sure all his dues were received. That is because ""The Irishman"" is filled to the brim with mob cliches. If it were anyone else, I'd be annoyed; but it just so happens that this is the man who invented these cliches. Scorsese was not the first to tackle the Mafia, but he was the best and most definitive.<br/><br/>Now, at 77-years old, De Niro and Pesci at 76, and Al Pacino at 79, it is time for these veterans of an era to cash their checks and wave goodbye. Of course, nothing is official. There is no Hollywood contract which says there won't be an ""Irishman 2"" but, come on. We all know. At three and a half hours long, ""The Irishman"" is barely not too long but it is a long goodbye signaling perhaps the inevitable end of an unofficial Mafia wave of cinema--all of it coming from exclusively these people (except perhaps ""The Godfather"" series).<br/><br/>Scorsese wanted to do this right so he toiled long and hard to get Joe Pesci out of retirement and thank God, offered De Niro the opportunity to be cast in a role which washes away a bit at his terrible choices in the last two decades, making him barely keep his ""living legend"" status. He also employed ""Schindler's List"" writer Steven Zaillian to adapt his script and with Netflix giving him essentially a blank check he could finally get on with it. Scorsese was not looking for royalties just for his ego, this financial and artistic freedom was needed to craft something like this because this is not the usual Scorsesian mob movie. It is much slower, much more deep, the consequences are more dramatic, and it is more focused on the ephemeral nature of the gangster life.<br/><br/>Despite Scorsese's fascination for mob life, he was always quick to destroy the characters of its movies as fast as he made them. In both ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", the Cosa Nostra fellas seem to be living an ideal, free, bossy life. But both those movies end up with them essentially getting caught by their actions and becoming succumbed to the Average Joe way of living (if they're lucky)--and it all happens very quickly. Not here! ""The Irishman"" takes its time with its ending, putting these all-powerful mob bosses, especially the fearful Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) through the old-age meat grinder. De Niro gets the most treatment. It's like Scorsese wants us to forget everything he ever displayed in the past about the Mafia and replace it with only this because this is the truth. And it feels like he was sitting on it for years.<br/><br/>Yet despite lacking the frontal bashing, ""The Irishman"" not only withholds the power of the Italian Mafia, but augments it more than any of his other movies about the subject. The lack of information about Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance allows Scorsese to fill in the gaps with really ambitious conspiracies. Yet Steven Zaillian's writing is so complex, so full of historical and (maybe) fictional characters that he makes it believable. It's almost pique and I love it. For all its slow pace, ""The Irishman"" feels like its characters made the most impact on the world.<br/><br/>But throughout these characters, it is all about the three unlikely allies. Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), the Crime boss, his friendship with Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) and allegiance with legendary Union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). They all give Oscar-worthy performances (although I would single-out Pacino) and it begs the question whether true friendship actually can coexist with this business. By the end, the answer is no. While Sheeran is often passive and understanding enough to survive, Hoffa's principles stand in the way. In a scene, in which Frank and Russell, now both really old and without any strings attached to their past life, share a meal in prison, Russell confesses to Frank his appreciation for Hoffa and despises his gangster peers for what he had to do.<br/><br/>But it is what it is. ""The Irishman"" is exactly what it needs to be. With a who's who cast, Scorsese took an important step in his career. At this point, another Mafia-themed movie in the future seems inappropriate, almost rude, and unlikely. ""The Irishman"" is built to close a chapter, a thread in Scorsese's thematic strings of movies. Out of respect, this should be his last mobster picture but secretly, we'd all wish they would never end."

","A once in a lifetime event of having the two greatest actors in film history surrounded by a constellation of talented thespians with a director who perhaps may be the greatest of them all and you know this won't dissapoint. Robert De Niro plays Frank Sheeran, a truck driver who comes across union boss and mob affiliate Jimmy Hoffa portrayed by Al Pacino and the two strike a friendship made in mob and cinema heaven. The film chronicles the twists and turns of the two as they cruise and bruise their way into the underworld. Joe Pesci steps out of retirement and lends his distinct and memorable presence hearkening the film to a reunion following the great tradition of ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" in look, color, pace and vibe. As inevitably memorable the film naturally is unfortunately the slow going pace of a lot of parts and the age of the actors snag what should have been a pinnacle of the silver screen. De Niro's too old to play his character and no amount of make-up can deny this. And as solid as the performances are there are no particular standouts and one gets the impression the aging legends are a bit too long on the tooth with the job and a jaded weariness permeates their performances. Of course, it doesn't get more monumental than this and any flaws are immediately sidelined by the talent and importance involved. One of the standout films in a year that has stood out in cinema history this is one you shouldn't miss if you consider yourself the slightest bit of a movie fan. And this may be the final time Pacino, De Niro and Scorsese ever make a film together. Nothing could be more moving, poignant and as essential as that."

For me, it is very hard to review; it is not a comedy, and it is not an action film. The de-aging technology is used well, but clearly imperfect. This is not the sort of film I see myself making or emulating in life. But, all things considered, I believe that this film is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Irishman has an extremely slow burn. For those fans of the mob film who are primarily in it for the action, this film will not satisfy. The action is sparse and brief, as were the actual killings it depicts. However, the journey of this film does not meander and, despite its length, is without excess. It is an epic that takes you through Frank Sheeran's life as a made man, from its beginning to its annihilation. Without a single tear being shed, the main character's suffering is well earned and very powerful. I can't recommend this film for everybody, but for those who can enjoy the drama of a silent life, this film is without flaw.

","Had been looking forward to this for years. Glad to see these phenomenal actors reunited with Scorsese in an epic film - the second longest I've ever seen (only behind Ben Hur).<br/><br/>The length and CGI are often the two most talked about aspects of this. I thought the CGI de-aging worked well and didn't find it distracting. Only some of De Niro's movements when 'younger' didn't fit so well. The runtime, however, did feel too long. Not every scene was a classic, and I found my attention fading occasionally.<br/><br/>The best part was simply seeing these actors working together and they all delivered convincing performances. Joe Pesci definitely still has it, while Al Pacino hits it out of the park, with what is the best performance in the whole film. The political, union aspects of Pacino's character (Hoffa) were often some of the more tedious, mundane though.<br/><br/>This often didn't feel like a gangster film. It becomes a lot more than that towards the very end. It turned into a strong morality tale, about life and death, sins, living a good life etc. I found ""The Shootist"" touch really powerful. The last 30 minutes were the strongest of the film. Other scene highlights were ""the fish car"" and simply just seeing De Niro and Pacino share a hug at this stage of their careers.<br/><br/>I have to admit though, I most enjoyed The Irishman when someone was being whacked. For a film about a hitman these instances seemed few and far between. For much of the film I felt quite emotionless. Neither loving it, or hating it, simply just feeling like a bystander to the story and events. This lack of emotions could perhaps be attributed to the emotionless disposition displayed by some of the main characters - most notably De Niro's Frank Sheeran.<br/><br/>The final scene is the type of cinematic experience that gets you talking among friends in the days after. Overall, I found The Irishman good, without being the masterpiece many are claiming it to be. It would make a good film to watch on any long haul flight.<br/><br/>Props to Netflix for getting behind such a project. I hope its not the last of its type they support!"

This is, of course, familiar territory for Scorsese, who's made numerous films exploring the world of mafia; no one's better at showing us a cavalcade of men with leathery voices and averted eyes, following them down dark hallways and sidewalks, sitting with them in old styled Italian restaurants or in ordinary middle-class living rooms. Mobster after mobster crosses paths with Sheeran and Hoffa; Scorsese shows us, in onscreen notes, their eventual fate.

"MrDHWong","9","1","4","5 December 2019"," An exceptionally well-made depiction of one man's ascendance through the ranks of organised crime that only the collaboration of its renowned director and cast could pull off
","The Irishman is a crime drama film directed by Martin Scorsese based on the non-fiction book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" by Charles Brandt. Starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino, it is an exceptionally well-made depiction of one man's ascendance through the ranks of organised crime that only the collaboration between its renowned director and cast could pull off.<br/><br/>In Philadelphia in the 1950s, Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) works as a truck driver delivering goods to shops all around the city. One day, Frank decides to do some delivery work for the local Italian-American mafia as a means to provide extra income for his family. Eventually, Frank is accused of theft by his company but is let off the hook thanks to the efforts of union lawyer Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano). Bill later introduces Frank to his cousin Russell (Joe Pesci), head of a northern branch of the Philadelphia mafia, who recruits Frank to do some tough jobs for him, including being a hitman if necessary. Over time, Frank gains notoriety and respect among mafia members and affiliates, including the popular union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), who becomes a close personal friend of his.<br/><br/>Epic in both scale and storytelling, ""The Irishman"" never wanes in holding the viewers' attention thanks to the creative efforts of director Martin Scorsese. Much like his previous mafia-related work ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", Scorsese carefully and meticulously uses every moment of the film's long runtime (209 minutes to be precise) to help the audience get to know each character and their motivations in full detail, never once boring them in the process. Few filmmakers could make a movie in this way but if there are any, Scorsese would be high on the list.<br/><br/>At times, I felt strangely nostalgic for this craft of filmmaking, which is a rare occurrence today. The film offers nice on-location sets, creative production design to reflect each decade, and almost no CGI whatsoever (apart from some de-aging used on the lead actors). This is a pure dramatic experience from beginning to end that a modern audience may not get to enjoy all too often. I wish more filmmakers would consider re-embracing this style for their future projects.<br/><br/>In addition to this, all of the lead actors did a fantastic job, being the usual Scorsese heavy-hitters (the only one missing would be Ray Liotta). Robert De Niro gives his finest performance in years as Frank Sheeran, a man who ultimately who just wants to survive in this unfair world. This felt like a return to form for De Niro, a far cry from the abundance of mediocre comedy films he has starred in recently. It is also great to see Joe Pesci again, this being his first notable film role since Lethal Weapon 4 all the way back in 1998, and despite all that time, his acting skills are still as strong as ever. Al Pacino is also a joy to watch, being one of those actors who will chew the scenery in every film his is in, no matter how it may turn out. However, I felt that Harvey Keitel was underused, with his character only appearing in a handful of scenes. This is a shame as I believe there was potential he could have been just a memorable as the rest of the cast, had he been used more frequently.<br/><br/>Overall, any fan of Scorsese or this classic style of filmmaking will find plenty to enjoy in the director's latest outing. I do feel that newcomers to his work may be put off by the film's three-and-a-half hour runtime, but if anyone can handle binge-watching an entire season of a Netflix show in one day, then this shouldn't feel too much different. To quote Roger Ebert; ""No good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough"".<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10"

","Mob movies have more bad than good ones, and this is not one of them. A 75 year old actor playing a 30-40 version of themselves is just not believeable. That's what ruined it for me. I seriously thought that the plot in the story had potential, Though at times it was dragging on and didn't seem like it was going anywhere. I seriously don't understand why couldn't they find younger actors to play the younger versions of Hoffa and Sheeran. You're telling me that there's not a single young 30 40 something year old actor that resembles De Niro or a young Pacino? That's why at times I couldn't take this movie seriously. it would have been fine if DeNiro and Pacino were playing the old versions of themselves, because they're old, mixed with younger more agile actors. come on really the scene with DeNiro when he beats up the grocery store guy and the sound doesn't even match up!?? Walking like an old man with his back hunched.
I watched this movie for pesci and I think he did a good job in here. it is a major different character from his younger Wilder mob movies where he is crazy, where now he's quiet and reserved.
Camera had choppy movement, stunts were unbelievable ridiculous, editing sub-par, soundtrack is forgettable expect for the credits song. could have shaved at least a half hour off this film, and probably could have done without the father daughter tensions, not done well at all.
All the reviews that given more than a 7 are pretty fake and biased probably from a bunch of yuppy millennials who don't know what a real not movie should look like, IE casino, my favorite in particular.
I wanted this movie to be good but in many ways they messed it up. I'm not saying it's terrible it just has too many unbelievable and boring aspects to make it a good film. Scorsese and his trio of Italian-American actors have come and gone. I mean, there's a reason it's on Netflix and not in theaters. I would say watch it if you like my movies and have free time on Sunday because it is three and a half hours long."

","The Irishman is a movie that follows the life of a mob enforcer Frank Sheeran and his involvement with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>The movie is good and worth watching, but my advice is to have as little expectation as possible prior to watching it, otherwise you might get disappointed. Majority of people will probably go into this movie expecting something similar to Goodfellas or Casino, but you won't get that from this movie. The only thing this movie shares with the two previously mentioned, apart from certain actors, is the style of narrating. Goodfellas and Casino are movies where the mob life is portrayed in all its light and glory, where the characters lived like kings and could do whatever they wanted. The Irishman is more drama than it is crime, a dissection of its characters and their lives. The biggest minus about the film, as most people who saw it say, is the length. Some say the pacing is good, some disagree. Personally, I think the movie could have been shorter and thus my grade would be higher.<br/><br/>All in all it is a good movie to watch, but, in my opinion it is not a masterpiece or a movie that will achieve a cult status like Goodfellas or Casino."

","Martin Scorsese's style of filmmaking has become an entity of its own that Hollywood has been influenced by the likes of Todd Philips and greats like Quentin Tarantino. Though it's sometimes hard to differentiate his films from time to time, ""The Irishman"" tells a rags to riches medieval classic but trades the knights and Jesters For Gangsters and Union bosses. Scorsese's style of filming coupled with his compelling crafting and acting of characters from the Palkia, Dialga, and Giratina of acting with Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro, these 3 hours are worth it."

De Niro was wrong for the title role, he looked strained most of the time, and they failed to get enough makeup on him to look younger than a veteran Social Security/Medicare recipient. Scorsese blew a great film and story by putting his buddy in the title role. It was okay, but not remotely close to Good Fellas, and the story does not warrant a tediously long tell."

"Dragonsouls","9","1","4","30 November 2019"," An instant classic
","While The Irishman may not be Scorcese's best film it does what many of his films haven't done since Raging Bull; emanating with emotional character drama. Characters die throughout and you may find yourself getting emotional about it. Scorcese does an excellent job at building tension, in his scenes and also as the film progresses from beginning to end. I found myself on the edge of my seat during the Hoffa and Provenzano conversations, and especially in the end, when a meeting was set up to quash a beef, between major characters.<br/><br/>At the end of the film we are left with a powerful character drama and study of The Irishman, which is almost used metaphorically as a term to represent the Criminal minded, or the ""Wiseguy,"" who are often killed for merely insulting someone with lots of money, and lots of power. It is a film about what an overdeveloped sense of pride can do to a human being, often resulting in their demise, whether it'd be their career, job, or in the case of Gangsters, their lives.<br/><br/>While The Irishman may not have as many memorable scenes as Goodfellas, Casino, and Gangs of New York, it does what many of Scorcese's smaller films did, like Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, and that is tell a very emotional story. The Irishman, just like Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, are not only the titles of those movies but also representations of the same archetypes that have enthralled us in Scorcese's films."

It has many of the common elements of a Scorsese classic; Great story, great screenplay; great characters; great flow and three incredible performances by Pacino, Pesci and DeNiro. Yes this is a long film, so what? It is an engrossing story and Scorsese tells no more or no less than what needs to be shown.And by the end of the movie there is a larger message that has been conveyed to the audience.<br/><br/>I've watched the film twice (once in the theatres and once on Netflix). There is so much to say about this film. But first and foremost the acting is amazing. You have two of the greatest actors of our time (Pacino and DeNiro) giving two of the greatest performances of their careers. And Joe Pesci (back from retirement) is also wonderful in a dark and subdued role as a mob boss.<br/><br/>And no the digital de-aging is not a distraction at all. It works perfectly because these actors have the ability to pull it off. And of course all praise to the greatest director in the history of film-making Marty Scorsese. It's been said this may be a swan-song to all his crime dramas. If so what a way to go out.<br/><br/>I predict the movie will be nominated for at least 5 Academy Awards; Best Picture, Best Director; Best Actor-DeNiro, Best Supporting Actor-Pacino (this could also be a best actor category) and Best Film Editing. And it might also get a nod for special effects for the digital de-aging. Go watch it."

"aguti-09325","9","1","4","30 November 2019"," 10 out of 10 Opinion
","Beginning with the tone. Scorsese has this ability to portray story telling with depiction and pace. The narrating to me feels in place with editing, music, background, back and fourth. Nothing to quick or slow. Enough to immerse yourself with these bad guys who are humanized even though they are villains.<br/><br/>Dialogue had such substance. So much was said between all the characters through passing. Pesci directing all these avenues when they show him in the sewing shop. Pacino wearing his emotions on his sleeves when going through the Robert Kennedy trials. And never wanting to relinquish any power.<br/><br/>De Niro good gracious Bobby De Niro. How an actor of many generations continues to capture the screen on a unquestionable lead. He's played murders before with yelling, psychotic behavior, and mentally unstable characters. The ability to look so intimidating with not blinking, dead stare, and great posture, delivers for me, such a compelling character. ""It was like the army, you take orders, do them, get rewarded."" Such a cold delivery for people's lives however you can understand he did his job well.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 in my opinion."
"jmholmes-73727","10","1","4","30 November 2019"," HITS US WHERE WE LIVE - THE EVIL NEXT DOOR
","No one is likely to say this gangster movie romanticizes their way of life, or that it is filmed with operatic intensity; or that it has sequences that are thrilling, with violence staged in creative ways that make them almost fun to watch. Scorsese here is not only refusing to imitate other directors' works (Coppola, DePalma, Penn) - he's not even imitating himself. If it weren't for the cast, it would be hard to
even peg this as a Scorsese movie. The ordinary, almost casual tone gradually becomes chilling as we sense we are watching people very much like ourselves - and they are monsters. They drive our trucks, run our factories, live just down the street, and maybe even end up in our nursing homes. Their evil has tentacles that reach as far as the top levels of our government. THE IRISHMAN is a truly great American movie, masterfully directed from a rich screenplay by Steven Zaillian, with DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci perfectly in tune with the project. The year's best? - Certainly."

That's how much I like Scorsese's films... but there's something missing in this one. Where as all the films I've mentioned above are rated 8, 9 or 10 by me, I've really struggled to even give this film a 7/10 score... it's simply not the same as his other films.<br/><br/>There's CGI on the faces of a few actors in this movie, including De Niro and Joe Pesci. The CGI is quite noticeable. They also made Robert De Niro look like a  vampire in ""Underworld"" for some reason... they gave him the bluest eyes EVER. De Niro looks like a Disney Princess in some scenes, with his bright blue eyes, like they put  LED lights in his eyes or something. I mean sure, you're trying to get across that the dude has blue eyes, but holy hell! It's just a too excessive tbh.<br/><br/>I wouldn't dissuade anybody from watching this movie, BUT if you want to see Scorsese at his best, then I'd rather recommend one of his other movies like Casino or The Departed, because ""The Irishman"" simply isn't the best that Scorsese can do."

","Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel, Welker White, Anna Paquin, Jesse Plemons, Dascha Polanco, Kathrine Narducci to name just a few of the top notch line-up of performers at their very, very best in this tour of the golden age of the Italian dominated underworld' power struggle for union control and government corruption.<br/><br/>The story reminded me of a three decade long chronology of ""New York Daily News"" (et. al.) gangster hit headlines over those years. (And 'the News' would splash the front page with crime scene photos back then!)<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Di Niro, as aged mob enforcer Frank Sheeran, narrates a chronology of the life and times during this 'golden age' of corruption as he and his boss, Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) embark on a road trip from Philadelphia to Detroit to attend Bufalino brother's wedding while taking care of business, and one major problem, along the way.<br/><br/>That's the good news. The bad news is that this is an 'epic' in every sense of the word. The best way I can describe it would be as the ""Lonesome Dove"" of gangster movies. Although riveting in every way, it seems endless and is well the the feature length class as ""Ben Hur"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Doctor Zhivago"", but without a carefully placed intermission. It needs one.<br/><br/>Every moment, every flashback vignette is worth waiting for, but there are seemingly an endless number of moments. Plan on watching it over two evenings. Also, keep your mouse pointer near the 'pause button'. When characters are introduced, a too quick 'who's who' description pops up letting you know 'who the guy is'.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a classic and probably one of Martin Scorsese's very best ."

","The Irishman left a lot to be desired for me, firstly let me just start by saying that the technical aspects of this film are fantastic, the cinematography, score, editing and the de aging technology are all fantatsic to me as well as the acting. De Niro, Pacino and Pesci are all awesome in very different ways, Scorsese is a fantastic director and it shows in this film. The whole 3rd act of this film is near masterclass storytelling especially a 20 minute sequence within this third act which was mesmerising to watch.<br/><br/>However I do not think this film is a masterpiece, the 3 and a half hour run time is near ridiculous and you definitely feel it, also for a film this long it does have some very rushed sequences that explain way too much in that time and expects you to remember all of it when they reference it 2 hours later. I do think the screenplay is the weakest and most inconsistent part to this film. I think that the film needed to make use of visual storytelling a lot more instead of having a character explain something in a monotonous voice over a sit down conversation. Also when the film is starting to hit its emotional points of the story you feel burnt out due to the run time you just want things to wrap up and whilst these scenes were great it doesn't leave the desired impact in my opinion, I am certain that if an hour had been cut out of the run time it could have left that impact.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy the film but I do think a whole hour of it could have been taken out and it needed to make use of more visual storytelling rather than just heavy exposition the cast is fantastic, the technical aspects are fantastic and the 3rd act is masterful. Not a masterpiece but a film I enjoyed and just wished it could've been more efficient in the way it told its story."

","Martin Scorcese is not the first elderly director who decided to slow things down. It's not uncommon; age seems to cause some auteurs to become fascinated by the slow pace of real life and try and emulate it in film.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Irishman is slow. It's a fairly interesting story with interesting very well-acted characters, but every scene plays out fully; you don't just get the basics, you get all the digressions and pauses and irrelevant asides. Any ten-minute scene in the film would be a five-minute scene in most movies.<br/><br/>What happens in these slow scenes is sometimes very interesting. And at times there is a horror underneath that is underlined by the calm, leisurely attitude of the principles. But this all still requires a lot of patience. And I've always preferred Scorcese's fast-moving films (After Hours, Taxi Driver) to his slow ones (Raging Bull, Last Temptation of Christ).<br/><br/>Maybe at 60 I'm just not old enough for this movie. Sure, it's interesting to watch a movie that follows gangsters from brutal youth to doddering age, but it's not *that* interesting. Maybe it will be in another 20 years.<br/><br/>I know it's supposed to be a brilliant work of cinema, but personally I'd say skip it unless you really like slow-paced movies."

","The Irishman, directed by Martin Scorsese is an exciting, and interesting film about Pennsylvania's Bufalino crime family during the 1950s-1970s. The film focuses on Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran (Robert De Niro) and how he became one of the most respected and important members of the mob. Frank first joins the mob in the 1950's when he meets Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) while working as a truck driver. Frank recaps his life as a hitman for the Bufalino crime family, and claims to be responsible for the disappearance of the former president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). This film depicts Frank's life and shows how being part of the mob affected his life, and how it affected others like his family. It can be difficult to watch as you can see that Frank's family drifts further from him as they learn about the terrible things he does. The Irishman is a very interesting and entertaining movie, and anyone who appreciates movies about organized crime in the 1900's should definitely consider watching it.<br/><br/>The Irishman couldn't have better actors to portray the characters with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, and Ray Romano playing the major roles. Having these actors who are known for their roles in classic mob movies like Goodfellas, The Godfather, and Scarface gives this movie a lot of credibility even though it's a Netflix produced movie, which tend to be not so good. Having great actors made it feel like I was actually witnessing all the murder and sabotage committed by Frank and his associates. One of the biggest problems I had with this film was when they made Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci look younger using editing, it was pretty obvious that special effects were used. Other than that the editing and special effects used in the film are great, like when Frank and the Teamsters blow up a parking lot full of taxi cabs.<br/><br/>This movie isn't for everyone, it's rated R for a reason. It's gruesome and vulgar, but I think it makes the movie more real. The makeup and costumes used are accurate, and when someone gets shot all the gore and blood look real, which is necessary for any movie about the mob. The other negative aspect of this movie is the 3 hour and 30 minute run time, which caused me to have to finish it in two sittings. I don't mind it being long because of how interesting and immersive the film is, but most people aren't able to sit through a movie that long. Scorsese doesn't spare any expense when it comes to detail too, like when he includes the build up to different jobs Frank does. The viewer gets to know each character, like who they're friends with, who they work for, and how they die/go to prison. The plotline is easy to follow even though it jumps around to different events in Frank's life. Robert De Niro narrates throughout the movie so the viewer doesn't get confused which is very helpful, and makes the plot very easy to follow.<br/><br/>After watching The Irishman I was so intrigued that I started researching more, and even started reading the book that the movie is loosely based off of ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" by Charles Brandt. I strongly encourage anyone who wants to sit through a 3 hour and 30 minute movie to watch this masterpiece by Martin Scorsese."

Slow and definitely not keeping the attention of the audience. We like gangster movies but this one failed miserably. Although the actors did an ok job it was also not really amazing either. Why does Robert De Niro play himself both young and old. It doesn't portray well. He could have stuck with the old and someone else should have acted the young. For the sake of the good actors this movie gets 5 from us. If this movie gets any awards, it would be because of the support behind Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. ( definitely not because of the movie) plus these guys are good actors yes but they can only act similar roles/characters. A super perfect actor is the one who can act / portray various different characters.

I found the story and all the actors portrayals both captivating and believable with one notable exception. De Nero's physicality simply doesn't cut it. Try as he might he can't swagger like a man 40 years his junior.

"bob-the-movie-man","9","1","6","20 January 2020"," An endurance test, but a great endurance test.
","Martin Scorsese made a lot of enemies recently with his rant against the superficiality of the Marvel movies. But you can hardly argue that his latest film is superficial. We see the mobster Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) in his old people's home wistfully recalling his past life. Through flashback we go back to times as early as his service in World War II, where he learned to kill other men without a second thought.<br/><br/>Later, back in Philadelphia, Sheeran has a chance meeting with mob-leader Russell Buffalino (Joe Pesci) and Buffalino hires him as a hit man. It's a working relationship and friendship that is going to last a lifetime.... however long that may be in this business! But it also brings Sheeran into a relationship with union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). And those of you with any knowledge of the history of Jimmy Hoffa (or remember that scene in ""Bruce Almighty""!) will recall what happened to him!<br/><br/>One of the issues with these sort of films is that it is impossible (unless you are reading this as a borderline psycho) to form any sort of empathetic relationship with any of the characters. It's horrifying that this is based on a true story: you'd really like to assume that all of this sort of stuff was solely on the pages of tacky crime novels, and not reality.<br/><br/>The horror of Sheeran's actions are neatly reflected by screenwriter Steven Zaillian (""Schindler's List"", ""Clear and Present Danger"") in the impact on his family, particularly on his impressionable young daughter Peggy (Lucy Gallina). Only when he is old and grey can Peggy (now Anna Paquin) vent at her father for the damage done.<br/><br/>The ""youngification"" work on De Niro and Pesci is really essential for the film to work. Finding a younger actor to play either of these iconic actors would have been a stretch. Here it's very well done. But I will again suggest that we are probably another ten years of technology advancement away from removing the ""uncanny valley"" effect from scenes like this. It just doesn't quite work for me for a reason I can't put my finger on.<br/><br/>After the career nadir of ""Dirty Grandpa"" it looked like Robert De Niro might have nothing but bread commercials and dog-food ads to look forward to. However, within three months we've had a resurgence of form: his great performance in ""Joker"" and now this. Of course, this is a role that he can play in his sleep. And I suspect that might count against him in the Oscar/Bafta season. But its undeniably a great performance.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci (famously mocked as ""Baby Yoda"" by Ricky Gervais in his hilarious Golden Globe roasting) and Al Pacino are also great, with Pacino being particular impressive as the fanatically focused union boss unable to see the danger he is in. ""It is what it is"" repeats Sheeran over and over again to deaf ears. A memorable scene.<br/><br/>Again Zaillian's script is brilliant in creating an impossibly tense triangular friendship between the three men. His family love Hoffa and dislike/distrust Buffalino. When the triangle gets stretched to breaking point, and a link needs to be broken, which way will Sheeran jump?<br/><br/>For me, good movies should be seen in the cinema. But I missed its short (to make it Oscar-worthy) release so had to catch it up on the small(-er) screen. Cinemas seem reluctant to stick an ""interval"" in programmes these days: never quite sure why, since most movie-goers if we are talking a 2 hour+ movie might welcome a loo-break, and the cinema could also sell more ice-cream! But at three and a half hours, a cinema trip would be a bladder-testing challenge for sure. So this is one that I wasn't unhappy to use the pause button on!<br/><br/>It's a superbly constructed movie and well deserved its place on the Oscars ""Best Movie"" shortlist. It's tense, dramatic and has enough variety of people being shot in the head to make it ghoulishly watchable.<br/><br/>However, while I can appreciate the technical art of the film, and I'm delighted I got to see it, a top film for me needs to be one I would reach for on my DVD rack (spot the old-fashinoned git) for multiple watches. And for all its worthiness, this doesn't really fit the bill.<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."

It is reminiscent of Scorsese's earlier critically-acclaimed mafia movie, ""Goodfellas,"" also starring DeNiro and Pesci.<br/><br/>I thought some of the hype on this year's Netflix contender was overblown. The story is a dramatization of Charles Brandt's book, ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" a tell-all book of the mafia's criminal activities in the mid-twentieth century.<br/><br/>The film ties together some of the conspiracy theories of John F. Kennedy's assassination and the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. The actors' performances, the screenwriting and directing were all superb, but as a whole it was all a little too much. Two or three times I was looking at my watch saying, ""how much longer is this movie?"" I feel like after watching this film, I felt sick to my stomach and didn't have to watch another mafia movie again in my life. Yuck!<br/><br/>While I am sure it is destined to win some awards in February, it isn't going to be my pick or preference. There are much better ways to spend more than three hours of your time."
"audunystgaard","5","1","6","1 January 2020"," Maybe a good film if you're a big fan of the genre. Sadly, I'm not.
","As an amateur filmmaker myself, not having seen this movie would be a true indictment on myself. Scorsese is probably the second biggest director of all time after Spielberg, but this one did not hit it for me. The pacing is way too slow for me, the story is not exciting and honestly, for a 3 and a half hour movie, didn't have many climaxes. I'm writing this as a genuine fan of cinema and not necessarily as a big fan of Scorsese, and this one was simply not for me."

","In the light of the recent furore surrounding the 'whitewashing' of history by Hollywood, it's ironic that a film should now be made by several of Hollywood's most famous Italian-Americans called 'The Irishman' about an Irishman (played, inevitably, by Robert DeNiro rather than, say Liam Neeson) who always seems to be with union leader Jimmy Hoffa whenever anything dramatic happens (like when they're in a bar together when news comes in of Kennedy's assassination).<br/><br/>Al Pacino in a wig gives the same performance he always gives as Hoffa; while Scorsese seems to have spent more time recently studying Coppola, DePalma, Leone and Tarantino than Curtiz, LeRoy, Powell or Wellman."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","6","11 December 2019"," 5 Golden Globe nominations
","Golden Globe nominations have just been announced. ""The Irishman"" has been honoured with 5, in the ""Drama"" category: best picture, director (Martin Scorsese), supporting actor (Al Pacino, Joe Pesci) and screenplay (Steven Zaillian).<br/><br/>Throughout the history of Hollywood (an indeed probably worldwide), there is no lacking of gangster movies. To many, ""Godfather"" has set a bar that is yet to be surpassed. Director Scorsese's only Oscar win so far also came from this genre, a deviously clever screenplay from Hong Kong adapted to become ""The Departed"" (2007).<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" opens with a long one-take shot (similar to Brian De Palma's ""Snake eyes"" (1988) but not as long or as flashy) that meanders along the corridors of a seniors' home, finally resting on the title protagonist Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) sitting on a wheel chair. A VO starts as the camera closed up to De Niro and continues seamlessly as his lips start to move and speak. In the next three-and-a-half hours, we hear Sheeran telling his life story.<br/><br/>Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran was a WWII veteran who had been following General Patton all over Italy, Anzio and all. He then became an important figure in the teamster labour union, as well as organized crime. Through easy-to-follow narrative, some mild temporal scrambling notwithstanding, the movie recounts Sheeran's association with various underworld figures, with plenty of killing using efficient, clean neat shots to the head.<br/><br/>The main body of the movie pertains to two such associations with characters played by the Golden Globe best support nominees Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). While these two are without question Sheeran's best friends, there is a sharp contrast between these two relationships. Bufalino is Sheeran's mentor, an almost fatherly figure. When they talk, it is always in a low, subdued tone which, however, at times have such a hideous undercurrent that makes you shudder. Hoffa on the other hand is like a time bomb, but a time bomb that explodes just about every hour. The fiery speeches Pacino delivery at the union meetings is something to behold. I won't go into any further details, not because of spoiler avoidance as the true story is amply documented and readily available in the public domain. The spoiler here would be taking away the pleasure of experiencing the mesmerising story-telling.<br/><br/>Three-and-a-half hours in today's nano-second-verse seems a long time to sit through a movie. What makes it a worthwhile, special experience is the direction of Scorsese and the acting of De Niro, Pacino and Pesci, particularly when with the excellence is also three entirely different styles and persona, giving such a rich variety.<br/><br/>It would of course be interesting to see what Oscar nominations ""The Irishman"" will gather."
"Junaidinam","6","1","6","10 December 2019"," Not the best film of the year, nothing close to it.
","I am really confused and have mixed feelings about this movie. I have been a fan of Martin Scorsese's work like million of others and have seen almost everything he has been a part of and absolutely loved it, but this one was just a disappointment. I don't know why people are rating it so high and praising it so much, the plot basically fell flat from the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Just going back and forth of who said what and you tell him that and I told him this just got boring really quickly. There was no character development throughout the whole thing except Pegyy. Everyone came out at the end the exact same as they were at the beginning of the movie. You have 3:30 hours and still nothing meaningful about the effects of changing circumstances on Frank's personal life. There is no element of surprise and CGI looks weird and ruined their expressions. Some of the dialogue were good but overall it was just boring and plain, thank heavens I did not go to cinema to watch it and could only digest it on my couch after pausing it every 30 minutes or so ."
"iGlad","5","1","6","9 December 2019"," Finally Scorsese makes a comedy
","This was a movie about a murderers however the telling moment was the conversation with the daughter. The lack of contact with his children was what he deserved. The man was a monster plain and simple without a soul. The film was about 90 mins too long."
"nick_demonlover","10","1","6","8 December 2019"," As good as Goodfellas, if not better!
","I usually don't leave reviews but seeing some bad reviews and undeserved low ratings, I kind of felt compelled to chip in with my two cents.
Could movie have been an hour shorter? Could have there been more action? Yes. But that's not the point. The first three hours are entertaining and funny at times, last half hours portrays how bad guys end up with bad consequences and lifetime of repent. The last shot was a piece of an art and open to many interpretations.
""Painting house"" ""fish scene"" ""watermelon scene"" ""charge a man with a gun, with knife you run"" ""what kind of man makes a phone call like that"" ""leave the door open, I like it that way"". There are many iconic scenes and dialogues/quotes that will be talked about in many years to come.
I don't want to give any abuse by saying ""marvel fans"" or whatever but you don't watch these kind of movies expecting ""action"" or ""violence"" every minutes. These movies don't have one guy with his machine gun fighting and killing hundred of bad guys, or two rival gangs fighting with unlimited arms and ammunition, instead these movies portray how businesses are conducted in real world by these mobsters.
In short, if you watched likes of Goodfellas and Godfather and loved them, you will love this too. This is in par with those movies. If this movie came out 30 years ago, would be an instant classic and one of the greatest movies ever. It still is, nonetheles."

"random-70778","Null","1","6","7 December 2019"," Watchable, well crafted, but nowhere near top dramas on mob. Seven stars.
","Really is this on the level of the first Godfather or on the Waterfront?? Of Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco, either Scarface or any given pair of Sopranos episodes?
I don't think so and I will tell you why.
Firstly there is not single element of the inescapably of mob life in this film. Specifically the relentless need to earn and kick up that is at the core of it.
Irishman is more on the level of iceman, which is to say functions as a good but not great exploration of one aspect: the hitman. But doesn't not delve into the real driving force once someone is in the mob or the culture of the mob. For example is it brave enough to show the non corrupted union members who spoke out being intimidated, beaten or murdered? No.<br/><br/>The Irishman is a good movie, it is done by one of our best filmmakers and good actors. Pesci's minimalist portrayal is especially good. Pacino does well but is he on the level of Lee J Cobb's mob corrupted union official in Waterfront? No. Is this really anything but a mediocre performance by De Niro? No."
"Java_Joe","8","1","6","5 December 2019"," Not Scorsese's best but damn good anyway.
","This is a movie that shows the talents of both the person behind the camera and those in front of it. Martin Scorsese is, in my opinion at least, one of the greatest directors in Hollywood today. He's never failed to entertain and even though he's had some financial flops he has managed to garner a lot of critical acclaim not to mention a lot of fans of is work. Add to that some powerhouse performances by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino and you have yourself a great movie.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro plays the titular Irishman. He's a working stiff that drives trucks for a living. A chance encounter with Joe Pesci and a chance to make some money lands him a position in the mob and a friendship with legendary Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa. The movie follows his life, his dealings with the mob and the aftermath of what he did.<br/><br/>This is a powerful movie. It's also really long clocking in at three hours. And while the last third of the movie does drag a bit in places it's still worth the watch.<br/><br/>The best part of it however is the de-aging they did on the main cast. It is seamless and a wonder to behold. We see them as old men, as middle aged men and everything in between. And while I'm aware they're all in their 70's at no point did it show and you could believe they were playing younger men. While in some movies, like Tron Legacy, the uncanny valley did make some appearances in the de-aged Jeff Bridges it was nowhere to be found here. Truly one of the best examples of this technology I've seen to date."
"citdeltajrs","Null","1","6","5 December 2019"," Great Movie... Great Acting with the exception of Robert De Niro
","I wanted to love this movie. I ended up liking it. Great acting by Pesci and Pacino. Unbelievable acting. Then the directors throw in De Niro. I really tried to buy into his character. Bottom line it was third rate acting. Not sure what happened to him but this movie could have used anyone else for that character. It could be old age or his time to leave the industry but this movie failed to convey the story every single time Robert was brought in. Sad."

"gwnightscream","7","1","6","1 December 2019"," Great Scorsese Crime Drama!
","Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci star in Martin Scorsese's 2019 crime drama based on true events. De Niro plays Frank Sheeran, An Irish, working
man who befriends Italian businessman, Russell Bufalino (Pesci) who helps him get a job working for Union boss, Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino). Frank and Jimmy become friends and Frank is loyal, but finds himself in a very tough spot when Jimmy's stubbornness and tactics make Russell and others annoyed. Harvey Keitel and Anna Paquin are also featured. This is a great flick and De Niro, Pacino & Pesci give terrific performances as usual.
This is a long film, but I still recommend it if you like crime dramas like
Scorsese's ""Goodfellas."""

"i_hussain_pk","10","1","6","1 December 2019"," Cinematic perfection
","Martin Scorcese is a genius and the Irishman is a true masterpiece. Have seen this twice in successive days and just felt that this movie was on a different level altogether compared to all the films I've seen in the last 15-20 years including those made by Scorcese himself. As for the acting its better than best. I intend to watch this movie again at least a couple of times.
My only gripe is that I could not watch this on the big screen and I doubt I'll get the chance to do so given that Netflix does not plan on rolling this out in cinemas across the world (I live in Pakistan). Incidentally with Netflix showcasing movies like this on its platform it'll continue to steal a march on the competition."

People who are complaining on the grocery scene and the de ageing cgi.....<br/><br/>De niro is 76. and still outshines even todays greatest actors in my opinion it was authentic to the actors age even with de aging c'mon people sometime your expectations are too high go ask your grandpa to do a powerful leg kick go ahead!!!.... Jesues... Cut them a break..the acting is strong powerful when I'm scared of de niro saying get the f in the car and saying don't play cute with me it cuts deep.<br/><br/>The phone call scene just made my emotions run through the roof.. how can you make that phone call.<br/><br/>The cgi in my opinion was seem ess I didn't mind the de aging it kept a kind of original feel to the characters..<br/><br/>It seems.

"the_headspace","6","1","6","29 November 2019"," Technology over story
","A suggestion: if watching on Netflix, turn the brightness down, mute the colours, and reduce the sharpness.<br/><br/>This helps to hide the jarring uncanny valley effect of watching live actors who look like 3D puppets.<br/><br/>While the de-aging technology is amazing (but also worrying from an artistic point of view), it just isn't convincing. I found it worked better in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, but the lead actors there are a bit younger than here.<br/><br/>It actually looked better when I took off my spectacles, which gave me a chance, ironically, to focus on the performances of the actors without wincing or thinking I was watching some old mafia version of Polar Express that I somehow missed first time around.<br/><br/>I would have much preferred younger actors playing the roles, but I understand the marketing value, and perhaps even the artistic expectations, of a Scorsese, DeNiro, Pacino, Pesci, Keitel reunion.<br/><br/>So much for the technology.<br/><br/>Storywise, I can't say much yet, since to my surprise I stopped watching after half an hour.<br/><br/>Stop watching a new Scorsese movie?! I just couldn't muster up the interest to care about any of the characters, perhaps because of the distracting technology, or perhaps because (for me at least) the Scorsese-style gangster movie is old news now. There are some modern touches (technology aside), but overall the style of it just seems dated and worn.<br/><br/>And no, I don't expect dramatic storylines. One of my favorite recent films is Roma, one of the slowest moving films of all time, but which I consider a directorial masterpiece.<br/><br/>Of all the characters, I find the women more interesting. Again nothing new, but at least there's a sense of something more than just macho mafia swagger. Harvey Keitel (or what I can see of him trying to fight its way through the layers of 3D) is excellent as usual. An understated yet powerful performance. I would have liked to have seen more of the daughter, perhaps even had the story from her point of view - that might have made it feel more fresh.<br/><br/>I'll watch the rest of it today, if I can be bothered. So why post a review now? Because I wanted to share my first impressions, which aren't good. I'd hoped to be somehow shocked and amazed by a new Scorsese film, but for me it's sadly flat and disappointing. Too high expectations? Maybe, but this is Scorsese with his old gang!<br/><br/>It's like a long-awaited new album from a favorite band of legendary rockers (think The Who). It has one or two great tracks, but overall is a tired reworking of old themes - and worse, the aging vocals are all auto-tuned almost beyond recognition.<br/><br/>Some new ideas, tighter editing, and ""real"" actors would have made this a much better film. Time to watch Raging Bull again."

"king-of-crunk","6","1","6","29 November 2019"," Joe Pesci is phenomenal, the rest is meh, and the CGI grotesque
","First of all: I do not think that the length is a problem. I personally like long movies and if they are made well, then a slow patch can be good too.<br/><br/>Secondly: Joe Pesci's performance is the highlight of the movie: fine, minimalistic, nuanced, detailed. He is the one who should get accolades for it.<br/><br/>3rd: The CGI is not working well and very often it seems like old men with masks trying to portray 40 year olds... It is just -- weird! (Only works for Pesci. No problems there.) The biggest problem is maybe De Niro: The grocer's scene is a farce. De Niro's character should be what, 40 y.o.? It looks like grandpa is trying to kick the grocer. It looks comedic. A no-go. How could they film it like this? And often he looks hunched and crooked, just old, but should portray a 40 y.o. It just does not work -- unfortunately!<br/><br/>The film itself lacks flow and story coherence at times. It is good, at times nicely atmospheric, but it is not great. I cannot understand the hype and I am, to be honest, somewhat disappointed. (Mostly because of the not succeeded de-aging CGI.)"

","It is so good to see Martin Scorsese have all the time he needs to tell a story. Especially in a film that he obviously loves. The cast leaves no one out, and I am not simply singling out the lead roles. As is sometimes the case, he doesn't have many women who have big roles. This film is based on a documentary. I like the fact he casts many younger and/or not as well known actors. Like ""Goodfellas"" (1990), this story is told by a central character. Also, it is hard not to consider other films he has made. All this aside, ""The Irishman"" stands up firmly on it's own. We are very fortunate to have a handful of directors who are not making films based on ""super hero comic books"". I am so sick of that type of movie, where it is boxed, packaged, marketed and (finally) shoved down people's throats. This is a must see film."

","I say all the CGi aging comments & I sorta agree. It made it hard to follow the flashbacks because of the discrepancy between how old they're supposed to be vs. how they looked. IDK much about this but I think they should have gotten a younger actor to play Sheeran in his 30-50 ages.<br/><br/>Maybe Colin Farrel, Ben Afflec or Leonardo DiCaprio (who could have carried the whole role, Then transitioned to Pacino in his 50s with the CGI & maybe some make-up or medical cosmetic de-aging.<br/><br/>Other than that I liked it. The characters were well-developed. The re-creation of 1970s urban life was great. The main characters acted well, especially Pesci. Some of the minor actors were surprisingly good: Ray Romano, Sebastian Maniscalco, Anna Paquin.<br/><br/>The plot had a lot more dialogue than action, so that may have made it seem slow to some. I thought it was pretty much necessary to tell the story. I thought it was interesting to see what it was like to be in the mob in that place and time, and how Sheeran fell into it because of what he learned in the army: shooting people & speaking Italian.<br/><br/>It definitely wasn't Baby Driver, but it was an interesting biography that kept my interest. I watched it over two night at home so maybe it felt longer in a theater.
t wasn't as much a crime movie, more of a memoir reflecting on a life a crime. It did a good job telling that story from one man's perspective."

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","1","7","5 December 2019"," Netflix did a great thing giving this three-hour epic life.
","I think it's fair to say that this is Netflix's first TRUE blockbuster on the service; their previous 'original' offerings were more niche films that didn't have room for wide-release cinemas, but The Irishman is VERY different from the likes of Bird Box, Roma and Okja in that it's a $150-million crime epic starring Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino all being directed by Martin Scorsese himself. It's an experience that's showing 2019's challenging the landscape of cinema, television and multi-media entertainment itself; and Netflix is leading the charge, and it's going to still stand strong against Disney + and Amazon Prime.<br/><br/>The Irishman has all the best elements of Goodfellas, The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street: this film has dry wit, humour and intense violence all surrounding the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa, whom Pacino brings very dynamic, hilarious and cynical charm in his performance. It's a three-hour saga that shows organised crime's thinly-veiled difference between government corruption, extortion and openness of personal character (something even the most honest men can struggle with). It's honest art even if it's somewhat confronting on human nature's somewhat contradictory nature. And it's those kinds of films that show why crime cinema is so important to the creative landscape of cinema. Martin Scorsese's done another great piece of art with this paradigm-breaker of a movie, and he's shown Netflix can stand its own against the Major Hollywood Studios.<br/><br/>The Irishman is a long movie but it's rewarding and fulfilling entertainment. It's a showcase for what Martin Scorsese has done so well in his movies, and it's never gratuitous repetition for the sake of nostalgia. It's new territory that's still got an atmosphere of familiarity to it without undermining the film's story.<br/><br/>The Irishman gets 5/5 stars."

"e-m-hobo","10","1","7","28 November 2019"," Man, gangsters are stupid!
","They tell it well. They did it with GOODFELLAS and they do it again with THE IRISHMAN : they make it painfully clear that gangsters are stupid and if you get people that stick to the law in charge of the law, there's no getting away with breaking the law, since they are just so plain obvious and stupid, trying to bribe their way into every nook, crease, and cranny society has to offer.<br/><br/>What you get to see is what you get to see in many places : a fraternity backed by a sorority of what are essentially complete and utter dumb anarchists that just wear a different uniform than other anarchists, but other than that are really the same, that don't care about anything else other than their own personal gain, whims, and follies.<br/><br/>If there's one thing you don't want to do in this world, for as far as these gangsters are concerned : it's making any kind of sense. They all want to live it up. They all want to live the good life. What they don't get for instance, constantly focusing on making as much money as possible, is that that what they see as the good life - wife, family, food - doesn't actually cost anything. Just learn to cook. It isn't that hard. Life is simple, the only thing you have to do, is keep it that way.<br/><br/>Anyway, the one thing that's left in the middle is why the main character decides to tell his story in the end. I think that in the end, with all his friends deceased, the game is gone, which pushed what life is really about forward, namely his family and his desire to see his daughter again. His main problem being that even when he does tell the story, he feels no remorse, so will she see him again? But that's not what the movie is about. It's about his exploits, endeavors, politics, lack of comprehension, and being a soldier : doing what you're told to do. But what good is a soldier that can't even think for himself?<br/><br/>I've had to change my reviewing ways a bit. First I had to get to a point where you get 9 stars if it's perfectly made, for as far as I can tell, and one more if it resonates with me. I hate gangsters, which is pretty much the same thing as saying that you hate people that just do stupid unlawful , which almost made me knock off a star. This movie definitely kept me watching and left me baffled how these people get away with what they do, because impulsive a.k.a. greedy people manage to get themselves into positions of social responsibility, which they don't feel, since it's all in the game. Okay, so I had to add a star because the (un)social relevance resonated with me.<br/><br/>Loved the CGI, although their eyes seemed to look like they were wearing colored contacts when they made use of it, both to make younger and age? I think they also changed from more atmospheric color and directing to more hard-edged longer lens, bleak colors to kick in the grind of reality for the last bit of the movie, at the end of the story, when the game has come to an end? ""Pretty cool.""<br/><br/>Anyway, as a throwout-question related to the movie, where do you stand after watching this? Is life about grabbing what you can grab? The game? Or love, health, and employment? Great movie."

"huntersmithx","10","1","8","20 January 2020"," Martin Scorsese closes out the decade on a high note.
","Given Martin Scorseses' undeniable footprints in the gangster genre among others; it's a no-brainer he'd take on adapting the non-fiction (supposedly) book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" by Charles Brandt, about mafia hitman Frank Sheeran and the crimes he committed for the Bufalino crime family, also tying in with the controversial career of union labor leader Jimmy Hoffa.<br/><br/>""The Irishman"" nicely works as an encapsulation of various technical and story elements seen in Martin's past films: but also amped up due to its' epic story scope (it spans more time than Scorseses' ""Goodfellas"") and de-aging technology given to our three leads Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. While not completely foolproof, it's a bold task and marks progress for this new trend that will hopefully be used wisely in future films (no guarantees though).<br/><br/>Robert De Niro (who was unfortunately snubbed by most major awards ceremonies) gives one of his best and more understated performances as Frank Sheeran. The rest of the cast is fantastic; particularly Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa and Joe Pesci as Russell Bufalino.<br/><br/>The film doesn't quite reach the same level as Martin's other prospects like ""Goodfellas"" or ""The Departed""; but it's undeniable ambition and themes will leave you thinking after it's all over, and it should be looked upon as a highlight in the genre.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grade- A"

And also, I wonder why they didn't give a more extended character for Harvey Keitel since I really like his acting and he deserves a better one.

"jadepietro","10","1","8","29 November 2019"," A Gangster Saga that Slays It
","GRADE: A-<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: An excellent view into a gangster's life, brought to life by one of America's greatest director.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Experiencing Martin Scorsese's epic gangster tale, The Irishman, is seeing great art delivered by a master craftsman. The film, over three hours in length, tells its true story that ""crime doesn't pay"" in the most common of terms, but the visual sweep of the storytelling is mesmerizing. With superb production values and three of the best performances, the movie is one of the year's finest films.<br/><br/>Subject wise, this is safe territory for Mr. Scorsese. He lived on those mean streets and made a career with his many films of Mafia life. His film is based on a confessional biography about hitman Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran entitled I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt. Steven Zaillian skillfully adapts his literate screenplay and delves into this violent world focusing on Sheeran's notorious rise as we witness his crimes and murders.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro plays Frank and this is one of his best roles in years. The character reminisces about his career and the toll it took on his family and friends. He plays his unlikable character with no remorse and a pure disregard for mankind, an unethical man with no moral conscience. It is a solid commanding performance.<br/><br/>Providing dual support is Joe Pesci as Frank's crime boss, Russ Bufalino, and Al Pacino as Teamster racketeer, Jimmy Hoffa. Mr. Pesci underplays his character to maximum effect and his interpretation of a cruel and calculating don is chilling. Mr. Pacino has the more showier role and, at first, he overdoes his ranting schtick with too much yelling and cursing, but he finally settles into the role and adds some depth and substance that make his character all the more human.<br/><br/>Other cast members include Anna Paquin, Ray Romano, Gary Basaraba, Jesse Plemons, and a memorable Stephen Graham as Hoffa's nemesis, Anthony ""Tony Pro"" Provenzano. Also contributing their talents are Bobby Cannavale, Jack Huston, and Harvey Keitel, although they are underused in their underdeveloped parts.<br/><br/>The film's narrative spans five decades, starting from the 1950's, and the artisans' work behind the scenes to capture the various eras is outstanding. The production design is impeccable in its accuracy and its rich period details. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is truly exceptional with fluid camera movements, strong use of slo-mo effects, and carefully lit close-ups. Thelma Schoonmaker's concise editing establishes the needed tension and keeps the action front and center. Costumes by Christopher Peterson and Sandy Powell add all the finishing touches to one of the year's most visually arresting films.<br/><br/>Yet while the film has so much to admire, there are a few minor flaws. The predictable story does tend to meander a bit in the middle section and some smaller roles are strictly reinforced negative Italian stereotypes. Much has also been said about the de-aging process, making the three lead actors substantially younger in years by using CGI technology. The overall effect for this reviewer was uneven, like cinematic Photoshopping, but with only partly successful results. Some of the visual enhancement worked, others lacked the high definition and looked slightly unfocused and artificial.<br/><br/>But Mr. Scorsese's vision is as sharp and crystal clear as ever. He masterminds the entire film and is in top form here. It is he who deserves all the many accolades for this superior film. This accomplished director has created yet another masterwork to add to his impressive resume.<br/><br/>In The Irishman, one character wisely warns another, ""You might be demonstrating a failure to show appreciation."" With sage advice like this, realize that this is an offer you just can't refuse, dear moviegoers. Do not miss this film!"

","Scorsese had a rough time lately with the whole ""marvel"" scenario in which his right. But mostly he had a rough time because Netflix were the only ones to work with him on the production of the movie, which is a big flop for the rest of Hollywood that is focused on making franchise films. Anyway ""The Irishman"" is a fantastic movie well written by Steven Zaillian, with great dialogue, Hollywood's best actors in the world, fabulous story that hasn't been told in this scale yet and much more. The story of Frank Sheeran, the man who worked closely with Jimmy Hoffa and the Italian mafia, his story is told by his point of view and we the audience are aware of everything he's been part of since the 50's. Robert DeNiro does an amazing job and performance, Al Pacino is great with his iconic scenes of yelling and making a big scene out of everything. Joe Pesci is a revolutionary and he plays exactly like in his earlier roles in Goodfellas, Casino and Raging Bull. The movie has other cast members who are great and fun to watch them act. Even though the movie is three and a half hours it is worth every minute of viewing, I think it's possible to stop at the middle if you need a break but overall the length doesn't matter, it's just an interesting story to learn much from. In every Scorsese movie you get to learn something new and interesting, a huge plot and a special motive. that's way his movies are amazing at first look. His movies are obviously ""lessons of cinema"" that evey film buff should Know and see. The cinematography is absolutely perfect and the set decoration fits the setting well. Something that might be missing is a little more violence. Although the movie has a great story, all of Scorsese's movies have the feature of ""the rise and fall of the protagonist"", because the story is a little more different than the typical gangster movie, so there is no feature and not much of violence, but maybe it doesn't need anyway? I don't know... ""The Irishman"" is a fabulous movie that deserved more appreciation and academy awards for it's success. I loved it and definitely recommend, unless you want to get wacked by Joe Pesci."

","Robert De Niro excels at playing closed-off, unreachable characters-hard men who might seem a bit dull if you met them for the first time, but have inner lives that they rarely let anyone see, and are mysteries to themselves. De Niro was 75 when he played yet another of those characters in Martin Scorsese's ""The Irishman,"" which feels like a summation of a rich subset of De Niro's long career.<br/><br/>Adapted by screenwriter Steve Zaillian (""Schindler's List"") from Charles Brandt's book I Heard You Paint Houses, and clocking in at three-and-a-half hours, the movie is an alternately sad, violent, and dryly funny biography of Frank Sheeran, a World War II combat veteran who became a Mafia hitman and then a union leader, and who had a long, at times politically fraught friendship with Teamster leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). You feel every one of De Niro's years in his haunting performance, as well as those of Pacino, Joe Pesci, and Harvey Keitel, who are ""de-aged"" for flashbacks via computer-generated imagery as well as analog makeup and hairpieces. You also feel the years in the mostly younger supporting cast (including Bobby Cannavale, Kathrine Narducci, Stephanie Kurtzuba, Gary Basaraba and Stephen Graham as gang bosses, spouses, and union leaders), who age forward.<br/><br/>And you feel them in Scorsese's direction, which is more contemplative than his gangster movie norm (at times as meditative as his religious pictures), and which deftly shifts between eras, using dialogue and voice-over to make the time-jumps seamless. The frame-within-a-frame-within-a-frame structure is one of the most complex of Scorsese's career. But it's realized with such grace by Scorsese, Zaillian and longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker that it never feels fussy or overdetermined, gliding from one thought-path to another as a recollecting mind juxtaposes the distant past, the recent past, and the present.<br/><br/>The opening shot glides through a retirement home, finding Frank sitting alone in a wheelchair. He's such a rock-like presence that, seen from the back, he looks as if he could be dead. Then the camera circles around to reveal his lined face, cloudy eyes, and white hair. He starts to speak. His statements become the film's narration. We don't know who he's telling this story to. Very late in the movie, we see him talking with a priest. But the audience is us, really.<br/><br/>The concluding half-hour-an immersion into this now-old man's life, fuller than we're used to seeing in any American film not directed by Clint Eastwood-provides a clarifying framework. This is a film about the intersection of crime and politics, Mafia history and Washington history. It touches on Fidel Castro's rise in Cuba and the CIA's attempts to overthrow him, President John F. Kennedy's assassination, and the mob wars of the 1960s and '70s. But it's mostly about age, loss, sin, regret, and how you can feel like a passive object swept along by history even if you played a role in shaping it. If Sheeran's account of his life is to be trusted (and many crime historians warn that it isn't), he was intimately involved in a handful of pivotal moments in American history. And yet we might still come away from ""The Irishman"" seeing him as a passive figure: the Zelig or Forrest Gump of gangsters-because of how he tells the story, as if he's in denial about what it meant and what it says about him.<br/><br/>Although he's capable of violence, and can mete it out on a moment's notice, Frank seems mostly content to hang in the backgrounds of Scorsese's wiseguy murals, behind louder, more eccentric men (especially Jimmy Hoffa, played with wit and gusto by Pacino, in hoarse-voiced, shouting-and-strutting mode). Frank is muted and reactive for the most part, and great at talking his way out of tight spots by pretending not to understand the questions being asked of him. He comes into several defining tasks and jobs by virtue of being in the right place or meeting the right people at the right time. As he describes his inexorable march through time and life, he characterizes choices that he made of his own free will (including several murders) as things that just happened to him.<br/><br/>This is not a seamless movie. Admirable as it is to see Scorsese committing to self-contained scenes that often unfurl like deadpan comedy sketches, the many digressions, marvelous as they are, come at the expense of fleshing out the canvas. And even at three-and-a-half hours, certain aspects feel undernourished. Major supporting players like Keitel (as Philadelphia crime boss Angelo Bruno), Cannavale (as Felix ""Skinny Razor"" DiTullio) and Ray Romano (as Teamster lawyer Bill Bufalino, whose daughter's wedding provides a pretext for Frank to take a car trip that literalizes the idea of life as a journey) all register as visual and emotional presences, especially when you first meet them. But it's not always easy to understand who they are as people, or what role they're playing in this narrative besides sharing space with the leads. (Pesci, who hasn't acted onscreen since Taylor Hackford's 2010 film ""Love Ranch,"" makes a much stronger impression as Frank's mentor Russell Bufalino, boss of the Northeastern Pennsylvania-based Bufalino crime family; he's as quiet and controlled as his ""GoodFellas"" and ""Casino"" characters were obnoxious and volatile.)<br/><br/>The overwhelming maleness of the story also hurts it in the long run, notwithstanding the intentionality of this choice (the film is narrated entirely by Frank, and he's barely interested in life outside of his work in a world of men). As Russell's wife Carrie, Narducci has brilliant moments early on, mainly in car trip flashbacks, passive-aggressively hassling her husband to make Frank, the driver, pull over so she can smoke; but she becomes a non-presence after that. Kurtzuba (as Frank's wife Mary) and Anna Paquin (as the grown-up version of his daughter Peggy, who saw many things she shouldn't have) are largely mute, almost ghostly presences. There's nothing innately unaccceptable about stories focusing mainly on men (or women, as in the current ""Hustlers""). But at the same time, I don't think it's a coincidence that Scorsese's two greatest Mafia pictures, ""GoodFellas"" and ""Casino,"" carve out substantial space for wives, girlfriends, mothers and daughters, and feature indelible lead performances by actresses (respectively, Lorraine Bracco in ""GoodFellas"" and Sharon Stone in ""Casino"") that energize and transform the material, exploding the hero's lives like the bombs that roast vintage cars in ""The Irishman.""<br/><br/>As for the de-aging technology, it's not there yet. I don't think it's been there yet in any movie, though your mileage will vary. But if the results are sometimes distracting in ""The Irishman,"" they're no more distracting than, say, then-fortysomething Pesci and De Niro in ""Goodfellas"" playing twenty-something versions of themselves. And Scorsese never gets too hung up on that kind of thing anyway-he's legendary for letting obvious continuity errors slide because he's more interested in continuity of tone and emotion-so here, as in his other epics, it's best to just roll with it.<br/><br/>All that having been said, anyone who worried that Scorsese was dipping into the Sunday gravy one too many times will be reassured by the tonal originality of what's been achieved here. More so than any other Scorsese crime picture-and this is saying a lot-""The Irishman"" confirms him as one of the greatest living comedy directors who isn't described as such, and De Niro as one of the great scene-stealing straight men. His byplay with Pacino, Pesci, Keitel and all the rest is masterfully acted and edited by Schoonmaker. Much of it is a gangland ""Who's on first?"" routine, or the ""Joey Scala/Joey Clams"" exchange between Keitel and De Niro in ""Mean Streets."" Zaillian's script is filled to bursting with quotable lines. And every few minutes you get a marvelous bit of character-based comedy acting, such as Frank's blank-faced concentration as he plots their long car trip on a map with a red Sharpie marker, or a wild-eyed Hoffa glaring at a nemesis during a union awards banquet while sawing though a bloody steak.<br/><br/>The net effect is more unsettling and melancholia-inducing than you might have expected. Frank's storytelling aligns him with the most mesmerizing unreliable narrators in Scorsese's voice-over-heavy career. As in so many Scorsese films, what matters most is the relationship between this movie and its audience. It's about the difference between what the film shows us and how Frank describes it: the words and tone he chooses, and-most strikingly-what decides to gloss over, or present without comment.<br/><br/>How much agency, how much moral choice, how much say, do we truly have in our lives? Is a sin still a sin if we don't recognize the concept of sin, or lend credence the idea that some deeds are innately right and others innately wrong? Does it make sense to distinguish between murder and killing, or gangland mayhem and warfare as practiced by nations? Or are these just mental constructs designed by authority figures, meant to sanction acts approved by the state and condemn them when practiced outside its purview? Is Frank a sociopath who is a great killer because he doesn't feel emotions or have relationships in the way that most people do? (De Niro italicizes so little of Frank that we often don't know what Frank thinks of the things he does.) Or is it possible that violence, even killing/murder, is just one more type of activity, forbidden by rules of most societies, yet still widely practiced, and compatible with friendship, love, and loyalty? Are a killer's tears at losing a friend or loved one counterfeit, a performance of grief? Is his smile on his wedding day a performance of love? And even if these are performances, what's the substantive difference between performing feelings and experiencing them? Is it different from deciding to become a soldier or a mobster."

","The Irishman is great. The acting is insanely good (mainly De Niro, Pacino and Pesci). The score is soo good. And most of all, I love the movie's theme, it's a mob movie, it has kills and great other scene you will see in a great Scorsese mob movie, but at the end, it's really a movie about growing old.<br/><br/>Mostly in its last 40 minutes or so, the movie has so many great lines and moments. Mainly the end, with De Niro just looking at the door, basically waiting for death really, cause everybody he knows is dead, and his family isn't really his fan, based on the choices he made throughout his life. And the mob part of it aside, the theme here of growing old and at a point basically waiting for death to come is a scary thought, and something I've seeing happening before, so that's powerful.<br/><br/>When the FBI agent goes to talk with Frank and says ""everybody is gone"", is also such a powerful line.<br/><br/>I didn't have much of a problem with the runtime, but basically because I didn't watch the movie on the spot, I might have made a mistake, but I watched in parts first 47 minutes, then almost 2 hours, than the last hour or so. So yeah, you may wanna judge for that.<br/><br/>Well, really, there isn't a bad thing I can say about the movie, it's perfect, the guy is a filmmaking genius. One thing I will say tho, is that the de-aging is great, awesome that we got to this point in time regarding technology, but their body seems... weird still. Going forward I don't know if that
would be an effective way to make older actors seem like their younger selves for a good part of a movie. Because they seem like 40, 50-year-old De Niro, and Al Pacino, but they don't move like it... it is still an almost 80 years old actor moving like an almost 80-year-old actor, and you can see it in a few scenes."

But it is sad that there is no interesting side-plot or moralistic conslusion. Even the development of the characters are poor and barely present. While a period of 30 years? Its just what it is. An old, and slow one-dimensional (true) story. The relation between Frank and his daughter is told too simple and so it doesn't saved the movie. Have I overlooked a human core of the film?

","I can't ever remember looking forward to a movie as much as I did this one. As fan of all the mane protagonists and a student of the subject matter I hoped this would be a fitting tribute to all involved. Thankfully for once I wasn't disappointed. Deniro is fabulous throughout, I never thought I'd see this sort of performance from him again, it takes me back to the 70's & 80's when virtually everything he did was an acting masterclass. Pacino too rolls back the years and is at his brilliant best in the role of Jimmy Hoffa. The chemistry when DeNiro and Pacino are in screen together is amazing and this is now the best thing they have worked together in and no I am not joking!!
Scorsese's direction is sharp and embeds the scenes with depth allowing the actors to deliver the great performances which brings me to Joe Pesci. Unlike DeNiro and Pacino he has been retired from acting for a number of years and had to be talked into participating in this movie. Pesci gives the performance of his life here and deserves recognition come Oscar time. The story is told well through flashbacks to various different eras and it is fascinating to see the actors performing as different ages.

","Scorsese pulls it off: all the cosa nostra movie stars (apart from Liotta) brought together for a final reflection on life, death and Al Pacino's hairpieces. The bones of the story are clear: Frank Sheeran (Bob deN) is a truck driver who demonstrates his worth to the Mob, while also being factotum to Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) - and ultimately - SPOILER!!! - his assassin. Shtump-Shtump!<br/><br/>Godfather II meets Once Upon A Time In America Meets Hoffa meets Godfather III meets Goodfellas meets JFK. Yes, it's that epic, and it succeeds on that level. The whole JFK thing is sorted out after only ninety minutes.<br/><br/>Scorsese has nailed it as entertainment. The whole movie is essentially vivid; so vivid that my dog (an HMV-style Jack Russell) couldn't stop watching. Me, I couldn't believe in Al Pacino's hair or crumpled physique; maybe Hoffa's death was really a hit by the Randomly Variable Scalp Doilly Standards Association (RVSDSA). And Stephen Graham achieves mob-movie immortality in spite of being a small Scouser. Good for him - he went where Clive Owen, etc, failed to tread.<br/><br/>Get my drift? It's very, very corny, but knows its audience, and is staged to the highest standards. Up there with the best Godfather movies."
"teleconman","Null","0","4","24 December 2019"," So... that was 'The Irishman'
","'The Irishman' is a movie that captures a lot of director Martin Scorsese's style through out the movie. The film opens with a song, ""In the Still of the Night (I'll remember)"" by The Five Satins, which just gives you that feel that says, ""yep, this is a Scorsese film. I would say that the way that the film is all interconnected was something different. And if you stick around long enough when watching the movie, you'll see just why. I understand that people call this different from other Scorcese films, in particular 'Goodfellas' (1990) and 'Casino' (1995), but I'll be honest, the first hour, did remind me of 'Goodfellas' in a lot of ways. Robert De Niro is almost like Ray Liotta's character from 'Goodfellas'. He's new and being introduced to this crime world making friends with people who are like the head-honchos. What really surprised me was how Joe Pesci is calm and relaxed throughout this movie unlike most of his other characters. But the guy who really stood out to me was Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa. Anytime Pacino gets angry and throws a tantrum is just fun to watch. For a film as long as this one, I would say that it certainly does need to be seen not as a series but as a movie. Like I said, everything just fits together and makes for an AMAZING climatic sequence. I guess what this film does so well, is that it takes it's time. Of course, you're going to have a lot of scenes where guys talk about business and politics, but it does it in a way where it doesn't feel scripted. You sense that the discussion matter is important to every character involved. And that brings me to another point about the movie, which is the amount of characters. Normally, I'm intimidated by being introduced to all these names, and then having to remember who's who. But for this movie, they make it out so that you know EXACTLY who they're talking about. I would say that this is an amazing movie that had the right people work on it. If it is true that this is Scorsese's last film- which I hope it really isn't- then what a way to finish a career."
"justinwfirestone","6","0","4","24 December 2019"," Geriatric Goodfellas
","Martin Scorsese has hinted that The Irishman could be his final directorial shot. That's too bad, given that modern graphics algorithms and high-speed computing have provided auteurs the fascinating ability to add age or induce youth into characters, perhaps leading to the ultimate goal of eliminating the picky and demanding actors in their entirety.<br/><br/>The Irishman could have been called Geriatric Goodfellas, and a somber tone wafts throughout as time, place, and situation are emphasized over bloody action violence. There's still a romanticizing mood about organized crime with the added touch of international intrigue because the mobsters hate Fidel Castro so much they seemingly would do anything to repatriate their Havanese casinos, even participate in driving trucks with guns to Miami for the Bay of Pigs debacle.<br/><br/>Was Jimmy Hoffa so pedantic and stupid, so infatuated with leading the Teamsters, that his closest Irish friend could not convince him to keep his yapping mouth shut, that he could be gotten to, that his house could be painted? The final 90 minutes are filled with this bombastic incredulity. The first 120 minutes are filled with Scorsese-isms, as if the director was worried the audience would forget somewhere in the third hour exactly who is the auteur of this road trip to Detroit.<br/><br/>It is nice to see Joe Pesci in a role that does not require anger, showing much more subtle attributes. It is frustrating to watch Robert De Niro paint by numbers in a role that never looks too introspectively at his character's motivations. Instead, Frank Sheeran's life is depicted as one job, one stop, and on to the next."

"ardelean-60763","9","0","1","23 December 2019"," Felt I need to write this review...
","Because this Marvel generation can't appreciate cinema. There were 2 movies this year that really took me back to the golden era of movies (50s, 60s and 70s). These are ""The Irishman"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"". Both have great performances and just great scripts, dialogue, settings.<br/><br/>In an era where probably 90% of people below the age of 35 wants to see CGI battle scenes and at least on major city in the world destroyed or why not? imaginary planets, Scorsese made an actual film, not cartoons. Unfortunately, the below 35 generation, if not obsessed about Marvel, only know Scorsese from Goodfellas, The Departed and Casino, which is fine, but the same guy did Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, which probably again, 90% if the people below 35 would find boring.<br/><br/>There are folks giving this movie a low rating complaining about the pace but they ""love"" Godfather. Are you kidding me? If you truly love Godfather, this is as close as you get to that movie. Of course, not the same league, but it's similar.<br/><br/>I do think that the de-aging worked, even if distracting at first. What I don't think truly worked and that is why 9 and not 10, is the movement of the actors. Especially De Niro. Pesci had a relatively static role and he was older. Pacino somehow found energy to be credible as a 50 yr old Hoffa. De Niro in some scenes, not so much. Probably due to amount of scenes he was in. I do think though he plays the low key role of Frank Sheeran great and his narration is awesome, with the mumbling and the voice trailing off.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie, deserving the Oscar. Not sure if there was a movie since maybe No Country for Old Men that deserved the Oscar as much."

","Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Ray Romano, Harvey Keitel, Stephen Graham, Bobby Canavale, Louis Cancelmi, Stephanie Kurtzuba, Kathrine Narducci, Jesse Plemons, Welker White, Anna Paquin. (R)<br/><br/>Close to 25 years since their last collaboration, director Scorsese and actor De Niro re-team for an examination of mob hitman Frank Sheeran, with particular attention paid to his relationship with infamous Teamsters president, Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino). Story spans nearly fifty years, presented in flashback layers, reminiscences from a retirement home in the early 2000s--in contrast to the typical practice of using younger actors and caking on the makeup later on, the veteran actors here are de-aged using digital effects to play their younger selves. Scorsese and De Niro certainly know the gangster movie territory, though this one is far more restrained, introspective, and melancholy than the director's past genre efforts; fitting, considering the way its told and where on their career timelines the effort falls (not just for Scorsese and De Niro, but the supporting players as well--Pesci even came out of unofficial retirement to play crime boss, Russell Bufalino). The elegiac pace is necessary for the material, and it's a treat to watch the director play with the powerhouse cast, but the length is a bit indulgent, especially after Pacino's exit. The culmination of wreckage in a lifetime, however, has rarely been felt so eloquently, and it would be an appropriate career capper should the director never make another feature film--here's hoping that's not the case, however.<br/><br/>88/100"
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","5","22 December 2019"," Expected from the protagonists, but still pretty good overall
","""The Irishman"" is a new 2019 American full feature film that is mostly in the English language and it is a really long movie at pretty much exactly 3.5 hours, so duration-wise basically two films together with each of them running 1 hour 45 minutes. But of course, it is just one film. Still I think it could have worked as a miniseries too. This film is based on a book and the adaptation is by Oscar winner Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List). The big star behind the camera, however, is the incomparable Martin Scorsese. I read people say this could be his final movie, but I really hope it is not. Not that he would not deserve retirement with all the greatness he has come up with in his career. This film here adds a new chapter to that. I am actually surprised to read that before teaming up with Netflix they struggled to find a production company here. I mean come on Scorsese and De Niro working on a mobster movie? Could it ever have gone wrong? Admittedly Pacino and Pesci (who celebrated some of his biggest successes, including his Oscar win, in Scorsese / De Niro films) probably weren't confirmed yet back then. So I would say it went right and looking at how this made it to the imdb top250 already immediately, others seem to agree. I must still say this is too much and I would not call it a great film really, even if there are occasional great moments. I will get to these later. But then again, my opinion is probably not too representative when it comes to Scorsese because the films that are considered his very best are not among my favorites from him and instead I prefer for example Hugo, Shutter Island or also the film about old Japan he made not too long ago (with Driver, Garfield and Neeson).<br/><br/>Now as for this one here, I already mentioned the three key actors with De Niro being at the center of it all from beginning to end at different stages of his character's life. Pay attention to his bright blue eyes here. The two big supporting players do not have that much time together on the screen. Basically early on, it is Pesci mostly. Then Pacino steps into the picture and really takes over and Pesci is gone for a long time until he reappears in the film's final third. And at the end, Pacino is gone and it is again only Pesci until the very end, when it's all about De Niro. I must say these very final scenes in the last half hour were also when De Niro mostly shines. He was not that great or memorable before that really. I would even go so far to say that Pacino stole the spotlight from him a bit. And he was a real scene stealer. This of course also has to do with the material. Frequently he just has much more to work with. The scene when they meet the guy who is late and not properly dressed is the best example. Pure Oscar bait for Pacino. Admittedly, he really also makes the most of this. But I am not surprised that the way it seems now De Niro is not getting the Oscar nomination this year, but Pacino and Pesci are. Actually, from what I saw here I would really love to see Pacino win a second, but at this point it seems highly unlikely because Pesci seems to be getting more momentum and both will have a hard time beating Brad Pitt, also because they will probably steal some votes from each other. Not that I'd mind Pitt winning at all. As for Pesci, the nomination is enough. But not undeserving. I think he pretty much showed a flawless performance here and also nailed all the more subtle moments, but as good as Pacino he is not or I would say his character did not offer as much. Speaking of awards, of course Scorsese must be mentioned too. Can he win Best Director this year? With his actors going against Pitt, he could be going mostly against Tarantino who directed Pitt. I am not sure, a nomination seems safe and he is among the top3 contenders right now. I don't think this is among his best directorial efforts though, so even if I love the man it would be too much and it would be nicer if he finally gets his second directing Oscar for another film in the future. We will see.<br/><br/>Also I want to say a few words on specific scenes and characters here. First of all, it must be said of course that this is based on actual events and characters. The best example is how the protagonists perceive the Kennedy assassination, especially Pacino's with the American flag scene. And as almost always with Scorsese there is a great deal of bloodshed in here. It all leeds to the killing of Hoffa. Maybe you knew it would happen, maybe you didn't. But still seeing it happen at the hands of Sheeran was rough, even if it was just one quick glimpse, two bullets and he was dead. But consequences were grave. Media posted hourly updates about the search for Hoffa and for Sheeran himself, this also had very personal consequences, namely his daughter seeing what happened. I am not too sure if I liked it and it felt realistic that she realized it, but the ""why?"" ""why what?"" moment was really tense. Oscar winner Anna Paquin plays the dauughter by the way. And with this scene alone, her character was probably more relevant or played a bigger role in this film than all the protagonists' wives who admittedly added very little except cigarette smoke. Also the scene very early on with the daughter and what happens after her dad finds out a guy pushed her in a store. She realizes how violent he can be and it is not only when he needs to protect his beloved ones. Another daughter makes a similar statement at the very end because when something happened they could not talk about it to their father because his reaction would be so over-the-top. But despite all the violence, bullets to the head etc. there are also scenes and moments that will make you laugh a little but, such as the lengthy fish scene at the end, or the gun graveyard earlier, Hoffa's sweet tooth when it comes to ice cream. And there is more really. In general, it is a film about many subjects, not just about crime, father-daughter relationships etc. but also for example about real honest friendship because Bobby's and Pesci's characters are friends for life really in here, even if they are also business associates. That's surely what you can call them. In addition, the music is always nice in Scorsese films and this is no exception. I personally found it pretty nice to see Breaking Bad's Jesse Plemons in here, even if he did not have too much to work with this time. But it's kinda interesting how he is having a far better career than Aaron Paul and without the Oscar nomination maybe he'd even be vlose to Bryan Cranston. And for me personally, it was really amazing to see J.C. MacKenzie here, even if it is just one or two scenes, because I loved him since Dark Angel. These likes are personal taste for me. Maybe others will appreciate Huston, Lombardozzi or Cannavale, it's up to you. Overall I believe if you consider watching this one, you most likely have seen older Scorsese crime films, or mobster movies in general, so you don't really need me to give you a recommendation here. But if you do, it would not be a negative one, although I cannot be as enthusiastic about this film as I would like to be. Still, thumbs-up. go watch and you will find many interesting details that maybe I have not mentioned already like the very last camera last shot with the door open, just like Hoffa's was the first time the two met."

"thenza","9","0","3","18 December 2019"," Slowly draws you into selling out to the Netflix Machine
","I give this title an 8.8 out of 10 stars that score might drop to the lowest of 8.2 on a rewatch perhaps but is unseen. Scorsese is one of the only directors that I can trust for quality films. This one had all the trademark moves: establishing steady cam rolling opening shot with fantastic score, the way he can jump from narration to cut scenes and bring it all back, starting from the middle and explaining the past while uncovering the plot; he has the formula down. The movie itself is an epic 3 hours and 30 minutes which puts it up there with Lord of the Rings and Benhur for runtime (not boredom) by hour 2 to 2.5 I was hooked into watching the rest of the film that is where the apex of the film lies. Pesci from out of retirement is brilliant it is like he never left, not as vulgar and over-the-top as previous films but he is still very daunting in character and subtle delivery.
At first glance you don't really understand what the movie is about, especially since the way they advertised it to me was a focus on an ex-hitman and his relationship with his daughter which in reality is about 3 percent of the movie, so I will have to discredit that portion; it might have been the motivation in writing the book but not the movie. The story really boils down to the relationship between these 3 guys one of which is Jimmy Hoffa played by Al Pacino who is unstoppable in mindset (I could see some of that Scarface flare in there as well). The movie is also about history in the making and looking back at life through duty and loyalty in the broadest sense of the word, in that regard De Niro is more muted and is instead more of a tool of bringing that history to screen than an actual person to an extent.
I can't leave a review without talking about the misses and negatives because I would say watch it on your own to know what is good, but knowing any Scorsese film you get the build up and the conclusion. Not to be understated I really want him to direct a movie that isn't mob related, I know it's his bread and butter but I wonder if he could put as much detail into something else because I honestly think he can do it, (the little things: explaining why the hotdogs were the best, how to make pancakes all that detail in narration that is irrelevant but doesn't seem story book like Quentin.) Other than that; there are some character development that goes nowhere like the wives at the beginning, and I think about 10 mins of the first act could have been shelved; there is no need for it. Uncharacteristic of Scorsese is that the beginning doesn't have the feel of the rest of the film but the formula is the same with his running plot style (quick cuts, change in character arc, etc). In part you might be disappointed if you thought this film was going to be a fiction mob movie where De Niro plays the monster and his daughter revives their relationship though story-telling because its not that at all. If anything the movie is part Americana, part aging-mob with historical accuracy being more of a shade than a color. I'll end on saying that this film was start to finish about one person but it was not about that person at all, it was about people living in an era and the inevitable outcomes riding the tide of life. If it will be a classic is not likely per-say but Martin always comes through, just a little lame that Netflix had buy him out to do this but it is still very much quality. He should retire the mob films though and make Tyson or a different genre at this point instead of playing it safe."
"ernestsavesxmas","6","0","3","18 December 2019"," Real long movie, not bad though!
","The crime of Martin Scorsese's 25th feature film is not really in its length. You could fill seven seasons of a Netflix TELEVISION production with the real world lives this movie unpacks. Perhaps, Marty (age 77) or the three main characters (DeNiro and Pesci both 76, and Pacino, 79) have lost something off their fastball, and asking any of them to carry 209 minutes is, well, impossible. Not trying to be ageist, but this movie drags. It's not the brilliant return to Goodfellas form that others seem to be gracing it as. It's great in moments, but as whole it's merely good. Scorsese nuts are sure to love it, everyone else? Could go either way.<br/><br/>While Scorsese is no stranger to biopics, Jimmy Hoffa is the most famous subject he's tackled since Howard Hughes (The Aviator). Working with relatively unknown REAL people, like Ray Liotta's Henry Hill, serves this type of ""biopic"" movie so much better. The audience isn't clouded with any preexisting notions of who that is because Goodfellas essentially functioned as his introduction. He still doesn't feel ""real"" to me. (And, yes, I understand DeNiro as the much more obscure Frank Sheeran is the lens here, but inserted into such momentous real life history--e.g., the JFK assassination--the film plays much more like Forrest Gump than I would have anticipated or cared for.)<br/><br/>Late in the game, the movie makes a unique tonal shift. When the story and the flashbacks catch up with each other, we're given some of the most slow sequences I can ever recall in a Scorsese film. Up until that point, the viewer had been subjected to non-stop exposition and plot movement. Finally, some extemporaneous dialogue! There is a long conversation about a fish in a car: what kind of fish it was, why you shouldn't put a fish in your car unless it's properly packaged, etc. It's really some of the most plodding stuff he's ever put on film and it's fantastic. I can't believe I'm saying that about something that happens 2+ hours into a 3.5 hour long movie, but it's true.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after the climax of the film, we still have nearly 45 minutes to go. And that tonal shift completely evaporates. We're back in Scorsese voice-over hell and it's a completely dragged out, overly emotional, unearned final act that borders on being all-out comically bad at times. I think that, without it, the film would earn a low-8 for me and not the middling 6 out of 10 I'm giving it.<br/><br/>Lastly, I was able to catch this in a movie theater. Seeing the Netflix's N logo and hearing that ""bum-bum"" chime as the only production bumper was an odd experience, as this was the first Netflix film for me IRL. With the landscape for how and where we see things changing (and primed to REALLY change soon), I feel much like I felt about this film: conflicted."

","Short but sweet here. If you're expecting it to be as good as taxi driver or goodfellas then prepare to be dissapointed. It's good but not as good as I was expecting at all. Expected so much more however it's still worth a watch. I'd give it 6.5/10 if I could but won't let me"

","Love Casino. Love Goodfellas. This was eh. I could get past the old men playing younger guys in the previously mentioned movies. This one, too fake, too unbelievable and ruined the story for me. DeNiro hobbling to take someone out didn't help... These guys don't need these don't need the work, let someone else more believable tell the story."

","First let's talk story. This is a fascinating period of time in US history so the foundation is there for a strong story but it just drags a bit too much. For it to be 3.5 hours long is crazy. It's just way too long.
Secondly, what is De'Niro's characters goal exactly? He seems to be pretty 2d in so many respects. The strength of an anti-hero is found in what motivates them. I couldn't see what did.
All that aside the VFX is certainly good. They made this film for 350M. Of which most must of gone on VFX and main cast. That in of itself is a very expensive movie for what actually is."

","Even though the movie is really long, it kept a steady flow and didn't seem to drag. Al Pacino does a really good job, Ray Romano does a really good job. Robert De Niro not so much, when he's kicking the store owner on the ground just horrible acting all around on that scene. A couple of very good actors with really small parts, Jesse Plemmons, Steven Van Zandt, etc... If Goodfellas and Casino are a 10, then this would be a 6-6.5."

","Another ensamble piece from Scorsese is always a great reason to get excited for his films. They have resulted in such classics as Goodfellas, Casino, and the Wolf of Wall Street. However, his latest film The Irishman is kinda a let down on a lot of fronts.<br/><br/>Firstly, this is Scorsese's longest film by far, but it never feels as if there is any fully fleshed arc for characters. Even the main character, Frank, feels like he only had a part of his character developed. There a complex story threads and awesome moments of intricate tension, but it does not build the character's complexity in any way, to the point they feel like characatures.<br/><br/>Secondly, this film has the most ok looking cinematography and the most jumbled sound design I have heard in a while. There is a moment where a character is killed off and his dialogue is clipped mid sentance by a gunshot. This is the type of amateur mistake that happens in film school. Even if this is a long movie, it does not give Scorsese any excuse when plenty of other 3 hour films have such attention to detail and this one being quite lazy in others. The cinematography, film is shot on mostly 35mm celluloid and has a few interesting Scorsese stylistic flares (long takes and zooms). But there is some really jarring and out of place digital zooms, as well as random title cards that barely add anything to the film's experience.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the music. Now this is something I was quite frusterated about, because Scorsese usually has a great taste and usage of music through his films. This one is diverse-ish until the last third. Where La Vie En Rose (which has been played in film near to death) is played, then the irishman theme is spammed as well as In The Still of the Night.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, there are so many callbacks to Scorsese's other works, that it becomes downright annoying. We get it, you made some awesome movies, get over it and get on with your movie man!<br/><br/>For the good things, cast was pretty fantastic. I wasn't sure how I felt about Pacino'a accent, but it grew on me. The story itself and the production design where well detailed. And the deaging effects were not noticable. I even liked the way the film ended without going into spoilers.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a big meh and it will not be on the top of the year list. It was overhyped and not one of Scorsese's best films by a strech. If you love all things by him, I'm sure you'll love this. But if you want a good detailed character study, you are better off rewatching Goodfellas or waiting in the later weeks for netflix to release A Marriage Story."

","Please bare with me here a bit. First off, I had surprisingly many chances to see The Irishman in cinema, but did not because of its runtime. I just didn't want to miss a few minutes because I need to pee, that's all. My wee-counter on this watch at home was two, so I feel justified in that painful decision I had to make. But really come on, that's not an actual big deal and you're no less of a movie person if you wanna relieve yourself in peace, I think. The experience was great on my 4K TV as well, but still, I of course normally would've liked seeing it on the big screen. Anyway, the movie is great. The performances are very good, especially Robert De Niro toward the end is absolutely terrific and managed to break my heart a little which surprised me a lot. A character like that I didn't think I could even feel a tiny bit sorry for. And I guess I still don't, but the sincerity of the performance did a lot for me. Al Pacino also is quite brilliant and magnetic as can be. The direction is by Martin Scorsese, which is all anyone needs to say about that to get people interested in watching the thing. Then there's beautiful cinematography and a very good score as well as strong writing. Everything works. The runtime was never a big issue for me when it comes to pacing, but I still would've liked it to be shorter anyway because it's just a damn long time. Films shouldn't necessarily be that long in my opinion, but whatever, this one definitely pulled it off well. Now I'm gonna watch the conversation about it that Netflix put there to play after the film's finished. That's a nice thing to do by the way and I'd like that to happen more often."
