"asexpected","Null","112","136","22 November 2004"," greatly misunderstood story, completely underrated classic
","Having watched this film more times than I can remember and reading the comments left so far I feel that a major message of this film has gone completely overlooked. Even as a complete golf addict, I can look beyond the obvious inspirational story and see than the focus is on Junah's battle with faith, and why does nobody mention that Bagger Vance is a guardian angel? I'm not a religious person so please don't get the wrong idea but is it not obvious at the end when old Hardy Greaves dies and Bagger appears on the horizon? ""I'm right here with ya, I've been here all along..."" And please Junah's trauma was caused by WW1 NOT WW2 - it is 1930 (WW2 did not start until 1939!) OK,the direction by Redford is fantastic with the portrayal of the characters done (and acted) extremely well. Will Smith and Matt Damon play the roles brilliantly, especially Smith. Perhaps Damon seems a little young to be a veteran at times though, but all the same-flawless. Theron, physically, looks perfect for the role but, like Damon, not a woman assumedley in her mid-thirties. I only wish more money could have been spent on this film and it would have been made into the epic it deserves to be. Far more than a simple, soft inspirational story. One must look beyond to see the real message, oh and if your not a golfer, you might not completely 'get it'.<br/><br/>Film 8.5/10 Story 10/10"
"rittmeister","Null","34","40","19 November 2001"," This movie is about Redemption
","It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a movie as much as I did this one. We all watch movies for a lot of reasons besides the obvious reason of ""entertainment."" While THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE does it in a most charming and entertaining way it is all about Redemption. Each of us faces adversity in our daily life and how we face it marks the quality of the life that we live. Junuh has faced personal demons for more than ten years since he fought in WW I. The ""Loss of his swing"" is more than an athletic loss that he refers to. He has lost his faith in himself and his ability to face life after his return from the war.<br/><br/>The role of Bagger Vance, ably played by Will Smith, was not as God like as the character described by Steven Pressfield in his book from which this film was adapted. In the movie Vance had the ability to help people think beyond the obvious and to reach back for something special. In Junuh he helps reinstill a personal belief and an appreciation of life. In the Pressfield book, Vance WAS a God.<br/><br/>All of the roles were well played and the young boy playing Lemmon in his youth stole the show. It was also good to see Jack Lemmon in his final movie role. I thought it was an interesting coincidence that Lemmon's final role was in a mystical movie just as Burt Lancaster's was in THE FIELD OF DREAMS. The score was also especially moving and the music fit the movie to a ""T."" This is a different kind of movie but still qualifies as a ""feel good"" movie. We don't always have an opportunity to go back and take a second stab at life and that is the beauty of this movie.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful thing to be able to go back and make amends for mistakes we have made in our lives and to come out on the other side as a better person. That is what Junuh was able to achieve and that made me feel very good when the credits rolled. For those of you who thought this was a golfing movie that is not the case. It is a movie about life and the chance to make a fresh start which is always important for those who struggle to overcome adversity."
"Willie-12","8","58","75","8 November 2000"," Guess I was just in the mood
","Maybe it was because I had a hard week at work.  Maybe it was because I just needed something to make me feel good.  I don't know.  I can't pinpoint it, but for some reason I really liked this movie.  Sure it was manipulative, and sure it tried it's best to make you feel all mushy inside, but you know what...I guess I was just in the mood for that, and this movie hit the spot last Friday night.  From a cinematography stand point the movie is beautiful.  Redford is known for this trait, and indeed has directed some of the most beautiful movies ever made (A River Runs Through It, The Milagro Beanfield War, The Horse Whisperer).  He just chooses some very beautiful scenery and runs with it.  However, besides the scenery, the movie seemed to flow like a steady river.  The acting was superb (even Smith's subdued Bagger), and the story was interesting.  I like golf, so maybe that helped, but I do think that anyone can enjoy this movie.  You just have to let yourself like it."
"ExpendableMan","7","42","53","22 October 2007"," Will Smith and Matt Damon playing golf for two hours, much better than it sounds
","The thing you have to bear in mind when watching The Legend of Bagger Vance is that sports movies, by their very definition, tend to match the atmosphere of the sport they depict. Football or Ice hockey movies for instance tend to be loud, bombastic and flashy, just like the games themselves. Basketball movies meanwhile often rely on the street/hip hop connection and are just as loud, but with a slightly more gritty edge to them, provided you completely forget about the atrocious Space Jam. Bagger Vance on the other hand revolves entirely around golf and consequently, is a lot quieter, slower paced and gentle than its brash genre cousins, but it nevertheless possesses a charm and subtlety that is quite endearing.<br/><br/>Told completely in flashback, the film's story involves Matt Damon's depressed World War One veteran Rannulph Junnuh taking part in a highly publicised golf tournament against two established (real life) professionals - Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones. At first things don't look good, Junnuh hasn't played the game since getting back from the trenches and is a slovenly drunken washout and despite having the support of the townsfolk, nobody really expects him to win. And then he gets a new caddy in the shape of Bagger Vance (Will Smith).<br/><br/>At this point I imagine alarm bells are ringing in your head. Will Smith must mean wise-cracking, one-liners and the word 'damn' being stretched out so that it consists of two syllables right? Well you'll be relieved to know that Bagger is a pleasant change of direction for the normal Smith stereotype. Relaxing on his heels and working his acting muscles instead of his action hero ones, Smith is the undeniable soul of the movie. His eminently likable charm is still there, but he relies more on home spun wisdom and gentle prodding to help Damon back into his game, rather than calling him a honkey and effecting a cocky swagger. Playing off against him, Matt Damon is suitably vulnerable and insecure but is overshadowed a bit and with the exception of Junnuh's two rivals, the rest of the cast might as well be superfluous. Thankfully, Junnuh's redemption and Vance's easy going friendship is enough to carry the film and the story, while corny, is just as charming as the title character.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, director Robert Redford once again shows off his knack for beautiful cinematography. As most of the film takes place on golf courses you're never too far away from some gorgeous scenery and the contrast between the vibrant green vegetation and stunning blue sky makes Bagger Vance a feast for the eyes. Given the film's somewhat slow pace, it also makes this an ideal choice for a wet Sunday afternoon where you'd like to go for a walk and appreciate the countryside but are unable to thanks to the rain.<br/><br/>That said, Bagger Vance still has its faults. The writing is a bit hackneyed and anyone who doesn't like cheese would do well to stay away. Junnuh's love interest sub-plot with golf promoter Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) meanwhile feels tacked on and unnecessary, as though somewhere along the production line someone decided that if Junnuh was to fully come to terms with himself he'd have to get it on with a sweet country belle. The positives outweigh the negatives though and if you're in the mood for a relaxing, slow paced movie with a lot of subtleties that not everyone will appreciate, you can't really go wrong with Bagger Vance. This is a film to watch with your feet up, the house clean and a big mug of hot chocolate in your hand. And refreshingly enough for a sports movie, it doesn't feature a scene where a big crowd begins cheering wildly while over-the-top power ballads play in the background, that alone should be enough to raise an eyebrow or two."
"ccthemovieman-1","10","49","66","4 November 2006"," Another Excellent Fantasy-Sports Film
","I usually like fantasy movies and I really enjoy sports films. Combine the two well - like ""Field Of Dreams"" and like this movie - and I am sure to rate this extremely high. I've seen it three times and enjoyed it immensely each time.<br/><br/>It reminded me a bit, too, of ""The Natural,"" but instead of baseball, this one features golf and real-life legends Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen playing the local guy, ""Rannulph Junuh"" (Matt Damon). Like ""The Natural,"" this is beautifully photographed, has a wonderful feel-good ending, a variety of characters, a beautiful lead woman and good acting.<br/><br/>The no-name child actor in here, J. Michael Moncrief, who plays ""Hardy Greaves,"" narrates the film as an older man looking back on this story. The kid is a fine actor, too, and I really enjoyed his Georgia accent. Charlize Theron is the beauty, playing ""Adele Invergordon,"" a woman who organizes this famous golf match between the greatest amateur player of the world, the best professional and ""Junuh,"" who is the focus of this story. Theron's known for her dramatic roles but she exhibits a nice comedy touch in here. <br/><br/>Damon does his normal fine job of acting and Will Smith, as the angelic caddie ""Bagger Vance,"" is uncharacteristically low-key, which I found nice to see. Bruce Magill did a good as Hagen and Joel Gretsch, likewise, for Jones. Magill is obviously the best real-life golfer here among these actors. Damon had to learn the game from scratch, and did a fine job with his swing.<br/><br/>The only part of this film that went a little overboard - but it's the fantasy part of the story - was the New Age-type preaching by ""Bagger."" However, some of his speeches were simply golf visualization, which has always been taught as a means to concentrate better on one's shot-making. I didn't think hearing the Lord's name in vain a half dozen times was necessary in here, either, but what are you gonna do? Other than those things, this is great film and I one I throughly appreciate every time I see it."

"trumpman30","9","30","41","22 May 2002"," This film worked for me.
","I guess I'm really into the ""winning through adversity"" films.  I really enjoyed films such as ""The Natural"" and ""The Legend of Bagger Vance.""  I think the two were about equal.  They both show the hero overcoming adversity through a sport's golden age which is what makes this movie great. If you showed a golf or baseball movie today it would not be as believable because they no longer play for the love of the game but for the money. This was set in a time when the game was more dignified.  I never though much of Will Smith, thinking of him mostly as a comedy type actor but I think his greatness hit its peak when he started doing these drama type productions.  Smith is sensational in his roll.  If Redford had a mental picture of Bagger Vance before this movie started, I think he actually saw how Will Smith performed in this film.  Matt Damon was good also. <br/><br/>
Overall, a great ""feel good"" film.  9/10"
"ralphzoontjens","10","16","23","4 October 2011"," The best movie I've seen to become present yourself
","You know, there's basically only two ways you can watch movies. You either use them as food for the thinking mind, or you simply sit back and see where it takes you, as if it's the first thing you've ever seen.<br/><br/>In the first way, your mind generates expectations of what it will get to consume. Then it will be presented its food for consumption, and it will start up its filters in order to judge whether the food is good or bad. And every time you think you can fit it with a negative label, you will gladly make known that you made that recognition.<br/><br/>In the other way, you enter the movie fully and openly, without expectations. And as the experience unfolds, you feel into the characters and relate it to your own being.<br/><br/>From the first perspective, this movie is not very good. It's slow, a bit airy-fairy, and the plot quite boring. Your mind will probably already know what's going to happen all the time, and find plenty of negative labels it can paste onto the movie. On to the next one, the next thing to consume, it will tell you.<br/><br/>From the other perspective, this is one of the best movies if not the best ever created in the history of humanity, if you ask me. It gradually unfolds into showing how R. Junuh (Matt Damon) becomes more present in where he is, as he makes crucial steps in his mind and lets go of the baggage that remains inside of it. By following this process and relating to it ourselves, this movie is a wonderful tool for becoming more present and being masterful in whatever we happen to be doing in our own lives.<br/><br/>Bagger Vance (Will Smith) basically tells that the only thing that Junuh can do in order to win this game of golf is let go of his thoughts. The thoughts that tell him who he is or should be in relation to others, what he feels about the present 'situation', or what he needs to do in order to succeed. He learns that he needs to simply drop that self-centeredness, essentially that whining child inside, and let the moment that is already there take him over instead of his mind.<br/><br/>By doing so ourselves during the movie, we might become more present too as our thoughts fade to the background and as we become more aware of what's going on around us, instead of being absorbed only in what's going on inside the screen, behind the electronic window. We can get into that state where we feel our environment, where we drop all mental baggage, and where we can simply excel in what we do, whatever it is that apparently wants to be done through us. We can remember how it was before all the mental conditioning started somewhere in our childhood, and become present again. That's the real potential of this movie, the experience it can drag you into. Which is much better than a temporary pleasure, if you ask me.<br/><br/>And is that not the only thing to do in this game we call life? Is that not the ultimate teaching that the Bhagavad Gita and ultimately the mystical branches of all religions point to? In this movie, it's not Bagger Vance that awakens R. Junuh, it simply all happens pretty much independently of anything, in the true experiential recognition of itself. And that's really all we need to know, and the limit of all that we can really get from any type of immersion in media content."

","This will be short. This will be sweet.<br/><br/>After viewing this film, I am feeling really good about myself right about now. This movie was uplifting and inspiring. You will feel good about yourself after seeing it. And that is probably what Robert Redford has hoped would happen. Hehe. That little s***. This movie has the exact feel of those other feel-good movies that have come before it. Ex. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, OCTOBER SKY, etc. But, for some reason THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE seemed to be one of the better films of that genre. It almost made me cry, which very rarely ever happens. Matt Damon is a good actor. I hope to see more of him everywhere. If you are in the mood for a happy movie that will make you feel good about yourself, see this one.....5/5.<br/><br/>Oh, and it was good to see Jack Lemmon in this film.

"Elgroovio","8","31","55","18 September 2004"," Not a bad film
","I used to love this film a lot, but with time I have grown less fond of it. Still I regard it as a pretty good film, for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>First, it is very well made, and artistically shot with some highly memorable scenes, such as the one where Will Smith first appears out of the dark.<br/><br/>Second, it is very well directed, by Robert Redford.<br/><br/>Third and finally it has a smashing cast, with Will Smith and Matt Damon carrying it beautifully. Surprisingly, Charlize Theron, who I don't tend to like very much in general, is very good as Damon's love interest. Another surprising thing about this film is that the kid, J. Michael Moncrief, is fantastic in his part as young Hardy Greaves (kid actors, with the exceptions of Rupert Grint and Haley Joel Osment, tend to have very poor acting skills. Yes Daniel Radcliffe, I'm thinking of you). Also, look out for Jack Lemmon's (for some reason uncredited) role as the old Hardy Greaves (it was one of his final roles).<br/><br/>""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" is a good watch, but it does get a bit monotonous after a while. Still, if you love golf, you're bound to enjoy it. I give a respectable 8/10."
"jimvandemoter-50236","9","4","5","27 July 2019"," Great movie
","I'm surprised this movie didn't rank higher with viewers. Will Smith is great in the way he imparts quiet wisdom. Matt Damon's portrayal of a man who has been damaged by the horrors of war, finds redemption and learns to live is spot on. The feel of the time the story is set is also very good. the camera work and the general setting is beautiful. Do I like this movie? What do you think?"
"mirkobozic","7","4","5","8 June 2018"," The perfect stroke
","The Legend of Bagger Vance is one of those movies that are all about feeling good and inspiring messages all of which we have seen a trillion times before.: Chocolat, You've got Mail, etc. Yet, it kind of works and Redford succeeds in persuading you to stay till the ending credits though the core of the story is not a romantic plot but rather the personal development of the Matt Damon's character Junuh. Will Smith's character Bagger Vance comes to his rescue as a mysterious, yet charismatic caddie who helps him regain not only his self-confidence but also his status. The film is interwoven with magical realism of Vance, although there's not much more to him than delivering motivational speeches and puzzling everyone regarding where he came from and why he's on Junuh's side in the first place. A large part of the charm of the film is the beautiful setting of Savannah, and a very luscious Charlize Theron playing a glamorous local socialite who incites the exhibition golf match around which the whole story is revolving. With all this, it's a light , inspiring afternoon entertainment in a stylish package. You probably won't regret seeing it, but it's not exactly on par with equally feel-good vehicles like Forrest Gump. To paraphrase Vance, it's not exactly the perfect strike, but it goes in the right direction (pun intended)."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","7","4","5","14 April 2013"," Very underrated flick
","This is a movie I very much like, and last evening as I was watching it for maybe the 4th time I tried to focus on why it wasn't more popular. I think what it comes down to is that there's an awfully lot of time in the movie spent on the course...so if you're not a golfer or not ""into"" golf, that might bore you. And I tried to compare that in my mind with films about other sports, and it seems to me there is much more time spent on the links here, than might be spent on the diamond for most baseball films or on the field for most football films.<br/><br/>Having said that, there are few things I would complain about regarding this film...but then again, I like gold. It does seem to me that some hint of Bagger in the climactic WWI scenes would have helped tie the film together. And visually realizing at the end of the film that Bagger has not aged, even though it is 60 years later would have been helpful...again to tie the beginning and end of the film together.<br/><br/>In terms of performances here, I was impressed, and here's why: yes, we can get a sense of whether someone is a truly good actor in an action pic, but what can they do in a serious film? And, with the exception of ""Six Degrees Of Separation"" (in which he had a supporting role), this was Will Smith's first serious film...and he comported himself very well. Matt Damon had less to prove here, having been in a number of serious films, but he also does very well here in a role where in various scenes he has to be very up or very down...and he balances it all pretty well. Similarly Charlize Theron continued her series of fine performances here...certainly one of our most stunningly beautiful actresses. Bruce McGill as Walter Hagen is wonderful, and he is a supporting actor I have come to have a great deal of respect for. Joel Gretsch is equally good as Bobby Jones, and I'm surprised we don't see him in more feature films, although he is quite active in television. J. Michael Moncrief as the young Hardy Greaves...well, I had mixed feelings here...a little uneven...but pretty good. And of course, it was nice to see an ailing (both in the film and in real life) Jack Lemmon. Lane Smith a newspaper man was also a welcome addition to the film, although his role was not overly substantial here.<br/><br/>My guess is that if you really ""get"" the psyche of golf, you'll love this movie. If you don't, there may be parts that bore you, but you can still enjoy some very fine performances. But make no mistake...this is a ""serious"" film."
"Christopher van Raij","Null","16","31","26 June 2002"," Best Redford yet!

"xteve","5","12","25","13 April 2001"," Good Intentions, but really falls short
","This adaptation of the book is well done in many ways. The casting of the supporting actors, who play Jones & Hagen, as well as the young Hardy, is top notch.<br/><br/>Cinematography, etc. is also very well executed.<br/><br/>I thought that Damon did a very credible job as Junuh, although his character is a Redford clone, right down to the haircut and whispery delivery of his lines, and Will Smith was surprisingly quite good as Bagger Vance. I must admit when I read the novel I had a hard time imagining Smith playing this part, but he carries it off with Morgan Freeman-esque style.<br/><br/>I completely disagree with every reviewer who enjoyed Charlize Theron's performance. Her character is little more than a footnote in the book, and in this film they greatly expanded her role to have a romantic subplot that frankly has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and bogs down the story. Ms. Theron is very beautiful, but her accent is TERRIBLE!!!! Watch her first few scenes with the town elders and tell me how you could ever believe that is a real Georgia accent.<br/><br/>Similarly, the young Hardy, who has a much more credible Southern accent, seems to lose it completely by the time he's grown up to become the narrator, Jack Lemmon. Little continuity errors like that drag this film down.<br/><br/>All in all, Bagger Vance is not a bad film, but it's not great either.<br/><br/>Best suited for golfers and fans of the Great Gatsby."
"tedg","Null","7","14","12 November 2000"," Bogie
","Redford continues his quest to be the Englebert Humperdink of film by creating uplifting Hallmark moments. The idea is to create a zen-like chicken soup metaphor, first fly fishing, then horses, now golf. The fishing film (`River Runs Through It') was far better, closer to noble,  because it was more meditative and exploited some creative shots. This has some of that, which is to its credit, but its all buried under a pretty syrupy story. Of the story, there's not much positive to say.<br/><br/>
The regional accents are particularly bad -- why couldn't they bring on a coach or at least get everyone to use the same fictional accent?<br/><br/>I think overly romanticizing a racial stereotype is just as demeaning and more pernicious than denigration. Just ask Native Americans. They'd be better off being portrayed as savages than as spiritual, environmental, peaceful, wise people. At least the former is an obvious trap. Redford should know better, and here is just capitalizing on the Tiger Woods rush."

I'm not a baseball fan but I do the same thing with ""The Natural."" So why am I hooked on this picture? It's certainly not golf. I like the idea of it but I don't play it. I'm not into Zen, or partial to ""angel"" movies. Yet all of these ingredients are thrown into the hopper and worked over, by what I've come to realize is a brilliant director, and out comes a masterfully told story. I re-watch the movie, not sure what birdies or eagles are, just to daydream that if I followed Bagger's advice I too good be a great player. I watch it for Michael Ballhous's poetic cinematography. Or for the great 30's costumes draped on a ravishing Charlize Theron. Or for the fantastic performances from Charlize, Matt Damon, Will Smith especially the boy explaining why he loves the game so much. Then when I think I'm cured, I have to watch it again for Rachel Portman's incredible score which cements the other-worldliness of this story so beautifully. I guess if I looked hard I could find flaws, but I don't want to. Sometimes it's better not to analyze things that seem in perfect balance without disturbing that balance. I guess time will cure me. I hope it's not too soon."

It is so uplifting. I don't know if it is because I love golf, but the moments that Redford captures in this movie are so beautifully done. He manages to keep the feel of the book without adding all of the nonsense from the book. I love this movie. The casting was perfect, and his sureness with the camera all add up to a movie that leaves me feeling better every time I see it. I love when I come upon the movie just before the hole in one scene and when Bagger talks Junuh into the shot out of the woods. I get goose bumps every time. This movie ranks high on my goose bump rating. Sometimes I see a performance or an entire movie that just gives me goose bumps, like Gladiator, or The Departed or Blood Diamond or Crash and I know there is true greatness happening.

"slokes","4","5","10","3 January 2008"," Pretty But Not As Magical As It Thinks
","Robert Redford is a good actor, but as a director I get the feeling he has never had a real human conversation in his life. Take ""The Legend Of Bagger Vance"".<br/><br/>It's about a Georgian named Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) who marches off to World War I one of America's greatest golfers but comes back without his swing. Coaching him back is his ex-lover Adele (Charlize Theron), a boy named Hardy (J. Michael Moncrief) who won't stop believing in him, and the title figure, a mysterious caddy (Will Smith) who tells Junuh that golf, like life, is ""a game that can't be won, only played.""<br/><br/>As with other Redford films, there is no real dialogue in ""Bagger Vance"". There are a lot of speeches, as various characters wait for their turn in close-up and for the music to swell before unloading some great profundity. ""Your Dad stared adversity in the eye, and he beat it back with a broom"" ""This is my last 18 holes, Junuh, and I can't think of a better way to end it."" ""I like the way we danced."" ""It was only a moment ago"". Those last two lines are each repeated, in case you missed them.<br/><br/>I get the feeling Redford treats his actors the way his directors treated him, telling Damon and Theron ""Do that again, only blonder this time"". Beauty is everywhere in ""Bagger Vance"", and the camera and lighting work here are exceptional, but there's never a feeling of real life creeping into the corners of the frame.<br/><br/>What's good in this film is Moncrief, the one real Southern accent in the cast who has fun and a disarmingly non-precocious way about him. Joel Gretsch showcases a convincingly authentic swing as golf legend Bobby Jones, one of Junuh's celebrated opponents in a big match at the end. Smith is enjoyable, too, making an otherwise annoyingly tricked-up character amusing at times with his sly, subtle delivery, about the only subtle thing in ""Bagger Vance"". It's a shame Redford couldn't have made Bagger's true otherworldly nature more of a mystery, but then Redford isn't one to let a point go by without beating you over the head with it.<br/><br/>Jack Lemmon narrates and appears in a cameo role as the adult Hardy. While obviously showing signs this would be his last film role, he makes his bad club swings as fun here as he did on TV at Pebble Beach. Redford's focus on actors does pay off with this old pro, and in some other cases. Everyone acquits themselves decently, anyway, with nice moments evenly distributed here and there among the chaff. The golf action, when it happens, is shot prettily, as is the Depression-era costumes and set design.<br/><br/>But everything moves so slow, especially when the game is underway. ""You've got an answer for everything, Bagger,"" Junuh says, and so he does. Or else Adele's got an answer. Or Junuh's got an answer for Hardy. These aren't people but fortune cookies with pre-formed messages when you crack them open.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, you wonder why no one zaps Junuh with a penalty stroke for all his on-course ruminations. Never mind. It's not really golf they're playing. It sure looks pretty, though, and that's the point."
"scoopcc","Null","3","5","12 November 2000"," Disappointing flick ....
",".... and I didn't have high expectations in the first place. This movie could have been solid, had the plot devices been developed. This would have meant chopping some of the golf footage out, but in my opinion, there was plenty of golf footage to snip. (And I'm an avid fan and participant; I enjoy the sport thoroughly.) The acting was, well, OK (I liked Damon) and yes, the shots were pretty. But why not delve into the subject matter involving Damon's character? Why not examine his horrors? Are we supposed to understand his character by seeing him unshaven, drinking a beer? I've seen many a person look and behave that way without going through combat .... details, please!<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I don't see what was so outstanding about Will Smith's character .... making a bunch of vague statements while driving the locals crazy with his aloof attitude does not make a great role. You want good Will Smith? Watch ""Six Degrees of Separation,"" not this. As outrageous as it sounds, Bagger's character meant very little to me in the whole scheme of things, and could have been written out! The child who admired Junuh could've spouted out the same kind of wisdom.<br/><br/>On a side note: I could see the boom mic on countless occasions during the first 10 or 15 minutes .... annoying!"

","Ahhh, it's not about golf. It's about knowing what you want in life and learning how to get it through golf. And it's about making not that interesting movie about all of that as well!<br/><br/>It sums up life, and reads people, with deep lessons, via one golf tournament. See the players; one is prurient (the oldest one) who cares only for money, women, and fame. Another one (middling-aged) who cares about winning, yet family and work too. And then our lead (the youngest) who considers the game a fully spiritual ride. As if the spirit's power proportions inversely with ageing; so as long as you're more spiritual - meaning less caring about materialistic goals - as long as you're young, and consequently live longer. Not to mention other matters that perfect with the main theme, like how life / golf is a match to beat your own weakness; ego, pains, etc. So you can find your swing; meaning your peace, where your gift / the best of you; meets its top shape, hence success. Sure they're all bright points. But not brightly delivered!<br/><br/>The small problems: First off, WAW, that must have been the longest heart attack anybody had in the history of mankind, and I'm referring to the one which struck Jack Lemon's character while he narrates the whole 120 minutes movie! Despite portraying it nicely, few people know about golf and its rules, and the movie just didn't help much to explain for the ignorant ones. And the music, ohh I hated that music, it's the typical soft music of Hollywood movies lately, so typical to have eventually nothing to it, being more like usual sound effects!<br/><br/>Then the BIG ones: it's undoubtedly Matt ""The Flat Face"" Demon. The guy is lower than his character, its demons, and its inner conflict, while having so little to express. His boyish sleek features just chilled the supposed fires inside. He's too cold to be silently torn. Likely actor / director (Robert Redford) wanted to cast himself in the role, or at least he saw himself in it. The role resembles some of his distinct characters over the years already. But with that suppressed desire, and that unqualified star, what we did have was the very poor man's Robert Redford as a lead!<br/><br/>The movie goes exactly like this: Demon plays bad, then Smith comes to straighten the guy with some cool sophisticated talk about balls and life, learning him how to get jiggy with it.. urrr.. get his swing back. Well, he gave Demon so many advices to an extent that put The Iliad's verses to shame!<br/><br/>Will Smith looked so idiot, and it's not his fault. He's way too young to have all of this complete wisdom. Casting Lemon instead should have been more believable. Even if the point was to indicate metaphorically how the WASP is indebted for the Afro-American, it didn't work. Especially when poor Smith got nothing to do but smiling quietly and saying fortune cookies all the way.<br/><br/>Then, nothing was said about who that young impeccable mentor was? Where did he come from? Or what would he gain out of his plan?, nothing said about the real calamity of the lead either; his war's bad memories, plus the mute Demon who they relayed on to speak the unspeakable. Add all of that to the previous, and you'll find that the movie is whether a parody of itself; about a black dude named Vance who shows suddenly for the bad golfers to rectify their performance for just 5 bucks (or accompany them to death free of charge!), or - at best - a dream of a lesson about getting the pureness of oneself yet imperfectly made.<br/><br/>Apparently, it tries to be wise and outwardly rich to end up as alleged and inwardly needy. The smooth cinematography and the romantic editing made nice colors to a hollow painting. While the movie appeals us to finding the ""swing"", it loses its.<br/><br/>Correct these flaws and you'll have the magical movie that this one wanted to be. Dear Redford, look at Smith's smile getting more and more empty and provocative as the movie goes on, to know that (Legend of Bagger Vance) missed a lot of care to be a legend, any legend, itself."

","i am disappointed.  to be honest i thought from the advertisments that this film would not be great but i figured if it was a robert redford film with will smith and matt damon it had to have something to it.  but it didn't really.<br/><br/>the best things about this film were will smith and some of the camera work. matt damon wasn't bad.  but the script was very unfortunate and i don't think the actors could have done much with it.  will smith seemed to be given the amusing lines to say and his smiling face is full of light that brightens up the screen always.<br/><br/>so the script.  yes it was very bad.  no real character development, no thrill to the story, everything felt very rushed.  it is hard for a film to live up to a book - the book this was based on was not fantastic, in fact it was kind of cheesy at points, but it was very lyrical and had moments of real beauty - these characteristics did not make it through to the film, though.  the script for the film was quite different form the book and i think that was a huge downfall.  the whole romance storyline was created for the film and it felt flat to me - no depth to it at all.  the relationship between junah and bagger vance is also very different and suffers for it i think.  there is little chance for a bond to develop between the two and bagger vance comes off as a wandering life-saver, instead of the mystical all-knowing god that he was in the book.  the whole premise of the book - looking at golf as a analogy for the human condition - gets lost somewhere. the film is very thin, little substance if any, and while it doesn't look bad, it doesn't look great - the looks won't carry the film.<br/><br/>and the editing was quite bad.  there was no flow to the film.  it felt very choppy and there were often cuts or transitions at the wrong points so that it was unclear where the focus of the scene was.  i was amazed that this film was released in such a choppy state.  very sad.<br/><br/>this is redfords worst directorial work - and it pains me to say that because i admire the man and his work greatly.  but there you go - no denying it."

","It would probably make a big difference if the viewer/reviewer played and appreciated golf and in fact read the book.  If neither is true, I suspect that the movie would have been marginal. In my case, both apply, and I enjoyed the movie, even with it's drawbacks, the biggest of which was including Ms. Theron's character in the movie at all, let alone with a major role. It was completely contrived, tantamount to inserting GI Jane into Saving Private Ryan, and with a questionable result. But with Redford, Hollywood and the need for attracting financing and an attempt at wider audience appeal, so be it. For example, ask any golfer how a public berating/hissy fit on the back nine of a major tournament, as occurred in the movie (rest assured, not in the book) would be received. But the movie and the casting of Mr. Smith and the golfers worked OK for me, except for the ending, which was unsatisfying compared to what Pressfield accomplished in the original work. As for Bruce McGill, a long way from ""D-Day"" in Animal House."

Damon tries once again to convince us he is the most talented human being on the face of the planet, playing yet another character with talent that just needs harnessing, (in this case by Smith, who's acting can only be described as 'fresh'). One wonders when Damon might like to join the human race, whereby ordinary people have to face life without amazing super powers, and show normal human emotional frailties, not wonder why they can't sink a putt. And for anybody who thinks thinks this represents any 'heal the world' effect on race relations.....see 'In the Heat of the Night' to get that stupid idea out of your head, then you'll feel a bit wiser about what constitutes racial commentary.<br/><br/>
Far closer to the truth is that the era the film is set in, combined with the ethnicity difference of the the two leads are used to manipulate the audience in the most vulgar way. Far from being clever, it is type casting at its ugliest. I for one would be interested on Spike Lee's comments on this movie, which clearly was devised for the 'lap it up' consumption of the intellectual midget. If you sat down the movie audience before they viewed this movie, and asked them what they thought would happen in it, almost all would find themselves capable of predicting the basic story line (just by thinking about the concept). Therefore, those who find they hate this, have only themselves to blame.

","What I really liked about The Legend Of Bagger Vance is the great care that director Robert Redford did in evoking the feel and ambiance of Savannah, 
Georgia in the Great Depression. I really did feel like I was back in that time
watching this story about a match between the greatest golfers of their era,
Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. A match where a local man, Matt Damon
gave the greats a run for their money.<br/><br/>Harve Presnell one of Savannah's leading citizens has invested everything in
the development of a new golf course and when stock market crashed he loses
everything and takes his own life. Staving off her father's creditors Charlize
Theron vows that this course will open and will feature a match between the
two best of their time Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. However for a little local rooting interest the townsfolk insist on a local player in with the big
guys.<br/><br/>Said local player is Matt Damon who went to war in 1917 and came out bitter,
disillusioned and drunk. Back in the day people in Savannah thought Damon
might have a future in professional golf then really at its beginning. But he
hasn't swung a club in a decade.<br/><br/>This entire story is seen through the eyes of young J. Michael Moncrief who in
time grows up to be Jack Lemmon who appears at the beginning and end of the film in his farewell role. Lemmon also provides the narration for The Legend Of Bagger Vance.<br/><br/>Damon eventually accepts, but it's only when Will Smith comes along playing
the title role as a most mysterious man who offers to be his caddy that Damon
plays. Smith imparts some real life lessons that both Damon and young Moncrief take in.<br/><br/>Other than Will Smith the only time you see any black people in the film is when Damon is discovered, living reclusively, drinking heavily and in a poker
game with several black people. In segregated Savannah of the Twenties while
you see a genteel version of the South it still has its racist mores and only Damon and Moncrief break them. The only black face you see in the crowds
at the celebrated match is Will Smith's.<br/><br/>Joel Gretsch as Bobby Jones and Bruce McGill as Walter Hagen exactly fit the
conception I had of both Jones and Hagen. They were as different as baseball
legends Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Hagen was a cheerful hedonist who was
quoted as saying he didn't want to be a millionaire just live like one. Jones was
the epitome of clean living and good sportsmanship. Among those covering
the match was Grantland Rice played here by Lane Smith in his farewell role.<br/><br/>How the match comes out is for you to watch the film for. But some life lessons are learned by all the players."

","**May include Spoilers** The Legend of Bagger Vance is told from the perspective of an elderly Hardy Greaves who has just had his sixth heart attack while playing golf. As he is lying there he is recalling his childhood and why he loves the game of golf. Before going off to the war, Rannulph Junuh was a very good golfer in Savannah, Georgia. Junuh lost all of his men in World War I, became very depressed and disappeared. When he finally returned to Savannah, Georgia it was the start of the Great Depression. He was an alcoholic and tried to keep to himself. Hardy Greaves really looked up to Junuh and volunteered him to play in a golf tournament that Adele Invergordon (Junuh's girlfriend before the war) had managed to set up with two of the world's best golfers, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagan. Adele had done this in an attempt to save the family golf resort. After some nagging from Adele and Hardy, Junuh starts practicing hitting golf balls when a strange man appears, Bagger Vance. He starts giving Junuh advice and becomes Junuh's caddy. Junuh reluctantly agrees to play in the tournament. Bagger Vance finally is able to help Junuh realize that his thoughts are affecting his game and he has to overcome them in order to do well in the tournament. By the last hole, Bagger Vance can see that Junuh has grown and matured and leaves the caddying to Hardy Greves, who he had been mentoring. Junuh, Jones and Hagan ended the game in a three way tie. The film ends with Hardy Greves getting up from his heart attack on the golf course and seeing an unaged Bagger Vance waving him over.<br/><br/>The theme of this move could be 'the way we think affects our and actions'. Bagger Vance bring to Junuhs' attention that he needs to let go of the pain and sorrow inside of him in order to be able to focus on life. It is setting him back in both his gulf game and his relationships with people that he needs in life. As Junuh starts letting go of his troubles, he is able to start opening his heart once again to Adele and find happiness.<br/><br/>The movie Nanny McPhee has a similar theme to The Legend of Bagger Vance. Nanny McPhee shows up when a father is struggling in life and has children that have a knack for destruction. She mysteriously shows up one day and slowly helps correct the madness. Her famous line is ""When you need me but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me, but no longer need me, then I have to go."" The same thing happened in The Legend of Bagger Vance. Bagger Vance mysteriously shows up and help straighten out the problems going on in Junuh's mind and helps him become aware of the affects that his mind/memories are having on his life.<br/><br/>Two techniques that are used in this file are camera angle and lighting. Camera angle is used in a lot of close ups in order to show the expression at that particular point in time. When it is more serious or intense it shows the actors close up. The most noticeable close up that is used is when Bagger Vance has Junuh watch the way that Jones putts. He has him see that he is the only person on the golf course and gets him to focus on the ball, his swing and where the hole is. Junuh becomes one with the game at that point. The lighting in the movie seems to portray the mood very well. During the dark time and memories in Junuh's life the film is darker or night time. The move that Junuah finds himself, the brighter the sun seems to shine, and when he has his fall backs it gets a little gloomier.<br/><br/>Junuh went from being miserably depressed and drunk to finding inner peace through the help of Bagger Vance. Bagger Vance had a calm peaceful feel about his character that made the audience feel at ease with him and his choice of words. Letting go and not allowing our fears and frustration affect us, is when we will truly find happiness."

","Hollywood will tell you it is looking for new, different stories.  Actually, what Hollywood looks for is the same old story with a slightly new twist.<br/><br/>Robert Redford has got the message. We have in the past seen films about almost every conceivable sport, from pool hustling to bob sledding. They almost always have the same plot. The long shot guy or team wins. Whether its about baseball, football or ice hockey, whether its about an individual or a team, its always about a loser or losers who find redemption.<br/><br/>So, having exhausted the major American sports, and in Redford's case this includes fly fishing, we turn to that most thrilling of spectacles, golf.<br/><br/>The plot is this.  It's the 30s, former golf phenom Matt Damon, who somehow got messed up in World War I, agrees to play in a three way golf shoot out with the two greatest players of the era, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. Will the gambling, boozy (well, not too boozy) Damon get his swing back? Only, it seems, with the help of his own person guru, played by Will Smith. Smith appears out of the night in a spiritual sort of way and before long is spouting new age advice of the type that made Luke Skywalker invincible with a light sword.<br/><br/>There's no point of going any farther with the plot, because if you can't figure it out from there, you've never seen a Hollywood sports movie.  This is essentially a festival of cliches which centers on believing in yourself.<br/><br/>
The camera work is great, the sets beautiful and the sunsets just knock outs. The acting is passable and Damon and the girl he is trying to win back, Charlize Theron, soldier on bravely with their parts. Smith gives what at best could be called a relaxed performance. What he seems to be doing is impersonating one of those guys sitting around on the sports journalist roundtable shows, pondering the more philosophical aspects of one sport or another, but really just waiting for the camera light to go off so he can pick up his paycheck and go home. You'll want to go home, too, about halfway through the film.<br/><br/>Actually, the filmgoer would be better advised to go outside and get some exercise rather than seeing this through to the end."

But what else could you do with scenes like that? <br/><br/>I've liked most of Robert Redford's movies, loved The Horse Whisperer, but here he's back attempting to film another unfilmable book. He's also back in Milagro Beanfield country, attempting to create another legend. Legends--actual legends, as against stories-behind-the-legends--make lousy movies. Milagro Beanfield sat around for years while everybody tinkered with it, trying to make it something other than flat and slow, and succeeded only in making it flat and fast; but I rather liked it, anyway. This time Redford in the hands of Dreamworks, who never know when to stop (cf. Jan de Bont's The Haunting), and it was probably they who led him to stuff the climaxes with technical tricks that aren't really in his style and only make the movie seem more insincere. <br/><br/>When Matt Damon is on screen, he actually performs the estimable feat of selling the story, in the same way Brad Pitt sold A River Runs through It, by playing Robert Redford; only better than he would have. Damon also seems to be playing Gatsby, and some of the sequences seem to have wandered out of that movie. Will Smith does not convince in his part, but what actor living or dead could? Jesus as a lovable and whimsical caddy who talks like Uncle Remus? Best to be polite and pretend it never happened. The other actors were fine, except for Charlize Theron, whom I found exceptionally cold and unattractive in what was obviously meant to be a warm and attractive part. <br/><br/>Once in a while the film looks past the faces to the golf field itself, and for a few seconds gives us something to see; but it hardly pertains to the story. Redford is trying to translate the untranslatable."

","This could have been a better movie, but this cast doesn't pull it off. Will Smith will never be an actor, only a personality, yet we keep seeing him foisted on audiences. His portrayal of a mystical golf guru coming out of nowhere is simply not believable. Matt Damon and Charlize Theron have a fair amount of talent, but this movie does not bring it out of them. Their characters act like stock characters out of central casting, and the result is a boring, plodding film in which you can't wait to reach the end. The film is well done on the technical end with beautiful scenes of the golf course and surrounding areas, but that does not make up for a poor script and uninspired acting. Not one of Redford's best efforts, as I've seen much better from him in the past and know he can do better."

Will Smith is so bad in this film, that I was amazed he was allowed to continue with the project. I would love to describe some of the other characters in this film, but they were so hollow, that there is simply nothing to describe.

","Apparently, Robert Redford's depression-era fable is from a Hindu text called Bhagavad Gita. It takes a rare imagination to transplant a story of Ancient Indian warriors to the golf courses of American South, so it's strange that the same imagination can't free itself from the conventions of classical Hollywood plotting. While the film is always entertaining, the story it tells is never less than 100% predictable. This same can be said of many movies, but BAGGER VANCE appears to hold itself out as something different, as if it's going to offer something new and sort-of meaningful when really all it's doing is rehashing the increasingly tired 'sport as a metaphor for life' theme.<br/><br/>Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon), once a hotshot teenage golfer, lives in drunken semi-seclusion in his hometown of Savannah after a traumatic experience in the Great War. Junuh is a lost soul, a fact signified by Redford's insistence in obscuring his leading actor's face in shadow for the early scenes. His former girlfriend, Adele Invergordon (the somewhat delicious Charlize Theron) also has troubles: her father committed suicide after the Great Crash wiped out his fortune, leaving her with an expensive white elephant of a golf resort and a mountain of debt. She determines to hold a challenge match between America's two greatest players to raise funds to pay off her debts and, having persuaded/tricked them into taking part in a too-contrived fashion, discovers that the townsfolk won't stand for it unless a local hero also takes part. This is where young Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief), the narrator introduced to us as a dying present-day Jack Lemmon, steps in and suggests Junuh. Naturally Junuh refuses, but then has his mind changed by young Adele stripping to her undies. Trouble is, Junuh has lost his swing, which is where Bagger Vance (Will Smith) makes his entrance, braving the golf balls Junuh is whacking into the night at all angles, and jauntily proclaiming, ""I positioned myself right in front of you, 'cause from the way your swings were going', I figured that was the safest place"". Bagger is a figure of mystery, perhaps guardian angel, perhaps God, literally emerging from the darkness in answer to the apparent cry for help Junuh made when he picked up his golf clubs again<br/><br/>This film is such a slick and glossy example of Hollywood professionalism that at times you find yourself suddenly jettisoned from the story to reflect on how damn slick it all is. The cinematography is at times sublime, offering us rich images of the southern states in the midst of a depression, the worst consequence of which seems to be that young Hardy's father is forced to take a job cleaning the streets. This is the old MGM style of movie-making, a world that bears only a passing resemblance to our own, and in which townsfolk urge a young boy to ""fly with wing-ed sandals on your feet"" as the eager mite dashes off to plead with the town drunk to pick up the sticks once more. It's almost endearing in its way, and if it weren't for the aura of falsity that keeps seeping in and out of the proceedings, it might be something worth shouting about.<br/><br/>A major problem is the casting. Theron is fine in a role that doesn't call for much more than a spunky female who looks good in vibrant 30s costumes, but Damon and Smith are both miscast. Damon's just about the right age to play Junuh, but his pretty boy features simply don't bear the marks of a decade-plus of alcohol-fuelled trauma. Damon is the type of guy who, when he's fifty is going to look like a 25-year-old with wrinkles; at the age of thirty he looks like a twenty-year-old who hasn't even begun to sample life; he's lost us before he even opens his mouth, which is a shame because he's a good actor who brings a lot to his roles. Nevertheless, Damon could just about squeeze by without requiring too much suspension of belief on the part of the viewer, but Smith simply doesn't have a chance. He's easily about twenty-five years too young for the role, and growing a beard doesn't make that much of a difference. All the time I was watching the film I kept thinking of a mature character actor like Morgan Freeman as more suited to the part, and was surprised to discover that Freeman had been Redford's first choice for the role but that he had decided against him in favour of a younger actor. I can understand Redford choosing to stand down as Junuh, but selecting Smith over Freeman just doesn't make sense  unless you're an accountant. That's not to say Smith doesn't give a good performance, in fact he's very good and, after all the no-brainer blockbusters he's appeared in over the past few years you start feeling optimistic about what might be ahead from him, but no actor, no matter how good, could come out on top when called upon to wrestle with some of the truly laughable lines he delivers that are supposed to be laden with deep mystical meaning.<br/><br/>Despite all this, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE kept me interested for the entirety of its long and slowly-paced running time. Redford conjures up some memorable images and manages to revisit themes he has explored a number of times now without the material growing stale. It all harks back to the kind of uplifting fare Hollywood churned out by the truckload back in its Golden Era, which is no bad thing. It's old-fashioned for sure, and shamelessly tries to manipulate the audience at times, but it has such a good-natured heart that, unless you're the deepest of cynics, you'll probably find yourself being drawn in."
"aimless-46","5","3","6","5 July 2004"," Swing and a Miss
","Given the $60 Million budget and the lofty game/life message, it is likely that Robert Redford was striving to achieve a 'cinema classic' with this film. Unfortunately, professionally crafted movies by well-meaning directors with very ambitious goals often fall short. ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" is such a movie. You have to give Redford credit for trying for something extraordinary, but at the end your overriding reaction is that it just didn't work. The upside is that ambitious failures provide excellent opportunities to understand the pitfalls of film-making. While there is little to be learned from failures like Cabin Fever, where little is attempted and even less achieved, a careful analysis of Bagger Vance can be a valuable learning experience. And while analysis can explain why it didn't work, it will not explain why those making the film failed to recognize and correct the elements that ultimately relegate this film to nothing more than a visually interesting period piece. <br/><br/>It is well over two hours long (three on television), and while not much happens it isn't particularly dull. The sets are wonderful, the camera work is first rate, sound is fine, and editing/pacing is more than satisfactory. So why doesn't it work? <br/><br/>SCRIPT-Beware of adapting a storyline that combines the tenuous idea of golf as a metaphor for life with a nostalgic return to the essence of the sport, and then throws in the standard underdog rising to the challenge in the 'big game'. It simply cannot be done in a movie, these three basic elements get in each others' way. Redford failed for the same reason in ""The Natural"" and ""Field of Dreams"" was wise enough to stick to only the first two elements and not incorporate the underdog/big game idea. Another flaw (IMHO anyway) is utilizing historical figures in a serious fictional story. Since the events of the story never happened, why are historical characters like Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen dragged into the plot? <br/><br/>DIRECTING-Redford's weakness as an actor is also his weakness as a director. Just as he has never played a character that we could really believe in and care about (we wanted ""The Sting"" to work but we didn't care what happened to Redford), Redford as a director has never been able to populate his films with real humanity. His focus has always been inanimate detail and mystical reverence. Even Hardy Greaves, the local boy who narrates the story is two-dimensional; which is quite an achievement given the amount of screen time he has and the opportunity afforded by his voice-over narration. <br/><br/>CASTING-Will Smith and Matt Damon are way too young to be even remotely believable as a wise mystic and a burned-out veteran. I'm not sure that Will Smith could even be considered an actor so his age is only a secondary problem. While not physically credible, Damon's actual performance is fine-but many of this scenes are opposite Charlize Theron who (as usual) dominates the screen when paired with relative lightweights like Damon. <br/><br/>Except for the sets and style there is little to get excited about in this film. The only interesting character/performance is Bruce McGill's (remember D-Day in Animal House) portrayal of Walter Hagen (who would have been better of course as a fictional character). McGill puts actual life into this movie, even as it's moronic golf-as-religion theme bogs it down like a golfer who wades too far into a Georgia tide pool."

","SPOILERS ALL OVER IT<br/><br/>Robert Redford has helped cinema by creating the Sundance festival and supporting talented filmmakers. I strongly encourage anyone telling him that he's already done enough.<br/><br/>The movie's argument deals with the internal dilemma of an ex-golfer and war coward who has ""lost his swing"", both in golf and in life, and who is helped by a misterious black caddy named Bagger Vance who gives him a strong piece on advice on how to grab a club, both literally and metaforically speaking again.<br/><br/>The metaphore in the movie is poor and reiterative. The funny touches are really un-funny and so ""I've seen these a million times"". In fact, I've seen absolutely everything in this movie a million times before, and better done. Add to that a conventional storytelling and about one hundred ""unbelieveable swing-- everyone stares, the crowd yells, John Williams-like music sounds while Matt Damon smiles stupidly"" scenes.<br/><br/>And about Matt Damon. He's not really that hell of an actor. I strongly think he's overrated, although he's not bad. Will Smith is not an actor. And Charlize Theron, although she's good, can't hold a movie by herself.

I don't mean 'bad', I mean it's inexcusably hopeless. The story itself is uninteresting, the characters are dull and uninvolving. The direction is uninspired and by-the-numbers. Frequently, this film is so bad it's embarassing - sometimes it feels like a parody. Every time there's anything remotely dramatic, the orchestral score swells up and slow-motion kicks in. It's a film that tries to be about real people and real emotions, but the only place any of this can be considered real life is Hollywood. Every five seconds it keeps reminding you - this is a film. This isn't real. Real people don't act like this. Real people don't feel like this. <br/><br/>This is a film you feel you've watched a hundred times before; that's because you have, it was just called something else. Everything - every last little detail - is a tired, overused cliche. The DVD package describes it as ""an uplifting story about the indestructible human spirt"". Come on!

When he comes back, he is not the same person as he used to be, playing poker instead of golf and drinking heavily. However, when he is invited to take part in a huge golf tournament in Savannah, he finally agrees, accepting the mysterious Bagger Vance (Will Smith) as his 'caddie'. The second hour of the film, we see Junuh compete with two of the biggest golfers in the game for the $10,000 prize.<br/><br/>Calling a film a 'legend' is always pretentious and often out of place, and this dramatic comedy by Robert Redford is no exception. The photography, especially during the golf game, is beautiful and the cast is OK, but the story never really came alive. Some parts of the plots were far too superficial, like the romance between Junuh and Adele and the return of Junuh: when he comes back from the War he is mentally destroyed, but it is never explained why, as if the makers of the film thought that this is already such a horrible cliche that an explanation was unnecessary. Overall, this film never felt like a 'legend'; 'Golf' should have been a better suitable title. But it was entertaining enough to prevent me from rating it lower than 6.<br/><br/>6/10"

He is stiff, not believable, and offers the worst southern accent I've heard since Melanie Griffith. <br/><br/>Why all the worship of this film?

","Only if you like golf should you see this movie!  I am sorry, Mr. Robert Redford, but the story does not do justice to the calibre of your actors.<br/><br/>Fairy tale story about a drunk (forget the World War I connection) who has lost his self-respect and confidence and is ""lost"" for 15 years (Matt Damon as Rannulph Junuh) and beautiful Charlize Theron (Adele Invergordon) who for 15 years still loves Junuh and pines for him when she should have moved on with her life.  Along comes an ""angel"" in the form of Will Smith (as Bagger Vance) who knows all about the golf game and for only ""$5.00 guaranteed"" and the pair of shoes he ""broke in"" becomes the caddy for Junuh and throughout the game ""helps"" him to regain his long lost self-confidence.<br/><br/>""What we have here - is failure to communicate!""  What can you get out of a golf movie?  Players chasing the little white ball from hole to hole.  The predictable ""drama"" of golf balls going into the sand trap, the water trap, the trees, and other common golf hazards routinely associated with the game.<br/><br/>
Where is the drama?  Adele was pursuing her own issues trying to convince Rannulph that he still loves her all the while interfering with the championship match that ""she"" organized and produced.  Did she need to confront him behind the trees on the final round and break his concentration causing Rannulph to land in the sand trap?  No, that's self-defeating.  Did she have real dialog to speak?  No, not worthy of the role she beautifully acted in ""The Devil's Advocate.""<br/><br/>Matt Damon looks manly and the ladies like him.  But, his dialog is weak. He can perform much better than the script he was given.<br/><br/>Will Smith has accepted better challenges.  Essentially, he plays it ""smooth"" and delivers like he was reading narration in a high school English class.  In this script is his mission in life to be the ""angel"" to help wayward and lost Junuh to rediscover himself?  <br/><br/>Who did a great job?  The young J. Michael Moncrief who played young Hardy Greaves.  This first time youthful actor, never before in a movie according to Robert Redford's trailer interview, shows the most emotion and acting ability.  ""First times a charm!""  <br/><br/>Lane Smith needed more to do.  Bruce McGill and Joel Gretsch just played golf and showed professional courtesy to Junuh.  With only three players in the tournament why work harder?<br/><br/>Jack Lemmon was uncredited in this film (WHY?) as he played the Old Hardy Greaves telling the dubbed-over story of that one special moment in his golf life before he, now an old man, walks into the sunset to die on the old golf course he played all his life.  Of course, there's Bagger Vance on the hillside waving him to come ""over to the other side."" <br/><br/>
Life's over! And, so it should be for this film.  I gave it a ""4"" out of respect for the actors who could have made a better performance had they had a different story line and script.  Save the golf stories for tee time on Saturday mornings at your local course!"
"harry-76","6","3","6","1 September 2001"," Sports Metaphors and Mystique
","Robert Redford seems to have a thing about sports.  It's more than just a game to him, but rather some sort of portal seeking the essence of what life has to offer.<br/><br/>In ""Downhill Racer"" (1969) actor Redford engaged the craft of skiing to achieve metaphysical heights; in ""A River Runs Through It"" (1998) director Redford likened the activity of fly fishing to something of a profoundly spiritual nature; now in ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" producer director Redford discovers the secret of overcoming adversity through the challenge of golf an ultimate peak experience.  <br/><br/>While it's pretty hard to fathom where hurling one's self down a ski slope as being akin to a state of grace, or where killing fish enhances one's spirituality, in ""Beggar Vance"" finding one's ""authentic stroke"" makes more sense in aligning it to discovering the secret of mastery.<br/><br/>
The story's idea that seeking perfection in sports can lead to clarifying one's true life values emerges as completely noteworthy.  The mystique of Will Smith's caddy is intriguing from an idealistic perspective; the same goes for Matt Damon's once-promising golfer trying to recapture the skill of his youth--only to find that it must be recreated.<br/><br/>In the case of each of the above films, it helps considerably if the viewer already likes the respective sports. The films themselves don't do an especially great job of winning fans.  It must be said, though, that one may become intrigued at Matt Damon's Rannulph Junnah who, after over a 15-year period of combat fighting in World War I, and thereafter living in seclusion while drinking heavily, still looks like a fresh college junior. The film in this regard seems more like an paean to discovery of the elixir of youth. If you're an avid golfer, or loving spectator, ""Bagger Vance"" might have special meaning. Otherwise, it might be a bit of uneven going.<br/><br/>Smith, Damon and entire cast all give highly creditable performances."

Golf is a sport about things that you cannot portray on the screen and anyone who has played it seriously knows this well. Golf is an internal sport and it is very scientific. Magical characters don't suddenly appear in your head to show you the putting line that twists like a 30 foot boa over the Pyranees. Golf is about spending hours on your own on the putting range. It is a mental sport and if you had an ex-girlfriend chatting in your ear like a parrot while you tried to hit a drive, or a fictional Will Smith uttering maximus excrementia in your other ear just before a 200 yard carry over water you and everyone else on tour would probably shoot a lousy round of golf, perhaps your worst.<br/><br/>This movie illustrates everything that is wrong with Hollywood when it goes bad. It makes up fantasies, and suckles the world's children on them making them believe that heroism and success are merely a figment of the strongest imaginations. If I imagine and focus strongly enough I can simply hit a 3,000 yard drive. What's next Mr. Redford, SpiderMan Joins the Tour?

Since Tiger Woods has transcended the sport and became iconoclastic, my interest in golf has multiplied exponentially.  Toss in a good Canadian prodigy named Mike Weir and I am now hooked on the sport.  I was even fortunate enough to see Tiger and Mike play at Glen Abbey this year where Mike had a difficult weekend and all Tiger did was win the triple crown for only the second time in the history of golf.  It was quite an event.<br/><br/>
Golf is different than any sport, and that is because it is a gentleman's game.  There is a level of integrity and honesty to it.  You are responsible for keeping your own score and you are expected to uphold the rules of the game even when no one is there to govern you.  Could you imagine in hockey if you hooked a man from behind and the ref didn't see it, you then went up to him and said, "" look, I just took down Joe and I deserve two minutes in the box for that?""  Or if in football, you told the ref that you didn't really make the catch, that the ball touched the ground first?  It is unheard of.  But not in golf.  Not only is it your responsibility, it is your oath to do so, because if one wins the game of golf without integrity, then one is not a real man.  I realize how surreal that sounds, but it is so true.  Your victory would be tarnished and that would stay etched in your mind forever.  That is one of ( but certainly not the only ) the beauties of golf.  Such is one of the themes of this film.  Golf is the back drop and it deals with issues such as these but it is a film about much more.<br/><br/>Critics have criticized the film for being too shallow and not containing enough substance, but I vehemently disagree.  You have to look for what this is about at times, but believe me it is there.  Will Smith plays Bagger Vance in by far his most in depth performance.  Smith is known more for his comedic roles and his propensity for box office success where as Matt Damon has had success box office wise as well, but not nearly the kind that Will has.  Yet he is known more for his great layered performances in films like Good Will Hunting and The Talented Mr. Ripley.  However, in Bagger Vance, Smith steals every scene he is in with Damon.  This is a performance that is worthy of an Oscar nod as best supporting actor thus far.  He is that good.<br/><br/>Bagger Vance is a character that comes into Rannulph Junnah's ( Damon ) life just as he's entered into a golf tournament against the two best golfers of their era, Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones.  Junnah was once a revered golfer but then went to WWII and came back a scarred man.  He never regained his swing and now he flounders in a sea of confusion and drinks his life away. He is given this one chance at greatness again because of a young boy's belief in him.  <br/><br/>The town is sponsoring a $10,000 dollar golf tournament in the middle of the Great Depression but it will only back it if one of their home grown talents will compete.  Hardy Greaves is a young boy of maybe 12, and he remembers when Junnah was the best golfer the south had ever known.  He tells the mayor and all the other town folk that he can get Junnah to play.  He doesn't disappoint.  He convinces Junnah that he can get his swing back again, with a little practise.  One night as Junnah is attempting in vain to regain his stroke, Bagger Vance comes walking into his life out what seems to be nowhere.  Somehow a conversation is started and Bagger Vance ends up being Junnah's caddy for the big match.  Now where did this man come from? How did he get here and why is here?  These questions are never answered but most people that I know and have talked to about the film think he is a guardian angel of sorts.  Was he sent here just so Junnah could regain his stroke?  Perhaps.  Maybe God really does love golf that much.  But maybe he was sent here not only to help Junnah with his game, but to help him with his life.  Golf is like the art of Zen to some people and in here it is spoken of in the same reverence.  If Junnah is to regain all that he once was, he is going to have to get rid of all his inner demons.  And sometimes inner demons are a bitch to ostracize.<br/><br/>Bagger Vance is very laconic in his approach to things.  He only says what needs to be said and the rest has to be learned.  In all of the teachings about golf that are preached about in this film, the same can be said for life in general.  This film captured me and filled me with a sense of....life.  It did to me what American Beauty did in some ways.  It is one of the best films to come out this year and it is steeped with rich and wonderful performances.  This should go down in the annals of film as one of the best sports films ever made.  And of course Will Smith is wonderful.  I really think he will be looked upon differently in some circles after people see what he is capable of.<br/><br/>But more importantly, this film taught me something about sport, golf in particular, but sports in general.  Even though Tiger has changed golf and there is a bit of swagger to it now with 5 million dollar purses and such, just take a minute sometime to take it all in.  Golf really is different than anything else.  In days when soccer fans are rabid enough to kill each other, hockey has people like Marty McSorley and one of the Niedermeyer boys head hunting with their sticks, football players celebrating voraciously and classlessly by slicing their throats with an imaginary knife, basketball players trash talking each other to the point of verboseness and the list can go on and on.  Fans of these sports can become rabid with their cataclysmic fanaticism and yet you watch the gallery in golf and you get a perspective of what it is all about.  When a golfer is about to take a shot, there is utter silence.  No one wants to disrespect any player, whether his name is Tiger Woods or a guy that is just hoping to qualify for Q-school. You have fans that will not touch a golfer's ball when it goes out of bounds, they all understand the integrity of the sport.  Then there are the players.  They play side by side and wish each other well.  They want to play the game to the best of their ability but not at the expense of someone's integrity.  Player's respect one another, that can not be said in any other sport, not on the same level as golf.  As Bagger Vance says in the film, ""Golf is a game that can never be won, only played.""  Words to live by. <br/><br/>9 out of 10.  This is one of the films to see this year.  Look for it to get some well deserved notirity in March."

After I saw this movie, I thought to myself ""what was the point of it?"". Some golfer who's good goes to war and comes back a pathetic drunk. He's not good at swinging a club anymore so he swings a bottle, gets a weird caddy to teach him and suddenly he's a good golfer and wins a tournament. Thats pretty much it.

"paul-nemecek","9","2","4","8 July 2018"," Great mythmaking
","The Legend of Bagger Vance is about golf in the same way that Field of Dreams was about baseball--that is, hardly at all. This film has the mystic symbolism of Field of Dreams, the sense of time and place of A River Runs Through It, and the triumph of spirit that is at the center of most of my favorite films. It might be an accident that the number of holes played in this epic showdown is about the same as the number of years we get in the big game (on average), but this film is quite clearly about the game of life.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Rannulph Junuh, a promising golfer from Savannah whose prodigious career is interrupted, and ultimately diverted, by World War I. He comes back from the war changed, and neglects both his game and his girl as he attempts to drown his sorrows by killing off brain cells little by little. When the Great Depression hits, the whole town of Savannah is devastated and Adele attempts to save the family estate by staging an epic golf match on the golf course her father had designed. The two greatest golfers of the time are enticed to play in the epic, but the town wants Junuh in the game too, to represent Savannah. <br/><br/>Young Hardy Greaves has been a fan of Junuh's almost since birth and Hardy does his best to convince Junuh to enter the fray. When Hardy fails, Adele also tries and also fails, but then Junuh meets Bagger Vance--caddy, wisdom teacher, and philosopher extraodinaire. To say much more about the relationship that develops would be to give away too much of the suspense that propels the story forward. Suffice it to say that Will Smith's portrayal of Bagger Vance is an intriguing mix of Cheech Marin in Tin Cup and Obi Wan Kanobi in Star Wars.<br/><br/>It is the mythic dimension that makes this a satisfying film. Like two of his previous films (The Horse Whisperer and A River Runs Through It), this film is best when viewed as myth and metaphor. The brilliant cinematography by Michael Ballhaus contributes to the mythic feel of the film. If there is a flaw in the film it is a relatively minor one. As in A River Runs Through It, director Redford chose to tell this story as one long flashback using extensive voice-over narration. Especially in the beginning of the film, I found this to be intrusive and a bit distracting.<br/><br/>Aside from this minor flaw, this is a wonderful film about grace and redemption, with rich images and refreshing themes. As I left the theater I ran into an acquaintance who is an avid golfer. He said, ""I've played courses just like that one."" I don't golf at all, so it is a real tribute to the mythic qualities of the film that I was able to walk away saying to myself ""me too, me too."""

","I just saw this movie again for the first time since it was first released and there is only one thing that has bothered me since that first viewing: Will Smith as Bagger is too young. I know he was a hot actor when the movie was made but the part cries for Danny Glover or Morgan Freeman. A little age on the character would have made the wisdom and witticisms work. As it is, Bagger just comes across as a vaudeville act, rather than a vagrant that has seen the wear and tear of life, including the downtrodden world that a black man would have experienced at that point in time. America in the 20's was not that far removed from the slave days and the reflections on long gone relatives and friends would have worked with middle age as a bridge. Great part, just not enough mileage on the actor."
"Movie-12","7","5","17","14 February 2001"," Great direction, passionate style, beautiful photography, but a week story. *** (out of four)
","THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE / (2000) *** (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French: 	 	Robert Redford almost always brings a gentle style of passion and hope to his movies, and ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" is a great example of how he does it. This film's tone, mood, and atmosphere are dreamlike in appearance and the flavor of the film is assuring and inspiring. Many directors would be tempted to fall into the predictable formula of a typical sports movie, but not Redford. He constructs a delicate, refreshing story not just about winning a golf tournament, but about being happy with what you do best. It has subplots involving love, age, death, anger, war, forgiveness, innocence, and eternity, but mostly compares the game of golf with life itself.<br/><br/>
	""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" starts with a brilliant, masterful setup only to slowly run into conflicts in the second act. The story revolves around a somewhat complex character named Rannulph Junuh, played wonderfully by Matt Damon. During the 1910's this individual held the record of greatest amateur golfer in the Southeast, and also the luckiest man when he won the affection of Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron), the luxurious daughter of the wealthiest man in Savanna Georgia. Now, however, after suffering the horrors of World War II, Junuh is disillusioned, depressed, and only cares about getting drunk and playing poker with his buddies.<br/><br/>	Meanwhile, the great depression strikes, Adale's distressed father commits suicide, and she is left with a failed newly opened oceanfront golf resort and a pile of debts. Pressured to sell the property to pay off her many bills, Adale refuses and comes up with an idea to attract attention to the golf course. She nearly puts everything she owns up for a ten thousand dollar exhibition match with two of the world's best golfers. They are Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill), a chubby ladies man, and Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch), a suave, sophisticated family man. However, the Savanna locals will not allow the tournament unless there are three players participating. Ten-year old Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief) invites Junuh into the match. While refusal is his first reaction, after meeting a poor black man named Bagger Vance (Will Smith) who offers to be his caddie, Junuh decides to represent Savanna in the tournament.<br/><br/>	The plotis sweeping and beautiful up until the second act, where the script becomes desperate and redundant. Junuh begins the tournament on a losing streak, an easy and lazy way of raising the tension level in this kind of movie. Good old Bagger Vance pulls Junuh out of the water, however, and gets his game back to par. Then the movie makes its biggest mistake. It again attempts to increase the amount of tension in the audience by once again making Junuh fall behind. The first time the story exhibits this material we buy into it, but the second we are tired of such contrivances. The movie tries to make up for its mistake by portraying the idea that how the game is won is more important than who wins, but that does not make up for such a major screenplay miscalculation. <br/><br/>	The rest of the movie is stirring and avoids the usual clichés. The filmmakers could have sketched Junuh's competing gofers as hard-edged, one-dimensional plot devices to build tension in the story. Junuh's relationship with Adele is not mushy and erotic but realistic and passionate. Robert Redford put considerable effort into taking each plot point only so far. The only variable limitless here is the grand photography by Michael Ballhaus. He makes the golf course look like an endless pathway to heaven, and recreates the experience all golfers feel as they walk up to the first and last hole during a perfect summer afternoon.<br/><br/>
	""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" is not a great movie because of its often week plot, but the movie is so magnificently directed, photographed, and acted that it is able to go beyond the boundaries of an undeserving script and still manage to succeed. I recommend the film, but think with a better story, ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" could have been one of the year's most poignant and tactful films."

","I heard about this film a couple of times when it at the cinemas, and I suppose I did really want to see it for the leading actor, but to be honest it wasn't fantastic. To be honest, it wasn't as good as I'd hoped that I can't remember much of the story, apart from the basics. It is the 1930s, Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) is a war veteran who starts playing golf, but is a little rubbish. Soon though his skill is improved by his friendly and mystical caddy Bagger Vance (Will Smith). That's pretty much it. The rest of the film that I do remember is some slightly gripping golf games, a gorgeous Charlize Theron as Adele Invergordon, narration by Jack Lemmon (also playing Old Hardy Greaves), and it's directed by Robert Redford (The Horse Whisperer). Also starring Bruce McGill as Walter Hagen, Joel Gretsch as Bobby Jones, J. Michael Moncrief as Hardy Greaves and Lane Smith as Grantland Rice. I doubt I would want to see it again, even if I can't remember it. Worth watching, at least once!"

The superb acting, the outstanding soundtrack, and the story itself combine to move the viewer's heart and soul and lead them to what could easily be a new perspective on how life should be lived. To see how the main character starts at the height of society, then makes the dive to the ""black night of the soul,"" and then is further badgered by life itself to come back up and seize his ""authentic"" self by the society he once led makes for an invigorating tale.

","This movie is about a mystical black man named Bagger Vance who shows up one day to teach Matt Damon (wounded slightly in WWI) how to be good at golf again.  We all learn a valuable lesson about golf as a metaphor for life. The End.<br/><br/>Really the only good thing I have to say about this movie is that it is beautifully shot.  Some of the sunset shots simply must be required in any prestigious film studies class.  There are a few other camera tricks Redford uses to fully showcase the splendor of the Georgia sea coast, and they make you wish you were really there.<br/><br/>However, everything else about this movie was garbage.  I mean, it is simply a 'Field of Dreams' type mystical film set to golf instead of baseball, but whereas baseball does indeed have a legitimate legendary and mythical status in the American mind, golf is just a rich white man's game played in one's ugliest clothes.  Golf will never have the stature and love that baseball does, even if more people play golf nowadays.  It is a good game (I am not here merely to bash golf) but it is still a game and not a sport.<br/><br/>
**Possible Spoilers Ahead** This movie is very implausible (if you can extract yourself from the ultra-manipulative filming style) and would be a good fantasy tale if it were not loosely based upon well-known history.  This film takes place sometime in the 1920's, if I am not mistaken, a time when absolutely no black people (i.e. Vance) would have been tolerated on a golf course in Massachusetts, much less a southern state like Georgia.  Of course, he doesn't actually play golf in this film, but appears to know more about it than anyone else.  Maybe his wisdom came from observing people he wasn't allowed to associate with playing a game he wasn't allowed to play, through binoculars since he wasn't allowed anywhere near the place.  Now, Bagger Vance was portrayed as a bit of a simpleton, but why would he go to the trouble of learning so much about a game when all he could possibly do with his knowledge is to have the honor of serving as a white man's caddy? Lofty goals, my friends, lofty goals. There are a few other cliched plot devices (the little white kid who looks up to Matt Damon, the hot-and-bothered southern belle love interest). Putting the southern belle aside (I know that big budget movies need love interests as part of some commandment of movie-making) what is with that kid?  How many ten year old boys do you know who are absolutely nuts about golf and who weren't born into wealth and privilege?  When I was ten, I was into baseball and hockey and football, and so was everyone I knew.  Golf was something our fathers played, and they weren't even that crazy about the game.<br/><br/>Bad performances all around (except from Bruce McGill, who can always be counted upon to ham it up with the best):  Matt Damon plays himself yet again, Charlize Theron is just here for scenery, the kid is chirpy and annoying, and Will Smith plays one of the more offensive black stereotypes in recent film history (he usually plays the wisecracking black stereotype, but here it is much more Uncle Remus offensive, I was wondering why more black people didn't slam this film but then I'd be really surpised if a single black person even saw it in the first place).  Really, all Vance does is grin sheepishly and dispense little pearls of wisdom that will make Damon not only a better golfer but a better human being (""Yassuh!! No Suh!!! You mus' be da ball, massuh Damon!!!).<br/><br/>Sadly, Robert Redford did indeed attempt to do for golf what Field of Dreams did for baseball, and failed miserably on every count.  Great scenery, though."

I cannot fathom how a movie of this quality, directed by Robert Redford, starring Will Smith, Matt Damon and Charlize Theron got great reviews, and yet it failed to draw much of a crowd.<br/><br/>I've said earlier in the thread, I prefer it when Smith is actually acting, instead of just playing versions of his public persona. This is no different. I remember taking my 8 year old son (who was a huge Will Smith fan back then) to see this at the cinema on opening day, and it was only half full. After I had watched it, I was telling a friend how wonderful it was, and he replied ""I don't like Will Smith, I hate Matt Damon and I can't stand golf!! So you have no chance of getting me to watch that!!"" His loss. As it is a brilliant movie, filled with excellent performances. Even my son, used to such movies as Independence Day and Men In Black from Will Smith loved it. He used to silently sit watching this movie all the time.<br/><br/>Although the basis of the movie is around a golf tournament, it's not really about that. For me, certainly isn't about who wins the tournament. It is more about the characters and the journey they take.<br/><br/>This is why I love movies. I'd rather watch a movie like this, than most things released these days. No CGI, no gimmicks, no superhero's, no shared universe and no eyes on a potential franchise. Just one movie, with some great acting, that is well directed, beautifully shot and tells a well crafted and well told story. I'd go so far to say Smith is so good, he should have been nominated for an Oscar. He got a few nominations of smaller awards, but was over looked for the big ones. Matt Damon is very likable, and is easy to root for, Charline Theron was fine, J. Michael Moncrief is great as Hardy. Child actors are so hard to cast right. Bruce McGill and Joel Gretsch are perfectly cast as rival golfers. Lane Smith is a joy like always and I love Jack Lemmon's voice over. <br/><br/>Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus creates some beautiful images, accompanied by a beautiful score by Rachel Portman.<br/><br/>I recommend everyone watch this wonderful, heartwarming movie. <br/><br/>The Legend Of Bagger Vance grossed $30 million at the domestic box office to end the year the 82 highest grossing movie of 2000. To put it in to context of how poorly this movie performed. The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas and a rerelease of The Exorcist grossed more. America should hang its head in shame."

This time it's golf.<br/><br/>The story begins with an elderly man (Jack Lemmon) having a heart attack while playing golf. Lying on the ground, he talks about his love of golf and tells a story set in the post-World War I era.<br/><br/>In Savannah, there was a promising young golfer, Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) who went to fight in WW I and saw his entire battalion killed, except for him. He disappears, and does not return to Savannah for 15 years, and now spends his time drinking and playing cards. His old girlfriend Adele (Charlize Theron), never heard from him and has moved on with her life.<br/><br/>Adele's father has died, and left her a fabulous resort area but no one can afford to visit these days of the Depression. But Adele knows there are still people with money out there. She decides to sell everything she owns and have a golf tournament between Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen (Joel Gretsch and Bruce McGill) with the prize being $10,000.<br/><br/>Her board agrees but they want someone from Savannah to participate. A young boy, Hardy Greaves, who idolizes Rannulph, wants him to play and is in fact present when Adele tries to seduce Rannulph into playing. Eventually he gives in. But he finds he can't swing anymore.<br/><br/>One night while practicing his swing in the dark, a vagrant named Bagger Vance (Will Smith) approaches him and offers to be his caddie for $5. What he shows Rannulph goes beyond his golf swing - it shows him to get through any challenge in life.<br/><br/>This is a Field of Dreams type of film, and it's wonderful. It's about letting go of pain and learning who you are and what you can achieve, no matter the knocks you take in life. It's not only beautifully photographed but well directed and well acted.<br/><br/>Will Smith is fantastic as the easygoing Bagger, his eyes and smile carrying the secret to life as he guides Rannulph. Charlize Theron has an outrageous southern accent, but she's very likable and beautiful. Matt Damon as Rannulph is a man burdened by the past, frustrated by the present, but with a winning smile who finally realizes he has to go for it.<br/><br/>I have two problems with this film: One is, don't tell me Bobby Jones was that good-looking; and secondly, The Public Enemy, shown on a theater marquee, was released in 1931. Bobby Jones' last game, which he tells Rannulph this game will be, was in 1930.<br/><br/>I thought the end was beautiful, particularly because this was Jack Lemmon's last film.<br/><br/>I guess I don't understand a lot of the criticism about the movie being embarrassing. Perhaps I'm not as politically correct as I should be. I still thought it was a great movie."

Charlize Theron is good as the love interest and it works. The kid who inspires and believes in him adds so much to the story. And Jack Lemon as the old man (who was the kid as a youngster) gives the story depth. It inspires a love of the game of golf even in those who previously hadn't found it very interesting. It's a wonderful history lesson about the game and since I first saw this movie I began to enjoy watching golf on TV. I may even attend one of the big tournaments one of these days.

","Robert Redford directed this adaptation of a novel by Steven Pressfield that uses golf as a metaphor for one man's spiritual and philosophical journeys in The Legend of Bagger Vance.The movie features Will Smith, Matt Damon and Charlize Theron. It is based on the 1995 book of the same title by Steven Pressfield and takes place in the U.S. state of Georgia in 1931. <br/><br/>Rannulph Junuh was a gifted amateur golfer from Savannah until traumatic experiences during World War I shattered his confidence and sent him into a spiral of alcoholism. In 1931, Adele Invergordon, a beautiful heiress who once loved Junuh, inherits a spectacular but financially ailing golf course after the suicide of her father. To attract customers, she proposed a high-stakes match between the two most famous golfers of the day, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen.Local businessmen sponsoring the match insist that a local golfer be added to the card, and Junuh is drafted for the position, but it soon becomes obvious that his game is just a shadow of its former glory. When things seem hopeless, a mysterious gentleman named Bagger Vance volunteers to serve as Junuh's caddy and coach, using a mixture of ancient wisdom and past- life knowledge to help Junah ""remember"" the swing he's lost. Jack Lemmon,in his final film,provides narration in the movie.<br/><br/>Although a lot of the critics hated the film due to the performances are hindered by an inadequate screenplay full of flat characters and bad dialogue as well as how it glosses over issues of racism,it manages to be a good view.Will Smith shows skill and subtlety in his ludicrous role as Bagger Vance. With regards to the production design,the visuals were superior as well.Although it may turn off some viewers,this is still an above average film as the talent involved makes this material worth the viewer's time for entertainment and satisfaction."

","""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" - A Film Review by 'Young Angry White Man' (Negative, Very Minor Spoilers)<br/><br/>Golf, not unlike the Legend of Bagger Vance, sucks. Let's face it golf as a sport, as a form of recreation, and as a premise for a movie just doesn't quite register (Happy Gilmore respectfully excluded).<br/><br/>Sure most of us are caught up in Tiger mania but honestly before our favorite calablasian entered the scene and started tearing up the greens no one, not even Nike or ABC, really cared about golf. So when Will Smith talks about golf being the greatest sport ever, in the midst of football season no less, I can't help but choke back my disgust and try not to spill my bile on the floor.<br/><br/>But enough of my disgust about that pseudo sport...What's the movie about? Well this movie is about golf. The movie is also about Matt Damon. Damon, who plays a white man, not just any white man but a southern white man seems to have lost his ability to hit a golf ball after returning home from World War I is struggling with his personal demons.<br/><br/>Things aren't really going all that well with Damon, we know this because the director shows us that he hangs out with black people and drinks a lot, until Will Smith comes along.<br/><br/>While Matt Damon does one hell of a job playing a white man it is Will Smith who manages to steal the show by playing a Negro. Not his usual shtick as the ultra cool Negro, but a spiritual Negro.<br/><br/>Since black actors are only allowed to play the roles of comedian, ultra cool guy who says funny things, ignorant but yet spiritual guy, or the meaningless position of authority (i.e. Judge, police sergeant, DA), it appears Smith has one more role to achieve before he completes his career grand slam - shame Hollywood doesn't give black actors better quality roles.<br/><br/>Bagger Vance (Will Smith) is Matt Damon's caddie and though Bagger may not be able to follow subject/verb agreement he sure knows about the sport of golf. He knows so much about golf one asks him why isn't he playing? Could it be because he's a black man in the Deep South during the great depression? Or maybe because Bagger isn't really a caddie but a sage who preaches about life and golf is just one clever metaphor - Naw because that's just plain stupid to try and correlate how life is like a golf course. Not just stupid but insulting since golf is perhaps the most elitist sport out there today. Have you ever tried to purchase some clubs? I could buy what's left of Alonzo Mourning's liver for the price of new clubs. I will give the director the benefit of the doubt that his movie isn't about life being nothing more than a golf course since the only brothers other than Tiger who are on the golf course aren't swinging the clubs.<br/><br/>Will Smith's stellar role is very reminiscent of Michael Clarke Duncan's outstanding performance in the Green Mile (who by the way is playing in Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes). How he didn't win an Oscar for that ""Take my hand"" line is beyond me. Of course that is neither here nor there.<br/><br/>As with all popcorn movies, and that is exactly what this movie is, the hero rises and falls only to rise again. So if your into clichéd swill about black caddies who take a back seat to white men and their women then this is the flick for you...but if you got better things to do with your money then sit through this garbage go see Bamboozled and educate your self."
"bob the moo","Null","2","9","17 August 2005"," Overly sentimental and needlessly mystical guff that no amount of professional polish can minimise
","The depression hit the south hard, particularly John Invergordon who commits suicide and leaves his estate (and debts) behind to his daughter Adele. She refuses to let her father's golf course be sold off cheap and decides to organise a high stakes golf tournament between the leading players of the day. However the would-be buyers of the course argue that it should not happen because Savannah is not represented; but a young boy volunteers golfer Rannulph Junuh and the crowd take it up. However Junuh is knackered  he had a very bad war and has lost all ability he once had, although he knows he should step up to the tournament.<br/><br/>The terrestrial television premier of most big films in the UK is usually an event and it is only after multiple screenings that see it gradually slip into being filler material in less key timeslots. So with this film I should have smelled a rat with the fact that it premiered on a normal Friday afternoon  far from being the prime slot that the names involved would suggest it deserves. However bookended with two sentimental TV movies seems a pretty fair place for it to be resting given that it essentially a mushy piece of fluff that will mainly appeal to those that like that sort of stuff. The story is told as a memory, which only serves to make the mush and the sentiment easier to produce (not a good thing) and it does it in spades  a fact not helped by the very slow pace that the whole thing is delivered by. I can forgive it being corny if it doesn't take itself too seriously but my god but it does; line upon line of dialogue are written like scripture and as if they have deep meanings  this stops it being fun or light and just makes it come off as pretentious.<br/><br/>Of course it is still watchable despite this  just. Mainly this is down to the very polished product that it is, although this only manages to partially cover the cracks rather than actually manage to reduce them. This professionalism can be seen in the classy direction but, despite this I did always hope that Redford would put as much into the story and the characters as he did the looks. Without help the cast struggle. Damon cannot do much with his character that look pained occasionally because the war experience is really simplified and never personal or real. However his character looks like it was crafted in detail compared to Bagger Vance and Smith can do nothing with that. At best he just turns on the charm and hopes that he doesn't choke on the amount of corn he has to say  he nearly does it but not quite. Outside of this it also requires a forgiving viewer to ignore that whole Uncle Tom aspect of it and the fact that, in this film, racism does not exist and this stops the period being real. Theron is OK but has little to do while support from McGill and a few others add some degree of class if not substance. I don't care what anyone says, Moncrief was pretty poor, a standard ""cute kid"" from start to finish.<br/><br/>Overall this is a polished film but it has nothing beyond cheap mush, sentiment and guff that often borders on the pretentious. It fits the daytime schedules well but doesn't deserve any more than that. The cast all struggle with the lack of substance and with this failing it doesn't really matter how many polished shots and swelling musical moments are used because many viewers will simply struggle to care."
"Easygoer10","8","1","3","28 May 2019"," A Very Good Film
","I like this film, even with all it's golf goofs and the like. There are some real truths, but overall you must remember this is a fantasy film. The casting is quite good; especially Charlize Theron, Matt Damon and Will Smith is brilliant. Joel Gretsch is just right as Bobby Jones. The supporting cast is very good. The only person who I thought was odd is Bruce McGill, who is supposed to be a ""ladies man"". That is 1 thing McGill isn't. Although he has good dialogue and is a truly fine actor, he is simply wrong for this role. I can think of a dozen actors who would have been better. Overall, however, it is a feel good film. I also like ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" (2005) is a true story; with Stephen Dillane, Shia LaBeouf and Elias Koteas. It has some flaws as well, but works quite well. Dillane is excellent as Harry Vardon.
The best golf film, for me, is ""Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius"" (2004), with Jim Caveziel in the lead, Claire Forlani and a slew of excellent supporting actors, like Malcom McDowell in a (rare) protagonistic role along with Jeremy Northam, who is truly brilliant as Walter Hagen, plus Aiden Quinn as Harry Vardon. So enjoy; all 3 films have their moments."

","To start off, I have NEVER written a review before. This movie, however, was honestly SO much more than I expected I could not help but write one -- and I truly believe this is a movie everyone should see. This movie is inspiring and speaks millions to overcoming the adversities of life. Just as golf is a game, so is life -- to some extent -- and cannot be won, but merely played.<br/><br/>People that didn't like this movie obviously didn't think deep enough to realize how symbolic it truly is. Having had some rough patches in life myself this movie spoke deeply to me as I'm sure it will to many who see it. Don't pass on this movie by its lower rating. I'm generally a person who only watches movies 7 and up, but I am so glad I chose to watch this. <br/><br/>I RARELY give movies a 10/10. I'm telling you though -- this movie deserves it."
"tylern2009","10","1","3","13 January 2012"," My Favorite and one of the most underrated and undervalued movies of all time
","This movie is the best of the best. Many will disagree but for me, its my favorite movie of all time behind the dark knight and the lord of the rings trilogy. This movie grasps the essence of film making as an art form. In other words, great and beautiful cinematography. <br/><br/>When people first judge this movie they will probably see it as just your normal sports movie and in this case its golf. I am a golfer but you can absolutely hate golf and still enjoy this movie. Being a golfer really only helps with the technicalities of the sport, which the movie minimally shows. <br/><br/>The movie is just one big metaphor for someone who is need of faith. In this movie that person is Junah, played by Matt Damon (whos performance is excellent), Junah was one of the highest praised upcoming golfers in the 1920s but after serving in WWI and becoming a war hero, he suffers from memories of battle and has lost his faith in just about anything from his old girlfriend, Adele, played by Charlize Theron (another great performance), his faith in talents, and especially his faith in life, which the movie centers on. <br/><br/>Just when Junah's faith is nearly gone for good while horribly swing golf balls in his backyard, Bagger Vance, played by Will Smith, (greatest actor today and a legendary performance), comes out of nowhere, like an angel(WINK WINK) and immediately tries helping Junah. <br/><br/>This movie is just one big metaphor of an angel who is disguised as a golf caddy and is uplifting the faith of a person in need. Golf is just the format or stage they use to translate this message in a different way. <br/><br/>You know Bagger is an angel because he never receives nearly any of the rewards he should receive after all the help he has given Junah, his spiritually perfect advice (like an angels would be), and at the end there is a clear give away when Hardy(the little boy, the narrator, and the old man in the beginning and end of the film) dies from a heart attack on the golf course and wakes up in heaven(which is still the golf course he was playing on) to see Bagger waving to him in his ageless form. This is also showing that the movie suggest heaven isn't this big epic white scenery of clouds but instead a place that you are the most happy. <br/><br/>I'm not a very religious person but this movie is a religious/spiritual/life experience that is great in all areas from storyline, script,acting, directing, and cinematography. You will be moved after watching this.<br/><br/>So for the people who haven't seen it....watch it. For the people who have but didn't realize the real story behind it...watch it again and my mind blown....and for the people who have watched it and did get the memo....watch it again and still be blown away and entertained like I am every time.<br/><br/>10/10 obviously."

","A wonderful movie inspired by a Indian myth and the love of golfing. It is beautifully filmed not only in the way it portraits the landscape, but also how it portraits the actual act of golfing. You can see very clearly that golf is not just an excuse but a main subject for the creators of the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps that is the reason for that this film for the very first time in my life made me understand the beauty and magic of golf. There is especially one sequence of actual golfing where the movements is so beautiful filmed that I had to see it repeatedly and I still remember it though it was actually some years since I saw it.<br/><br/>The main characters are very well formed. The stranger (who is in fact a god, or at least inspried by a Indian deity) has the carefree playful feel about him as such a person should have.

","This is what a movie should look like; a lot of innocence, a little mischief and just a hint of tragedy. This movie is from the era when Charlize Theron still retained some of her feminine grace and beauty. She looks absolutely stunning. However, Will Smith, as an extremely likable mysterious mentor, stole the movie. All characters are well placed with as much screen-time as it was necessary to keep the pace of the movie while holding on to the attention of the audience.<br/><br/>The best thing about it is despite being a feel-good movie it does not have too many emotionality. Just the amount necessary for the flavour. It did not keep me on the edge of my seat but the time did not just go by but flew like a jet. Bagger Vance is someone who fills a void in all of our lives as we go through our day to day routines looking for someone to tell us whether we are doing it right? If not then how to do it right? Whatever this 'it' might be.<br/><br/>Most American movies teach audience that one can do anything with mere belief, whereas this movie shows that even the best of the best can't do just by self-belief but one needs a proper guidance to believe. You cannot believe a lie and a proper guide shows you the truth and then you choose to believe. That's all this movie is about.<br/><br/>All in all it is definitely feel-good movie especially when you are really feeling down. Don't judge it by your version of science of movie making but judge it for what it is as it is not pretentious. It is what it is. A great movie."

"mcrego","9","1","3","23 March 2009"," A movie about doing the right thing, authentically
","The Legend of Bagger Vance is much more than a film about golf. As a retelling of the Bhagavad Gita, it is about life, responsibility, and overcoming one's personal demons to act--to seize the moment, and to do so with integrity, with authenticity.<br/><br/>In the movie, a troubled hero, Rannulph Junnah (R. Junnah, played by Matt Damon), returns a sole-survivor from the horrors of WWI riddled with doubts and detached from his life. When called to act, in this case, to represent his hometown in a golf tournament, he cannot 'find his swing', or act to his potential. At his moment of trial, a caddy appears, Bagger Vance (played by Will Smith), and leads him through. Bagger Vance shows R. Junnah 'the field'--gives him a vision of who he really can be and what he really can do if he sets aside all the 'would-have's and should-have's and could-have's.' <br/><br/>In the Gita, a troubled hero, Arjuna, is called on to act, but is also riddled with doubts. His charioteer, is none other than the 'beloved one'/Bhagavan, also known as Krishna or God, who shows him the field and purpose of life. In Hindu mythology, Krishna is not the hegemon of western theology, but rather playful and compassionate. Both Will Smith's portrayal of Bagger Vance and Matt Damon's of R. Junnah are delightfully true to the mythical tradition.<br/><br/>Both the Legend of Bagger Vance and the Bhagavad Gita encourage action without reservation and doubt. But the action is not arbitrary, but rather, completely and totally authentic. Bagger Vance teaches Junnah to find his own swing, the one he was born with. And later, Junnah finds a moment of integrity in action unparalleled in any other film. Doing the right thing when the whole world tells you not to is when authentic action truly matters."

","First, I loved this movie. The themes are rather timeless, really - redemption, mystery, fair play, doing the right thing - it's all there.<br/><br/>But there were a few snafus that confuse me. The main one is this: the narrator (Jack Lemmon) collapses, tells his story, then walks into the sunset on the golf course. Except this is in S. GA or S. Carolina. Sun doesn't set in the EAST, I can't think that any of the islands off the coast of GA are that far off the mainland that you can see a sunset over never-ending water, but maybe I'm wrong. So, what WAS that supposed to be? I guess the filmmakers are so used to S. CA that they figured viewers wouldn't notice. It's just a small thing that's bugged me from the get-go."

","A truly inspiring story about a talented golfer battling his past demons. Will Smith is on top of his game with this performance as the mythical figure ""Bagger Vance"" who poses as Rannulph Junuhs (Damon) caddy. Matt Damons golf and acting skills are what prevent me from giving this movie a much higher grade. I need this main character to retain some golf skill to at least make his character believable on the introductory level and Damon fails right off the bat during the first ball hitting scene. Joel Gretsch's abilities as a golfer (Bobby Jones)and actor would have been better suited to take over this lead role and make it a truly believable story.(But Damon packs them in the house) As far as golf stories it ranks among the tops of all time. Pitting two of the games legends, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen against an unlikely but heralded local opponent, Rannulph Junuh. Charlize Theron, I believe, is at her peak of starlet beauty in this movie. She overpowers the screen with a presence of only the biggest stars of Hollywood past.

"JZeth","7","1","3","15 April 2006"," It was THIS close
","The Legend of Bagger Vance is one of the most difficult movies to evaluate that I've yet come across. Permit me to get this out of the way immediately: I promise that you will enjoy this movie, unless you come from one of two particular categories:<br/><br/>1. Serious golf fanatics; 2. Serious film-making fanatics. That is to say, if you're the kind that pays as much attention to each shot, how it was arranged, how the script flows, etc., this movie will irritate you.<br/><br/>The movie is headlined by two of the best actors of our generation, Will Smith (Bagger Vance) and Matt Damon (Rannulph Junuh). Junuh is a legendary young golfer who goes off to war, sees his entire company killed, and returns a shattered shell of a man. Brought up by fate (and his old flame, Adele Invergordon) to compete in the greatest golf match ever yet seen against legends Bobby Jones and Walter Hegen, Junuh has to rediscover himself, with the aid of an unlikely source, a young black caddy named Bagger Vance who pops out of nowhere.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has been excellent in nearly every film in which I've seen him, but not this one: Damon clearly is uncomfortable with the role. He shines in a couple particular scenes (most notably his dressing-room talk with young Hardy and his flashbacks to the war) that don't actually involve golf, but overall he isn't very believable as Junuh. This film also, parenthetically, finally made me understand why an actor as talented as Damon has spent his career on the B list and not the A list: He's consistently just about unwatchably bad in romantic scenes and never seems to develop any real chemistry with any actress. It's his one big weakness, and in Hollywood it's a glaring weakness. It shows in The Legend of Bagger Vance, too. <br/><br/>Will Smith -- and here I may diverge from the general opinion -- turns in a fantastic performance as the mysterious Bagger Vance. He carries Damon for a lot of the film and shows off his underrated versatility. Anyone out there who dislikes Smith because you think of him as a loudmouth -- I highly recommend you watch him in this film. He's the black Robin Williams, an extraordinarily talented actor who's cast himself into one too many slapstick comedies.<br/><br/>I would say the biggest thing this film has going for it is the spectacular performance of the supporting cast. Charlize Theron is very believable as Adele Invergordon. J. Michael Moncrief (who?) also dazzles as the young child Hardy Greaves, who idolizes Junuh and serves as his forecaddy for the tournament, and the story is told through the nostalgic eyes and voice of the aged, near-death Hardy Greaves (Jack Lemmon in his final appearance). Joel Gretsch as Bobby Jones and the underrated Bruce McGill as Walter Hegen are tremendous. Gretsch especially is outstanding, managing to provide a very believable rendition of Bobby Jones, who is to this day considered by many the greatest golfer who ever lived (the story is fictional but it makes use of the two greatest golfers of its time; Bobby Jones and Walter Hegen were real golfers.)<br/><br/>Given everything above plus the tremendous story borrowed from the book of the same name, you would think this movie would be a complete home run. It is worth watching and enjoyable, but it isn't everything it could be. It moves the story forward in a herky-jerky fashion, and most notably, we skip almost instantly from Junuh's meeting Bagger Vance to the beginning of the big tournament, which is just disorienting. The tournament itself is very well-done if a little dragged out, and the movie concludes on a very emotional, bittersweet note.<br/><br/>The two things, then, that hold this film back from being a true classic are 1. Its odd, confusing pacing, and 2. Damon, whose performance is subpar but you can never quite put your finger on why. Still, I'll finish where I started: Avoid this film if you're an avid golf nut (as the actual golfing is at times highly unrealistic) or a film nut (as the pacing and some of the script will drive you insane). I like golf and play it often; I like movies and watch them often. I'm fanatical about neither, and I love The Legend of Bagger Vance despite its flaws. If you haven't seen it yet, you won't regret renting it some rainy Friday night."

Great narration by Jack Lemon as I think this was his last film and the story was excellent as most golfers would probably agree. Did that golf tournament actually take place?? Hell, I don't know nor do I care, it was nice to imagine Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen and Junnah golfing together, to take a trip to Savannah and think it did and that Junnah got his swing,courage,faith,honesty and Adele back. While Hardy (Lemon)is called by Angel Bagger(Smith)to join him. Some have complained that the story moved too slow, well it takes place in the 1930's, a much slower time and Golf is a slow game.

","The cast of this movie (Matt Damon, Will Smith and Charlize Theron), are all actors that I think have some level of skill. After seeing the great 'Quiz Show' by the film's director Robert Redford I have to say I had very high expectations of this movie. Well, my expectations were satisfied, although I could not tell you why. In my opinion, this movie is disjointed and clichéd. It constantly confuses the viewer as to who is the main character, it is filled with long, deep and meaningful speeches with emotional music, mystical philosophies and more confusion as to how any of the characters work. Its pacing is quite appalling, it races through the most important part of the movie, then spends much too long on the spiritual and philosophical speeches. The narration gets annoying as it constantly interrupts the story to explain what could have been easily shown by more character time. In fact, apart from the acting, there seems to be very ittle to like about this film. Then why did I enjoy it so much? Like I said, the acting is good, despite the fact that the best actor isn't any of the main actors. It is in fact the young kid, Hardy Greaves (played by J. Michael Moncrief) who steals the show. But I don't think that that was the reason I enjoyed this film. I guess it could have been Will Smith's mysteriousness or maybe the supporting crew, like the old fat men of Savannah, or the maybe it was just the odd comic line that this film has. I am hoping (just as a matter of principle) that it wasn't the obvious feel-good ending, because I like to think that I am no longer affected by the Hollywood combination of an actor acting happy and emotional music, but maybe I am.

","This movie was a straight-up allegory to the Bhagavad Gita, one of the major scriptures of Hinduism.  To give a too-brief summary, it is the teachings of Krishna (a Hindu god) to Arjuna (a warrior) on the battlefield.  Arjuna looks out and sees his cousins on the opposite side, about to fight him, and says he has lost the reason to fight.  Krishna shows him why he must fight.<br/><br/>
Now, another name for Krishna is Bhagavan.  Say ""Bagger Vance"" in a Southern manner (i.e. drop the r) and real quickly.  Sound familiar?  Also, Rannulph (what the hell kind of name is that?) Junuh - if you just use his first initial and last name, it becomes R. Junuh.  Hmmm...<br/><br/>All in all, a pretty good allegory."

","I think I spoil. I just think.<br/><br/>There isn't much sport movies, not much about golf either. There isn't much good films about sport, but this one is different. I really don't like golf, I find it boring, but this film shows a golf in a whole new perspective, in interesting and entertaining way, so I change my mind about it. Really good film with interesting story, amassing acting, picture and directing. Will Smith and Charlize Theron are absolutely superior, but Mat Demon is bad as he always is. He always needs someone to back up on him, to support him, so Will and Charlize did it this time, and they did it extraordinary. More I watch movies with Charlize Theron, more I like her. This is her best performance till now, she was excellent in Cider House Rules too. She is perfect for this part, she is graceful, charming, gentle, ambitious, temperament, beautiful and very very very sexy. It is obvious that Will Smith is great in this kind of role, and that they should giving him it often, radar than stupid roles such as one in Man in black, film also stupid. It is interesting that this film carries a title of non main character Bagger Vance, whom plays Will Smith. I think main character is one that plays Mat Demon, but when you think about it, you realize what importance has Bagger in main character's life. He helps him with golf, what attached him again with his girlfriend, and bring him to life again. I was very amused of directing of this film all through. And in the end when i saw name Robert Redford, I very surprised. How can one actor be so good in directing? I was really amazed. Well done Robert. So, in the end my vote. It is between 7 and 8. This why you need to put 7.5 on your list. Almost every film is worth watching, this one especially.<br/><br/><br/><br/>P.S. Sorry for my English."

","This is a film with a wonderful, potential storyline that gets thoroughly bogged down with poor screenplay and distracting fantasies.  Matt Damon, in the title role, is thoroughly unconvincing as a supposed champion golfer, allowing Joel Gretsch (as Bobby Jones) to completely dominate their shared moments on screen.  Joel, himself, would have been an excellent choice for the lead role.  Will Smith gives his usual competent performance, but is handicapped by a series of fantastic, surreal fantasies that clearly demonstrate the dangers of having non-golfers make films about golf. Perhaps, after a suitable waiting period, this story may be ""rediscovered"" and remade by more competent production and acting teams."

","One of the best golf movies ever. Matt Damon did a great job trying to find that special, authentic swing that everyone has. Will Smith was great. He gave Damon great ideas and showed him if your not in control with yourself, you are not believing yourself. Sometimes, you just have to step back and take a look at the whole picture. Playing with professionals is scary at first, but then, something comes outside of you and you need to perform at the very best. Robert Redford, the director, showed what the game of golf really is.

","Ok, Ok - I realize that (as the title suggests) this film is supposed to be taken as a legend or even a fantasy, and that I should suspend my disbelief and just enjoy the ride. For the most part, I was able to. The script is literate and clever, the cinematography is gorgeous, the kid who plays Hardy is wonderfully natural, Jack Lemmon's voice-over is just folksy enough, Will Smith fits his role like an old broken-in glove, and the Matt/Charlize combo works nicely.<br/><br/>But, my God! - couldn't Robert Redford have found an actor who at least knew how to swing a club? Now I think Matt Damon is a huge talent and a terrific actor, but c'mon - he looked like someone who had never picked up a club, and was then given a crash course just for this film. Later, after seeing the film, I learned that this is just what happened. I'm especially disappointed that Redford would do this, given that he made sure he himself looked quite credible swinging a bat and throwing a ball in ""The Natural"". (Perhaps having nightmarish visions of Anthony Perkins in ""Fear Strikes Out"" gave him added motivation.)<br/><br/>This is so important in films about any popular sport, since most of the audience, from watching the pros and top amateurs on TV, can recognize the form that's needed to play at a high level. Most of today's directors know this, and modern sports films have by and large become a great deal more athletically realistic and credible than sports films of the 40's and 50's, some of which were laughable. But, every so often, one still slips through the cracks. Shame on you, Robert Redford."

","Originally, my only intention of seeing this movie was because the gorgeous Matt Damon stars. Little did  know I would be addicted to watching it till the very end. I'm not a golf fan myself, but seeing as the events of the movie led up to a golf match, I was glued to the screen, waiting to see what would happen. While Will Smith came in toward the middle of the movie, he delivered a serious yet unintentionally funny performance that lit up the screen. Matt Damon, aside from his looks, was well picked for the part of Runnulph Junuh (a strange name- which makes it hard for the viewer to imagine the actor as the charactor and not himself). He played the disillusioned war veteran quite well, although some parts of his performance were weak. Charlize Theron played well, although this wasn't her best performance- her part wasn't too big. But who really surprised me was the narrator, a young boy named Harty who looked up to Junuh. His presence really gave the film a nice touch, and it gave Junuh a little something more to strive for (being a good example.) Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, and I'm waiting till it airs on HBO again to watch it!"

","This was a dreadful movie, incoherent, sentimental, peabrained and subtly racist. But there is one scene that I can't forget, and I wonder if it redeems the rest. The scene has nothing to do with the abysmal plot or the trivial main character. It was when the character Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill almost stole the show in the role) drives off the 18th into the surf. After the others play, the scene switches to him standing barefooted on the sand, in gorgeous twilight, knickers rolled up to his knee, with the over voice ""And then Hagen came back from the dead."" Maybe five seconds long, but pure beauty. The rest of the movie was dreadful, but that was almost worth it."

Redford's mushy direction and Matt Damon's lack of acting ability make this nothing more than a cute, feel good movie.  Will Smith has most of the one-liners, but the real interest in the movie is from newcomer J. Michael Moncrief as the bright-eyed kid.  Gorgeous Charlize Theron is perfectly cast as the tough, stubborn, southern belle, but the script prevents this movie from taking the next step.  Also got tired of Matt Damon making the Redford poses (especially from Great Gatsby days). Note to directors of sport films: we hate poor mechanics on screen from actors playing roles of experts.  Matt Damon's swing looks like a weekend duffer."

Personally, I love golf, but this film made me want to clone myself so that we could both not see this movie.  While Will Smith did an admirable job of filling a role that was obviously written for someone twenty to thirty years his senior, Matt Damon once again proves himself to be a magnificently overrated actor. Robert Redford?  Please, no more directing!  I don't know how many more of those long closeups of the main character's ""soulful eyes"" I can take. Charlize Theron, while an incredibly talented person, has yet to land another role since ""The Devil's Advocate"" that proves it.  Unfortunately, this is no exception."

"TxMike","Null","1","3","3 April 2001"," Marvelous film, but maybe because I'm a golfer and understand the sports metaphor for life.
","CAUTION -- MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO --<br/><br/>To grasp this film one must first understand that it is a legend - "" commonly, a non-historical or unverifiable story handed down by tradition from earlier times."" Thus, this legend, of Bagger Vance, the ""caddy"" may represent a real person, or it may be a mythical person. That isn't terribly important, but what is important is the message that one must find and keep your innate ""swing"", your soul, to be happy. Bagger comes into Junah's life at a critical time simply to help him realize this. The golf match between him and two real golfers, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen, is simply the vehicle for Junah's finding himself.<br/><br/>Junah plays badly, hasn't found ""his swing"" yet, is 12 strokes behind after 18 holes! Bagger gets to him between rounds and gets back 4 strokes in the second 18 that afternoon. The second day was the other 36 holes.<br/><br/>At a critical point, on the last hole of the 72-hole match, as Junah prepares to hit his approach, and is clearing a small twig from near his ball, the ball moves a little. An almost imperceptibility distance. Even his two competitors try to convince him it probably was just an illusion. How Junah handles this situation actually is the climax of the whole story, because as we golfers know, it is the only game where you are expected to call a penalty on yourself. Junah calls the penalty, hits a great approach at dusk in the headlights of surrounding cars. His competitors both 2-putt, and he has to sink his to tie the match which no one expected him to even do well in. He now is ""in the zone"", all the onlookers disappear, he ""sees"" a green path to the hole, and calmly sinks the putt. He has found his swing, his soul.<br/><br/>As we see in the movies first few scenes, Junah had been a teen golf phenom, fought in WW-I, came back jaded and bitter. Spurned his girl (Charlize Theron), began gambling and drinking, went out by lamplight to hit balls after being asked to be in the big match, which was set up to try and save the golf course resort property after Theron's father killed himself because of the depression and the prospect of being financially devastated. As Junah is hitting balls badly, Bagger appears in the mist and begins his mission to help Junah.<br/><br/>Redford has made this story into a very nice film. No doubt, it helps to be a golfer, and it also helps to have already reached that point in life where you've figured out that there is more to sports that ""who wins."""

","If you asked me what subject I would suggest for a period piece, I guess golfing in the Great Depression probably wouldn't have been on my list.<br/><br/>But it was on Robert Redford's list, and this Will Smith/Matt Damon golf-o-rama carries itself pretty well through over two hours.<br/><br/>Rannulph Junuh (Damon) is the town of Savannah's golfing hero, before being drafted to fight in World War One.  Losing his entire platoon doesn't do his mental health any good though, and he returns to Savannah anonymously after being presumed dead 12 years.  His old girlfriend Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron - aaaaaah) has been waiting and isn't one bit happy that Junuh hasn't written.<br/><br/>With me so far? Good.<br/><br/>In order to save the family golf course and prove to the town that her fathers' building of it and subsequent suicide weren't in vain, Adele (Charlize - aaaaaaaah) persuades the two top golfers in the country to play against each other. Junuh is reluctantly made to agree to play in the competition.  He's game's no good though, but things start to improve when a mysterious caddy shows up and shows him the answer to life, the universe, and everything.  Oh, and golf.<br/><br/>Truth be told, my heart sank when Will Smith arrived.  I though he was going to cheapen the movie by lowering it to his fast-talking, joke cracking, streetwise (i.e. usual) style.  However,  he plays the happy-go-lucky Bagger very well; and portrays a character that's easy to believe.  Hard to admit Smith can acutally act. That said however, you never quite get over the fact that this is Will Smith here; it's like watching old Leslie Nielsen movies where he plays serious parts - you're waiting for the joke, and it never comes.<br/><br/>Go see this for something paced a little more toward the American south - i.e. a little more slowly.  Don't expect riotous action or fast-n-furious comedy - but this one will make you smile.<br/><br/>Special mention: Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus gets a free lollipop for some excellent visual work.  Actor B-List Spotters like me will also get a smile - Lane Smith plays - guess what? - a reporter (From The Earth To The Moon, New Superman etc.)."

","Here is another feel-good movie. The major fault is that it's not for kids, and most adults will shy away from it (as they tend to do in general), including and especially women, since most women would find no appeal in watching a golf movie. What a shame. Will Smith was solid as Bagger Vance, and the rest of the cast put in strong performances. Bruce McGill and Joe Gretch were well cast as the Pro's, and Matt Daemon (who normally I am not a huge fan of) worked well as the former whizkid of golf who returns for one more game. I guess if you like sentiment or need a ""feel good"" movie, this is it for you.<br/><br/>For it's genre and focus, it's well executed. My one criticism for it would be it's almost frantic paced, yet at the same time it meanders and goes slow. Because of it's genre and subject, it won't have wide appeal. To be a great movie overall, it needed something else that was lacking. I just can't put my finger on it. Again, it's a good movie for what it is, and I can understand the praise and criticism. Both sides have a lot of truth in what they say about this movie. I must admit, it was relaxing to watch.<br/><br/>
In summary, I would suggest this movie to anyone in search of a feel-good movie, or just would like to ""slow down"" for 90 minutes. Yes, even as frantic as the story moves, it feels slow."

","This movie succeeded as a fantasy even with its shortcomings. The ending was great and only at the very end could a viewer guess how it would come out. Perhaps because I can relate to much of the movie, I can appreciate it more than some. I grew up in the depression. I caddied for Ben Hogan in one tournament. I lost my whole platoon in Korea so I know the depression Captain Rannulph Junuh was experiencing though unlike him I didn't quit though I knew other officers who had the same experience as Junuh just quit. And I have always been a avid golfer.<br/><br/>But the movie had its weaknesses. Captain Junuh gets the Medal of Honor but he didn't do anything in the movie to justify a medal of any kind. Thirteen years elapses between the time he is in combat and when we see him again and we are left with a blank for that period in his life. We are supposed to believe that his wealthy and beautiful fiancé just waits during all this period of time without knowing anything about what's happening to him. In real life she would have married and had children by the time he returned.<br/><br/>And then there is the South in the 1930's and blacks. At that time Savannah was as racist as they came. Bagger Vance, who is a black, would never been allowed to caddy much less even get near white folks. Blacks were not allowed on golf courses then, especially a private course. And Captain Junuh would not have been playing poker or even drinking with black men. Whites, especially white trash, did not socialize at all with blacks although they thought nothing of raping black women.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was rather ordinary but sufficient to tell the story and it was a good story as many myths are so long as the viewer isn't taken in by its lackings and fallacies."

","The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000): Dir: Robert Redford / Cast: Matt Damon, Will Smith, Charlize Theron, Jack Lemmon, Bruce McGill: This film isn't any more about Bagger Vance than Cast Away was about the volleyball. Matt Damon plays a golf pro who hits the ball so hard that the game is paused just to measure its distance. After horrifying experiences at World War 1 he slips out of sight leaving the woman he loved. Will Smith plays mysterious caddy Vance who challenges Damon to play golf against two champions. Charlize Theron arranges the event and uses the money to clear a debt. Visually appealing with great golf footage. Directed by Robert Redford who addressed similar themes in Ordinary People and The Horse Whisper, both of which are so much better than anything assembled here as an excuse for a screenplay. Damon delivers a strong performance as a has-been golfer whose true potential is blurred by alcohol. Smith as Vance is never explained and seen as an underwritten angelic figure. Theron's purpose is to seduce Damon into playing golf and mess with his mind. Jack Lemmon makes his final film appearance as the narrator and Damon's older self. Certainly not the top of the list for Robert Redford who has done better films. It addresses the flaws of self-denial, which can disrupt a person's spirit faster than the screenplay.

Whether for his own sake, or as something to pass on to us less-intellectuals to brighten up our drab existence, who can tell?<br/><br/>It's just sad that all Redford has to give us is lame sports analogies.  At least with The Horse Whisperer there was some positive fallout -- a lot of idiotic horse owners will fall for the brain-dead techniques apparently espoused by Redford and his horse guru, and many of them (and their kids) will be killed when this ""training"" fails at a critical point. They lose....but the gene pool wins!<br/><br/>One can only guess where this boring series of sport-philosophy flicks by Redford will go, but I'm steeling myself for his  next epic brain-expander about bowling or badminton.<br/><br/>Listen, Robert -- it IS possible to mix sports with mysticism and have it work.

","It may be a different movie, but we've seen this all before in a better package called A River Runs Through It. We see the same lavish, dreamy photography heavy with panoramic vistas and rosy figures in the setting sun. The nostalgia of preppy characters, a story line that spans the life of a boy-into-old man character and most unforgivable, this time, the golf swing elevated to the spiritual vehicle instead of fly fishing. Didn't anyone think we would notice? It's one thing to produce more than one study of a concept, like the dysfunctional family. The fact the director had such wonderful success with Ordinary People (1980) took nothing away from his presentation of Norman Maclean's novella, which he handled brilliantly 12 years later. But Bagger comes off looking like a parody of what has been done before, and it's a total bogey on this hole."

","The Legend of Bagger Vance is a charming, unique, and fascinating piece from Robert Redford that has the potential to reach out and touch all of us. It is in my opinion that this movie is perhaps one of the most under-appreciated films to come out of the last few years. In an age where we have become increasingly reliant on fast-paced spoon-fed entertainment, it is rare to find a film that can bring us back to the days of 'ole. Set in 1930 Savannah, Georgia, director Robert Redford along with an amazing cast of Matt Damon, Charlize Theron, and Will Smith, truly remind us of what we have lost by moving head first into the ""information era"". The story brilliant follows the tests that arise when the Great Depression hits the south. When Adele Invergordon (Theron), the daughter of a wealthy landowner, loses her father and risks losing the golf course he worked to create, she decides to host a golf tournament. The tournament becomes a test for the great city of Savannah, as well as everyone involved. As events unfold we see everyone tested in their own way, and we discover the depth and inner torment of each and every character. Through masterful use of metaphor, The Legend of Bagger Vance strikes deep into the core of all of us and inspires hope in a time of great adversity. This movie deserves no less than an 8 out of 10 stars and truly deserves status as a masterpiece."

","This tale hangs on a well-worn peg. An African-American (Smith) acts as coach and mentor to a talented young white man (Damon) who must overcome inner demons.<br/><br/>The game is golf. But Smith, who wanders into Damon's yard out of the night, is something more than a supportive friend. His lines turn him into a Zen master. ""Every man has that perfect swing inside him."" ""You lost your swing but you don't find it -- it finds you."" ""Close your eyes and feel the field."" ""Golf is a game that can't be won, only played."" That last one is a doozie because life has that same quality of course. The last we see of Smith is his silhouette, wandering off, hands in pockets, into a florid sunset. He came like water and like the wind he went.<br/><br/>But Smith has some of the better lines too. In an important match, the Savanna Open or the Atlanta Closed or something, Damon winds up in the sand trap, the ball half buried. He turns to Smith, who is watching dispassionately. ""What do I do now?"" Smith: ""About what?"" The director, Robert Redford, has turned golf into a religious experience. Mystical music play while Damon contemplates the field. It's like watching Ben Hur play golf. And when the little white ball sails through the air, we hear a heavenly chorus.<br/><br/>Golf, despite its sanctity and the imprimatur of St. Andrew himself, has always struck me as absurd. Grown men taking a stick and trying to knock a little ball into a hole in the earth. Take away the sticks, shrink the field, and you'd have a great game of marbles.<br/><br/>Redford doesn't spell out all the technical details although they sometimes crop up willy nilly in the dialog. I never had the slightest idea of what a sand trap had a ""lip"" or what an ""iron"" was. Now I have the slightest idea. You can pick up the argot from the context.<br/><br/>The photography of South Carolina is exquisitely done and the period details are amusing to see. The performances are all professional too. I particularly liked Charlize Theron as one of Damon's demons, the other being his shattering experiences in World War I. Certainly, Theron is beautiful but Hollywood is filled with beautiful women. Theron has rather more than these accidental attributes going for her. For one thing, she is a polished ballerina and can still bust a couple of tough moves. For another, she speaks Afrikaans. Her rosy aereolae may be a bit circumscribed in their extent but she can be forgiven for that. It's curious that her theme line with Damon should be ""I like the way you dance."" In many ways -- in many fundamental ways -- it's a dumb movie, but it's done so well that I hung with it, tensely, until the inevitable outcome of the only golf match the movie shows us."

","I know Americans love their golf, but even as a golf-lover and player myself, it seems to me it is a difficult sport in which to impart cinematic drama and though beautiful to look at, Robert Redford's gentle film treads a little too gently on the grass to really satisfy.<br/><br/>Redford's recreation of the American South is gorgeous if sanitised to the point of caricature. The rich seem too rich and the poor too poor and for another thing there's a distinct lack of the expected good ol' boy prejudice in the air around Will Smith's black caddie. If, as others have suggested, this is down to his character's supernatural influence on everyone, why make him black at all? I wasn't completely convinced by the elusive nature of his Bagger Vance, even as I get the Hindu allusions in his character name and metaphysical impact on Matt Damon's Junuh character as helps him to ""find himself"" at the same time upholding the sportsmanship of the game of golf as it used to be.<br/><br/>I just thought the Zen and the golf made for awkward bed-fellows plus I also thought it wrong to accredit Damon's character with the key moment of sportsmanship in the film (when he calls a foul on himself that no-one else sees) when in real-life this was actually done by Bobby Jones himself, here portrayed merely as one of Junuh's playing partners.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I usually like Matt Damon but felt his ""little-boy-lost"" depiction seemed shallow, ditto Will Smith's beatific Vance while I also Charlize Theron's southern belle character a bit too rich and loud for my taste. <br/><br/>Director Redford's cinematography as indicated is all soft-focus and golden-hued, tributing a by-gone age and there are some nice unobtrusive special effects inserted into the golf match between the two golfing greats and Damon's Junuh, especially the floodlit finale, but for me a golf-ball rolling into a hole just doesn't make for great cinema, unlike say a knockout punch at golf or a home-run hit in baseball.<br/><br/>This is a lovingly made film by all concerned but I think in the end think I might have preferred a couple of hours myself on an actual golf course than cosy up to Redford's just- too-nice fantasy film."

Will Smith as 'Bagger' was good, everyone involved was. Charlize Theron; beautiful, nice accent.

Matt Damon's excellent performance of a man with many inner demons, who hides from others. The other supporting characters around the golf community build on the story and create a positive spirit towards the story's climax of the golf tournament. The director blends an entertaining story with social messages. Can Damon win the golf tournament, and inspire people? Sportsmanship, professionalism, doing the right thing, and having ethics is spun as the characters develop. The Legend of Bagger Vance explains the mystery of the Will Smith's character.

","The Legend of Bagger Vance is the uplifting story of a former pro golfer and war veteran Rannulph Junnuh (played by Matt Damon) who, with the help of an unconventional caddy, tries to rediscover his ""authentic swing."" Directed by critically acclaimed storyteller Robert Redford, this film offers much more than a suspenseful game of golf - though it certainly succeeds in that regard. The heart of the story revolves around ""Captain Junnuh"" as he struggles to regain his dignity and work through his past in the midst of the Great Depression.<br/><br/>The romantic pairing of Matt Damon and Charlize Theron provides a healthy handful of realism, meaning both humor and imperfection in equal doses. Will Smith lends his talent as the mystical Bagger Vance who not only caddies for ""Captain Junnuh,"" but helps him discover what it means to ""play the game"" of life.<br/><br/>What I liked most about this movie is that, while it is played out on a golf course, it goes much deeper than just a sports movie. It is really a deep metaphor for life and how our perspective, choices and integrity (or lack thereof) define the course of our lives. We see, in Junnah, a reflection of ourselves - not a perfect man, but one who is trying his best to work through his challenges one day at a time. If you could use a bit of inspiration with just the right amount of humor, suspense and romance sprinkled in, then you'll probably love The Legend of Bagger Vance."

Is he a bit young to be a guru to anybody? Maybe, but I find him utterly convincing and as the film reveals, it's not really ultimately important how that character looks. If anything, I think it adds more strength to the story by not giving that role to someone like Morgan Freeman and for the 1930's South, a black man caddying for a white golfer is fairly reasonable. And I think Damon does a good job of conveying his inner turmoil without saying too much. Anyone who has ever had a crisis of self can relate to this film, I think.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the film or ending, I will just say that if you like movies about people overcoming adversity and putting their burdens behind them, it's a quality film for you."

However he returns from WWI broken and disappears. Adele moves on with her father's business to build a golf course in 1928. She finds Rannulph return to town but a year later, the great depression hit. The golf course is complete but the financial strain drive Adele's father to suicide. Adele struggles to keep the golf course open by organizing an exhibition between Bobby Jone (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill) for a prize of $10k. In a town meeting, people demand for a local golfer but the drunken Captain Junah is reluctant to play. While trying to get back his swing late one night, Bagger Vance (Will Smith) asks for a job to caddy for the big game.<br/><br/>It takes a bit of exposition to get started. Charlize Theron and Matt Damon starts off with an interesting period piece. Then Will Smith comes in and it slowly becomes obvious that this is some kind of Magical Negro that he's playing. This is apparently a fable where racism is not much mentioned nor noticed. It demands that the viewer forget any historical realism since this is a fable after all.<br/><br/>The best thing about this is that Robert Redford has made a beautiful looking movie. It is however slow moving, and lacks the needed energy to keep up the pace for the whole 2 hours. My biggest problem is that the fable needs much more magic especially visually. Redford does a lot of speeding up the clouds and clouds rolling by and shots of nature and shots of sky and various other in-camera moves to denote magic. It needs something more. It needs something much more. It needs to put this movie definitively into the magical territories. This is not the simple period piece that Redford is creating. (small unimportant spoiler: even the last scene is too uncertain. Bagger Vance is waving old Hardy Greaves over. Redford really needs to spell out what's going on there.)<br/><br/>The acting seems fine to me. Matt Damon and Charlize Theron have some nice scenes together. They have the best fun and I enjoy them the most. I'm not able to tell if the accents are accurate but I don't think it's so obvious that it would offend anybody other than southerners. Will Smith is playing someone unreal. He is almost otherworldly. If this isn't a fable, I'm tempted to say that he's playing it too fake. In the end, it's an uneven viewing experience."

Unfortunately they are drowned in endless sickening violins, and Will Smith's awful, permanently smirking character. If I had to play a round of golf with a pontificating smirker like that, it would be really all I could do to get round the course without making a serious attempt to do him an injury. There are certainly other nits that could be picked - the rules of golf are not well respected in the presentation, and the movie is rather unfair to Robert Jones and Walter Hagen, who were, after all, real people. But the massively annoying Bagger Vance character and the dreadful syrupy music drowning all significant moments are what really sink the movie. The style of the cinematography somewhat matches the music, but I could have lived with that, if it were not for the other problems. Given the paucity of decent golf movies, I suppose this is worth checking out for those interested in golf and its history, but it really is a bit much to take - muting the sound, especially when Bagger is speaking, might improve it quite a bit (although you'd still have to endure the best part of an hour of that annoying smirk)."

","Every one of us has faced an adversity (or two) in our lives where we decide flight is the choice instead of fight. Events occur that knock us off our projected course and reshape us as an individual without any sense of direction of how to get back; and this is a story of one of those journeys. Rannulph Junah (Matt Damon) is an up and coming phenom golfer from Georgia who is sent off to fight in World War 1. When he returns home, his confidence is completely shattered and proceeds to spiral into the depths of alcoholism. Upon inheriting a golf course, Junah's old flame, Adele Inergordon (Charlize Theron)decides to solve the golf courses financial woes with a one-on-one golf tournament with the two best golfers in the world, Bobby Jones (Joel Gretch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill). The town pleads for an addition from Savannah to represent them in the tournament and Rannulph Junah is selected. Severely reluctant, being an understatement, Junah decides to play and quickly realizes (along with everyone else) that he is a shell of his former self. One night while Junah is horrifically hitting golf balls, literally, out of nowhere appears Bagger Vance (Will Smith), and becomes Junah's caddy for the match. Using a combination of life experience and an unexplainable knowledge Bagger Vance helps Junah find what he has lost, his ""swing."" Director Robert Redford uses golf as a medium to explain this, painful and emotional, story of a man who once had everything and lost it all fighting for his country in World War 1. He shows us that ""remembering"" involves reconnecting; in this case Junah is assisted by Bagger Vance in remembering his ""swing"" and conquering his fears, and most importantly that whatever may be buried deep in the past was only just a moment ago. Redford uses rather deep cinematography to focus in on the symbolism of everything around us, and how listening and feeling reconnects us to what we knew. This movie is a little on the cerebral and emotional side, and involves some soul searching to connect with the true point of the film. The performances by Damon, Theron and Smith are terrific.<br/><br/>(The film is rated PG-13 for language and some sensuality)"

Bagger Vance character depicted Lord Krishna in the battlefield where he gave his teachings and wisdom to Arjun in the Bhagavad Gita.<br/><br/>Star Wars was also based on Hindu philosophy and religion.

E.g. the praying to Kali Maa being seen as a negative thing and the depiction of the stones or the Shiva Lingams which represent Lord Shiva. <br/><br/>Some Westerners say that the Lingams depict a phallic symbol, which they do not. There is nothing sexual about it at all, except for the fact that Shiva (a male God) was born from the Lingham.<br/><br/>So Hollywood.........please get your facts right and portray the correct message to the public and not destroy or tarnish the Hindu wisdom and philosophy. One can learn a great deal from them, which scientists and people are only just discovering. India had this knowledge thousands of years ago.

Out of nowhere Bagger Vance appears and offers to caddie for him.<br/><br/>Comments: A top notch feel good movie, with some romantic flair. There are some ominous feelings, mostly in Rannulph's war memories and the depression effects, but the most suspense are in the feelings between Rannulph and Adele. It's also the main point in the story, as Rannulph's play hinges on him sorting his emotions out.<br/><br/>The acting of the three leading actors and actress is impressive and is the main benefit from the entire movie. Matt Damon, Will Smith and Charlize Theron are very good as Rannulph, Bagger and Adele respectively. Damon's and Theron's characters are maybe the most interesting as they have their history and conflicting feelings together. But Smit's portrayal of Bagger is just stellar. He always has some wise advice to give but is also always so easy going, always with a smile on his face. There doesn't seem to be any conflicts within him, all the more impressive for Smith to make his character deep and complex.<br/><br/>Maybe the best part is that there is no bad guys. It is too typical and too easy to have one of the competitors to be a real scum. But here both competitors are pure gentleman, and based on real golfers too. The entire movie is about to win the fight within yourself, so no exterior threat is needed. It is nice to see that they didn't take the easy way and introduced one.<br/><br/>7/10"
"msmary","4","0","2","26 May 2009"," Hokey Delivery of Overt Metaphor
","Director Robert Redford weaved a spiritual metaphor into ""A River Runs through It"" that flowed with its plot points. He attempted to do the same with ""The Legend of Bagger Vance,"" this time golf was the metaphor instead of fly fishing, but the spiritual message seemed more contrived, preachy, and hokey than in his previous work. It's a shame that the theme was so overt: a little subtly would have strengthened the plot, which was seriously weakened by the over-emphasis on metaphor.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was unconvincing as a professional golfer, spiritual journeyman, and lover to Charlize Theron. I've read other reviews criticizing the choice of Will Smith as a servile, uneducated caddy. Racism did not occur to me when I watched the movie, but in hindsight I must agree that the casting choice seems at best careless. While conveying an interesting theme, the movie was over-ambitious and, perhaps, too self-important to accomplish its goal with grace."

","For some time now I have come to expect three things from any Robert Redford movie. Great stars, home spun story line, and something immensely beautiful in both cinematography and musical score. Bagger Vance does not disappoint anyone in all three respects. Like his epic ""River Runs Through It"", the story is narrated by an older man looking back on the story of his life. Or in the case of Bagger Vance, a moment or event that changed his life forever, and never to be forgotten. Bagger Vance is a movie of which you just sit back and enjoy after a long hard day, or late in the evening when all is quiet and you desperately need an escape. It is moving, often funny, exquisitely photographed, and has a soft luxurious musical score similar to ""Field of Dreams"". It is also the very last appearance of the legendary Jack Lemon in a movie, who is also the narrator the tale. I have read a few other scathing reviews of this beautifully told story by others that do not possess a sentimental bone in their bodies, as well as golfers. Who for some reason see it fit to proclaim that they hated the movie and make sure you understand "" by the way, I'm a golfer"". Like knowing that is supposed to mean their opinion should carry some sort of premium to it. Personally, I have always felt there is something a little strange about any man that enjoys spending so many weekends shelling out decent bucks in chasing a little ball around a big green field rather than with his family. But,.. that's another matter. Let me confess that I am neither a golfer, a baseball player, basketball star, or football hero. But I happen to love ""Field of Dreams"", ""Hoosiers"", and ""Rudy"". And I loved this movie. I did take one star off on the meter for the story is not quite up to par at times with ""River Runs Through It"". It can be a little slow at times. But trust me, you will find this movie staying with you long after its final scene. Take a chance. You won't be sorry..."
"authorwizard","5","0","1","5 January 2009"," Solid acting nearly saves this arrogant mess
","With so much young talent at his disposal, why does Robert Redford continue to direct movies? His style is wearisome. You leave the movie physically tired because the director makes you squint through too much low-key lighting, pushes you around by jumping from one romanticized (sweeping covers, slow motion, slow-zooming close-ups, etc.) shot to another, and leaves you scratching your head trying to figure out why every scene is paced to take up as much of your time as possible.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the actors save this movie, even if some of their accents are not perfect. For example, Bruce McGill does a fine job of portraying Walter Hagen as a gruff but likable antagonist.<br/><br/>However, this picture bombed for a reason. Nobody (not even a person who plays golf) wants to watch more than half of a too-long movie dedicated to a troubled man ""finding"" his golf swing. There is simply too much zen-like philosophy and too little treatment of the main character's motivations for this film to elevate itself above the mediocrity of a basic man-versus-personal-demons-overcoming-all-odds story. By now, we have seen it too many times and ""Bagger Vance"" adds nothing new to this tired theme."

The blurb suggests it will make the spirit soar. Your mileage may vary, but expect true inspiration as a minimum. If it doesn't make you feel, it will make you think. On the plus side, Redford has created beautiful cinema with this golf-centered and Depression-era story. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm done with watching it, Charlize trying to re-ignite passion for an old flame, to profess her love.

"pgwhite95","7","0","1","26 December 2008"," A great story, with great messages.
","I had the pleasure of seeing this movie being made, while I lived in Savannah, Ga. I have to say first off that the visual imagery of this film in impeccable, and nothing other than top-notch. The use of scene's at night, and scene's in the fog, and scene's in the rain bring an emotion to specific points in the story that could not have been told any other way.<br/><br/>A great story is exactly what this film is, despite what some critics have said about this film being cheesy, or not being realistic, what they apparently lack in a sense of imagination and a flair for the art of storytelling. The setting for this film as being after WWI, and entering into the great depression separates the story from being exclusively about money, or an individual character. Although, this movie is titled, ""The Legend of Bagger Vance,"" this film is not about Bagger Vance. Sure, Bagger Vance had a big role in transforming Matt Damon's character. This film is about fear, and personal doubt, and the ability to overcome our own obstacles.<br/><br/>Using Golf as the subject is terrific, being that it is a sport which, is ultimately about competing against yourself. Each shot in golf, from the drive to the putt is about individual concentration, and ability. Being a golf fanatic, I know it can be quite a frustrating game when you let it get the best of you. You get behind on a stroke, you try to over-compensate for your loss, and you end up playing worse because, you're now playing not to screw up.<br/><br/>I give big prop's to Robert Redford for directing this great film, and to the casting director for bringing together a group that has great on-screen chemistry.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story, and likes the idea that we can all conquer our own fears."

","I do not agree with any of the negative comments about this film. It honestly doesn't even matter who directed it, who starred in it or even how much money was spent in producing it. It doesn't really matter how the critics reviewed it, nor the fact that it lost money in the end. The most important element about this film is the storyline. The story itself is what carries the film, in my humble opinion, by virtue of its message alone. Overcoming adversity in one's life is the impetus behind the concept of the story, the ""sport"" itself is merely the visual aid, the vehicle. Granted, although it contains the element of a fantasy film, if you think about the forces involved whenever someone ""loses faith"" with his/herself, and the painstaking attempt to gain back that faith, it all boils down to being one with nature, with one's life-force being in tune with all things around them. Much the way we seek solace whenever we pray to the Almighty, or ask for help from some 'higher power', ""Bagger Vance"" is the culmination of every force in nature. He is the sky, the earth, the wind and the water and is manifest in the form of a human being. The movie is such an inspiration for anyone seeking approbation or, more simply, just a good feeling. Another great feature about this film is that it is for the entire family from 8 to 80, everyone has something to gain by watching this film....I think it's simply GREAT! A perfect 10!!"

However, at the same time he cannot do it on his own strength, he requires help because he simply does not have the raw materials in himself to repair and make new. <br/><br/>I think it misses the mark though in saying that the ultimate power is within ones self and that the power to be the best lies inside yourself.

","The Legend of Bagger Vance is about living. Golf is the medium use to bring the characters out and to be seen. The names do not matter, but they give the depth and reality to the script. Junuh (Matt Damon) being the focal point is a man, any man, that has survived a moment of history that most men would like to forget. The beautiful Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) is the strong woman that is a compliment to any mans life.<br/><br/>Junuh existing in the present, and without guidance, can not see the life he has in front of him. Despite the inter actions of the other characters he is lost, and can not find his groove, swing, reason for moving forward in life. He remains bitter and guilty for things that were out of his control and still feels he could have changed things.<br/><br/>Bagger Vance (Will Smith) (This has to be the best direction of an actor by Robert Redford. The Fresh Prince in a serious role that is not like himself) comes out of the dark and into the light. This is no angle, this is much more. <br/><br/>Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief as young Hardy and Jack Lemmon narrating and the old Hardy) is the byline to the story and is the person bearing witness to the events that unfold. <br/><br/>This movie is not feel good, it is not about golf, it is not about a WWI vet who is depressed about the fact he is alive while others have died. It is about LIVING, it is about humanity, and those that have passed through our lives and we did not pay any attention to them or what they had to say. We all want to be heard but do we want to listen? <br/><br/>For those that have read this, revisit the movie and the new title could have been"" I saw God as a caddy"".

I'm not a golf fan but this movie made me see that golf is not an easy sport. The three leads did a god job. Matt Damon was a good pick for the character of Rannulph Junuh. He really showed the character's emotion through his face expressions. Will Smith did a great job as Bagger Vance. To me, he really captured the mysterious guardian that helps anyone and everyone. Charlize Theron did a decent job. At some parts she did great but at others I just couldn't see the character. But overall I liked that she was the pick. The whole cast did an excellent job.

That never happened in the '30's and balls were likewise not marked -- which led to frequent stymies.

","It is amazing that a movie seemingly centered around golf can be so inspiring! When we do however look closer at the movie we see the major theme of Faith begin to arise. In the scene where Junnah is hitting golf balls into the dark and Bagger seemingly appears out of the darkness, the viewer is given a picture of Junnah's metaphorical blindness. He appears to be aimless and in desperate need of guidance. It is from here that faith takes a major role in the film. Numerous references to God appear in the narration, and this may be linked to the perception of Bagger as somewhat of an angel. 'The Field' is easily interpreted as life and Hardy's comment at the end of the film - ' ... as Bagger once said, golf is a game that can't be won, only played' seems to justify his search for his place in the field.

","*** out of **** stars:<br/><br/>       Like the sport of golf, this movie is one of the less-adreniline felled and more slowed-down movies you'll ever see. Matt Damon plays a has-been in the world of golfing who was broken by his experiences fighting in World War I. Damon ultimately decides to get back into the sport of golfing with the inspiration of a little kid (played in his older days by Jack Lemmon, always a plus!), a unique caddy named Bagger Vance (Will Smith), and a tournament being thrown by his wealthy ex-lover (Charlize Theron) to help save her golfing club in depression-torn Savannah. Rather than adrelaine and lust for glory, Bagger Vance, somewhat of a centerpiece to which the film is built around, preaches love for the game and the inherent beauty of it. It's possible that the director intended to enfuse the film with some religious subtext, as Bagger Vance seems in some ways to be divine, we don't know where he came from or where he leaves for at the end of the film, and he seems to know exactly what to say at any given moment. Will Smith shows a little more range and depth that we're used to seeing from him, and the rest of the cast seems to have brought their A-game to the film. The drama, set against beautifully photographed backgrounds, is subtle and attentive, pleasantly mild."

","This movie had potential, but never got close to what it could've been. Things that made this one of the lamest attempts at being a ""classic"" that I've seen are the weakly written plot and script, lack of character developement, and the overall feeling that Redford wanted this to be a classic, but obviously didn't bother putting enough effort into pulling it off.<br/><br/>First off is how they portray the whole plot of man vs. himself.  The story is basically about a guy (Rannulph Junuh) who comes back from WWI and is carrying ""demons"" he has to face from it (i.e. everyone dies but him, and also that he has avoided his lover for the past 10 years on account of this guilt????)  Come on, really???  What war veteran is going to come home from the war and NOT want to get laid the 1st chance he gets from his extremely beautiful girlfriend.  Anyway, so somehow (after 10 years of avoiding them) he comes to terms with these ""demons"" in a matter of a few days, most of which are taken up playing golf.<br/><br/>I'd have to say one of the cheesiest moments is when Junuh hooks the ball into a forest and when he goes to find it he has a WWI flash back.  Then Bagger Vance somes in, recites a poorly thought out script, and all of a sudden Junuh has overcome that particular demon is back to his peak performance again.<br/><br/>Then there's this character Bagger Vance.  Who the hell is he and what's his story.  This movie would've made a lot more sense if they would've put a little more into decifering if he was a regular mortal who just had a lot of wise quotes, or some angel-esque being with heavenly insight.  They hint at this at the end when he is seen in our time looking the same.<br/><br/>
The acting is done mediocre on everyones behalf, but Charlize Theron does an exceptionally lousy southern accent, half the time she slips into a regular accent in the middle of a word.  Check out her speech when introducing the 3 different golfers to the city.<br/><br/>Not that the movie isn't entertaining, because it is.  I wanted this to very much be a ""classic"" but ended up feeling sorry for the unfulfilling mess it becomes.  And on a note for Redford... can you try doing a movie that isn't based before 1980?   The ""good 'ol days"" are gone and I would rather try and find meaning from someone from my time that your grandparents time."

Sadly, Hollywood does not make many movies like this anymore, where you don't have to have explosions and head cuttings to make a movie good and exciting.  All of the performances in the movie were magnificient.  Especially from Will Smith, where when you go down his list of movies you see ""Independence Day"", ""Bad Boys"", and ""MIB.""  For me, this was his breakthrough performance, stunning my eyes in awe as a man who can only fire a gun all of a sudden giving a brilliant performance as a man who helps and guides another man through his problems in life.  In this case, it is golf but this movie can be applied to life, in which Will Smith's only reward was to see the other man better off.  If you want to see a movie to make you not be able to think and comprehend anything above lights moving in front of your eyes, see ""The Fifth Element.""  If you want to see what Hollywood has lost and should have back, and what makes you think and makes movie watching an experience, then watch ""The Legend of Bagger Vance.""  And remember that a good movie isn't what makes you sit and enjoy, but what makes you think and experience."

","This movie was way ahead of my expectations! It was so good that I'm going to try writing a comment in english!! I think Robert Redford made a really good job : a nice, moving, simple and straightforward story, intelligent and very well written dialogues ; and all his scenes were so beautiful and so neatly worked on that it seemed to me he got the best out of each : all seemed to flow for my greatest delight. I felt Redford knows how to show the extraordinary in ordinary lives and that touches your very soul leaving you optimistic and happy for the rest of the day! I was also delighted by the actors' performance. Matt Damon confirms once again his - oh how much promising- talent. I really loved the way Will Wmith played his character : he avoided the clichÃ©s and gave his character a humoristic touch which, in my opinion, added in the mystery of Bagger Vance. As for Charlize Theron, her character was so lively and stubborn! She made me think of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the wind. And, last but no least, the kid, Hardy, was so talented! I hope to see him on the screens again soon! Also, maybe because I'm european girl- I don't know exactly why-, I like movies about the South of United States. I feel it's just such an intriguing place. And, in my opinion, Redford's camera just catched all the southern charm, touch and contradictions. I was really carried away by Bagger Vance's Legend."

This is a mythical tale.<br/><br/>If this was about golf, I wouldn't be interested. Unlike Redford, who describes himself as an environmentalist, I don't consider golf courses to be very 'natural'. As a kid, I played plenty of golf. But now I see it as the opposite of nature: as a herbicide laden terraformed playground for a privileged few. I prefer real nature, embodied in real wilderness -- what's left of it.<br/><br/>Yet, I love this movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps my judgment is colored by Robert Redford's role in Jeremiah Johnson, which I saw as an impressionable teen. Both Johnson and Junuh grapple with that long shadow of solitude.  My life would be very different without Jeremiah Johnson - it had that kind of impact. <br/><br/>If I was to draw any comparison to Redford, it would be a writer: Ernest Hemingway.

"ClarkKentKY","10","0","1","11 April 2001"," Robert Redford's Swan-Song
","!! **Spoilers** !!<br/><br/>This film is simply as good as they come.  Perhaps it just strikes the right cords with me.  But this, in my mind, is the Peak of Robert Redford.  His masterpiece.  The movie could be played without an audio track and still move you with its visuals and the images.  Likewise, you could rely on just the dialogue and no sense of sight, and be moved by the dialogue and exchanges between the characters.  Particularly Bagger Vance. Bagger... It took a third viewing of the film before I truly understood Bagger.  For the purposes of this film, bagger is God, or as Robert Redford calls him in the DVD production featurette ""a spiritual being.""  An Angel to say the least, but quite possibly the films intention was to portray him as divine.  We don't see Bagger's entrance, or exit.  We don't see him eat, or bleed, or become angered.  And then we see him motioning from the bright light of a sunset over a Golf Course.  Often the golf Course is used for a metaphor for life by Bagger, so perhaps the deeper meaning of that final scene is lost on people that wanted less out of the movie, or saw bagger as what he wanted to be perceived as.  One scene in particular shows Bagger's grasp on Junuh's pain, and the power he needs to overcome it, where Junuh comes to the realization that this fight for his swing, the golf match, isn't about a trophy or a town, But about his soul.  The film uses Golf as a vessel for this story of a broken man trying to redeem his spirit and his lost identity, and it succeeds with vivid flying colors. One of the most underrated films of the year, overlooked by the box-office, the critics, and the awards.  But appreciated by me.  A true 10."
"FlickJunkie-2","8","0","1","11 April 2001"," Beautifully filmed golf story
","As a director, Robert Redford has gained a reputation for making beautifully photographed human-interest stories (`The Horse Whisperer', `A River Runs Through It') and this film fits that mold.  From a production standpoint, this film is an 11.  It has gorgeous photography, incredible locations, wonderful period costumes and props, and terrific golf sequences.  The story is an old-fashioned underdog story with a man fighting against the odds and himself in quest of victory and self respect.  It gets a bit corny at times with the `Golf is Life' metaphors and the story is predictable, but Redford conjures fascinating characters and endows the story with a great deal of affability.<br/><br/>If there is one area where the film falters, it is in the character of Bagger Vance.  This is no reflection on Will Smith, who did an outstanding job with the character.  It has more to do with the way the character is written and Redford's way of presenting him.  Vance is presented in a way that is too quirky and enigmatic which dissipates some of his impact.  There has been much speculation about the character.  Is he a real person, or an angel, or is he just a representation of Junuh's (Matt Damon) mental battle with himself?  The last scene points to the angel theory, but Redford purposely leaves the issue nebulous.  <br/><br/>It is a mistake for Redford to personify Vance as a black man dressed like a hobo.  In Savannah in the 1930's, you were not likely to have seen a black caddie at an exclusive country club, particularly one dressed in tattered clothes.  Redford completely ignores the issue of race in the film.  During the entire film, not a single person makes so much as a crossways look or comment at this disheveled black person consorting with high society, which is utterly unrealistic and anachronistic.  Perhaps Redford is trying to contrast the wisdom of simple folks against the deluded self-importance of the wealthy, which is a noble message with a ring of truth.  However, the incongruence of the character and the times makes the entire story much less like a legend and more like a contrived fairy tale.<br/><br/>As an enthusiast for the game, I am delighted at how wonderfully the golf scenes are done.  From an athletic standpoint, Joel Gretsch is a marvelous choice for Bobby Jones because Gretsch has a classic golf swing as did Jones.  Similarly, Bruce McGill does a good job imitating Hagan.  McGill is an avid golfer and he adjusted his swing to make it more ugly, more like Hagan's swing.  The biggest surprise is Matt Damon, who never picked up a golf club until this film.  He worked with a golf-pro and developed a nice looking swing, hitting some fine shots in the process.<br/><br/>The acting is outstanding.  Damon gives another superb performance, capturing the conflict and determination of the character and the mental gymnastics of the sport.  Charlize Theron is full of affected southern charm and belts out a fine Georgia accent.  Bruce McGill is flamboyant and charismatic as the pompous Hagen.  Though I don't agree with the way Bagger Vance is presented as a character, I can't imagine anyone doing a better portrayal of him than Will Smith.  Smith is charming, wily and cantankerous giving Vance a wise yet homespun air.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film to watch and a gift to golf lovers.  The story is somewhat trite, but the presentation is splendid.  I rated it an 8/10 on the strength of the production values and my love of the game.  Subtract one or two points if you think golf is boring.  Add a couple if you believe that life is a metaphor for golf."

I don't know what I was expecting when I watched it, but I don't think it was what Redford presented.  While in places the film failed to deliver (was Bagger real or not?; did the tournament save the country club?), all in all it was a really good film.  The acting was superb.  I found myself laughing out loud many times at quiet little jokes that hit the spot for me.  Now, I'm not a golfer, but I was raised one, so maybe that's why I liked it in part.  Other than that - the cinematography was superb - the settings agonizingly beautiful - and the costuming was dynamite.  I find myself liking Damon more and more with each film - he seems to grow more as an actor.  And Charlize Theron is just flat gorgeous! And interestingly, I found myself wondering just who was playing Bobby Jones.  Joel Gretsch, who plays him, makes him seem as if he really were a professional golfer.

Jeremy Leven writes a solid story and adapted it from the Steven Pressfield novel.

","Everything I'd heard or read -- except Roger Ebert and Jeff Lyons -- said this movie was sentimental twaddle. It didn't seem likely, though, that this fine a director and cast could so thoroughly sink the ball in every water hazard known to movie making, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Actually, it's a first rate, uplifting tale of redemption through love and  the act of rediscovering who you are. Matt Damon was wonderful in his role, adding another fine acting turn to a filmography that now includes a number of good guys (which seem to suit him well) and one stinker (Ripley), which may have been bad casting. He grows, he excels at self-discovery, and he's fun to watch. Theron had me transfixed -- in a world of post-pubescent female leads, none of whom will ever amount to diddly (or get another role) after the first onset of wrinkles at the mouth and a tummy, she has the glamorous aura of a genuine studio star of yesterday; and yes, she can act. Will Smith has been one likeable guy after another for years, and I like his smarts and his sass. As to Robert Redford's turn as director once again, he can continue to fight cynicism by waging a classy war for moral uplift through groundedness as long as he likes, and I'll love every minute of it, whether he's swinging a bat or a club, healing people or horses. I've had enough car chases, enough people trying to get laughs through farts and scatology, enough dumbing down to the lowest common denominator. This is a glossy, beautifully told, gorgeously photographed story that makes you feel good. Only one question bugs me -- why wasn't Jack Lemmon credited.

I actually tried to sleep through the lazily contrived and inept plot, but the music was very noisy, so try as I might, I couldn't dream up something more interesting.  If there had been a spark of chemistry between the two principals, that might have made a difference, but Charlize Theron is too mature and just plain too much woman for Matt Damon.

","I have a lot of faith in Will Smith and Matt Damon.  They seem to keep their integrity even through the worst settings (Smith in the *Fresh Prince of Belair* series and *Men in Black* and Damon in Spielberg's *Saving Private Ryan*).  So when I saw they were both in this movie, I had to see it.  Then I read some professional reviews from various magazines, etc., and heard almost nothing but that the movie was pretentious, slow, pointless, self-indulging, etc.  Thank God I happened upon Ebert's review amongst all these negative ones.  He nearly stood alone in judging it to be a movie with a lot to offer, and so I took the chance, and I think he was right. (If I were to do a review of movie reviewers, he'd get two thumbs up from me--very even-minded, not given to knee-jerks, even if I don't always agree with him.)<br/><br/>Though a long movie, I didn't notice the length.  I have to admit, I stumbled through the choppy beginning as Charlize Theron struggled to hold up scenes on her own.  I began to fear that all the other reviewers were right, but when the golf got started, so did the movie.  It was a very nice movie about personal resolve and achieving excellence, and was wisely philosophical as well (through the mouth of Smith's Bagger Vance character). <br/><br/>By the way, I don't know anything about golf, but I read another user commentator who swears the movie was 100% historically accurate in depicting the state of golf at the time, even if there didn't seem to be quite as much racial prejudice on and off the golf course as you would expect during the Depression.  The two golf competitors, played by Bruce McGill and Joel Gretsch, were both amazing supporting actors, making the golf competition that much more of a rich experience.  The movie also had it's share of humor: the entire scene with Damon's character, Junuh, playing cards with his black drinking buddies; and when Junuh turns to Vance during the tournament and declares, ""You're one hell of a caddy.""<br/><br/>I'd probably only give the movie a 6, if I thought such unqualified ratings very valid, but if you go to movies to find at least a few great moments, as I do, this movie is sure to bring you out of the rough with a number of inspiring master strokes on director Robert Redford's part."

","All the disappointments, frustrations and exultations in the game of golf are carefully scripted into this story right up to the final hole. There is mild excitement between the top-notch photographic shots of the setting sun and the trees that line the well-groomed fairway, but there are really no surprises.  I was pretty sure that Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) would beat the world champions, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagan.  After all he could not let down his young somewhat precocious little friend Harley (Michael Moncrieff), the beautiful Adele Invergorden (Charlize Theron)in her sumptuous twenties outfits and the mystical Bagger Vance (Will Smith) who appears one night while Junuh is hitting golf balls into the darkness surrounding his house. Vance proves to be a minder. adviser, psychologist and coach while he carries the clubs around the course.  ""You've lost your swing"" he says with his critical smile. ""You must focus"".  There are close-ups of Kunuh's eyes peering forward  along the fairway at the distant green.  There is an amazing piece of photography where we actually travel with the ball from tee to hole.  On one occasion the ball lands among a clump of trees and there seems to be no way out. ""Focus!"" he is told and focus he does and we travel upward with the ball and through a narrow opening in the treetops.  Even the name of Matt Damon could not draw large audiences to the film which had a short run at my local cinema.  It is not so much a story about golf as about a young man in a perilous state after atrocious World War 1 experiences who finds his real self and re-establishes himself with the people of Savannah his home town."
"Philip Crowther 2001","8","0","1","25 February 2001"," Interesting and strangely fascinating old-fashioned sports melodrama
","Robert Redford has clearly not forgotten the time in the 1970s when he and Paul Newman were two of Hollywood's leading men. As soon as you see the posters for his sixth outing as a director  this time golfing story/parable The Legend of Bagger Vance  you are immediately reminded of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. Because in Matt Damon and Will Smith he has got two of the most illustrious members of the new generation of American screen heartthrobs, reminiscent of his own legendary partnership with Paul Newman. But the undoubtedly talented Damon and Smith are not just pin-ups: they really manage to carry the film for all of its 128 interesting, and strangely fascinating, minutes.<br/><br/>I say `strangely' because a simple film like this shouldn't really be able to satisfy regular cinema audiences, what with the plot being no different from virtually any other golfing, or indeed sporting, movie. But Redford actually manages to pull off what every basically similar film in the sporting genre tries to do in one form or another: sport as a metaphor for life. Now this may sound pretty pretentious, but in his hands it isn't, because not only is the storyline a success; the historical context is right (Savannah in the Great Depression), and even the more philosophical utterances play their part in creating a very enjoyable and quite profound package.<br/><br/>The unfortunately named Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) is a world-weary Great War veteran who, after his harrowing experiences in the trenches, is encouraged by golf-course owner and fiancée Adele (Charlize Theron) to recover his `long-lost swing'. But only thanks to the help of his mysterious and spiritual caddie Bagger Vance, the catalyst of the story, does Will Hunting, sorry  Rannulph Junuh, get his `authentic swing' back to triumph in Adele's three-man exhibition tournament.<br/><br/>Although Damon dominates the screen throughout, it is Will Smith's character who gets all the best and most important lines, and he delivers them with obvious enthusiasm, though always keeping out of the limelight and maintaining a certain physical distance. Bagger Vance's religious overtones might irritate a few people, but in fact the film can be taken as a straightforward, old-fashioned sports melodrama, with a nice little love story thrown in for good measure. The ups and downs of the main character's sporting life are narrated, as all historical dramas seem to be, with the help of a flashback structure and voice-overs. The colours  sepia-tint brownish tones dominate  suggest not only a very nostalgic, respectful look at the Deep South in the 1930s, but also a tribute to the film-making techniques of the time. It seems as though only modern Hollywood conventions kept Redford from filming the whole thing in black and white. But then again, some of the sweeping camera movements (or are they just computer-generated images? The end credits certainly suggest so .) are breathtaking; ditto the settings.<br/><br/>Although the film often lays it on a bit thick in the sentimentality department (the inevitable slow-motion scenes at the final hole, complete with mawkish, swelling violins), Redford's calm, almost poetic images and his ability to tell a simple story with style have the power to surprise even some of the more cynical moviegoers among us."

","One of the persons that made a review on this film complains because of a movie that works golf more than the characters. Is it necessary always to follow the same patterns? I think it is the director choice how to manage a story and present it to us. In Robert Redford case, he did it elegantly, convincingly, and knowingly. He is telling us in images, what the book says in words. When you play a game like golf, it is yourself, the ball and the course. There's no one to blame for those bad shots; it is you and only you. It's a selfish game that will always test you. If you have your ears open, you will hear the Golfing Gods and learn the lesson. If not, you are nothing but a weekend hacker, having a good time with no brain in it.

So I wasn't exactly revved up to see the film.<br/><br/>However, it won me over. The style, mood, and metaphors really blew me away. The story is slighly cliched, if only for the existence of movies like ""The Natural"", which also featured an older guy returning to a sport he previously excelled at, with a blonde woman cheering him on from the sidelines. But where ""The Natural"" was a fantasy and didn't have much of a message, ""...Bagger Vance"" digs deeper and has more of a philosophy behind it. And if you think you can predict who will win the golf tournament in the end, you are wrong.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor - be open minded and go see a movie that happens to use golf as a way of giving its message."
"LaurieB","Null","0","1","2 December 2000"," A big ""yes""!
","I've read several of the comments on this Board, and I feel some people are missing the point of the movie. True, Matt Damon is a superb actor, although not in this movie. But this movie isn't just about Matt Damon's character and his struggles, don't you see? If Matt Damon over-performed his role in Legend, then we would miss the point, because we'd be so focused on his despair.<br/><br/>True, Robert Redford used yet another sport for his movie, but so what? Redford reveals a bit of himself each time he directs. This is what truly great directors do! Who cares how he accomplishes this?<br/><br/>True, the golf balls were not 30's golf balls, and this is an unfortunate and unnecessary oversight (we assume). But if that ruins the movie for you, then AGAIN, you've missed the point.<br/><br/>True, there's nothing really 'new' in this story, or the way in which Hollywood presents it. Perhaps that's because to some extent Hollywood knows what people are about, what people relate to, people like you and me. What's wrong with producing something known to us with a slightly different twist (i.e., casting Will Smith - what an excellent choice! - but very unexpected) that WORKS? This movie works!!! It touches me. It challenges me. It causes me to ask questions. And it somehow is able to relate itself to me.<br/><br/>Side note: J. Michael Moncrief (as Hardy Greaves) was astounding. I sincerely hope to see this young man develop into a fine actor. He has what it takes.<br/><br/>Final comment: If for no other reason that you can concoct, see the movie for Will Smith's and J. Michael Moncrief's performances and the cinematography. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy!!"

"notlehs","7","0","1","20 November 2000"," Pretty Good, Redford movies are better when he isn't in them.
","The last movie I saw which Redford directed was The Horse Whisperer. Redford showed himself too much and the movie could have been edited down to about half its length.  <br/><br/>This one doesn't have Redford in it, so he does a pretty good job of keeping the pace moving.  <br/><br/>Matt Damon is a great actor, but only good here. As an avid golfer I would have to say his swing is fairly flawed and the way he leaves his hips out means there is absolutely no way he could hit a golf ball 300 yards. However, his swing was perfect for the scenes where he was shanking the ball left and right. So I will give him a C grade on the golfing portion of his acting.  Damon pulled off everything thing else with an A-. He was very good and had great chemistry with Charlize Theron.  Her accent was off a bit, but not bad for someone from South Africa. Charlize gets a B.<br/><br/>
Will Smith was a natural in his role and the highlight of the movie.  Every moment he spent on the screen was perfect. A+ for Will.<br/><br/>
Redford's direction was pretty good, but there were a few gaffes which are worth mentioning.  Golf balls from the 20's did not have dimples. The close-ups of the balls showed 90's style golfs balls. This was quite lame. They were not made from polymers which made dimples possible until the late 40's.  The balls were rubber on the outside and they would not have flown 300 yards if King Kong were hitting them with a wooden shafted club. <br/><br/>
These technical glitches can be put aside because this movie wasn't really about golf they say.  Well I say don't put golf in the story if you aren't going to do it right.  <br/><br/>Redford gets a B-.  Which is far from the D- I gave him for The Horse Whisperer.  <br/><br/>Nice improvement Bob, Now remember to keep yourself out of the movies you direct."

"mercury-26","10","0","1","14 November 2000"," Redford at the top of his game
","Because Robert Redford has become the symbol of filmmaking in America--having won an Oscar in his directorial debut for ""Ordinary People,"" then founding the Sundance Institute and Sundance Film Festival--his work tends to be scrutinized more than most. We watch each frame of his films just to see if he'll slip up. As evidenced by his latest, ""The Legend of Bagger Vance,"" Mr. Redford is a filmmaker of scientific precision. He was in a zone when he made this one.<br/><br/>Going in I wasn't all that intrigued by the story: a once-great golf pro tries to regain his game against two of the world's best golfers. As you'd expect, golf here is a metaphor for life. I hung on every word of Bagger Vance's philosophical speeches to Rannulph Junuh (dig the genuine 1920's names) about how to find, say, the perfect shot or the perfect swing. I have no idea why because the game itself bores me. I was simply there because when a Redford-directed film unspools, I've learned by now that I should be in the audience. The man just knows how to pull you in.<br/><br/>The story is set in Savannah, Georgia, where golf is bigger than football in Texas. The Great Depression has just hit. Adele Invegordon (Charlize Theron) has just inherited her father's fortune--which includes the golf course he'd just finished--after the man's suicide. The golf club and resort is worth little now and she's approached by some local men about selling. She believes she can bolster its value and has the idea to hold a tournament on the course between the country's two best golfers, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. Savannah is thought of as the golf capitol of the world so its people insist on one of their own playing in the tourney. A local boy, Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief), a dedicated fan of Savannah legend Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) who hasn't been seen since leaving to serve in the Great War, promises a town hall filled with the city's elite that he can produce the missing golf pro--and does. It just so happens that Adele was Junuh's lover before the war.<br/><br/>The idea isn't that interesting but Redford's gift is making his chosen material engaging. Junuh is persuaded, going against his better judgment, to compete against Jones and Hagen. Problem is, he's 'lost his swing.' Enter Bagger Vance. Vance (Will Smith) is like a figment of Junuh's or Hardy's imagination. Like Shoeless Joe Jackson in ""Field of Dreams"" (""Vance"" has the same sort of mystical, magical feel of that film), he's a ghost--only everyone can see him. He offers his services as Junuh's caddy but isn't satisfied with just carrying and selecting clubs. In fact, he rarely even does what a caddy is supposed to do (which creates many of the film's humorous moments). Vance has a different fight to help Junuh win--the battle of the soul.<br/><br/>The tournament itself takes up most of the film and it is, needless to say, executed to perfection. It has all the intensity of a great sports film plus all the deliberateness and beauty of a Redford film. <br/><br/>""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" is certainly one of the best, if not the best, films of the year. It's been a weak year for the industry so that isn't saying much. This just makes work of true quality easier to spot.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","In this stirring movie director Robert Redford shows what can be done without ""in your face"" language, violence, or sex.

The movie reinvigorates appreciation for lost values, fighting for one's country, adversity in terrible situations, honesty, and appreciation for other people's abilities and contributions. The movie is cinematically lush, the sound track is appropriate but not intrusive, the language fits the situation, and the actors are at the top of their art. I saw this movie twice in one evening and my interest was held at each viewing. Thumbs up to Director Redford, Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Matt Damon for cinematography at it's best. My only reason for a 9 instead of a 10 is some aspects of the story line were not sufficiently explored but this is due to length constraints.

","My father used to say that a walk on the golf course on Sunday morning was a better way to appreciate what God has given us than going into a church. It's a given that my mother merely thought that was an excuse, but I found out it is true. Golf is game between a player and the golf course. Anyone that thinks differently is confused or doesn't play the game.  All mistakes start and end in the mind.  When you believe in yourself you play up to your ability. When you don't beleve in yourself, it can be a long day. This is the lesson Bagger is trying to teach young Rannulph.  His willingness to listen to Bagger Vance and his desire to please his jilted lover go a long way to completing the trip back from his self inflicted depression, but as in life the last steps must be taken alone. Will Smith and Matt Damon play well off of each other.  (I am constantly amazed at the breadth of talent of Will Smith.) I really enjoyed Redfords long lingering look at this time and it's customs. (I have no time for people that say this movie drags.  These are the people that would take a motor scooter through the El Prado so they could say they were there.) His casting was brilliant.  The photography was stunning.  The music was moving. I know the story is somewhat trite and certainly has been told many ways in the past. But the setting and the characters made it fresh and charming all over again. I didn't give this film a high rating only because I think Redford made one huge mistake.  In his role in ""Out of Africa"" he wouldn't try an English accent, because he didn't feel he could do it good enough.  I wish he had told Charlzie Theron the same thing.  While I think she is a great actress and I have enjoyed her in other films, her over the top depiction of the southern Belle was to much for me."

I guess the script was a little weak and had too many underdeveloped stories but still Robert Redford produced the movie so I guess he's not off the hook there either.

Once you get past the introduction (the first 30 minutes or so) the movie is great.  The photography, music, and scenery are beautiful.  The actors all did a good job.  Unlike some other reviewers, I felt like all the actors handled their roles well.  Will Smith pulls off Bagger Vance with just the right mixture of humor and sincerity.  Matt Damon as Ranulf Junnah is much as I imagined him in the book.  The ""chemistry"" between Damon and Theron seemed appropriate given the storyline and the characters' past history.

"LR2000","10","0","1","6 November 2000"," Finally, a great movie about golf.
","Finally, a great movie about golf. Tin Cup was silly and feather light. Happy Gilmore was insultingly stupid. Caddy Shack, though very funny, was more about class warfare than about golf. Robert Redford's The Legend of Bagger Vance successfully brings to life Steven Pressfield's parable about golf and life and captures the essence of what makes golf ""the greatest game.""  Remembering one's authentic golf swing in the midst of competition is the perfect metaphor for finding one's place in the world and resolving inner conflicts.  Matt Damon effectively conveys the disillusionment of America's Lost Generation as a war hero who has lost his direction in life as well as his golf swing. Will Smith thoroughly inhabits his role as Bagger Vance, the sage caddy who materializes to help Damon's character find meaning in what has happened to him.  This is the first movie in which Smith has completely shed his Fresh Prince persona and emerged as a real actor. Charlize Theron is convincing as the determined southern belle, who wants to save her father's resort.  The actors who portray the legendary Bobby Jones and Waler Hagan, Joel Gretsch and Bruce McGill respectively, are brilliant. The young actor at the center of the film, J. Michael Moncrief, projects the wonder and innocence of a child who loves a game and the adults who play it with dignity, honesty, and integrity.  Finally, Jack Lemmon, Hollywood's most earnest golfer, provides a familiar and sympathetic voice as the narrator.<br/><br/>Robert Redford's love of the game is apparent in his direction.  The golf course is photographed lovingly and emerges as an organic being, every bit a character in the story.<br/><br/>The Legend of Bagger Vance is a beautiful and entertaining movie.  It's sincerity and spirit are in sharp contrast to the cynicism and mean-spiritedness so pervasive in the movies today, as so many attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator."

I am usually quite annoyed by southern accents on film, but this movie does not over-do the southern accent.  Will Smith does an AWESOME job in this movie, providing such witty comments to Matt Damon on his golf that are extremely funny.  He will be recognized by the Academy this March, I just know it.  The love affair between Junuh (Matt Damon) and Idell (Charlize Theron) is also not overdone.  Idell is not the typical girl-waiting-for-her-love-to-get-back type of girl, instead, when Junuh doesn't return back from the war, she simply moves on.  When Junuh reappears it takes some time before you realize how Idell actually felt/feels about the way Junuh just vanished. Matt Damon and Charlize Theron are wonderful attributes to this movie.  I wish I could tell you more, but I will say that the movie is beautifully done in every aspect...I don't especially love golf and I still loved this movie, which is over two hours long but felt like two minutes.

There are an increasing number of people who believe in metaphysics which has its roots in Eastern philosophies. By far and away the largest number of openly practicing metaphysicians are in California with the Los Angeles area having many large metaphysical churches.<br/><br/>Over the years I have noticed metaphysics creeping into more and more film plots, overtly in ""Powder"" and ""Phenomenon"" and more subtly in the seemingly violent and gory ""Gladiator.""<br/><br/>Bagger Vance could well be shown in a Metaphysics 101 class. All of the basics are there - the Force is within us - Each has to find their own path - as you really believe, so it is - our souls live on (as in Titanic's theme song) - you have to get out of the way and let the Force (in this case the Field) take over - and of course from decades ago, the Force is with us always.<br/><br/>Whether the teacher appears as an old bearded white guy named Obi or a young black guy named Bagger is relevant only to illustrate that it is not the surface, but what lies beneath, that is real. <br/><br/>If you happen to be tuned in to any form of metaphysics at all, DO NOT MISS this wonderful film.  If you are firmly rooted in this earthly reality, you will probably see Bagger Vance as a boring, ridiculous movie about golf. You will find plenty of comments posted here to support that position.<br/><br/>Regardless of your own philosophical, spiritual leanings, you should find the film well directed, well acted, well photographed, and well scored.

","While the overall success of this movie cannot be blamed on any of the acting performances or the director, this is a flat, boring movie. it takes far too long to get into the heart of the story, and when you do, it doesn;t really pick up pace like it drastically needed to. My favorite movies happen to be time piece dramas.....it's not like I am an action genre fan. However, this movie is completely limited because of the script and the story line in genearl. It wouldn't matter who played the roles and who directed, the movie would have fallen flat. The biggest problem is that the movie focuses far too much on the overall theme......they try to smack you upside the head with the theme time and time again.....it is forced, and the theme is pretty generic......Worse yet, and most importqantly, the characters have no dperth to them......they are boring and you never quite fully understand where they were in the past to care about them in the present. They try to elude what these characters were like before we get to the present, but they do it in such a shallow fashion, that we never really know any of the characters, nor do we dare about them. Bagger Vacne(Will Smith) is a forced, generic, unnecessary character, just their to swarm us with his annoying logic on life...and we never know where he got this logic from....he is just a mystical chracter who we are not allowed to know anything about. Runnolph Junah(Damon) is scared from his past, and we know so little about that past when he was in war...We know he returns home a different guy then when he left and that he has lost his swing(he was an up and coming golfer legend before he went to war). Now he is home, a drunk, and trying to drink away the memories....He makes the transition from drunk to golfer again literally in the snap of a finger......it is VERY unrealistic. And Charlize Theorn's character, no matter how hot she is, is a waste as well....We never feel like we know enough about her and Damon's past relationship to care what happens with it now...Their romance could be the weakest, unbelievable portion of the filme. There is never a level of excitment or conflict that can make this movie anything but drab. A River Runs Through It is one of my all time favorite movies. In that film, a more boring topic than gold was chosen...that of fly fishing, but you cared about the characters...you felt like you knew them, and because of that, yoiu were drawn to the entire movie....The Legend of bagger Vance comes no where near achieving this. It is one of the biggest disappointments I've seen in a while for I was psyched to see it. It looks pretty on the outside, but it's rotten on the inside...a very shallow, one dimensional drab film."

Rannulph Junuh, a local golf hero (played by Matt Damon), returns home from the Great War, the only survivor of his company.  Unable to shake the horrors of war, he becomes a recluse, attempting to drown his pain in whiskey and alienating all he loves, including his former girlfriend, played by Charlize Theron.  It is only through the intervention of a young aspiring golfer (J.

In addition to the lush cinematography, the actors were well cast and gave strong and colorful performances.  The musical score, written by Rachel Portman, was entertaining in its own right, in addition to perfectly complimenting the film's 1930s setting.  I look forward to hearing more of her work.

"Spanner-2","9","0","1","6 November 2000"," Solid and entertaining
","This golf fantasy was directed by Robert Redford,with his typical eye for detail and works for the most part, though if you dislike golf it may not be to your tastes. Matt Damon is a young man who was once the greatest golfer in all of Savannah, but after a stint in World War Ihe vanished into the wilds of depression, leaving his wife (a mesmerizing asalways Charlize Theron) behind. Several years later, Theron is throwing a golf tournament to try to save her late father's golf resort, and she invites tworeal life golfing legends to participate. Of course the towns people of Savannah want a local boy in the match and soon enough they hunt down Damon and talk him into participating. Of course he must recapture his long lost love of the game,in which he is aided by mysterious golfing guru Will Smith (a more subdued and effective role than usual for him). The time and place are captured quite nicely and I appreciated the fact that the other golfers weren't turned intovillains as a lesser film might have done; this film is basically Damon trying to win out over his own personal demons rather than having an external foe.Solid performances abound in a very effective film that's only flaw is its propensity to perhaps take itself a tad too seriously. GRADE: A-"
"Queer-qatfm","5","0","1","3 November 2000"," Very middle of the road.
","Without giving too much away, ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" isn't really so much about the caddy played by comedian Will Smith.  The film, which is a Robert Redford flick -- meaning go see it knowing he's going to tell you the whole story from start to finish -- is more about a boy who watches a golfer played by Matt Damon who's caddy is Bagger Vance, who's played by comedian Will Smith.<br/><br/>Have I mentioned that Will Smith is a comedian?<br/><br/>Ah, okay.  Well, that's precisely my point, faithful readers.  While I completely enjoyed Smith's laid back and confident approach to a character I've read was made for Morgan Freeman, I know for a fact that the part was altered, and in my opinion, made less effective because Will Smith was signed.<br/><br/>Oppositely, I don't like Matt Damon.  I never have admired his ""I'm-a-movie-star"" kind of glitz he brings to every role.  And while nothing's changed here, when he takes his role in this otherwise hokey fantasy about golf, I can't help but want to latch onto his character as if he was the only real element in the film.  After all, Savannah, in all of it's old-classic wonder, seems so real and yet provides a quaint unreal setting for the piece.  Viewers needed Damon to be there for them, and he comes through quite nicely.<br/><br/>So all that is really left to come together for ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" is it's moving story about a golfer who's ""lost his swing"" who's feeling a little ""in the bunker"" and can't quite make ""par for the course"" on life. (And every other metaphor Bagger Vance uses in his trance inducing monologues.)  If there wasn't so much love stuff, I'd say the film would have coasted into a solid B, but alas the movie decides it doesn't want to play it solo (like the game of golf) and introduces way too often Damon's love interest played by Charliez Theorn (""Men of Honor"") who seems too rigid anyway to allow herself to be her character.<br/><br/>I liked ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" but would have only watched it if I caught it on a lazy Saturday afternoon and had nothing else to do. Kind of like when I'd probably watch golf.<br/><br/>Legend of Bagger Vance Grade C"
"LuckyDragon","8","0","1","3 November 2000"," Fore stars
","In a year where there haven't been that many films to get excited about, The Legend of Bagger Vance is one that is.  Robert Redford has taken two good actors, Matt Damon and Will Smith, and made them GREAT actors.  This film doesn't need sex, action, or an overabundance of curse words to be successful, it's as simple and yet, as wickedly complex as the game of golf itself. I won't give anything away, but this is a wild ride of emotions that will keep your attention right up until the credits start to roll.<br/><br/>
The low part of this film is Charlize Theron's performance as Matt Damon's former love.  At times, it seems as if she has forgotten that she is playing a Savannah belle and drops the accent.   However, if you ignore her faults and remember that she's not the star, she's just a double bogey in an otherwise perfect round.<br/><br/>This is an amazing film that golfers and non-golfers will enjoy.

Nonetheless, a wonderful movie, especially in the current cinematic context.<br/><br/>Others have mentioned the lack of ""filling in the details.""  In fact, this is one of my requirements for a good movie.  If one is left with no questions after viewing a film (or any piece of art) then the product was obviously not evocative enough.  An extended war piece is not necessary to ""explain"" a veteran's shellshock at losing his whole company.  A day-by-day recitation of a romance is not necessary for understanding characters' later motivations.  Not all father-son conflicts in real life are resolved with lengthy ""grown up"" discussions. like they are in movies.<br/><br/>The ""point"" of the story was not driven home hard enough for my taste. Junah's search for, and Bagger's description of, the ""authentic swing"" is what the story is all about.  I think the movie would have profited by focusing more on the Bagger/Junah dynamic and Junah's quest than on the love interest.<br/><br/>Go see the movie, then read the book.

","I loved this one. You go into it thinking, it's gonna be hokey, sappy, boring, trite, etc-and no, it isn't that. Instead, Redford works his 'Natural' Magic here in a way that is believable, sentimental in the best meaning of the word, and very, very moving by the end.  It's a flick about someone losing and finding their Self again, bringing their gifts that they thought they'd lost forever in their Youth, and magically retrieving them in a golf game  to end all golf games. <br/><br/>Semi spoiler or two below!!<br/><br/>Matt Damon basically comes off as being a big goofy kid at times, he is So babyfaced that you think of him as being maybe a couple years outta college at best, not some 30 year old scarred-up WWI vet. But he pulls off the role just the same, you can kinda buy him as Payne Stewart, a little.<br/><br/>The guys playing Hagen and Jones were right on the money, Hagen essentially a Babe Ruth of golfing type, all cynicsm and smoke, complete with turbaned Gunga-Din style Caddy and gaggle of groupies, while Jones is shown as the typical athletic golden Boy, all class and business. I think they were well-written roles indeed.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is beautiful, of course, the camera simply loves every minute of her onscreen-she seems to me to combine the right elements of Kathleen Turner, Michelle Pfieffer and Goldie Hawn. I thought her performance was quite effective, and its too bad she is semi-written outta the flick once the game gets underway-standing on the sidelines and reacting to the matters at hand much the same way Liv Tyler does in Armageddon.<br/><br/>Bagger Vance, of course, is essentially a guardian angel, of the links, very well done by Will Smith. He underplays it just the right way, I enjoyed seeing him onscreen and hope he can do more roles like this. It's a tough role to play nowadays-basically he's a soothsayer and advisor, but because its a black guy being a Caddy, you know the PC-hordes in the media are gonna be screaming 'Stepin Fetchit!' from the word go, though the character is anything But. Nice bringing things full circle at the very end, too.<br/><br/>I found everyone in the audience enjoying this thing all the way through, it is funny, touching, exciting, beautifully filmed. If it has any real weaknesses, you won't read about them here-cause I didn't see any.<br/><br/>***1/2 outta ****, hole in one of course."

Unfortunately, the humor was completely unintentional.  The acting by the supporting cast was pretty shaky.

The acting of the three leads wasn't too bad.  Will Smith was fairly charming as the title character, and Damon and Theron were fine in their own right, but chemistry between them was lacking.  <br/><br/>This movie failed to hold my interest as a golf movie, a sports movie, a love story, or a tale of redemption.<br/><br/>Go see The Legend of Bagger Vance -- just leave your mind at home."

","""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" is one of those movies that comes around and defines a sport.  ""The Natural"" did it for baseball, ""He Got Game"" did it for basketball, and ""Any Given Sunday"" did it for football.  Now, golf has a movie to call its own.  ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" is a stunning and magical journey about the sport and a few souls who are affected by it.<br/><br/>""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" is the story of two people whose lives are directly affected by a drifter named Bagger Vance, played by Will Smith. Those two people are Rannulph Junuh, played by Matt Damon, and Hardey Greaves, played by J. Michael Moncrief.  Junuh is a WWI veteran who was once known as a great golfer, maybe the greatist.  His experience in the war left him shaken, and he loses his swing.  Hardey Greaves is a child who loves golf and wants to be just like Junuh.  His father is another victim of the Great Depression, and is made to sweep the streets.  Junuh is invited by his former girlfriend, Adele (Charlize Theron), to compete against two of the best golfers in the world in an exhibition match for $10,000.  Bagger Vance tries to help Junuh find his ""authentic swing"" before the big match.<br/><br/>""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" seems to be more than a movie.  It has a life of its own.  Robert Redford employs some beautiful cinematography which gives the movie a magical air.  However, some people may see it as too much of a ""Halmark card"", but to each his own.  I especially liked the scenes where everything disappears but the course, they really draw you in.  Some have called the dialogue hokey, but I just think they were trying to keep it in that time period.  Remember, people did talk like that.  The only real flaw in this movie is the beginning.  The exposition seems to move way to quickly, and they ask you to ingest a lot of background information.  But, it was based on a book which had as long as it wanted to explain things, and we only have two hours.  So, this isn't really a bad thing.<br/><br/>In the end, I came out of ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" feeling good.  It does the sport of golf justice in a way no other movie has."

I saw an interview with Will Smith where he said that he enjoyed doing this film so much he would have done this movie for free.  (Well maybe for ""Five dollars guaranteed."")  Jeremy Leven provided the groundwork with a powerful screenplay, and director Robert Redford made it all work with an insightful interpretation. I highly recommend renting the DVD and watching the special features.  Redford provides an insight into the vision he intended to create.  I found this feature interesting and educational.  I only have one question for him: What's up with all of the free flowing alcohol at the peak of Prohibition? I know everyone still drank, but did they do it so openly?"
"Old Joe","Null","0","1","29 March 2002"," Some things can't be learned, they must be remembered
","I am not a big golf fan, but after watching this movie, I have a greater appreciation of what a game like golf can do for the individuals that play it, and what it can do for a small town's moral. This movie is as good to the game of golf, as what the name Tiger Woods has been to this popular sport, in my view.<br/><br/>This is the story of Rannulph Junuh, a promising young golfer who loses his swing after he experiences the harrowing frontlines of war. Once considered Savannah's greatest sportsman and favourite celebrity, Junuh had won the heart of the town's prettiest heiress, Adele Invergordon. But when he returned from war he was a defeated man, giving up both golf and Adele for the sake of alcohol. When Junuh is given a chance to redeem himself by competing in a celebrity golf tournament, he must first regain his swing and his self-respect. It will take a miracle, in the form of a mysterious caddy named Bagger Vance, for Junuh to get his game back as well as his life.<br/><br/>
The cast of The legend of Bagger Vance is first class. The star performance for me, is that of Will Smith as Vance. Now the movie-going public would think of Smith as only an action man, but in this film he proves that he can take on more diverse, dramatic roles. In fact, I quite like him as the Bagger Vance character myself. Then you have Matt Damon, the young Hollywood actor, who has a great time in the movie world in the last few years. He was terrific as the down and out Junuh. He was also brilliant in the movie that he helped to write, that of Good Will Hunting, alongside fellow young star Ben Affleck and legend actor Robin Williams. To cap the cast of The legend of Bagger Vance off you have the beautiful Charlize Theron, who played the gorgeous and concerned town lady, Adele.  She has had a good career, with some other roles including Devil's Advocate, The Cider House Rules and 15 Minutes to name just a few.<br/><br/>The director of The Legend Of Bagger Vance, is the recent Academy award hall of fame recipient, Robert Redford. He has had a good career onscreen, but I never realised how good he was offscreen. He has directed some great movies, with an Oscar for his directing of the movie Ordinary people. I love the small touches he put to this film, the way that the movie was told to the audience via old eyes, but we view through young eyes, was very ingenious. In some movies the time that is trying to be shown is not that accurate, however I feel  Redford got the right look for the time that he was trying to reenact.  <br/><br/>In addition to all this, the sport that was being shown off in this movie was given a good light. Making the tournament a do or die battle for the town of Savannah and to see how important it was for the people, shows how great a game Golf can be. Sport is good in the way that it gets people closer, especially in a time of need.<br/><br/>So all in all, I can only praise this great movie. It was a funny and a touching film that had a great cast. This movie can help people that feel they are out of luck and are no longer good enough, to have some hope, if they can once again believe in themselves. I guess I can relate to that feeling, as in one time I felt that I was not good enough to be able to do anything. But now I am a person who has learnt that anything is possible, if you give it a try. Be motivated by the one film that can teach you anything.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10 or  4.5 Stars"
"max31","7","0","1","4 November 2000"," Good Film: The Natural Plays A Golf Course
","My, my, what nerves have been touched, judging by the comments.<br/><br/>This is a good film, and I appreciate anybody who makes a film about golf. It's lush, beautifully photographed, and well-acted, particularly by the second-tier actors. However, I am always a bit cautious about watching Hollywood do mysticism in sports. It's a bit like reading user comments by people who don't play golf. It's a bit like watching Hollywood do the American South.<br/><br/>Bagger Vance is similar to many of the characters you can read about in true-life accounts of mysticsm. If you live long enough and welcome it, you will probably have an experience similar to Matt Damon's character. A strange person enters your life, doesn't seem quite human, seems to have direct knowledge of events and conditions most of us don't, and after helping, he leaves. It isn't so unusual. My guess is, it happens more often than we know. Somebody once went to Boris Pasternak and criticized Dr. Zhivago for having too many amazing events, to many  coincidences. Too many people who hadn't met in years just bumping into each other. Pasternak replied in so many words, if you don't believe in that, it's because you don't know Russia. That's how things are there. You expect them to happen because they're commonplace.So, the Will Smith character is completely reasonable, and the performance properly underplayed. Zen master/yogis generally don't get too excited or loud. <br/><br/>There were some nice moments in the editing and sound. In our theater, at least, the movie opens in silence. The Fox logo comes up, and you expect the trumpets, but it's all quiet until we see Jack Lemmon playing golf. The very climax of the golfing also happens in silence. If I had to read anything mystical in that, it might be that our greatest achievement might be to reach the level of the Absolute, which is silence. By the way, I got the impression that Bagger Vance maybe saves the life of the Jack Lemmon character. It's subtle, but it is suggested. <br/><br/>This is the kind of film you really want to see in a movie theater. It will lose a lot when it shrinks to the VCR and DVD. I forget the name of the course they shot it on, but the course itself is one of the charcters.<br/><br/>
It will be a while before we know if anything spoken in the film drops into our day-to-day usage. Nobody says, ""Be the ball"", but the movie does have some good moments. For people who don't play sports, a lot of what Bagger Vance says makes no sense, such as when he says Matt Damon needs to see the field clearly. WHAT? Well, there was a book or article written maybe 20 years ago by George Leonard, in which he discusses how the great basketball players have ""soft eyes"", a vision which pulls in much more than the average player can see. It's inherent in us, but rarely developed.<br/><br/>
Anyway, this is a good film, but one that challenges the viewer. If you don't believe in things you don't believe in, it's like watching fog. If you have had experiences in athletics or meditating, much of it will make sense."

Redford and writers, et. al., are not saying that life is like a golf course, they are saying that life is a game, and more specifically, your life is your game, and it is what you make it.  Junuh's game just happened to be golf.  Baggar, who I believe represents God, has to gain Junuh's trust, as his caddie, so that he can deliver one simple message, ""I'm here, and I've always been here.""  That's it, that's what it's all about."

This is a movie about your ability to overcome an obstacle when the cards are stacked against you.  This is a movie about finding yourself when you thought you couldn't.

It would have provided a positive balance and karmic payback for all his life's mistakes (etc.). It would have given enough true artistic glory for him to bask in for the remainder of his days. Funny thing is, as much as I respected and admired that movie, I've never seen it again since that first time. ""Bagger Vance"" is different, though. It is even better than anything Redford has ever done before-- and that's saying A LOT-- and I will for sure go and see this one again. Maybe twice more. It is uplifting. It is easy to love.<br/><br/>""Bagger Vance"" is: ""The Natural"" meets ""A River Runs Through It"" meets ""Good Will Hunting."" Sort of. It is about redemption, grace, mystery, and power. What makes it special is that the mysticism isn't magic. It isn't science fiction, or some far out fantasy deal. Rather, it is the actual, real, human mystery and magic that all of us live every day.<br/><br/>Some critics may not like this movie, because as a rule, the pretentious, dysfunctional geeks who usually write movie reviews for a living are frightened when made to feel a bit more emotion or reality than they're used to. There are exceptions, of course, but... Feel sorry for those poor, repressed souls! ""Bagger Vance"" is exuberant, lofty, loving, exciting, and meaningful.

","Publicity pictures featuring the winning smiles of Will Smith, Matt Damon, and Robert Redford hunched over his laptop, were enough of an incentive for me to go see ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"". I'd refrained from reading about it, and so when it immediately became evident that the subject matter was golf, I almost regretted my choice. But then I recalled that I'd thoroughly enjoyed Tin Cup (also about golf), Field of Dreams (baseball), and Bull Durham (baseball). So I sat back, relaxed, and enjoyed. I don't think it's a good idea to tell the plot, and not because there's a mystery or surprise involved; but rather because the plot and the golf are there to celebrate the human spirit, determination, hope, love, and other such uplifting ideas. The ""legend"" aspect of the movie is actually reminiscent of ""Field of Dreams"". Legends and romantic stories are supposed to make you feel better - and this is exactly what this film does. Oh, yes: and the opening scenes of Savannah, Georgia, look very much like those in ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"". Which isn't a bad thing at all!

The Will Smith character was more silly than ethereal and the long presentation of the big championship was almost completely predictable.

"bedazzle","6","0","1","7 August 2001"," authenticity, interpretation
","Interpretation, spoilers:<br/><br/>Junuh, having spent many years as the local hero, becomes disillusioned when he discovers that his heroism does not cross over to the battle field. It takes Bagger Vance to teach Junuh that things such as heroic glory are of no importance compared to authenticity. <br/><br/>For those of you current on modern ideas, the term `authentic' should immediately be recognized as an earmark of existentialism. Basically, in a godless world completely devoid of any intrinsic meaning, meaning can only be found in living `true to oneself,' authentically. To live for external rewards such as glory in the sporting arena is futile, because both winning and losing amount to the same thing in a meaningless world. Meaning can only be found subjectively through one's personal experience, existentially. Thus, both life and golf `can only be played, not won.'<br/><br/>
The movie is basically a look at Junuh's gradual attainment of authenticity. His early days of golf stardom serve as a gigantic obstacle, because Junuh mistakenly believes that his authentic life is the same as his life of fame. The war shatters this ill-founded illusion, and now Junuh must come to grips with reality. <br/><br/>Bagger has a sort of method in imparting authenticity onto Junuh. First, everything must be taken cheerfully calmly. Go with the flow and be yourself. There is no point frustrating yourself with the game of golf or the game of life. For Junuh, either his authentic self is a good golfer or it isn't, bellyaching will change absolutely nothing. Second, in order to be yourself, you must forget everyone else. This is symbolically shown when the crowd becomes imperceptible to Junuh, `it is just you and the ball.' This existential dictum is also demonstrated by Hardy's overcoming his shame of his father and his job. Hardy realizes that his father is living authentically by doing what he feels best, and the crowd reaction has no relevance whatsoever. Lastly, given the subjective nature of authenticity, it must be learned subjectively. Vance cannot just tell Junuh what to do. He can only prod and must let Junuh learn himself from his gains and mistakes.<br/><br/>
This last point is illustrated by Junuh's misuse of the iron driver and by Vance's last hole vacancy. Vance cannot be around at the end, he needs Junuh to fully realize that he can only depend on himself to find his true self. When Vance allows Junuh to make the iron mistake, one of a few impediments to authenticity is shown. The three impediments in tension throughout the movie are: Junuh's heroism, Jones' perfectionism, and Hagen's womanization. Placing any one of these three dead ends over authenticity will leave one with a fake happiness. During the iron mistake, Junuh becomes infatuated with heroism, women, and the need for a perfect shot again. Thus the consequent fiasco. <br/><br/>Luckily, he overcomes, and the movie concludes that through authenticity one attains true happiness. Junuh attains his true love of golf, his love of his woman, and everything works out. But, to be consistent, these last two triumphs should be taken as symbolically representing happiness. Authenticity is the major objective given, and Junuh is not happy because he has a girl and his game, but because he has himself. `The game can only be played, not won.'"

","The overall production is okay.  Matt Damon is getting better with every film. Will Smith is okay.  Charlize Theron has been better cast.  Robert Redford should seek retirement or another film with Barbra Striesand.<br/><br/>However, the uncanny end with Jack Lemmon commenting on his life as Bagger Vance and walking into death is riviting - considering this is the last film he ever made (that I am aware of) and the last scene in the film is of his death - prophetic? Errie!"

","In my previous review of the excellent film The Legend of Bagger Vance, I seem to have made the unforgivable mistake of identifying Jack Lemmon's character as the elderly Rannulph Junuh, which closer inspection will reveal to be untrue. He is, in fact, an elderly Hardy Grieves, the young boy who believed so strongly in Junuh back in the 30s. How could I possibly have missed that..."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","1","28 July 2001"," Robert Redford should be recognized just for making a good movie out of the most boring `sport' on the planet.
","Making an entertaining film about a sport as dull as golf is challenging enough, but The Legend of Bagger Vance is not only entertaining, it is also meaningful and thought provoking. And on top of that, I saw it about two days after Jack Lemmon died, so his role in the film was that much more effective to me. With a film that metaphorically compares the pastime of golf with life there is sure to be comparisons to movies like Tin Cup, which set out with a very similar premise, but the Legend of Bagger Vance is not just a remake on the success of Tin Cup, it is worthy and meaningful in its own way.<br/><br/>(spoilers) The most obvious difference between the two is the fact that we see a much stronger spiritual presence here, specifically in the character of Bagger Vance, played with almost freaky charm by Will Smith. Bagger remains by Rannulph Junuh's side, providing help only when he wants to, as Junuh searches for the faults in his life and seeks to change them. In a vivid flashback, we see Junuh in battle during World War I, and he gives an order to advance which costs the life of every one of his men, and he is so grief stricken that he disappears, unable to face a hero's welcome upon returning home. He ultimately returns after an absence of over a decade, but finds that the world, including Adele Invergordon, his love, has moved on, and he winds up filling the resulting emptiness in his soul with alcohol and reducing himself to a meager existence. <br/><br/>Adele, meanwhile, is struggling to maintain the Invergordon golf resort, left to her by her father's suicide, which resulted from a decline in business due to the Great Depression. She proposes to have a highly publicized `exhibition match,' pitting golf greats Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen against each other, with the eventual addition of Junuh, after a widespread insistence to have a local competitor in the match and also after the reluctant dismissal of serious doubts that Junuh, the town's golf hero of the past, will ever be the great golfer that he once was. It takes some serious convincing to get Junuh to play the match after his predictable refusal, and what follows is the contradictory portion of the film, indeed, one of its only shortcomings. <br/><br/>We know right away that Junuh won't just agree to play the match, but when he does, he is visibly nervous at the town convention when all three golfers are introduced on stage. Junuh gets by far the loudest applause, yet he still takes off after the reception, only to change his mind and go back when he sees a few people cheering him from the side of the road as he drives by. It's a good scene, but it's strange that these few people changed his mind while the crowds of thrilled fans that responded so eagerly to his introduction only seemed to make him want to leave. <br/><br/>However, this is a film in which even the slightest bit of nitpicking can be catastrophic, because when viewed as a whole, the movie is stunningly creative. It starts off with an elderly Rannulph Junuh having a heart attack on a golf course (his fifth in ten years), which is followed by the entire film, told in the form of a flashback of his life up until that point. We are introduced to Bagger Vance, who is unquestionably of celestial origin, and at the closing scene, in which Bagger waves the elderly Junuh across the golf course (concluding Junuh's `search for his place in the field'), we realize that the heart attack that he had at the film's opening was fatal, and what followed was roughly two hours of his life as it flashed before his eyes while he died. That is simply a brilliant way to structure a film like this. <br/><br/>As is so often the case with Redford's films, The Legend of Bagger Vance is littered with stunning shots of the beauty of nature. Redford is very fond of presenting nature in a favorable way, and he does it extensively in this film. There are also several examples of Biblically originated messages and spiritual symbolisms. There is a scene where Junuh is stubbornly insisting on attempting a tremendously difficult shot, against Bagger's advice, and Bagger says, `There's a time to hit that shot, and there's a time to leave it in the bag. Which one do you feel this is?' This is a point of view taken directly from the Bible, much like that song by The Byrds, `Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season).' Ecclesiastes 3:1  3:8, I believe. There is also an allusion to Heaven and Hell when Bagger suggests to Junuh that he can just send a difficult shot off into the trees and relax. He is placing temptation at Junuh's feet, testing him, a test which he passes, but it is not until Junuh insists on accepting a penalty for accidentally moving the ball slightly - even though no one else saw it and even his opponents do not want the penalty administered  that Bagger walks off into the sunset, no longer needed. <br/><br/>The Legend of Bagger Vance is a film that focuses attention on the importance of leading a meaningful life by placing it entirely in the perspective of a man who is at death's door and is looking back at how he lived his own life. He clearly did not live a perfect life, he made many mistakes, but he was a good man. He was honest, he grieved for the lives that he had cost in battle, whether or not the deaths really were his fault, and he loved. He and Adele eventually did get that dance, and he died a happy and fulfilled person. Robert Redford has created another powerful and beautiful film, so enjoy it and learn from it."

","I had heard  mixed reviews of this movie but being a duffer myself and because I like both Matt Damon and Will Smith, it seemed worth giving it a try and I'm glad I did. The plot was not as predictable as it might have been,in fact, it was quite poignant.  And, without giving away any plot details, there is great value in seeing this last movie performance of Jack Lemmon."

","This movie, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever made.  Whether you enjoy watching or playing golf or whether you absolutely can't stand golf at all this is a movie I would recommend to everyone.  It has all the elements to make one terrific movie, sports, comedy, suspense, and romance.  All the actors give stellar performances.  In conclusion it's one awesome movie!!!!!!!!!!!"
"chrisbrown6453","9","0","2","12 July 2001"," A very good story, The Legend of Bagger Vance sinks a hole in one!
","The Legend of Bagger Vance is directed by Robert Redford and tells a story about winning, losing and the need for redemption, from the perspective of an American professional golfer and war veteran.<br/><br/>Set in Savannah, Georgia, The Legend of Bagger Vance introduces the triumphant Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) a golfer whose winning swings earned him the admiration of his townspeople and the affection of the wealthy and beautiful Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron). A man whose identity had always revolved around winning, Junuh suffers an identity crisis after failing in battle and witnessing the loss of all the soldiers of his platoon. After a prolongued absence, Junuh --a defeated man-- returns to post WWI Savannah. Conflicts arise when Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief), a young boy with an inspiring confidence in Junuh, ""volunteers"" the ex-golfer to represent the state in an upcoming and unprecedented national golf tournament with top players Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill). As if prompted by Junuh's resistance, the mystical character of Bagger Vance (Will Smith) encounters the troubled man, offers to become his caddy and to help him find his winning game.<br/><br/>The Legend of Bagger Vance successfully establishes the act of playing golf as a metaphor for living and defines its players' commitment toward winning as representative of people's capacity and willingness to embrace life. In this sense, The Legend of Bagger Vance transcends the specifics of the sport of golf, while using these to deliver the notion that the discipline, sensibility and motivation required to win the game applies to all pursuits in life. The Legend of Bagger Vance benefits from the captivating cinematography of Michael Ballhaus which provides a naturalistic setting for a simple story to unfold. Although not focusing deeply on the climate of the Depression, The Legend of Bagger Vance does comment on the tragic quality of a demoralized society, of its struggle with poverty, and of its need for a motivational figure. Thus, while the character of Rannulph Junuh exemplifies the possibility of the existence of such a figure, the abstract character of Bagger Vance personifies the concept of the irrepressible conscience that guides, moralizes and offers the opportunity for redemption. Although romanticized, this premise finds a clear mission and renders The Legend of Bagger Vance a memorable experience."

","I've seen this movie on the big screen and the small screen. Regardless of the screen size this movie reaches out to touch you on a spiritual level. The story being told isn't merely about golf but about LIFE. I'm not a huge fan of golf although this movie still held me transfixed.<br/><br/>Will Smith gave one of his best performances as the guiding force in Runnulph Junuh's (Matt Damon) coming to terms with life after the World War. Smith's character, Bagger Vance, is also a guiding force for Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief and Jack Lemmon) throughout his life. Jack Lemmon narrates throughout the movie as the voice of a grown Hardy Greaves.<br/><br/>This movie has a subtly powerful ending."
"VernonPope","8","0","2","1 July 2001"," I knew I liked the lead performers . . .
","so I gave it a shot, and it was worth the time.  After being disappointed with Smith in ""Wild, Wild West,"" I was glad to see him in something with more substance, and this really came through for him.  He never gets his feathers ruffled, and always has the right answer for the situation - leading me to believe he may be much more than he seems.  But the ending, when the (now a very senior adult) kid who helped him caddy is leaving the golf course and Vance is waving to him to ""come on,"" I felt he must have been something like an Angel.<br/><br/>All in all, a very real film about normal people having to deal with very real problems.  Nearly every living war vet can relate to this one."

Seemly a golfing movie it soon leaves this premise far behind as it takes us into the realm of the mystical and of the spirit and will of mankind. It is totally engrossing and a bright star in the resume of Robert Redford. An actor director who has given us of his talents for more than forty years, a gift for which we must be truly grateful"
"Marie-7","Null","0","2","2 June 2001"," Nice, easy, feel good movie
","Picking this movie apart has been done by many but I loved it -- and I didn't expect to like it that much. I am a senior citizen but I love Will Smith and Matt Damon and think Charlize Theron is most beautiful and elegant. I am not a golf fan but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story is soft and comfy and I hope everyone noted only one 4-letter word. Hooray!!!  It's not Citizen Kane but it is very watchable and I would recommend it to non-golfers also.  Will Smith is a delight - when he wants to be soft and gentle no one else can touch him. The young Hardy was a great choice and Jack Lemmon (uncredited) as the older Hardy was perfect. What a classy person Jack Lemmon is. All of the actors seem to be right for the part they play. I give this movie a 10 because it made me feel good and it should be viewed for what it is and not what someone else wants it to be. <br/><br/>Watch it and just revel in the scenery and the niceness of the whole thing."
"WillPowerATL","5","0","1","21 October 2000"," A Supermodel film: Beautiful but without substance
","This film definitely has a 'Robert Redford' feel to it.  It has some beautiful cinematography and a wonderful style to it.  Beyond that, however, it falls short of being a good film.  To begin with, the film is full of unbelievable moments.  Although suspension of disbelief is an important part of watching any film, this one pushes the limits.  Not only are the golf scenes a bit impossible, but such scenes as the one where the black caddie lounges in the white locker room are not easy to swallow.<br/><br/>Also detracting from the film is the lack of closure or depth to any of the storylines.  We have a character scarred by war who neither explains his story nor comes to terms with it.  We have a boy at odds with his father, and the two never have a meaningful conversation but just miraculously appear to be reunited.  We have a girl left to wait ten years for her man, who simply welcomes him back without ever speaking her mind or seeking retribution.  Even the framing sequence is without substance.  None of the stories are resolved with any satisfaction, although all are glossed over to make for a happy ending.<br/><br/>Finally, the actors are strong, but don't seem to fit their roles. Charlize Theron's accent is awkward, Matt Damon has trouble pulling off drunk and jaded, and the jovial Will Smith is implausible as the sage mentor.  The best roles are filled by the young boy and the two competing golfers, but none of them are written with any great depth.<br/><br/>In the end, there are no lessons learned, no big point to be driven home, no gripping emotional realizations.  It is a beautifully shot film...about golf.  If you get anything out of it except for ""golf is good,"" then let me know.  Believe it or not, I enjoyed the film a bit, but I was disappointed in the fact that it could have been so much more.  If I had paid to see it, I would have probably been more than disappointed--I may have been angry. Do yourself a favor and wait for the video version."
