","i have just watched this movie for the first time today, and I must say that I don't understand why I listened to the other reviews. All I heard was that the acting was horrible and the story was bland and so on. I will say that the opening scene is a bit too empty, but then Christina starts singing and you forget all about it. The cast is amazing: for the guys we have Christina Aguilera, Kristen Bell, Julianne Hough, Chelsea Traille and the rest of the girls, even Dianna Agron; for the ladies we have Eric Dane and of course the sculptured Cam Gigandet; of course we can't forget about the acting powerhouse that is Stanley Tucci playing the gay best friend that every woman wishes she had (especially if he is that good looking); and we can't forget about Peter Gallagher and Alan Cumming. There is a lot more eye candy from all the boys that work at Burlesque. The story is somewhat predictable but I find that the way it is told, between music and extra little drama in the background, makes it perfect. Just hearing Christina Aguilera singing is enough to carry the story along. Cher has a solo about halfway through the movie that brings you back to one of the main issues in the background which makes for a very powerful solo thanks to that story and the power of Cher's voice makes it even more dramatic. The writing is exquisite due to a main reason, it is perfectly real. It is not full of extra fluff and puff just to create some kind of big moment. It has lots of funny in it, but very subtle . Bottom line is, the script is simple, to the point and every line sounds like something you would hear somebody say in real life. Many films have all that dialogue that you know nobody would ever say but it makes for those big moment, but the simplicity in this movie is what makes me like it so much. It is a simple film, with an amazing cast, that I believe has been completely overlooked. I have a theory as to why it has been overlooked...the marketing for it wasn't very good, it only focused on Cher and Christina and it made very little reference to any of the other amazing people in it or even to the story. The trailer makes it sound like it is all about the dancing and sining, but there is an actual story behind it all. The love story is only partially shown on the trailer, there isn't even one image of Eric Dane or Peter Gallagher, there is too much information about the dancing part as well, I personally think they should have left a little mystery on the dancing and singing and added some more of the story into it. <br/><br/>That's just what I think. Enjoy."

","First of all; I didn't know what to expect from this feature. I hoped it would be fun to watch at least. Normally I would discard the idea of watching a movie featuring singers in the leads.<br/><br/>But I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.<br/><br/>As a whole, the film was beautifully shot, the costumes, set decors were all wonderful. Christina Aguilera was never prettier than in this picture.<br/><br/>Concerning Aguilera, I was blown away by her acting (not implying it was Oscar worthy), for the simple, fresh and down-to-earth character, she put out there. She was believable as this nice country girl destined for bigger things - if you know Aguilera's life story, you know what I mean. And she pulled it off to a 't'.<br/><br/>Also a nice refreshing thing this movie did, in my opinion: were the core values it expressed. Although show business, and especially burlesque dancing, have a way of being over-the-top sexy and sometimes promiscuous. A typical story in that setting could have had more sleazy behavior, sleeping around, back-stabbing and such. But no. Even the antagonists had a way of being somewhat nice and apologetic in their own ways.<br/><br/>The clichéd rivalry has a place in this, but although being a cliché in itself it never becomes cliché as itself. You would expect dangerous backstabbing. It never happens like that.<br/><br/>At the end there even is a little plot twist, concerning the fate of the club. It's a semi twist. But it works.<br/><br/>Although I am enthusiastic and glad to have seen this, there is a huge plot hole, I was concerned with. Halfway through the movie Ali saves the show by beginning to sing. It's pretty clear that the mics aren't working, it being a playback show. But still there are mics on stage. So if we forget this one hole, there is an immediate second hole. As if she has a hidden portable mic she is singing, passing the mics to the front of the stage, being completely audible for everyone present. Which isn't plausible.<br/><br/>That said, I had a truly great time watching this. It certainly the best in it's genre (a musical romantic drama).<br/><br/>Certainly worth your time, if you like this sort of thing."

","At times I can be a bit snobby about movies. I am more attracted to slow artsy fartsy movies that try make grand points about society or existence. However, not all movies are to meant to challenge social structures or deliver underlying meanings and here there certainly is none of that.... and I liked it! <br/><br/>Burlesque is a little cheesy, yup, filled with clichés, uh huh, predictable, you betcha! That is all part of it's charm though. It set out to be a fun romp with some sexy outfits and entertaining song numbers and it delivered. There is no great villain, there is no great backstabbing - which in someways is more realistic. It doesn't try to have an overly deep plot. It knows it's superficial and embraces it. Did anyone ever doubt Christina could sing? Her voice is amazing and her acting ain't bad either. Cher is well, Cher and how can anyone not love her? Stanley Tucci certainly steals the show while Cam Gigandet provides some delicious eye candy. If you want to be visually and audibly entertained for about an hour and a half, shut your brain off, sit back and enjoy Burlesque. Disclaimer: this recommendation does not pertain to men, unless you are a man of the Cher-loving variety. Despite a burlesque club technically being a 'strip club' this movie is certainly geared for the ladies."
"bjones","7","13","14","17 February 2011"," Entertaining
","I waited a long time to write this review. I liked the film a great deal but I'm not so sure everyone will. It is entertaining in the way of old fashioned entertainment. Other people in the theater I attended liked it a lot also. That was easy to ascertain by the loud comments both during and after the film.<br/><br/>The story, itself, is a little shallow, mainly it's there as a means to fill in the space in between the elaborate musical numbers. However, the story is enough for the vehicle it carries, happy ending and all.<br/><br/>Cher, as the club owner Tess, has top billing but the entire show is undoubtedly Christina Aguilera as country-girl turned burlesque performer Ali. I'm old enough to say that in my life I've seen most of the premiere singing performers of modern times, many in live concert. Little Christina Aguilera is not just in a class by herself. Ms. Aguilera is in another universe, perhaps even another dimension. Her voice has a tonal quality, a power and a range that is nothing short of staggering. But the best part is that she knows how to make fullest use of that magnificent instrument.<br/><br/>Every second that Christina Aguilera is on screen she is absolutely riveting. You can't take your eyes off of her; and not just because she's remarkably beautiful. Here she is in this film, surrounded by a good number of extremely beautiful and talented women, yet they all seem to fade into the background fog when she is on. She has something more than beauty. She radiates raw animal magnetism and positively smolders in some kind of unidentifiable sexual power that just plain overshadows everything around her. In short, this film is well worth watching just for Aguilara's screen time.<br/><br/>If you can tear yourself away from watching Christina, there is more here to see. All the participants turn in great performances. All the dancers surrounding her are talented and wonderful to watch. All together they create very memorable entertainment. Kristen Bell as Nikki and Julianne Hough as Georgia are great but it's Bell who is the surprise. Being so used to seeing her as the usual blonde adornment in romantic comedies she surprised me with her dancing talent. She's really good. And, Hough is a given in a dancing costume; as flawlessly great as she is beautiful.<br/><br/>For me, the performance I enjoyed the most other than Christina's was Stanley Tucci as Sean. Mr. Tucci is a great talent who adds character and charm to everything he does and he won't disappoint anyone here.<br/><br/>I saved any negatives for last and none have anything to do with the cast. I found I didn't like the sound the way it was presented. The techniques they used tended to make the performances almost look like they were all canned/lip synced. I'm sure they thought the vocals had more power the way they did them but it truthfully detracted from the overall presentation.<br/><br/>The decision to make a PG-13 rated film was, no doubt, made to try and capture the kiddie ticket buyers. I honestly feel that if they actually pulled out the stops and made an honest R rated film with a more adult slant it would have been better and more profitable in the long run. To me, trying to make anything called ""BURLESQUE"" anything other than an adult film just seems ludicrous on the face of it.<br/><br/>In spite of the negatives it's still entertaining. I'll take friends to see it with a clear conscience.<br/><br/>By Bruce L. Jones<br/><br/>http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/"

","Well this movie is amazing. The entire feel is Moulin Rouge meets Sex and the city. <br/><br/>From the dances, the costumes, the make up, the hair dos, everything was so freshly daring. The entire look of the movie was so perfect for the entire dramatic effect that this movie required and could easily pull off.<br/><br/>Both the actresses, Christina and Cher, were splendid with their vocals and their acting. Although Cher has been seen on and off the silver screen, this was Chistina's first major venture and she sizzled on screen.<br/><br/>The only pitfall for the entire movie was its very predictable and very sugary story line. There were no real black moments. Maximum it touched was a few shades of gray.<br/><br/>But if you enjoy musicals and have a penchant for dramatics, this is a perfect watch."
"markdelguado","6","90","120","27 November 2010"," Almost Bob Fosse
","The musical numbers reminded me of ""Sweet Charity"" and the camera moves around the Kit Kat Klub style room like Fosse's camera did in ""Cabaret"" The similarities stop there. The film is a brave attempt but the writing walks a very, very thin line. Was Steve Antin trying to be funny? Some of the lines were received with loud guffaws and there is no way to know if that was the intention because, personally, I felt like cringing. Never mind. It was fun. Christina has a powerful voice but not film presence and Cher is a fearless icon but she had so little to show for it. The best performance is, without question, by Stanley Tucci. The songs work at the moment you're watching them being performed but I couldn't hum a tune now, 48 hours later, for the life of me. So, I was entertained and in the big scheme of things, I guess that's enough"

","OK is impossible not to compare this film to Chicago or Nine. Nearly as good as Chicago in my opinion, way better than the disappointing Nine Not an epic musical but the music is great for 'burlesque' mood Christina is way better than expected. actually all of the cast did great some good dialogues although the plot is very predictable overall. it was though difficult to understand the time (decade) the film is set. i am fan of such films therefore the 8. if i didn't like musicals the rating would be lower i suppose. great musical performances by Christina and Cher choreography is good loved the scene with the cookies ( you will see - no spoilers!)"
"Gordon-11","Null","7","7","8 February 2011"," Burlesque!
","This film is about a small town girl from Iowa who goes to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of dancing and singing.<br/><br/>""Burlesque"" is very enjoyable on many levels. The costumes and sets are dazzling, and the dances are great. The moves are seductive but not erotic, and I commend the choreographers for getting this fine balance right. Christina Aguilera has always been known for her powerful voice, and in ""Burlesque"" her voice and singing skills are brilliantly displayed.<br/><br/>In some films, the abundance of songs can make the film like an extended music video, or is awkward or forced. In ""Burlesque"" there is no such problem. The speaking scenes and singing scenes transit smoothly from one another. Another thing I really like about this film is the witty lines, they made me laugh so many times! I never thought ""Burlesque"" could be so good, I think it should have made a lot more in the box office."
"iheart_ny","10","128","188","30 November 2010"," Burlesque: The return of the movie-musical!
","When I originally heard of the concept for Steven Antin's Burlesque, a movie musical starring pop phenom Christina Aguilera and the legendary Cher, I was, if you could believe it, less than enthusiastic. I was under the assumption that this film would be not just bad, but god awful. Recalling horrid pop star film debuts (ex. Mariah Carey in the depressingly hollow Glitter, Britney Spears in the mind-numbing Crossroads) I thought I was in for a cinematic train wreck of epic proportions. And I'm happy to tell you today, that I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>First of all, what makes Burlesque unlike Glitter and Crossroads is its aesthetics. Christina Aguilera's strong voice is enough to carry a film, as it turns out. However, Burlesque has more to fall back on. Cher plays Tess, Aguilera's character's boss and mentor. She can make any film excellent. Secondly, this film is a musical, also unlike Glitter and Crossroads. It shoots for being something of a hybrid between Cabaret and Chicago, and doesn't completely fail. Thirdly, this film has an outstanding supporting cast, including the always great Stanley Tucci, Grey's Anatomy vet Eric Dane, Kristen Bell, Cam Gigandet, and Alan Cumming, and these folks bring enough liveliness to save even the worst film, but here, they only add to the fun and excitement.<br/><br/>The story is really nothing new. Small-town girl Ali (Aguilera) leaves her job as an Iowan waitress, and heads for the big lights of Los Angeles. She stumbles upon a burlesque club run by Tess (Cher), starts working her way up, and eventually becomes the main attraction, with her intense vocal range and elaborate interpretations of dance numbers, which turns out to be a godsend for Tess, who is about to lose her club. She starts living with the charismatic and sexy bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet), after her apartment gets robbed. Romance ensues, and things go from there.<br/><br/>Cliché, right? It's been done before, right? Right. There isn't a section of this film that isn't even a little bit corny. But, that's not to say it's not a load of fun. I'm sorry, Harry Potter, Burlesque is the film event of the Thanksgiving holiday. Christina Aguilera isn't a fantastic actress, but she's better than you would expect her to be, and her song-and-dance numbers, obviously, are fantastic, as one would expect.<br/><br/>She and Cher have fantastic chemistry, as well as Cher and Stanley Tucci. All of these actors blend together so well, that they seem to compliment each other, enhancing each performance. And, I was rather disappointed to see that Cher only sang two out of the film's ten musical numbers, but it's safe to say that that's not enough, considering that she can still belt the hell out of these songs. However, Cher's obvious plastic surgeries don't help her performance, considering that her face barely moves throughout the entire picture, but she's still able to pull this role off, somehow.<br/><br/>Steven Antin is a director whom I've never heard of, however, I was fairly impressed. The film is directed with impeccable taste, and the writing is very quick and clever, and humorous, even when a little corny.<br/><br/>However, what really saves Burlesque in the end is its elaborate song- and-dance numbers. Soon after the movie begins, you know what kind of film you're in for. Even as cliché after cliché presents themselves, Burlesque has enough razzle-dazzle magic to outweigh its faults, and to leave you dancing in the aisles as you leave this film."
"slothhead54","8","103","155","17 November 2010"," Pleasantly surprised
","I can easily summarize this film into short sentences. This film has everything, everything but a plot that is. What you should expect from Burlesque is almost two hours of high powered entertainment. Burlesque is just that, entertaining. If you are going to this film to witness a great storyline unfold don't go see this film. However, if you want to be entertained with great vocals from Christina Aguilera and Cher in addition to great acting from Peter Gallagher, Stanley Tucci, Alan Cummings, and again Cher then this film is a must see. I must say prior to the screening that I attended, I was very apprehensive that I was going to see a product that resembled a ""Nine"" / ""Coyote Ugly"" blend of a film, but I was certainly wrong. Burlesque holds itself above the rest of the films in its category. The film obviously cost a lot to produce and I believe that the money was well spent. Cher's performance was excellent. Say what you want about the person, but the actress conveys a confidence level in front of the camera as though she has done this a hundred times. Stanley Tucci is also quite merit worthy in this film. His performance in ""Lovely Bones"" is still haunting and his role as Cher's right-hand gay best friend/costume designer in this film just shows what incredible range this actor has. The costume design, casting, choreography and set design for this film are also worthy of mention. You can count on this film definitely being nominated in the Best Film in Comedy or Musical category for the Golden Globes in December. This film will also do incredibly well at the box office. I would have no problem watching this film again."
"MsMaryE","8","28","38","5 January 2011"," Let Me Entertain You
","Burlesque may have started out as a dazzling, lip-sync singing French twist sensation but when a talented girl from a small town takes center stage belching out loud piercing notes screaming with soul, ""You know something got a hold of you and won't let go.""<br/><br/>The director starts out with scenes in dingy, crusty locations, overshadowed with filtered sunlight to create an outdated, old fashion look. These scenes failed to capture a unique cinematic vision, instead the views were dark and dull. His blend of melodrama and music worked better than Chicago because singing was sung only on stage. No phantom of the opera to bring tears, just a busting out movie that went straight to the point--I want to sing!<br/><br/>Ms small town girl named Ali, played by Christina Aguilera, changed cities but couldn't quite change her waitress uniform. She worked her way to that familiar job, when charmed by neon lights, she opened the door to a new world, Welcome to Burlesque. As she looked around, she watched the bickering and cat fights among the dancers and how shamefully patrons weren't getting their drinks. So, she took charge by befriending Jack the bartender played by Cam Gigandet, then moved from the unemployment line to waiting on tables and serving drinks. Tess, the club owner played by Cher, told her she has great enthusiasm and terrible timing. However, in the midst of all this tension whiplash, Tess told Ali to take off her coat and get to work.<br/><br/>Ali studied hard by reading every burlesque book ever written. She demonstrated a fierce determination that she could do every dance, every scene, step by step better than the other girls at the audition . She was impressive and landed the job. Now here's the catch 22, people pay to see the dancers lip sync to the great stars like Marilyn Monroe's ""Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend."" There is no live singing at Burlesque. What is a girl to do with all that vocal talent? Well, she could be lucky to have a vengeful enemy like Nikki who turns off the pre-recorded music during her lip sync stage performance. Surely for Nikki that has to be the biggest mistake, huge mistake, right? Right. So the rest, as they say, is history! Tess rewrites the whole show around Ali's voice and the small town girl is now center stage on Hollywood Sunset Stripe.<br/><br/>Cher's performance was better than great, it was awesome. She delivers a warm touchy feeling convincing me she owned the club, she loved the club and she wasn't selling her club. Hard set and beautiful, standing tall and confident, singing "" You Haven't Seen the Last of Me;"" Cher is a true goddess, definitive of stage and production. I needed to see more and more of her . You can't get enough of Cher and her makeup, her hair and her famous, I know everything attitude.<br/><br/>Christina is the sweetest part of the movie. She worked Burlesque from the beginning to the end with an Eminem's 8 mile state of mind, you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. Without a doubt, she definitely lost herself in the music, the moment, and the dancing. When you know you got it, you go get it. She wore skimpy cultured pearls, juicy bareback couture glittering with diamonds, and holding ostrich feathers only, as she paraded the stage singing slow songs, old songs and hip hop songs. Her roommate Jack, black eyeliner by night, is the movie's secret eye candy. Well built, nice teeth, and shy, he gives us a little touch of burlesque with his steamy and lusty private moves. And of course we need to mention Sean played by Stanley Tucci. He held the movie together or should I say he held Tess together.<br/><br/>Burlesque is an eye-popping never boring cinematic experience that will entertain you with grandeur songs from the present and the past. As you experience this razzle dazzle movie, you can actually feel the music. To me, Burlesque mirrors Purple Rain's electrifying energy that generated from a club of talented, struggling performers and a sidekick love affair. Christina and Cher in Burlesque will be remembered like Prince in Purple Rain. You have to see it again and again, because true talent never ages, its ageless. I just loved every mind- blowing performance and I'm sure you will too, so GO see it!!"
"rachealsews","8","5","5","25 December 2019"," Great musical numbers, costumes and set design, mediocre acting
","When going to watch Burlesque you first have to know a few things:<br/><br/>1.) You are watching this movie, knowing the acting isn't going to be great, but to see great musical numbers and fantastic costumes.<br/><br/>2.) The acting is partially terrible because of the cliche ridden but not mind-numbing storyline, and corny writing.<br/><br/>3.) Cher is great, but understanbly only contributed two songs. Would have loved to see more Cher action, but she hadn't recorded original songs for 7 years. She is also aging, gracefully, but aging nonetheless. This movie was made for Christina Aguilera.<br/><br/>4.) Christina Aguilera. I have a love/hate relationship with her musical career, but you cannot deny the power of her voice in this film and just in general. Her range, control, vibrato and power are just astounding and really shine in the musical numbers. She also looks fantastic here, and does a great job of playing a believable small-town girl trying to make it big.<br/><br/>4.) Stanley Tucci is a national treasure, and is delightful throughout the film with most of the best lines. The whole cast did a great job as well, but Stanley Tucci is great at playing these types of rolls and you can tell he has total fun with it.<br/><br/>This movie is great if you like musicals and don't mind sitting through a cute but predictable storyline. As a seamstress I am in love with the costumes, particularly the green silk dress Christina wears 3/4 of the way through the film. It's dramatic, got a really beautiful built in corset, and with the minimal makeup, hair and jewelry she is transformed into a goddess."
"jonnyfendi","7","5","5","1 February 2011"," Welcome to Christina's Playground
","Raise the curtain! Before heading to watch thiz movie, I already had my own imagination about how the story would look like, I thought maybe it revolved around a countryside girl who was about to try her luck to chase her dream in a big city (eventually the city is Los Angeles and the girl's name is Ali which is played by Christina Aguilera), maybe she would start from a cloistered but extraordinary nite club (apparently it named Burlesque), maybe she would have a tough beginning for her career and there would be such a mentor for her (I talk about Cher), maybe she was going to meet her love interest, a pretty boy with an attitude (I talk about Cam Gigandet), or maybe she would be forced to quarrel with her envious evil colleague as well (I talk about Kristen Bell). And for the ending I don't have to explain, I give it to you to figure it out yourself, I am pretty sure that you have already know the ending as well, and you are right! In the tradition of ""Coyote Ugly"" (2000) and Rob Marshall's movies such as ""Chicago"" (2002) and ""Nine"" (2009), here it comes a new breed of the genre. The movie is second directing effort after ""Glass House: The Good Mother"" (2006) by former child star of ""The Goonies"" (1985), Steve Antin. Thiz Ali's character is obviously made for Aguilera, it's like let a fish swims freely into the sea. It flows naturally. Cher is a legendary music icon who makes one dimensional impression, there is no specific chemistry with other Cast members, she seems to be talking to herself. Cam Gigandet, after seeing his macho performance previously in ""Never Back Down"" (2008), thiz time he plays more easy-going and fun role. But the worst of the worst is Kristen Bell who delivers a horrible nightmare performance, it's not convincing at all as Ali's competitor. Better performances come from Stanley Tucci, Eric Dane and Allan Cumming. Forget about the Actors, the film once again is an Aguilera's playground. Her powerful voice covers up all the flaws. The opening song ""Something's Got a Hold on Me"" is my favorite with gratifying 1970s Rock 'n' Roll tune. With all those fabulous songs, it comes to my mind why there isn't one single duet song from these two world class performers. Anyway, the dancing and cabaret performances are splendid. Aguilera's performance is very hypnotic and spectacular. In fact, who doesn't want to pay small nite club's cheap ticket that there is a performance from Christina Aguilera. Hello? It is Christina Aguilera on the stage! The story is predictable and the conflict is cliché. It doesn't look like a movie after all. By the way, I didn't come home from a movie. I had just come home from Christina Aguilera's concert. And I am happy! ^_^ <br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

Burlesque delivers on all account, it's sexy without being naked, it's fun, the music is great.<br/><br/>I don't know why so many reviewers here say that Christina Aguilera is a bad actress, she gave quite a decent performance considering that, well, she is not an actress. And while Cher is not on the screen all the time, she is fantastic. For a woman in her sixties, wow...<br/><br/>The movie made me buy the soundtrack, Christina know how to sing and she is very good.<br/><br/>As for the background stories (lounge on the verge of closing, love interest), they are there to give the movie some meaning but are not overly invading on the main content witch is signing and dancing. Those background stories are were the movie lost my 2 points, because you don't quite feel the urgency, stress of Tess money problems, everything runs like there is no problem at all.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a good, entertaining movie.

"JohnRayPeterson","9","4","4","2 March 2011"," Aguilera's brilliant pick of the role in Burlesque to showcase herself in a real Hollywod feature film. BRAVO
","I liked the movie very much so I'll make an valiant effort to sound unbiased. The movie is first and foremost a musical and no attempts to deny that or pass it off as anything but that is appreciated. It is or should be a prime selling point: A musical featuring Christina Aguilera. <br/><br/>The necessary sub-plots do the job adequately and no one will take the drama and romance by-lines for anything more than what they are. Actors like Stanley Tucci, Alan Cumming, Peter Gallagher and James Brolin do not have major roles in this movie and have received lesser billing, Cumming certainly less than Tucci. These are the kind of pros who add quality and value; to the connaisseurs, such names add credibility to the rest of an inexperienced cast. I do not include in the lesser experienced group the likes of CHER nor that of Christina Aguilera obviously. They are both accomplished performers in the same field, which is 'any stage'. <br/><br/>I would like to draw as many parallels to the 1972 musical Cabaret as I could, but I do not write reviews in any formal or official capacity and the right words at this moment fail me in that respect. I will however say that there are close parallels in my opinion such as the same club intimacy feeling, the same artistic professionalism on the part of the musicians, dancers and singers and clearly the artistic family spirit.<br/><br/>I would stop short the comparing 'Burlesque' to other recent good musicals such as Chicago, Idlewild or Dreamgirls. I especially enjoyed 'Idlewild' and mention it in passing because it unfairly did not receive as high a praise and ratings; it certainly did not benefit from the promotional resources of the other two yet it had assuredly the most original storyline of all and excellent musical numbers. <br/><br/>The younger audience should favour Burlesque over Cabaret and vice versa for the older crowd, but each will without hesitation grant the same nod of approval to the movies, 39 years apart in the making. <br/><br/>Christina Aguilera acquitted herself superbly in the strong lead character and Cher may surprise some of you as she did me in her major supporting role. Let's not kid ourselves as to who was lead and who was second fiddle. I was delighted by the relation between the two characters. I sincerely hope I have, as many other reviewers have, helped convince you to see it.<br/><br/>The soundtrack album should be a welcome addition to any Aguilera fan; it gets plenty of play on my sound system."
"alanyuu","7","4","4","13 February 2011"," Starring three octaves and a legend.
","On the actresses:<br/><br/>Cher as usual has her own. I think the songs put on for her allow to produce a great involvement. She shows she's got a voice, dancing moves and positive attitude. Overall, she does what's needed for her role in the film.<br/><br/>Christina Aguilera is given too much light. It tends to make her look like an over-prized luminaire which almost blinds the viewer. Good features and a powerful voice. Seeing a singer without singing lets her hide her voice somewhat, but this could have been handled better. Overall, she gives it her best and it shows.<br/><br/>On the movie: This tends to make it look like a musical but the rags-to-riches plot is too much. The actor who is paired with Christina seems more the puppet to cover a role, yet the small romantic scenery does the movie good by changing the theme. There should have been more role development, other talent displays and maybe that would have given it a better change."

Director Steve Antin handles these early developments with more subtlety and believability than is the norm for films with similar plot lines, allowing us to see the things from the protagonists point of view whilst also comfortably accepting that we may not wish to feel the same way about it, seeing as we have only just been introduced to the girl. As she ventures into this corner of showbiz our mindsets are naturally entwined with hers. Together we encounter the various colourful characters of the club, and see the way they are all either a help, a hindrance or a bystander during her climb from being a simple waitress thanks to the help of a spunky, good-hearted bartender, to becoming their main attraction thanks in part to the clumsy sabotaging of a clearly incompetent rival. The aforementioned depictions, making up the first part of the film, are most definitely a lush and exciting piece of work, densely endowed with engaging and involving occurrences, finely crafted scenes of dialogue and sprinklings of tuneful glamour and romantic decadence. After this it then proceeds in a less fulsome, but still entertaining fashion, focusing mainly on the love life of the girl, named Ali, and the dramas involved in the club's financial problems. In the end this subject matter proves to be considerably less sustainable than that explored earlier, and consequently, the musical aspect it turned up a notch, and the numbers grow in frequency and extravagance. Yet despite the thinness and tackiness, the later scenes do still carry that same undeniable charm and emotional value seen before, and so you feel you just have to love this film no matter what, and the explosive toe-tapping finale is very satisfying. So despite the obvious wantonness, memorability and fun is always ensured by the film's much more prominent merits: stupendous songs, the gorgeous visual package, the attractive premise, and of course the well- oiled cast, in which Christina Aguilera, Cam Digandet, Cher and Stanley Tucci are especially brilliant. In short, Burlesque is on feeling a masterpiece, but on reflection a misfire: the point being that if you don't overthink it you'll have the time of your life."
"Dragoneyed363","9","39","62","6 December 2010"," High octane, fast paced musical is super fun, even if it's not a masterpiece
","I, unlike a lot of people in lieu to it's box office results, really wanted to see Burlesque. I am not necessarily a Christina Aguilera fan, though she has made a lot of songs I like, same deal for Cher, and though the movie did not seem like it would be a 10/10, it looked insanely fun for my tastes and I had been invited by my friend and her mom to go see it with them. We were all fairly excited, after seeing the previews and hearing of what reception it did get from audiences was generally well perceived, and, directly after it was over, were pleased to admit that all three of us really enjoyed it and were not disappointed.<br/><br/>There is not really many downsides to this movie, in my honest opinion, that can not be made up for with other material. For example: The songs, while not all are memorable, make the movie ultimately more enjoyable, and have some nice choreography to the dances that were made for them. ""Show Me How to Burlesque"" is my favorite song, with Cher's ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"" and another song, that incongruently and infuriatingly is not listed in the soundtrack titles on here, and did not have a really huge part in the movie other than it being my favorite dance sequence, besides ""Show Me How to Burlesque"", being two other very catchy songs in the movie, as well. The others felt like they were there merely to fill time, because I personally did not find them that special.<br/><br/>There's not really any brand new, awesome material, but it really is much better than people would expect in terms of entertainment and professionalism. Christina Aguilera has got some pipes. Whether you like her vocals or not, she can hit and hold a note, and she really is not that bad of an actress. She wasn't in this film, at least, and while we are at it, neither was Cher; both gave pretty believable and likable performances. Everyone gave a likable performance both acting and music wise, especially my man candy Cam Gigandet. You could grate cheese on that boy's body. There is a nice touch of comedy here and there from Alan Cumming, Stanley Tucci, and a very cute and well done scene between Aguilera and Gigandet that involves a nice shot of Gigandet's bottom and another mishap in that scene that will make anyone crave ""the box of cookies"" at that exact moment. (I love Cam Gigandet.)<br/><br/>Moving on, another aspect is the movie has got excellent, sparkly costumes during some flashy, risqué sequences that could possibly make anyone have a seizure who was not thoroughly prepared. Another of my favorite things is it has got beautiful, and I mean beautiful lighting, and wonderful make-up in many scenes making the actors, actresses and settings look picturesque and crisp. Steve Antin, while not an amazing director, does a very nice job, and does an even better job with the writing, even if the script is not Oscar worthy. Like I have said, it is not going to be held in cinema history as the next Casablanca, or Godfather, few movies are nowadays, but this was an enjoyable experience for many reasons and I encourage anyone who thinks they can handle it for what it is to see it."
"prosebank","3","72","123","30 November 2010"," There's 2 hours I won't be getting back.
","This movie wore out both my BS detector and my suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>It should be prosecuted under the Trades Description Act, and sued by Rob Marshall and the estate of Bob Fosse for plagiarism. Because it ain't burlesque, and it rips off too many elements from Marshall's film of ""Chicago"" and Fosse's choreography, for me to count.<br/><br/>This movie is as true a glimpse of the real burlesque scene, as ""Showgirls"" was of the real traditional Vegas showgirl scene. But ""Showgirls"" had a slightly more believable plot.<br/><br/>Here's a suggestion for Steve Antin: How about making a movie called ""Girl Group"", with only one musical number in it? After all, you've given us a movie called ""Burlesque"" with only ONE actual burlesque number in it. The rest is just a rip-off of your sister's Pussycat Dolls routines. Especially that final number. THAT was the song that took so long for the hero to write??? THAT was the song that was so deeply personal that he couldn't share it with anyone until he felt it was perfect??? No wonder my BS detector wore out.<br/><br/>The costumes are gorgeous (hence the 3 stars from me), but they're the only things that made this movie remotely tolerable. And the camera never held still long enough for me to get a really good look at them. (Note to all directors: If you're spending that much on costumes, for god's sake, let us see them and appreciate them!) Also, as someone who is active in the burlesque scene, I must point out that merely wearing a burlesque style costume does NOT make someone into a burlesque performer any more than wearing spike heels and a miniskirt makes a nun into a streetwalker.<br/><br/>Vocally, Christina Aguilera and Cher both have amazing voices. But does every song they sing have to be a power-ballad with all those full-out wails and cadenzas? Enough, already! Those songs and vocal gymnastics lose their dramatic power when they're all we ever get to hear.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Burlesque"" was 2 hours of my life that I won't be getting back."

","If you like old fashioned musicals this is for you. Small town girl comes to Hollywood. In the tradition of ""Cabaret"" the music is performed in the venue rather then the characters bursting into song like dialogue. Unlike ""Cabaret"" the bad guys aren't Nazis, but unseen evil banks and real estate developers.<br/><br/>The story is thin, fluff, and predictable. The only thing stiffer then the dialogue is Cher's face. The musical numbers are high octane entertainment.<br/><br/>Christina Aguilera will be recognized by the Golden Globes for her performance and a song she wrote seems poised for an Academy Award. Stanly Tucci always looks like he is having fun.<br/><br/>It's not ""Chicago"". It doesn't measure up to the classic Hollywood musicals but it's a good try. See it."

","This movie was beyond anything i could have ever expected. Christina really pulled it off and Cher she was amazing as always. Saw it today and I went out and bought the sound track. The music is great! This is a movie i will buy when it comes out on Blu-Ray. Hurray! The story is very simple and that is a good thing. The writer did not over do it with drama and was able to focus on the characters and the music. I was so surprised when I saw that Christina can not only sing and dance her pants off but she can actually act. The best part of this movie is the music. This is my new favorite movie. I went into the movie after getting up on Black Friday at 5am and i exited the theater in a great mood and with tons of energy."

It's Not Shakespeare, but a delight none the less. I don't think this was written to be a real deep movie, just fun and entertaining, which it definitely accomplished. The musical numbers often played out like a live show, which left most movie goers clapping and screaming in the theater (which tickled me to no end because, they can't hear you silly people). I thoroughly enjoyed Burlesque and felt I definitely got my money's worth. I will go see it again before it leaves theaters, because that is where the most enjoyment can be gleaned in my opinion. Also as a warning: Be prepared to leave the movie and go shell out 12 bucks for the soundtrack, because it's almost inevitably your next stop. Kisses Darlings."
"st-shot","3","87","168","1 December 2010"," The grotesque state of the film musical
","The state of American film in the 21st Century has been generally abysmal but nowhere is it more evident than in the film musical. Taking the most honored of the period Chicago, a Fosse wanta be with bad performances and forgettable tunes as the benchmark it is more than evident all singing all dancing has lost its voice and more than a step. The latest entry and every bit the tepid much ado about nothing heat and light display of flaccid musical storytelling as the Oscar winner (an even bigger comment on the unimaginative state of the movie business) is the insipidly slick Burlesque.<br/><br/>Stop me if you've heard this. Young impressionable girl with massive hidden talent leaves the land of corn for the bright lights of LA where she stumbles upon a run down anachronism with a crusty but understanding owner still in it for love of the game who gives the kid a break and, well you can fill in the rest.<br/><br/>In the role of Judy Garland Christine Aguleria sings the blues with impressive voice but it's all plastic soul and slumming for the former mouseketeer who presents an unintentionally jarring visual context of an Aryan uber babe singing Bessie Smith. Speaking of plastic Cher all polished and waxed like an antique Oldsmobile splits her time offering sage advice and sarcasm. In addition she does a couple of tunes with her signature howl wrapped as always in distracting outfit and opulent stagecraft to soften its blow. There's some male characters whose purpose it seems is to stand around with expressions of awe for the divas and of course the serious pyrotechnics surrounding the noir dance numbers that attempts to put some make-up on this pig but in the end it is all forced Fosse."

","This is Showgirls, only way better. Ali is a poor girl living in rural settings and decides to save money and head west to pursue her dream, to be a singer. Luck finds her in a run down bar that runs a nightly burlesque show where the performers only lip sync to songs and dance provocatively. Ali weasels her way into being a waitress there, basically forces the bartender to be her friend and crashes at his place. He is in a complicated relationship and she has her eyes on the cliche rich older hot guy. Ali catches yet further a break when the ""star"" of the show quits. Fast forward, the star returns and is all jelly of Ali for stealing the spotlight. She kills the music during a routine but gasp, Ali can wail!!!!!!! I think you can see where this is going, god knows I did after the first five minutes. There is some drama thrown in about the bar almost going into foreclosure, and a love triangle. This movie is pretty predictable from start to finish and we are not even graced with any nudity from a single performer in the burlesque show. I know, I know, you are reading this thinking, ""But Tony, you gave it 9 stars!"" Hell yeah I did and the answer to your why is super simple. Christina Aquilera can wail!!!! Every time she busts out into a song gives me goosebumps, and I am a straight white man. (Sorry) So if you can stomach Cher (I barely could) and want to enjoy some phenomenal songs surrounded by so-so drama, this movie is for you."

","OK, first of all - I don't get how people compare this to a 30's movie or whatever.<br/><br/>I didn't like Christina before much. I just didn't like her outfit along with the ""pop-ish"" music she made. Neither I did Cher.<br/><br/>But hell, when Christina opened up her mouth on the stage for Tough Lover I got thrilled. The sing performances are simply amazing and show the vocal qualities of both singers. Honestly, I can't stop listening to the soundtrack. The arrangements of the songs within the movie are amazing as well, incomparable to those in ""Step Up"" series.<br/><br/>But sadly besides that, the screenplay is typically Hollywood - I knew how the movie was going to end since beginning. Shallow story and I really lol'd when Cher was singing her 2nd song in the movie... Just came along to the empty club, where the most probably loyal sound guy was waiting for her to rehearse something. And she sang something about something and then she went off. I was like: ""wow great singing, but ... where does it fit the context?"" I give it a 7 just because I enjoyed the songs and voice along with arrangements."
"ptb-8","7","5","6","17 January 2011"," All That Fosse
","BURLESQUE sets itself up for some fairly blunt 2011 criticism for it's lame storyline but if one knows their films of the 30s to the 70s, you can see they type of nightclub musical it wants to be. If BURLESUE was made in the 30s it would be a Warner bros Vitaphone musical like 42nd STREET or FOOTLIGHT PARADE. Christina Aguelira would be played by Joan Blondell who she actually resembles. Cam Gigandet would be James Cagney. Cher vs Mae West. Hop into the 40s and we might have Rita Hayworth as Cher, Berry Grable as Christina, and called COVER GIRL or PIN UP GIRL, or if you prefer staying in a cheaper locale THE SWING PARADE OF 1946, Monogram's big nightclub musical mess starring Gale Storm and performers in a finale who did not appear anywhere else in the whole film. In the 50s, well just have a look at either PAL JOEY or THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT. The opening 5 minutes of BURLESQUE resembles the 1965 Elvis credit sequence on a bus in TICKLE ME. BURLESQUE really really wants to be all of the fabulous nightclub scenes from SWEET CHARITY... the scenes where Charity meets Vittorio and sees the RICH MAN'S FRUG dance numbers with awesome Barrie Chase and her 10' legs and whopper hair. Now that we are in Fossey territory, add some CABARET (in fact, a lot of CABARET), mix in MOULIN ROUGE and plenty of CHICAGO and Columbia's B grade subsidiary Screen Gems give us a new B grade nightclub musical with all the above elements called BURLESQUE. This film just wants to be some of all those above. Hell it is far better than NINE and miles ahead of RENT, which for me is just fine. I actually think the 'lets save the nightclub' storyline is a wink to other cliché musicals and knows it. (Boogaloo, anyone?) What is good about BURLESQUE is the hilarious script which has some terrific lines, the excellent rapport between the three leads Cher, C.A and Stanley Tucci... and of course cute Cam as the Paul Newman type love interest. His 'box of cookies' nude scene adds some well timed zing. The dance numbers are thoroughly enjoyable albeit badly edited and filmed too close, like most of the film. The songs good and the costumes offer the old razzle dazzle as well they could and actually do. BURLESQUE knows it is silly and has a great time with it... hey just like an actual BURLESQUE show. Just enjoy. it's not difficult. BURLESQUE might even get Barbra Striesand out of the house to make a new musical given she would see it as her husband James Brolin has a cameo and Cher is her same age: 66. Also finally Cher might get the cash to make the Mae West musical for which she is now ideal. BURLESQUE would make a terrific double feature with Columbia's own 1948 cheapie LADIES OF THE CHORUS starring Marilyn Monroe in the Christina part."
"tavm","8","28","49","30 November 2010"," Burlesque is a fine showcase for Christina Aguilera and, especially, Cher
","Just watched this ambitious Cher-Christina Aguilera musical drama with my theatre-working friend and we both found it fabulous! Is it a masterpiece? Well, not quite as the plot seems to be quite derivative not to mention a romance subplot involving Ms. Aguilera's possible ""gets"" between her-roommate-with-a-fiancée-far-away (Cam Gigandet) and an-older-rich-man-who's-trying-to-buy-Cher's-club (Eric Dane). But the leading performances of both are fine which also goes for the supporting turns by some of the above not to mention Kristen Bell and especially Stanley Tucci as the right hand man of Cher's at the club. And seeing both Ms. Aguilera and Cher singing their songs-especially the latter on ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me""-are at their most compelling. There's also the requisite witty lines that make things go more smoothly as the narrative goes on. Oh, and more thing: I didn't recognize neither Julianne Hough nor Dianna Agron when they appeared on screen so I was surprised when I read who they were in the ending credits. But, overall, Burlesque was a rollicking good time for my friend and me."

","It is a really quiet Thanksgiving Day in Marin County, Northern, CA. Thank you IMDb for alerting me about this film. Despite the fact this could have been great in period costume with a Humphrey Bogart, George Raft and the rest (are they around?), don't miss this film if you love an unexpected treat. Which brings up the questions-where are women led films from todays media moguls? This movie shows how it can be done-with someone of the awesome power of Christine and a showcase for veteran CHER, these ladies blow away the plot absurdity and the male cheesecake to rock out. If only Chicago had the dance and song power of these pieces, it would have been as great as everyone said it was. And if only some of the other great women songsters sitting at home were given this kind of raw musical showcase. This movie shows that as far as great vocalization. women hold there own and then some. Christine-you are a star. So there it is, some power music pieces, thrilling vocal fireworks, and a reworking of the R and B ""lady on fire"" legacy that goes back to the first blues shouters, moves through greats like Aretha and Sharon Jones, and becomes oh so real in this bit of very musical celluloid. Unlike Thanksgiving dinner, this warm meal left you wanting more. Much more."

"jasoncheck720","8","15","25","27 November 2010"," It Is What It Is
","This movie is exactly what you'd expect, and doesn't try to be much more. It's all about the music, and the main ""plot"" of the movie almost seems tacked-on, as if the studio realized it couldn't just release a 100-minute film of Christina belting out burlesque tunes. So they threw a story together to pad out the moments between musical numbers.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty transparent, the jokes are fairly obvious, and if I said the words ""the club is in financial trouble"", you can most likely guess the majority of rest of the movie.<br/><br/>You'll notice earlier I said Christina ""belts"" out burlesque tunes, and this isn't exaggerating. Strangely, if I have a complaint about Christina's performance, it would be her vocal barrages that sometimes seemed forced. A couple times I wanted to throw my hands up and yell, ""Okay, I get it!"" The grunt-like ""HOOOAAAAHHHHYAHYAHYAHHHHH""s physically made my ears hurt in a couple of places. Don't get me wrong, she DOES have an amazing voice, but it doesn't need to go all the way to eleven all the time. I understand she's passionate about what she's singing. That's fine. But don't beat me over the head with it.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is excellent. Cher does a remarkable job, and I'd go so far as to say I enjoyed ""You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me"" more than the majority of Christina's songs, if only because Cher sings that song with more soul and passion than anything Christina does. It's more than Cher's character singing, it's Cher herself, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci is perfect as Cher's gay sidekick. The jokes are basically what you'd expect, but that doesn't make the character less charming. Kristen Bell does well with her smallish part. I was surprised and excited to see Alan Cumming's name in the opening credits, and was shocked at how small his role was. Cam Gigandet and Eric Dane are the usual, meaning they're what you'd expect from supporting male characters vying for the affections of the lead female character. One is involved in the only scene in the movie (towards the end) that is almost unbearable in it's ""convenience"", but it's forgivable given the tone of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>If you're going to see this movie, just enjoy it for what it is. Don't expect a piece of masterful cinema, don't take it too seriously. Enjoy the music, enjoy the plot for the fluff it is, and if you're a guy seeing it with your wife/girlfriend, enjoy the scantily-clad women."

","Like the name implies, ""Burlesque"" was lofty, dramatic and musically ambitious. Unlike the name, I think it was too serious to be much of a parody of stage-shows. Cher is an actress, an Academy Award winning actress at that, but there was minimal evidence of intentional self-caricaturing.<br/><br/>A small-town Iowa waitress pursues her dreams and high-tails it to Los Angeles. Ali has way too much audacity for her own good but it does get her a job, two scrumptious boyfriends, and into the burlesque show. Of course it does. Alice, you are in wonderland now. At least when lines like that are delivered by Stanley Tucci they are pretty funny.<br/><br/>The film did have a plot with questions along the lines of: Will Ali realize her dreams of singing and dancing? Will she meet the man of her dreams? And more importantly, will Tess (Cher) save her club from financial ruin? The latter storyline might actually matter if the rest of the film wasn't littered with outlandish sets, costumes and lighting. But ""Burlesque"" is also what it claims to be—entertaining. Well, mildly entertaining. Christina Aguilera can sing, Cher and Stanley Tucci have good comedic chemistry, and Cam Gigandet is one of the hottest young actors around."

I think it is worthy to watch for its songs and dancing. I also love its costumes and luxurious settings which made me feel exciting. All in all, I think this movie is a great choice to kill time. I think as the first time for a singer to try acting, Christina has already tried her best to use her talent on singing and dancing to make the film better; though it still needs a lot of improve on her acting, I think she chose the right film which can show her merits and it is more easier for her to play the role of Ali who is similar to her profession."

","""Burlesque"" is probably the most compelling contemporary movie musical that I have ever seen; the score, acting, costumes, and cinematography were executed, impeccably.<br/><br/>The film commences in rural Iowa, where we are first introduced to the film's protagonist, Ali Marilyn Rose, played by Christina Aguilera. The seemingly idealistic and ambitious Ali is determined to leave Iowa and pursue a career in the entertainment industry. After countless deliberation, Ali decides that moving to Los Angeles would presumably promote the advancement of her career, greatly. So, the diminutive Ali packs the relatively little belongings she owns, and heads to Los Angeles, optimistically, anticipating that numerous opportunities await her. Upon arriving to Hollywood, Ali is beset with financial and professional difficulties that unnerve her; she conducts an assiduous search for various jobs, ranging from dancing to bartending, and is ultimately unsuccessful. Inadvertently, a despondent Ali stumbles across ""The Burlesque Lounge"" and is instantly intrigued. She curiously enters the establishment and is engaged, immediately, by a coterie of dancers performing to a classic jazz number. She becomes completely enraptured, however, when Tess, the proprietor of The Burlesque Lounge, played by Cher, performs a musical number. Now intent on performing at the lounge, Ali accosts a bartender named Jack, played by Cam Gigandet, and expresses her interest in possibly working at the club as a dancer and singer. Jack instructs her to solicit Tess for the aforementioned position. Brazenly, Ali goes backstage, encounters Tess, and indiscriminately mentions that she is interested in working at the club. Tess, taken aback by Ali's audacity, prompts her to state her credentials. Ali hesitatingly admits that she has an inherent predilection for singing and dancing, albeit no formal training, whatsoever. Tess then appraises Ali, dubiously, and proceeds to prepare the dancers' costumes for an upcoming musical number. Determined, Ali approaches the production manager, Sean, played by Stanley Tucci, and asks him to be hired, stating that she would be an incredible asset to ""The Burlesque Lounge."" Sean informs her that they are not actively seeking to employ any additional dancers. He admires Ali for her zeal and ostensibly attributes his inability to hire her to bad timing. Desperate, Ali unabashedly opts to temporarily assist Jack with bartending duties until the club holds its next audition. Unsurprisingly, Ali auditions and Tess begrudgingly agrees to hire her as a full time dancer. This angers the troubled, intractable, Nikki, played by Kristen Bell, who considers both Tess and Sean impetuous for hiring a fledgling singer/dancer. Ultimately, Ali is venerated and recognized for her vocal talents. Not only does she restore credibility to the once ailing Burlesque Lounge, but she is also credited for being seminal in the decision to make musical performances at the club live.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, Tess and her husband Vince, played by Peter Gallagher, are on the brink of financial ruin, and subsequently may be forced to shut the club down, permanently. An astute, cunning businessman, Marcus, played by Eric Dane, approaches Tess and offers to buy both her and Vince's shares of the club, presumably to ensure that it stays open. However, deviously, Marcus intends to destroy the club, and build luxury high-rise apartments in its place. Tess refuses to sell her shares, even under pressure from her ex-husband, Vince, which precludes Marcus from following through with his plan.<br/><br/>This is a tour de force film with incredible characterization; Cher, Christina Aguilera, Stanley Tucci, Kristen Bell, and Cam Gigandet delivered convincing, compelling performances. Christina Aguilera in particular surprised me with her emotional scope and comedic timing. This successful musician will definitely be inundated with numerous film offers after the premiere of this film; she has the potential to be a very successful actress.<br/><br/>The musical numbers and choreography were spellbinding and entertaining, essentially similar to performances in the movies ""Chicago,"" ""Moulin Rouge,"" and ""Chicago."" Christina Aguilera and Cher round out the soundtrack with ten songs total-Aguilera co-wrote three original songs and performed five classics, while Cher sings two original songs.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is stunning; Steven Antin worked closely with legendary director of photography, Bojan Bozelli, to achieve a chiaroscuro effect, which created for mesmerizing color and imagery. The costumes were also incredibly intricate and tailored for each performer, individually.<br/><br/>Burlesque exceeded my expectations. The only reservation I had with the film was the derivative, trite on-screen romance sub-plot between Ali and Jack; it detracts from the amazing performances in the film. With the exception of the latter, though, it is an excellent production that will undoubtedly impress and entertain audiences."

It offers nonstop music, melodramatics, silly scenes, and laughs. Stanley Tucci is great as Cher's assistant, friend, and confidante. Burlesque is larger than life, it's pure escapism. The musical numbers fill the screen, the music is loud, snappy and upbeat. The movie has no lulls, is entertaining, has a simple storyline and likable characters.

","Over the last several years/decades, we've had various artists attempt musical comedy on film when they didn't, necessarily, have the talent to showcase in the film. It's almost killed the genre for me (which didn't have much going for it anyway).<br/><br/>But when there is a legitimate talent to be featured or simply vehicled, show me where to buy a ticket. The young Christina Aguilera has nothing to prove vocally, but everything was riding on her ability to act on screen and hold our interest between songs. As well, I've always found her performances physically static, while vocally unimaginably executed, so when the trailer put her in a line of chorus girls in a burlesque house (which is showing a rivival of sorts in San Francisco), I did have a question about whether she could be compelling. I shouldn't have worried and wonder why no one hasn't grabbed her before now and put her on the screen. She's mesmerizing and surprisingly demure (which is not a problem she has in interviews on talk shows); and when she mounts the stage she controls everyone watching. Her dancing is quite acceptable and isn't accomplished in the editing room as recent filmed musicals have slipped less than talented actresses over hurdles they clearly couldn't scale.<br/><br/>The story in ""Burlesque"" is a trifle, and no one tries to apologize for that. ""Showgirls"" tried to get around the limitations of this genre by adding scale and tawdriness and it only distanced us from any of the characters. The burlesque house here is modest, unapologetically copied from the Broadway show/film ""Cabaret,"" and the musical numbers scaled to a small stage that really's not much larger than an average film house's proscenium. It's a lesson directors of future musicals for film should learn. Keep it scaled down and accessible; otherwise, the audience and performers get overwhelmed and shut out. Here the talent of the dancers shines. The choreography is smart and sassy (as are the costumes), and I couldn't wait for the next numberwhich we're given a generous helping/selection of songs, all kept within the confines of the burlesque house.<br/><br/>Is it revolutionary? No, but it's the best offering since ""Moulin Rouge,"" and I actually found this more appealing. I suspect the Golden Globes are going to eat this up, and that might give both Aguilera and Cher a shot at an Oscar nomination."

Sometimes Cher looked like a very good drag queen. Sometimes I felt like I was watching an MTV video. No one gets hit. No one really gets hurt. No one uses profanity much. The song and dance numbers are great to watch. I would've liked to have seen a more character driven story...something like Gypsy. It kinda ended pretty quick.

"musanna-ahmed","4","21","41","19 December 2010"," A musical that hits the wrong notes mainly
","Christina Aguilera is the second singer to make her big screen debut this month. The first being Pixie Lott with her futile effort as Judy in a contender for the worst film of the year, Fred: The Movie. As we saw in Fred, Pixie occasionally sang in some parts of the film to demonstrate the talent and Aguilera does the same but only a lot more considering Burlesque is a musical. So is this the same case scenario as Fred? Better, but certainly nothing great.<br/><br/>Aguilera plays Ali, a small town girl leaving her home to depart to Los Angeles (because of the hard time living with her parents) in order to live her dream as a singer/dancer. She comes across The Burlesque Lounge, which is managed by Tess, who is played by music icon Cher. Starting off as a waiter in the place, she becomes enthusiastic to showcase her singing talent to Tess and her performance eventually convinces Tess, who then allows her to perform on the shows. In the background of it all, the characters in the club face problems – Tess' club faces bankruptcy and despite putting one obstacle out of the way by refusing an entrepreneur called Marcus Gerber's (Eric Dane) offer to buy the club, she still fears that she will lose the club. And for Ali, her problems lie with a fellow dancer who despises her called Nikki (Kristen Bell) as they clash for who the main star of the club is and an engaged bartender called Jack (Cam Gigandet) who has a desire to develop a relationship with Ali despite having a fiancée. <br/><br/>The characterisation is heavily flawed in Burlesque. Let's begin with Ali. Christina Aguilera was suitable for the role but not suitable. She has the skill to act as a good singer and a role like this can display it but playing a young dancer doesn't work, she looks a bit old for the role. Her character alters in the film: starting off as an unknown waitress keen to perform, and saying to the first man met at the club that it reminded her of a strip club to a star performer racking up the cash for the club with the popularity she gains and reiterating her opinion of the club as ""I've never seen anything like this"". From the time it takes for her to go from rock bottom to the most confident singer in the club, she evolves into a pompous arse. And that time is very quick. Rome wasn't built in one day, but the character of Ali was. <br/><br/>Cher as Tess is the opposite. She starts off as 'it' until the club's financial problem hits her, then she becomes the character Ali started off with, a woman with problems that need to be sorted. It takes two to make a thing go right, but not when they contrast heavily even when they change. Not to miss the fact that her looks are incredibly ludicrous. To sum it up, the word ""plastic"" defines how she looks in this. From the dancers in the club, only two have significance in the film, Kristen Bell's jealous character Nikki and Julianne Hough's Georgia, a dancer whom Ali befriends. Have I mentioned Coco yet? Coco (Chelsea Traille) is a black female dancer who occasionally grins at Ali in a manner which you would expect something fishy going on between them but it turns out meaningless. Stanley Tucci plays a bent stage manager called Sean. Not much to say about him. Cam Gigandet plays the bartender Jack who first appears gay with his eyeliner but turns out to actually be straight. Oh and the man that I mentioned at the start whom Ali describes the club as having the looks of a strip club to? He doesn't have significance either apart from reappearing in a dance scene which has a lot of sexual interaction between him and the two dancers participating with him. <br/><br/>The script writer of this film did a bad job. The dialogue spoken by the characters was very repetitive – when one character said something, the other retaliated by saying exactly the same thing but just worded SLIGHTLY differently. I also must say that some of these lines are really corny, with the corniness making the bad film so bad that it's good.<br/><br/>This is a musical that features a club which is actually similar to a strip club. It contains voluptuous women wearing skimpy apparel and wiggling their butts every so often during their dances. Add a small sex scene which comes out of nowhere (starting from a cheesy scene which turns into something mature) – which also involves the male completely nude apart from a cookie box covering his mid-section – as well as the dance mentioned previously which imitates sex positions yet here is a film rated 12A. Scandalous. Maybe it is because of nothing like pole dancing, stripteases and full nudity. At the same time, with content like that, anyone under 12 going to watch the film would be viewing this. C'mon Steve Antin, did you forget about the young audience or was your aim to stimulate sexual activity in youngsters?<br/><br/>On the musical side, Burlesque has positives. In here, the songs aren't suddenly broken into like you'd normally see thanks to it being set in a club where the stage is where everything happens. There are one or two exceptions though. Aguilera and Cher being two experienced singers worked and the songs were enjoyable with all the song scenes looking like music videos rather than part of a film. <br/><br/>Burlesque, with its cheesiness, is a film so bad that it's good. Yes, I repeated that sentence in this review just like the dialogue in the film. It's a musical that mainly hits the wrong notes, with the only right note being the music itself. Well done to Christina Aguilera anderm, that's about it."

","""A dream come true..."" were the first words I used to describe the spectacle that is 'Burlesque.' Never have I EVER been more captivated visually, mentally, emotionally, physically during a musical. Needless to say, this film exceeded my expectations. From the moment the film began, I was head over heels with excitement. Cher, Stanley Tucci deliver delectable performances, and to be honest, there are no weak acts in this feature film. The one and only, there never will be another, Christina Aguilera..., did not disappoint either.<br/><br/>For Christina's feature film debut as an actress, she excelled in many aspects only some of her contemporaries could only dream of. Christina's performance was believable, sensational, emotionally investing, and left me begging for more. She demonstrated a wide range of talent in a well executed performance. She gives you raw emotion, a naive sensibility, cunning wit, an arresting presence, and bitchiness with a bite to back it up. I'm honestly not even certain if that covers it all or not, but you get my point. Christina's performance in 'Burlesque' is going to be a vehicle that will take her anywhere she wants to go in the acting realm of the entertainment world. Great job, Christina.<br/><br/>The storyline, although predictable, aces the test in this type of format. Our story delivered in ways that capture your heart, body, soul, and mind. There are no stale aspects to this film as well. Most importantly, it's a believable piece of work that offers a little something for everyone. I was taken aback in some points of the film by how I was stunned or astonished at what was happening that either made me audibly gasp, or that literally took my breath away. There were also moments that had me welling up in tears, or exploding with laughter. A truly sensational experience. On the opposite side to the spectrum, there were a few moments that were a bit dorky, but all in all, this only added to the movie's charm.<br/><br/>The musical numbers are sewn well together as well in the storyline and offer an insight into the feelings and emotions that are being enacted on screen. The editing is flawless and is another great job well done. The musical numbers surge with electrifying elements that really do make you want to ""get your ass up, and show me how you Burlesque.""<br/><br/>'Burlesque,' I dare say, has redefined the musical as we know it.<br/><br/>'Burlesque's' Overall Grade: 'A-'"

","If you wait out the first 7 minutes of cliché small town girl heads for the big city, you will experience a glorious musical with Cher and Christina Aguilera. Set on the Sunset Strip, Burlesque is the frisky flight of fantasy of writer/director Steve Antin (whose previous claim to fame was the jock jerk in ""Goonies"").<br/><br/>There are some singer/actors that transcend their medium and undoubtedly Cher is one. Flawless at every point in the film Cher is memorizing in every scene she's in and in every song she sings.<br/><br/>Christina Aguilera is astonishing as the ingénue turned star that demands attention through her character's pure heart and talent. <br/><br/>I note early in this review that this is a flight of fantasy, because there are no scenes where Ali develops her talent for dancing and singing -- she starts and ends the film as talent personified. Having been a student at UCLA, I know all too well that talent and recognition are not compulsory companions. Burlesque is in the same vein of a Gary Marshall film (""Pretty Woman""), but sexier and sometimes smoking hot.<br/><br/>Much of the sexual heat comes from Ms. Aguilera's on screen relationship with Cam Gigandet, who portrays Jack (the lead bartender at Burlesque). In a star making performance, Mr. Gigandet is more than just eye-candy for the divas; he is Ryan Phillippe in ""Cruel Intentions"", sexy, cool, smart, and a man anyone would long to wake up to and few other men could compete with.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, most notably Stanley Tucci, is superb. Mr. Tucci consistently steels the screen film-after-film. I fear that much of Alan Cummings' performance was left on the cutting room floor. However, Mr. Antin leaves in one comic stage performance from Mr. Cummings that adds some levity to the film.<br/><br/>Mr. Antin lends a steady hand from scene-to-scene and paces the film well at 100 minutes. The music and choreography are perfect at every turn.<br/><br/>Trust me. Drink this film in like champagne, and try not to worry if it's real wine or not, because you will feel like continuing the celebration after the last credit rolls."

I admired her for her talent and astronomical vocal ability. I didn't go see this movie to walk out and critique this girl's acting skills, she's clearly not pursuing an acting career anytime soon. Though she was not horrible, she was fairly decent for never having acted in any major picture before. Christina knows who she is, and in some ways the story line really reflects her own life. This movie just makes you want to learn all the words to the songs, and get on up and dance! Such a wonderful movie!"

","We could use a story of triumph over adversity these days, particularly one with singing, dancing, and romancing. There's an undercurrent of legacy running between Cher and Christina Aguilera, and that adds to the spectacle of big voices, big costumes, and big love. Whoever designed the costumes should receive many awards. The same for the choreography. The musical numbers were all very sexy for being less than over the top. The men's costuming, with vests and bowler hats, was very good: the band rocked. <br/><br/>Of note were the photo histories of burlesque used as props, reminding the audience of the prominence this art form once held. And there was just enough of a tip of the hat to Cabaret to send a signal about those times and our times without being heavy handed. <br/><br/>In the end, girl finds stardom and love. Devotion to art triumphs over commercialism. In short, the world not as it is but as it might be for the brief time one is at the movies. Just a delight to remember the days when big production numbers were, well, big productions. I left the theater feeling, ""now that is a movie!"" This is one to see on the big screen and then tuck away for inspiration as needed."

There was not enough Info about her past and who she was before deciding to Move to California. We have no idea how she crafted her skillful voice or why she decided to chase her dream. That only bad reflection on the writers which I'm sure was originally filmed but later cut on the editing floor, And lastly, This is a bit of a bash on Xtina but nothing to serious! Though I mentioned earlier was a natural to the acting game, she had one emotional scene that just didn't work for me. At some point she is crying on the shoulder of her love interest, Jack, and it was a little unbelievable! Bad acting a little! however I don't think it took away from the film as a whole and it was the only scene her inexperience was noticeable!

","According to the dictionary, the word ""burlesque"" is defined as being a variety show characterized by low-comedy and striptease.<br/><br/>Well, (unless there are 2 versions of this movie out there) this version of Burlesque (with its PG-13 rating) contained neither one of these forms of entertainment. (It might have helped if it did) <br/><br/>I guess that the reason behind this film's erroneous and (deliberately) misleading title has something to do with the fact that a word like ""burlesque"" has a very provocative and enticing sound to it.<br/><br/>From my point of view, I found Burlesque to be, pretty much, an up-dated, carbon-copy of Flashdance and something of a Cabaret-clone, as well, with the distinctive echoes of Dirty Dancing thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>Burlesque's backstage, backstabbing story was so continually marred by clichés, predictability, dumb dialogue and trite personal dramas that this, in turn, quickly reduced its elaborately staged musical numbers to being nothing more than half-ass fizzle rather than full-throttle sizzle.<br/><br/>And speaking about Burlesque's mega-extravagant musical numbers, (when you clearly see the exterior of the building where they were being staged) you'll be quick to realize that there was absolutely no way on Earth that a dinky, little venue like that could ever possibly house these fantastic, ""Vegas""-calibre productions. No way, Jose! <br/><br/>Anyways - Besides the fact that the 64-year-old Cher was never filmed in natural daylight (Gee. I wonder why??), Burlesque really killed me with its pretentious and snooty ""I'm-so-classy"" attitude.<br/><br/>This picture tried and tired (so earnestly) to firmly establish itself as a real class act.

Various sub-plots ensue: Aguilera gets a chance to go on stage and dance, and then sing; a vindictive rival is beset with jealousy at her sudden success; Cher is faced with financial difficulties and has to find a way not to lose the club; romantic issues arise; other bits and pieces.<br/><br/>My expectation was that this was going to be trashy (and, in truth, it features its fair share of cliché situations and stock characters), and I don't care for Aguilera's over-ornamented style of singing.<br/><br/>So I was most surprised to discover that I enjoyed this enormously. As a first starring vehicle for Aguilera it must be marked a success: her particular brand of girl next door wholesomeness, cross-pollinated with sexual trashiness, translates well to the screen, and she sure has got a powerful set of pipes, which is undoubtedly due to her big lungs. The musical numbers show some variety and are all entertaining (though no wonder the club is having financial difficulty given the amount it must be spending on staging its shows) The biggest problem is that there is no real jeopardy here - everybody is actually quite nice, and all problems get resolved with the minimum of trouble, so the level of dramatic tension is never very high. Although, in some ways, it's quite nice to have a movie where you like the characters and the things which happen to them are sometimes a bit worrying but never really horrible.<br/><br/>And there is a lovely relationship between Cher's and Stanley Tucci's characters."
"bartireid","6","2","2","23 December 2010"," Sugar, Spice and all things Niche
","From seemingly nowhere there has been a recent outburst of interest in all things Burlesque, transmogrified by fashion, dance and other mediums in an attempt to modify the niche into something more commercial and accessible. So it's no surprise that Hollywood would get in on the action with Burlesque (2010) a feature length debut for Christina Aguilera alongside fellow musical behemoth Cher.<br/><br/>Stylistically Burlesque is a musical, although luckily there are no spontaneous outbreaks of song and dance except for when Cher decides to sing us a song to signify how fed up she is. Ultimately everything is constructed around the theatre and performance, driven by a collection of music/cabaret video sequences glued together by what turns out to be a fairly interesting set of characters and stories. Centrally we have a little cliché, Ali (Aguilera) is a small town girl from Iowa who decides she wants to leave behind everything to pursue the dreams and promise of Los Angeles. Destiny guides her to would be mentor Tess (Cher) the divorced, struggling owner of a neo-Burlesque club ""The Burlesque Lounge"". Ali becomes enamoured with the club, as well as Jack (Cam Gigandet) a hunky barman whose already complicated love life is thrown into further turmoil when he find himself with Ali as a makeshift roommate.<br/><br/>The tagline reads ""It takes a LEGEND... to make a STAR!"" which is sort of embolismic of the Aguilera/Cher partnership, Cher herself has managed to put together a fairly impressive acting career and her young on screen protégé is quite impressive in this debut. We see Ali jumble the juxtapositions of her womanhood, love life, her career and the accompanying emotions they bring to good effect. Christina already has the look of a Hollywood star and the talent is on show here to suggest that she could have a substantial big screen future. Cher does her bit too playing the struggling business woman married to her struggling club which she faces losing, until Ali's hidden singing talents re-energises her club and show. The Sharks are circling meanwhile and Tess must fight them off if the club is to survive, among the predators are an Ex-husband (Peter Gallagher) she must buy out, an aggressive Tycoon (Eric Dane), and the destructive jealousy of her former star pupil (Kristen Bell).<br/><br/>There are some problems however, script and resulting dialogue are a little misjudged, often being overly fluffy and cute instead of really taking on some of it's themes with real bite. Hence the message of the film is a little lost somewhere between feminist empowerment and the true nature of Burlesque as an art form, with the latter summed up by the repeated lines ""They're not here to hear us sing"" which appears to fall on deaf ears. As a result Burlesque's audience is a little ambiguous possibly the price to pay when bringing a niche into the mainstream."
"mikael-67","1","10","18","27 February 2011"," A whole new level of Turkey!
","This film should never have left somebody's to-do list! Cher would have been fab – had she not tried desperately to look 20 (really?). Can you imagine how great she would have been if she looked her real age, with at least a few wrinkles, and lips that do not resemble bagels stuck to her teeth. And miss Aguilera really needs to fire all her hair and makeup people and get herself a personality. Her look in the movie is so schizophrenic that you finally aren't quite sure if it is her, or a new cast member appearing in every scene. The end result is as if someone taped together an endless loop of different music video tryouts... Save your money and revisit ""Cabaret"". That film got it right. And seemingly without effort."

","Imagine Chicago and Cabaret with none of the social commentary but all of the sexy, flashy fun. This movie is ""almost"" that.<br/><br/>All great musicals have songs that help to push the story forward. This is not one of them. This movie has a lot more in common with Coyote Ugly and Flashdance. Flashdance especially. Not saying I didn't enjoy myself. On top of the 4 songs that actually do push the story forward, there are really some awesome pieces that just need to be seen to be believed. When the camera isn't cutting away from the dances, some real magic happens. Even Cam Gigandet gets to do a little striptease that has to be seen to be believed. Some of the lead-ins to the musical numbers were very unnecessary. When a movie opens with Christina Aguilera wailing away to cut away scenes burlesque dancers she has yet to meet, and follows with Cher wailing away with those very dancers, I think it's safe to say that if anyone is still in the theater, they get that these two ladies will sing and dance. <br/><br/>Christina Aguilera plays Ally who escapes from her small town life to Hollywood and finds herself in a club called ""The Burlesque Lounge"" which has an exterior that resembles a gay youth center I used to frequent as a teen. There she meets the owner of the club Tess (Cher), her gay companion Sean (Stanly Tucci), a sexy metro bartender (Cam Gigandet) and the star of ""The Burlesque Lounge,"" the villainous yet redeemable Nikki (an underused Kristen Bell).<br/><br/>There should be no doubt about Cher's acting ability. This woman went through Moonstruck, Mermaids and Tea with Mussolini. She's an actor people. Christina Aguilera really surprised me with her portrayal of Ally. I thought what she did with the character was very real and honest and I can only imagine how hard that is to do with all the flashy set pieces and costumes flying about. <br/><br/>Director and writer Steven Antin (Robin Antin's brother) really has to be praised for just diving into this material. Musical movies can be really tricky and this movie in particular straddles a fine line between movie musical and movie with music in it. A weak script full of clichés, one too many montage scenes and a rushed third act really might put a damper on this movie, but the little homages to Cabaret (Alan Cummings in a featured cameo for example) and the awesome choreography really help lift the movie past mediocre.<br/><br/>Definitely watch if you love the burlesque style of dance, Christina and Cher, and if not... well you read this far, I think you can safely decide. Or...... you can buy the soundtrack."
"laballatician","10","36","82","12 September 2010"," Best Musical of the Year!
","Burlesque, starring the fabulous Cher, Kristen Bell, Stanley Tucci, Cam Gigandet, Julianne Hough, and Alan Cummings, is without question the musical of the year! Now sure, there's not much competition. As a matter of fact, I'm failing at coming up with even one other musical from 2010, but that's beside the point. This is a quality musical!<br/><br/>One of the major failures that modern musicals have suffered from is an inability to truly entertain the audience aka the fun factor. Burlesque embraces the fun, and even delivers on the wow factor in several of many balls to the wall dance numbers. There is no holding back on these performances. The success is the film's ability to go completely over the top in these sequences, yet pull back in the moments that call for it. It's a tricky balancing act that a lot of similar films have not been able to manage. They usually end up going the campy route (see Showgirls) or play it safe and deliver a snooze fest (see Glitter). <br/><br/>Cher may be the big name in this movie, and she's great, but it's Cher. You know what to expect. The real surprise of Burlesque is Kristen Bell as Nikki. Just as Kristen Bell is not exactly the star of this show, Nikki finds herself left of center stage at The Burlesque Lounge. You get the sense that Nikki is completely aware of her destiny as a ""never was"", but she's going to make sure you know she's not happy about it.<br/><br/>The only place the film is really lacking is in its script. There's some PG-13 level romance that never connects to the audience, and really only distracts from what we really want to see - great music and great dancing. Plus, the dialog is pretty stale, the kind of one-liners you'll hear on The Disney Channel. The exceptions here being Cher and Tucci, who sometimes feel like they brought in their own team of writers to handle the characters of Tess and Sean.<br/><br/>Burlesque also marks the film debut of singer Christina Aguilera."
"vtownlove","1","18","37","28 November 2010"," Worst movie of all time?
","This is one of the worst movies of all time. Xtina can't act, Cher while charming is a dead character. I read an article before seeing it that compared it to Showgirls. If it is not worse than Showgirls I don't know what is. I actually thought the Sci-Fi movie Sharktapus had more generic entertainment value and that is saying a lot, since that movie was written while intoxicated or at least while riding some type of drug high. I'm also going to list some other great movies to put into the same category as this movie: 1. Showgirls 2. Coyote Ugly 3. Troll 2 4. Justin and Kelly<br/><br/>Hope this helps."

","This is a lousy movie with some of the worst, most utterly hackneyed writing in the history of movies, but what makes it stand out as particularly ill-conceived is that the story is Rocky/""Hey kids, let's do a show,"" while the production numbers are faux Bob Fosse. Consequently, the numbers have nothing to do with the story, or vice versa. Started badly when the heroine gave her buddy at the bar money to buy a bike for the buddy's kid, then ran down one cliché to another till it ended 4 or 5 hours later.<br/><br/>Cher and Aguilara sang well, but this isn't MTV, and as a movie it was awful."

","Well, well, well... I don't even know where to start. Eh, I'll try anyway. I think the main problem with the modern American cinema is around the fact it becomes more and more untrue to life and distant from the one can call reality. Yes, yes, I know the movies are supposed to sell us fairy tales and to make us entertain for the two hours we paid for as every other entertainment, but it is besides the fact you must not speculate with it. What I mean. Musicals are supposed to have a plot, even a thin one, but it's part of the movie and it is irritating when it is so distant and fabricated. I am putting aside the fact that singers involved (excluding Sher) cannot act, especially Aguillera. But please, please, do not try to be so ridiculous in the plot! Are we supposed to believe that a newcomer girl employed several days ago to dare to give advices to her boss what to sing and what to perform in stage? Not gonna happen EVER in real life and it is so boring. Wooden lines, just not believable situations... well, you can do what you usually do in porn movies. I mean, fast forward all the talking and watch only the songs. Too bad I wasn't able to do that in cinema as well.<br/><br/>3/10 from me, sorry folks. 1 for Aguillera and 1 for Cher (for the singing alone) and 1 for the effort. This movie really cannot deserve more."
"snowfre","4","3","4","7 January 2020"," The vibrant musical numbers can't cover the forced narrative
","""Burlesque"" is at first glance a movie with much potential; a musical starring legends Christina Aguilera and Cher, with supporting roles by actors such as Eric Dane and Stanley Tucci, it follows country girl Ali (Aguilera) moves to Los Angeles with the hopes of becoming a dancer and singer. She starts working at Tess' (Cher) burlesque club and from here, a story of hopes and love starts. Yes, it is cheesy, and ""Burlesque"" is also highly predictable, from the very start to the very end. My main issue is not that, instead, the most frustrating part of the film is Aguilera's take on the main character. Throughout the very start when she moves to LA, Ali seems entitled, spoiled, and grumpy, and I don't think that's intended by the writers. Now, Aguilera sings and dans like a muse, but acting doesn't seem like her bit. Cher does her best, but isn't really a scene stealer, neither is she given enough time as a singer. Instead, Tucci is the most memorable in this statically driven film, as Tess' sidekick Sean. When one of the lead stars, the plot, and excitement does not live up to your expectations, you will at least value the amazing singing and perfectly choreographed musical numbers."
"nikusik-82902","9","3","4","15 April 2019"," Great cast and great musical performances
","This movie is probably one of the best, captivating movies I've ever seen. It has plot, it has twists, it has struggle and it's more realistic than you would think. Christina Aguilera did a great job, her acting was flawless. Her musical performance was something I never wrapped my head around and probably never will. Her voice is exquisite and I've had goosebumps every time she sang.<br/><br/>This movie would enjoy people who likes to think that every dream, even the most crazy one can happen if you work as hard as you can to pursue it.<br/><br/>The idea of American Dream being fulfilled is clear in this movie. A girl, who has incredible talent is trapped in a restaurant working as a waitress, facing real life problems, while her life along with her dream of becoming famous singer is slipping between her fingers. Then one day she made a decision to end her misery and stepped into that amazing yet terrifying world of show-business. After multiples attempts to find a job in a City of Angels she began to realize what has she gotten herself into. And that was when she stepped into that bar. With the last 20 bucks in her wallet, she bought her ticket to the show of her dreams.<br/><br/>This movie sends a good message to the audience about not giving up and chasing the opportunity even if the circumstances are not always kind.<br/><br/>I highly recommend to watch this movie and I think you won't regret it."

Cher was awesome, the musical numbers were great and Christina's voice is amazing. A departure from the crap that is being produced these days. It was different, not original but different from today's fluff movies. Would recommend it to anyone. Besides I am a Stanley Tucci fan, I think he is an amazing actor. Did not really feel Cam but he did OK. They could have played up the romance between him and Christina more. I did not really feel the chemistry but it was OK. Peace, love and soul.

"Stachehunter-857-73111","3","4","6","1 May 2014"," Best performance by a wax mannequin ever.
","Where to start when reviewing ""Burlesque""? What's the sound of one hand clapping? I caught this turgid exercise in tedium wrapped around Cher and Xtina Aguilera on cable the other night. ""Burlesque"" revives a plot that was old in the 1930s. Kid from nowhere shows up in the big city, reveals a hot set of pipes, and voilà, instant stardom! Usually this sort of malarkey starred Ruby Keeler, but since she's long dead, Xtina takes her place. Warner Baxter, he of the famous line ""You're going out there a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!"" (from ""42nd Street"" 1933), is also long dead, so Cher takes his place.<br/><br/>Every cliché imaginable occurs here. Evil supposed star of the show who plots to overthrow the ingénue, sassy gay backstage manager, hot boyfriend, impending financial doom, instant last-minute solution to the whole financial problem, love conquers all, roll credits. Also many, many terrible musical numbers featuring the vocal prowess of Xtina. This woman never met a song she didn't beat into submission. This is urban yodeling at it's finest. All songs sound alike, featuring a cast of dozens on splashy sets using Faux Fosse moves. Hey, isn't this theater in financial ruin? Where is the money coming from to put on these huge numbers? Evidently, you aren't supposed to think about this.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Cher, giving the best performance ever by a wax dummy. Yes, she's an icon. She has an Oscar, legions of fans, makes a comeback every two years, and could easily be replaced in this movie by that unused flesh-colored Crayola that sits in the back of the box. One would think that after losing all her Oscar credibility by doing that infamous series of hair care product infomercials, she would have picked better material for a return to the screen. She's given a series of snappy lines that she sleepwalks through, and a really forgettable power ballad to warble. This is a sad situation for Cher, since anyone who paid to see this in a theater went to see her, not Xtina. <br/><br/>So, the state of the American movie musical remains comatose. Everyone involved here seems to have gone into hiding, except for perky Stanley Tucci, who's now embarked on a career path of playing snappy gay characters, and Cher, who went back to Vegas for the 1,000,000 time."

","Enjoyable Film that, I think, has Something For Everyone.<br/><br/>I saw this movie with two women in there 40's who sat on either side of me and who laughed at the Funny spots and ooh-ed and at the Tender spots.With us were one of the woman's two football playing teenage sons who came out singing Welcome To Burlesque, and kept singing it all the way home.<br/><br/>I'm older and not good at writing down my thoughts, but what I can and will say is that I Enjoyed this movie on so many Level's. Others can write about the costumes, the songs and the musical numbers (a 10 out of 10) and the plot and writing (a 7 1/2 out of 10) I can say that there are some Very Funny lines in this movie."
"rivertam26","8","4","6","25 November 2010"," Fabulous (pardon the intended stereotypical expression)
","I had my doubts walking into this film who wouldn't. Sure the trailers looks glitzy, fun and kinda silly but how often does that turn out well especially with the acting debut of a musical star. The film has so many things stacked against it and if I were to be extremely critical I'm sure I could pick apart the performances and generic somewhat clichéd plot but I had so much fun watching it I can't help but to give it the highest of my reccomendations and for so many reasons. First up here's the stick thin plot Poor girl named Ally(Aguleira) moves from Iowa to LA in pursuit of being a star. She comes across a flailing Burlesque club run by a tough as nails diva (Cher) who gives her a shot in the show and she ends up saving the club to some extent with her powerful voice. It all sounds fairly miserable I will admit. But the movie is told in such an energetic, visually exciting and light hearted way it's hard not too be instantly engaged by the films slightly amateur but exciting execution and dare I say it an engaging, charming but somewhat uneven lead performance from Christina Aguleira. there's some nice multi layered supporting turns from Kristen Bell, Stanley Tucci and a phenomenal much welcome share. And there's some delicious eye candy in the form of a scantily clad and one point nude Cam Gigandet of Twilight. The songs are fun, the choreography tight and exciting and the cinematography is so visually enticing from the a flashing light spectacle to the soft hues of a dark stage reflected off of Cher's facade during a powerful ballad. It's no doubt that the film definitely brings out the gay in and anyone who knows me knows it's also true that I relish camptastic films such as Showgirls, Elvira Mistress of the Dark, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Coyote Ugly among many others. And Like those films it's hard to see the bad in those films such as this one when I so completely enjoy them. there is a raw, seductive energy to this film and it feels fresh and unique. I'm afraid it might flop but it's no doubt prime real estate for cult status. It's everything I could have hoped for in all the right ways. It's fabulous!"
"bostonblonde","3","6","11","10 January 2011"," A Maudlin Film That Brings Out the Worst in Everyone
","First off, I LOVE movie musicals. They may be my favorite kind of movie, so naturally, I was dying to see Burlesque from the moment I saw the first ad back in September. When I finally saw it, it was beyond disappointing. I figured, ""Well, if the movie sucks, at least there'll be some fun, Moulin Rouge costumes."" Wrong again! The costumes were largely uncreative- too much like a Victoria's Secret catalogue.<br/><br/>But on to the worst part- the acting. This film drags everyone down.Christina Aguilera is horrid in the main role. I've always been a fan of hers and was excited to see her act. She can't. At all. Her character's overly dramatic back-story would be hard to play well even for a talented veteran, but Aguilera makes it seem like a bad made for TV movie. She's a fabulous singer, but she ain't no actress. Despite being ""a real actress,"" Kristen Bell failed utterly as bad girl Nikki. She's gorgeous and plays ""the bitch"" well, but when she was supposed to be drunk, the only tip-off was that Cher wouldn't let her drive. Cher is one of the few in this film who did a quality performance, when the terrible writing didn't drag her down. Cam Gigandet was also commendable, but again, the lines his character was given were cringe-worthy. Example: while on the phone with his fiancé, Gigandet looks at Auilera's character across the room and says ""My future? I'm looking at it."" I vomited Sour Patch Kids into my drink. Even Stanley Tucci flubbed this film, although his performance in the second half is better. <br/><br/>On a positive note, Alan Cumming's character was a cute nod to Cabaret."
"Mustang92","1","5","9","22 October 2012"," Are you kidding me????
","This is one of the worst films I've seen in years. YEARS.<br/><br/>What is it with singers who want to act? Or think they can act? Most can't. And a singer of Aguilera's statue cannot or won't put the real time in, to learn the craft. She can sing, but that's it.<br/><br/>In fact, everyone in this movie sucked. Stanley Tucci, Kristen Bell, Peter Gallagher? WTF? Tucci is okay, but wasted in his role. Bell isn't good, yet she's been quite good in past films. As has Gallagher. Cher isn't even any good either, and she's done some excellent work when she was younger. Given there was talent available to the director of this film, and they mostly sucked... clearly, one has to blame the director. Who never directed anything substantial before this movie. (And probably never will again.) For someone to be making this level of a movie and not know how to work with actors? Un-frickin-believable. <br/><br/>And the story? The story is horrible, the script is horrible, the dialogue is horrible. Extremely amateurish and lame. I lost count the number of times I said a character's EXACT line before they said it. The writer/director of this movie couldn't get good performances from his actors, and couldn't write a decent scene to save his life.<br/><br/>As mentioned by other reviews here, this movie is not about Burlesque, nor is there any Burlesque in it. This writer/director hasn't a clue as to what that is. It's like he wanted to make the movie Cabaret, but since that movie was done many years ago, he'd call this one ""Burlesque"" -- but it's frickin' cabaret.<br/><br/>Aguilera should stick to singing, and this writer/director should consider another line of work."

The only positive thing I can say is there were a couple of good songs in it. First, Christina Aguilera is not an actor. She even looks weird without her silly bleached blonde hair. Jack her love interest can't act. Stanley Tucci was the only decent actor. I like Cher, but her role as the older successful dancer trying to ""mother"" the up and comer while saving her club was dull.<br/><br/>I can't believe the writers of this movie ever got it made.

She's a phenomenal singer and actress and has the heart of a true star. Cher has yet another knockout performance and I really liked seeing Kristen Bell as the mean girl, it was a refreshing new side that made her seem even more flexible in her acting ability.

I get so angry when trailers are misleading like that. I spent the whole movie waiting for Cher's appearances. And those waits were long because they were filled with Christina Aguilera's bad acting and the movie's overall bad direction, filming and plot. Cher, when she got a few minutes in front of the camera, was mesmerizing, Aguilera, who got way too much time in front of the camera... was not so mesmerizing - she should stick to just singing.<br/><br/>The filming was erratic and changed styles several times within short periods. The mood and genre changed in a wild and ludicrous fashion. I was at an honest-to-goodness burlesque show one minute and then I was transported to a disco for no explicable reason.<br/><br/>This movie insults the intelligence and tests the patience of even the most forgiving audience."

For over a decade now I have wrongfully categorized this beautiful and talented young women in a group with the likes of other blonde paparazzi favorites like Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Lady Gaga, et al. To atone for this sin, I immediately ordered three of her albums. I can add little to the earlier rave reviews of this film, other than to say it was 100 minutes of sheer joy. Anyone complaining about this movie's plot should never, ever be allowed into a musical. I wouldn't be surprised to see numerous Oscar nominations for musical score, art direction, editing, costumes, and yes, even acting.

With its slight comedy/romance side combined with its musical aspect, Burlesque is a movie that is sure to leave a viewer breathless, as it did with me. If you're not a fan of this genre, this movie might not be for you, since there are some scenes that some might consider boring if they are not into this type of movie (Ex. Long singing scenes).Cher, Christina and Kristen really put on a good show though, so if you're hesitant, you might discover a new genre that is to your taste.

","Bar-waitress from Iowa ditches the sticks with a bus ticket to Hollywood, where she seeks employment as a singer; she finds an extravagant strip club on the Strip--where nobody strips!--and eventually worms her way into a dancing audition. Steve Antin wrote and directed this modern-day razzle-dazzle musical fantasy, apparently after overdosing on a double feature of ""Cabaret"" and ""A Star Is Born"". The film apes Fosse's ""Cabaret"" openly and unashamedly (not that fans of star Christina Aguilera would notice), even throwing in a dance routine to the ""Cabaret"" instrumental ""Sitting Pretty"". In fact, Antin is so wrapped up in his movie homages (i.e., stealing bits and pieces from various films, including ""Midnight Cowboy"" for the first few minutes) that he forgets to make sense out of the one he's directing. Cher runs the Burlesque club, and performs whenever she feels like it, but is in debt to the bank and may have close the joint down (a subplot right out of a 1940s Betty Hutton picture); in the mean time, Aguilera, who's been hiding her singing light under a bushel, finally belts out a smoky number and brings down the house--but will it be enough to get the hot-spot out of hock? Perhaps using less electricity in the stage numbers would curb their Edison bill? There's a musclebound bartender who has eyes for Christina (he wears eyeliner and she initially thinks he's gay, the only time that word is mentioned), while Stanley Tucci flits about like Peter Pan playing Cher's assistant (his character is gay, but Antin is as bashful of that as is he about the girls' stage routines). There's no connection between ""Burlesque"" and reality; it's all smoke-and-mirrors piffle. Cher doesn't want to sell the club, nobody can offer her enough money to give up the club, yet she won't listen to anyone's suggestions and she doesn't want to change the format. The welfare of her dancers barely comes into the equation--they don't even seem aware of the club's money troubles. The generic boy-girl romance between bartender/songwriter and singer/dancer is used as a fringe element, and has so little relevance to the central action that it becomes a chore to get through (it has been added simply to extend Aguilera's profile). Throughout, we get bitchy backstage banter and Vegas-styled musical numbers without anything concrete to support the issues of loyalty the script timidly raises. ""Burlesque"" has a chronic case of ""Peter Pan""-itis...it refuses to allow grown-up actors the chance to act grown-up on the screen. ** from ****"

","Burlesque is not a film for all audiences, and I'm willing to bet I'm the only fourteen year old who expressed an ounce of interest for this film. It's a musical/dance number that is constructed much like the 2002 hit Chicago. Beautiful women, catchy score, and a very involving story line. While 2010 has certainly offered better, if no musical comes out that's surpasses this one, I can easily say that ""Burlesque"" is the best musical of this year.<br/><br/>Cher, in the music world, is outstanding. Cher, in the film world, isn't so hot. She's done some winners and some losers like many actors/actresses, but it seems her filmography is always underrated and shed away compared to her discography. This is the first time I've seen Cher in a film since Stuck on You in 2003. I have been known to like her and enjoy her music. Burlesque shows off her inner talent and your eyes will be glues to her every time she steps onto the screen. Something about her voice, passion, (plastic) face, and apparel makes her an immediate site of attraction. I will also say that Welcome to Burlesque is my favorite song in this film as well.<br/><br/>The story follows Ali (Xtina) who escapes her life at a local dinner to head to Los Angeles to find herself at the Burlesque Lounge where she winds up meeting the club's firm but fair headliner Tess (Cher). As events go on, Ali impresses Tess with her strong voice and high passion for singing and makes her part of the dancing team. Ali finally gets the break she's been waiting for when she can express herself and show the Burlesque Lounge what she's made of.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the club is ailing and the future is looking so high, but with Cher running the club anything can happen. While it's the cliché ""showing people your true talent"" scheme it's shown to us in a very musical style which is something I don't see too often. I'd see this five times before I sit in the theater for Country Strong.<br/><br/>The score for Burlesque completes the film. No song is truly memorable, but for the film both Cher and Xtina provide some impressive vocals, especially Cher who has some dark/eerie singing abilities. Too bad most of the songs are occupied by the young blood rather than the pioneer. Xtina does a fine job at acting, but Cher was the true highlight/standout of the film.<br/><br/>Burlesque runs one minute shy of two hours, which for a musical is a bit lengthy, especially when the overall story isn't utilized to the fullest. I'd have like to see more of the girl's lives outside of Burlesque rather than see Xtina so much. It's nothing I'd watch/buy on DVD, but Burlesque proves to be more than the trailers show. It's a decent movie to wrap up Thanksgiving, but definitely not a film for everyone. The Sound of Music fans may be disappointed. Chicago fans might appreciate it.<br/><br/>Starring: Cher, Christina Aguilera, Eric Dane, Cam Gigandet, and Julianne Hough. Directed by: Steve Antin."

","I am giving it a six because of Christina Aguilera.<br/><br/>Essentially an Aguilera video with a cliché of a story line to join the music it was competently done. Good dance routines and pleasant music which became repetitive toward the end. Aguilera's electrifying voice kept my attention throughout.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci carries on with his role in The Devil Wears Prada, even to the extent of casually flipping costumery over his shoulder at the young protagonist (Aguilera in this case) whilst delivering witty repartee.<br/><br/>Cher wailed like a stuck pig in some of her numbers. I don't believe that her singing added value as CA swept all before her. It's difficult to compete with Aguilera's power. Not many solo artists today could follow her act.<br/><br/>I am not competent enough to comment on Cher's acting performance but she was believable in the simple (beleagured) role.<br/><br/>Aguilera gives an honest and energetic performance. I think she is a lovely girl and that is exactly what she plays in this picture. Nothing spectacular. I bought her story as simple as it was. Some bitchy comments seemed to be out of character later in the movie after she gains a measure of fame.<br/><br/>When CA opens her mouth to sing, I shut mine and listen."

","Lets be clear, this movie really does make you want to just get up and start dancing. This movie was pure sexy fun, and for us ladies there was some great eye candy too. But with the fun we also have to be realistic and look at this movie like a movie. <br/><br/>The good<br/><br/>1.costumes,music, sets were great, amazing and beautiful.

But for the drama in this movie she needs to work on her acting for future productions. And lets be real at one point in the movie her acting was so blah that I just wanted to slap Ali for being so annoying.<br/><br/>2.The storyline for the film had to much going on. Between Christina wanting jack who has a lady friend to wanting the other guy, to her wanting to be a singer in the show, then the whole money problem with Cher, to Nikki being a drunk , and lastly Georgia getting knocked up. Well There was just a little to much going on. So the movie isn't perfect, but then again those are hard to find now and days. But the movie was fun, flirty, sexy, and had great musicality.<br/><br/>I give it a 6 out of ten for being the fun movie it was suppose to me, but knock of points for lack of consistent story and acting chops."

The movie itself is pretty horrible. Flimsy storyline, and horrible acting mostly from Christina herself. On a movie level it sucks! But the dance numbers were good. The outfits were good. The music was catchy and good.<br/><br/>I don't know why they turned Xtina's live shows into a movie and added a ""plot"" around the numbers. I would have been happy to just see two hours of JUST Xtina PERFORMING! Because THAT is what she is good at. She belongs on a stage. Not on a movie set! She is a great singer and dancer. Acting...no, sorry. She is easy on the eyes, but she needs to back it up with acting skill.<br/><br/>This movie was just an attempt to cash in on Xtina's and Cher's names, among other actors in the film. They threw the story together as an excuse to have these elaborate dance numbers. If you saw the movie in one number the ""plot"" just gets in the way! SHOW ME THE DANCING! <br/><br/>Parts of the movie made no sense like if she was from a small town then why was she the only one without an accent? She sounded like any Hollywood girl! Also Tess would have not been that nice. People in big cities are cruel as HELL! Why did that Veronica Mars girl not sue Tess? I'm sure she was hired to be the main attraction, then just dumped for Xtina? I guess Tess was poor or something. But people took actions that made no sense. If you watch the movie you will most likely only enjoy the song and dance numbers."

","If you like Christina Aguilera, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you like movies, you probably won't enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>The issue is if you are looking at it objectively as film for watching, it's just not good. There is no drama, no depth, nothing to get you engaged or interested. But Aguilera is super talented - we know this - and I have chosen to factor her singing ability into this rating. Perhaps that isn't right, and instead I can just go and listen to her music separately to enjoy that.<br/><br/>Regardless of the music, I was bored. I didn't care for what was happening, what was coming next, and what might happen. And then when what happened happened, I just watched it happen with no reaction.<br/><br/>My suggestion: skim the in-between bits (the plot is so predictable it will be easy to pick up) and just listen to the Aguilera bits. Or probably better yet, just listen to the soundtrack."

Sure, it could have been more, and Alan Cumming should have had more though his moments on screen were priceless.<br/><br/>It's burlesque, it's naughty, it's back-biting and it's where music and dreams collide.Just the fab musical numbers won me over, Christina Aquilera's singing was fabulous and Cher's solo worth admission.<br/><br/>The love story was a little too drawn out and the film sagged in the middle from, but the rest, was fun, lively and did I say it before, Great Music."

"tabuno","8","2","3","18 January 2019"," A Great Use of Musical Production and Movie Development
","26 November 2010. There are some amazing musical productions in this small, compact movie that captures some of the dazzle of best Oscar Picture CHICAGO (2002), particularly one of the earlier numbers using a similar flashy Richard Gere court revue. This is a more soft touch THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (2006) as Christina Aquilera appears to get to escape the wrath of a devil and contend more with a softer version of Meryl Streep. The music itself doesn't quite have the poignancy and magic of MOULIN ROUGE (2001), the universal mass popularity of MAMMA MIA! (2008), and the haunting, ethereal sounds from THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA. This overly predictable musical, however extends itself in some great editing interspersing musical production numbers with movie scenes moving the storyline along and spends time on character plot development in a more convoluted path. The biggest weakness and one that makes its distractive presence noticeable is a technical one - the lip sinking. Even the first musical number is so disconnected between the acting and the singing that continues throughout much of the movie undercuts one of the crucial points of how BURLESQUE becomes more popular. There is also a weak scene in acting between Cher and Chirstina when the owner offers advice to her up and coming employee. The ending doesn't quite have the nice edgy feel of THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA and has a much more mass audience feels go ending and excludes that movies the dramatic collision with good and narcissism. Nevertheless, the energy, and entertainment value has bravado and power and compelling attraction."

","I went to see this movie with a friend at the cheap movie theater because we had nothing better to do. Before we went in we warned ourselves that this movie had been getting horrible reviews. I must say we were both pleasantly surprised and impressed with the movie as a whole. It is not great by any means but it is enjoyable and does not deserve the ridicule it gets. It's not West Side Story but it also isn't Glitter. Christina was about average on the acting scale, enough for me to enjoy her performance. Like Crossroads, it is clear that Burlesque was written for Christina Aguilera; and like Crossroads it gets a bad wrap. The ending was a cliché, Hollywood Happy Ending scenario, but that still didn't take a way from the fantastic performances, gorgeous costumes, and pleasant story. The romance between Christina and her leading man was fake as h--- to easy and would never happen; but whatever it made me smile. I would highly recommend you see the film yourself before judging."

"huldahvonn","5","1","1","23 April 2020"," Ugh. Uggghh. I don't like it.
","Ugh I really didn't like it. There are some positives. The dance routines are pretty cool, the dancers do a good job. The costumes and make up are nice. So the costume and make up designers get a thumbs up from me along with the choreographer. Besides that, oh boy. The script is pretty meh, the story is really predictable. Like really predictable. In fact it's kind of just Coyote Ugly except worse. I didn't like the main character Ali at all. She's probably the least amiable main character I've seen since Psycho. She's just obnoxious, rude and mean. I know she's supposed to come off as this strong young independent woman and I love that type of characters. But come on. This is a film about a woman whose only aspirations is to dance provocatively. I have absolutely nothing against doing that. But the film makes it look like she's striving for the Nobel peace price or something.<br/><br/>Jack, the main male love interest, absolutely deserves her. Are we supposed to feel so sorry for him for being in a long distance relationship with a girl who values her carrier that we deem it okay for him to cheat on her? Don't get me wrong. His girlfriend is conveniently horrible. But still. And the stuff he says just in general. The ""want a cookie?"" line (delivered by Jack standing naked next to Ali with a box of cookies to hide... him) made me dry heave profusely. The ""You're definitely not gay"" post-coital sentence from Ali produced a similar reaction. Like... what is this film? Who is writing these scenes and those dialogues?<br/><br/>Oh and I hate the sound mixing. Why do everybody sound like they're singing in a studio all the time? Even when singing on stage without a microphone? Like the scene where Nikki turns the sound system off whilst Ali is singing and they just freeze, but then Ali steps up and sings the vocals herself. She's supposed to be singing completely unsupported, not even a mic, but she sounds positive autotuned. It just takes you out of the film. It's rather ironic when Ali is this great rebel fighting for the girls to sing themselves instead of miming.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I've gone on a complete rant. It's just such an overrated film. Bottom point being, just watch Coyote Ugly."

I enjoyed watching the film - it's just not up there with the ones I mentioned. And the business of it being too ""Bob Fosse""-esque? Pah.

","A burlesque is basically a classy cabaret strip club where no private areas are shown, only teased. Christina Aguilera plays a stereotypical small town waitress girl who moves to the big city for a new opportunity, where she becomes a waitress (go figure) at a burlesque parlor. However, she soon discovers the beauty and fun that being a burlesque performer is. She auditions for a part, and once in, she starts to make changes to all involved while also trying to save the lounge from a financial crisis. This movie is a predictable and clichéd tale with mediocre acting from some, and superb acting from others. I could actually guess what was coming most of the time. Fortunately, this movie makes up for it's flaws with amazing performances in both dancing as well as singing, to the point that the performances almost seemed to become a character themselves.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: 10 Script: 4 Originality: 2 Cinematography: 8 Casting: 7 Acting: 5"
"RNHunter","8","1","1","24 January 2014"," Excellent but not Burlesque and that is fine
","Movie Burlesque<br/><br/>First of all, regardless of what I say during this, I do recommend the movie. I am a sucker for a group of pretty women dancing. Partially because I am a male, but women to me often have great moves and are not afraid to go with the music as many males are. Also this movie was done in what I would call good taste and there was honestly little that even I an older person would find offensive. And Cher And Christine Aguilera also played their parts well, and were often fun at times.<br/><br/>That being said, I would say that this movie called Burlesque had little to do with Burlesque, and I for one am fine with that, but it needs to be said. The women wore cute costumes, seldom showed much, and mostly had brash powerful music. Were they trying to threaten the audience? So I sort of saw this as ""Burlesque as preferred by a women"" ha, ha, sort of along the lines of, ""I am woman, hear me roar"". But I do not think the Moulin Rouge in Paris will be picking up this act soon. If meant as an allure alone, most men I think prefer at least a small amount of feminine side and sweetness on stage of the women. But again, what is wrong here is that I would not call this Burlesque, but something quite good more along the lines of the Rockettes. And as for the music, Cher sang two nice songs I believe and was her usual great self. I did not recognize Christine Aguilera at first and had to look up her name, but her voice was beyond talented. She had exceptional range and was able to do voice tricks such as being gravely at this point or smooth at another. But again for my tastes, even though I call that extreme talent, I tend to like songs more melodic, perhaps dare I say romantic. Christine's songs were too powerful for my tastes and came across more as if she were doing ""76 trombones"" rather than trying for sexy. But talented? Quite talented. I was left wondering who else on this planet could have sung the parts of Christine Aguilera.<br/><br/>And so I would highly recommend it as decent acting, good taste, great female dancing, even though the title ""Burlesque"" would seem not quite right. But yes I want to watch it again. Perhaps I am even happy that it was not the normal Burlesque."

"EUyeshima","5","1","1","7 March 2011"," A Well Preserved Cher Keeps This Predictable Pile of Showbiz Clichés Afloat
","Despite an eye-catching veneer that appears like a stylistic cross between Bob Fosse (""Cabaret"") and Rob Marshall (""Chicago""), this 2010 backstage musical written and directed by former actor Steve Antin is pure Hollywood hokum repackaged for the ""American Idol"" generation. Rather than being remotely provocative in subject or treatment, the film is actually a slapdash, new-millennium update of ""42nd Street"" in which the classic 1933 movie's most famous line, ""You're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!"", applies perfectly here. The youngster in this case is pop star Christina Aguilera in her feature film debut as Ali Rose, a plucky Iowa waitress described scabrously by an alcohol-fueled rival named Nikki as a ""slut with mutant lungs"". Your reaction to that comment will depend on how much you like Aguilera's throaty, blues-inspired holler of a singing voice. You would have to enjoy it a lot to sit through the several production numbers she performs in the movie.<br/><br/>The story is trite. Ali leaves Iowa for LA on a bus and faces exactly one day of unemployment during our current economic malaise when she discovers the Burlesque Lounge on the Sunset Strip. Talking her way into a waitress job thanks to sympathetic bartender Jack, she desperately tries to persuade the club's owner Tess that she belongs on the stage with all the leggy, lip-synching dancers. A dancer's unplanned pregnancy gives Ali the chance to audition and take her place, and then conveniently, Tess picks Ali to substitute for a drunken Nikki to take the lead one night. Out of spite, Nikki cuts off the recorded music at which point Ali sings in her own voice. In perhaps the most patronizing scene, the awestruck reactions of customers and colleagues insure her immediate stardom and Nikki's vengeful wrath. As Ali's star ascends, she is also caught in a romantic triangle between Jack and a wealthy opportunist named Marcus.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Tess faces the prospect of losing her club despite the good fortune brought forth by Ali's emerging fame. If you can't figure out the rest of the by-the-numbers plot, clearly you don't get out much. Even though the film is a showcase for Aguilera, it is really Cher who anchors it with her dry insouciance and sheer professionalism. At 64, she looks great in a highly cosmeticized way, but it's really her natural likability and her two standout numbers that linger in the memory. The first is a teasing nod to ""Cabaret"" called ""Welcome to Burlesque"" and the second is a Diane Warren-penned power ballad, ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"", which she sings with the same emotional fervor Jennifer Hudson did with her big ""Dreamgirls"" number, ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"". Aguilera acquits herself well as Ali. It's just that the role is such a predictable set of clichés when she's offstage.<br/><br/>As Tess' loyal confidante, Stanley Tucci plays almost exactly the same role he played in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and in the same wry manner that works just as well here. Cam Gigandet as Jack and Eric Dane as Marcus aren't given much opportunity to make memorable impressions. Kristen Bell has a few choice moments showing her talons as Nikki. Shallow entertainment for those in the mood for it. Extras are plentiful but not indispensable on the 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray. There is a talky but none too insightful commentary track from Antin, an alternate opening sequence that extends the Iowa setting, a five-minute blooper reel, and footage of six uncut musical numbers. The Blue-Ray additionally offers a five-part making-of featurette for true fans of the film."

","There are plenty of things that are wrong or off with Burlesque. Sometimes it's out of focus, the characters could have been more three- dimensional and its plot could have been more elaborate and original. Yet, ""Burlesque"" never fails to be entertaining and fun with occasional funny dialog, perfectly choreographed and directed dance and song numbers with a blooming love story in the mix. And there's Cher! <br/><br/>The aim of ""Burlesque"" is to provide the audience with a sense of feeling good about themselves, with an ease that is hard to express in words. When the story calls for character moments, it's all very sweet and innocent, even if these people wouldn't want to be seen as such. In one scene, Tess (Cher) discovers one of her dancers is pregnant (which opens the door for Christina Aguilera's Ali to assume her place and let her star shine). Tess is a very tough woman, so you'd expect the poor girl to be fired. Instead, Tess promises to take very good care of her and she has nothing to be afraid of.<br/><br/>The kind of sweetness even penetrates the burlesque numbers (no pun intended!). Even though they are very erotic and playful, there is no nudity to be found here. The women enjoy being on stage and dancing burlesque is just like any other job. When the working day is done, you'll go for pizza with your co-workers. <br/><br/>The sweetness is all the more surprising, considering the temptation to go from respectable to pure sexual exposition. Even the one sex scene in the film is about cookies and where to get them, if you'll be in the mood for a bite.<br/><br/>It's just that sweet."

A failing business, rich man wanting to buy everything to close shop and build something else, goose with golden eggs is found and all is well on Sunset Boulevard. Not a lot of surprises there. But hey, to me, the storyline hadn't become a drag or didn't feel too much of a cliché when watching, which is something you want to pay attention to when milking off an old theme.<br/><br/>There is quite some singing involved which means a lot of lip-sync. Tough job for the director who has to make it look like characters are actually singing ""live"". Mr. Antin, Steve, I'm sorry but you did quite the shitty job there. I get it, you're not a music-video-director. But please dear, don't try to be one then. Some of the songs ""preformed"" by Aguilera are so much out of sync it becomes funny. Not irritating, but funny. A flaw which was partially mended by the quality of the songs and the acts. The movie has a soundtrack that is kind to the ears (at least mine) and acts that are very nicely filmed and choreographed. But I ask you, again, WHY is it that Richard Gere and Renée Zellweger can be made to lip songs almost perfectly (Chicago) and Aguilera (& Cher) can't? Moving on to the performance of the 2 main artists/actors... Chrisina Aquilera and Cher. I àm a fan of both (actually a big big Cher-fan) so I'm a little biased. But I think they did great. Ignoring the sync (I know, I'll try and let go), you get to hear (and see) 2 amazing voices utilized to their full extent. The Etta James-esque sound of Aguilera and the slightly masculine undertoned Cher-voice. Also acting-wise they did good.<br/><br/>So... We have here a movie that is a lot of fun to watch (and hear), nothing' more nothing' less. Guaranteed to give you a gay old time, in every sense of the word!"

","This movie was so bad it was funny, one giant cliché after another It reminded me of PG-rated version of Showgirls<br/><br/>-small town girl who slaves in a diner gets stiffed by her boss<br/><br/>-so she take a bus to LA to fulfill her dreams<br/><br/><ul><li>works as bartender at a glitzy, non-porno Burlesque club, moves in with one of the bartender, they have a crush on each other</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>her roommate is an aspiring songwriter, who works on this little 2 octave keyboard and notates everything out</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>she gets an audition, the boss ( Cher) who is a has-been performer, gives her a break after our starlet begs and begs.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>gratuitous gay back-stage manager</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>she catches the attention of a rich patron, who tried to corrupt her, has a huge mansion in the Hollywood Hills.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>eventually the old star ( who's a drunk and a slut) of the show gets envious and quits.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the bar is in dire financial straights, the bank is circling to foreclose.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>our new star and her roommate finally make love.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cher and Christina barge into the office of a wealthy land developer ( James frigging' Brolin) and convince him to buy their club.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>their club is saved, yay! happy ending ensues. Even the envious drunk slut returns to apologize in what can be compared to a very Brady moment.</li></ul><br/><br/>Of course everything is improbable, predictable, neat and pretty ( pretty lame). The dialog is plastic and one-dimensional. Obviously this was a vehicle for Aguilera to get pushed thru the Hollywood star mechanism. I swear the girl must have had bot-ox or is on Lexipro, cause even when she smiles she has no emotion- its uncanny. She always has this vacant disconnect like no matter how hard she tries to be there- strangely she isn't.<br/><br/>Then there is Cher, who still looks pretty damn good for 65. She must have negotiated the solo performance in the contract. It really brought the film down to a screeching halt and served no purpose. At least no obvious Auto-Tune on her vocals this time.<br/><br/>I know quite a lot about burlesque, and there is very little in this film. Burlesque is a bit more risqué and a LOT less Fosse. There is no skit work,bad jokes, or pasties and only one number where the act actually strips. Actually the film doesn't foray into any explanation of burlesque at all.<br/><br/>Lastly, there is the music and how it ties into the film. The point of this club was the girls lip- synced to standard burlesque songs.OK, I can go along with that but then why the need for the band? Good musicians ain't cheap and in cabaret licensed club- they get union scale. Since the club was bad off financially, the band must have cost them 6K a week, and the performers are already lip-syncing so WHY KEEP A BAND?!! Of course the mixes are slick studio sounding- not live at all which is what Christina uniquely offers to the club- the ABILITY TO SING LIVE! ARGH!!<br/><br/>Oh, and check out the remake of Marilyn Manson's ""Beautiful People"" in the beginning and end credits: unforgivable."

","http://movieswithmitch.com/ Mitch Hansch ""It takes a LEGEND to make a STAR!"" It takes Stanley Tucci in this FILM for me not to blow my brains out all over my POPCORN! Out of the 2 stars I've given to ""Burlesque"" one goes just to Tucci's performance. As the calming stage manager of Cher's erotic dance club, he did just that- calm me. Making the film's talkie parts bearable with his immeasurable talent of being able to raise the performance of his co-stars and make it possible to almost enjoy the silly world around him.<br/><br/>I'm definitely not the intended viewer for ""Burlesque"" but if a film's good, I'll appreciate it. Heck, if a film's so bad it's good, I'll appreciate that as well. But director Steve Antin couldn't even get that right, missing the mark on consistent camp and only succeeding in plain old bad filmmaking. This is no train wreck like ""Glitter"" or ""Showgirls"" but ""who cares"" sub-plot after ""who cares"" sub-plot along with stolen choreography from ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"" make for a viewing experience that almost made my eyes rolling in the back of my head permanent.<br/><br/>A Midwest (duh) waitress named Ali (Christina Aguilera) has big dreams and moves to Hollywood (dur), learns of the sexy and exotic world of Burlesque dancing and gets the bug (dur-dur), then through much begging is finally given a chance from club owner and star Tess (Cher) and finally a rival jealous dancer's attempt at treachery actually backfires allowing Ali to show off her awesome pipes that nobody knew about (dur, dur, dur). Throw in a romance with a hot bartender (Cam Gigandet) and Tess dealing with threats of her club's foreclosure and there you have it folks.<br/><br/>In her film debut, Aguilera wasn't nearly as bad as I thought she would be. The ""dirrty"" girl isn't much for conveying lots of emotion unless it's up onstage singing but it's a smooth enough delivery that it doesn't take away too much focus. As her rival dancer puts it, played horribly obnoxious by Kristen Bell, ""she's a girl with mutant lungs"". Her famous lungs even had me bopping a little to the film's title song. How do you get Cher to return to her first full film since 1999's ""Tea with Mussolini"" and only give her two songs? One of them coming in my least favorite scene where the number is completely unrelated to the film and is just there because Antin remembered he had Cher in the movie. Cher, who has an Oscar, deserves some sort of award for taking on the horse crap dialogue she was forced to deliver.<br/><br/>""But Mitch you're just a ruff and tuff man's-man that can slam a Smirnoff Ice like no one I've ever seen, this isn't the type of film you'd ever enjoy."" Wrong about never enjoying these kind of films . It's called ""Moulin Rouge"" and I'll watch it with you right now mister! Again, I'm not the intended demographic for ""Burlesque"".

","I watched this movie last Wednesday because of a burlesque party that was organized that night. I wanted to get some inspiration for a costume, so what else to watch? If I should describe the movie in one word it would be 'fast'. The movie starts at a far away middle of nowhere town where you meet the usual-farm-girl-with-big-dreams (Christina). In 5 minutes she decides to go away and in less then five minutes she is in L.A., has an apartment and is looking for a job. The movie could better start at the minute where she arrives: that would be less fast.<br/><br/>The whole movie goes fast and is really predictable, but is good enough to watch when you're having a girls night 'cause you can predict everything so quickly, you won't even have to pay attention to it.<br/><br/>But well, doesn't Christina looks beautiful in all those costumes?"

","A hokey but passable story about small town youth(s) who come to tinsel town to make their mark but then get tossed around by the nightclub business. Love interest, good guys, bad guys, happy ending, it's all there. Some good acting. Don't blame the actors for the script. Sher is timeless as a stage/screen presence and she can read any line she wants. Music score, excellent. Dance routines are OK but are badly fractured by the rapid clip changes. The film editor gets a C minus or maybe they couldn't hold their dance routines for more than 1.5 seconds.<br/><br/>I'm a song and dance kind of guy. Big screen, big sound all the way. But, we've seen it before. The ancestor to this genre, for me, was the best of them all - Caberet. With a nod to 'Chorus Line' and 'Chicago', nothing else has since come close on the screen. That doesn't mean this wasn't a good effort. But ""Good efforts"" are in the same category as ""nice guys"" who are supposed to finish last. <br/><br/>Don't wait for the small screen on this one. but go to the bargain matinée. As you leave give a quiet thought to Bob Fosse and Rob Marshall. There may be an Academy award nomination somewhere here, but I'm probably not smart enough to see it."

Real estate guy Marcus Gerber (Eric Dane) is dating Nikki and trying to buy the club from Tess.<br/><br/>Aguilera is too old to play the young innocent thing who comes into town. The story is older than Cher. It has no originality at all. The song and dance is fun for a little while. Aguilera knows how to sing and even Kristen Bell does a good job. However all the performance are too similar and they wear thin really quickly. They get repetitive and boring. I don't mind Aguilera's acting although she's not winning any awards any time soon.

","Small town girl goes to the big city to make it big. Really? Haven't we seen this before? Well of course we have, but we've never been on this journey with Cher! Christina Aguilera plays the small town girl, who makes her way to L.A. to make it big. She lands in the Burlesque club run by Tess (Cher) and starts to wait tables while trying desperately to let Tess give her a go on stage. Meanwhile she shacks up as friends with barman Jack and befriends property developer who has his sights on the club.<br/><br/>Of course Tess does give her a job and everyone is astounded at her talent and the club thrives. Along the way Ali, treads on toes, gets heartbroken and becomes something of a star, while then discover the true meaning of Marcus's interests and therefore saving the club and helping Tess (mother figure!!) and the romance with Jack can blossom. Hurrah! The films story is pretty standard; small town girl, the young handsome barman who also writes songs (lets hope Ali get to sing one!) the divaesque star of the club who's limelight is stolen and the charming, but obviously has something else planned man. But despite all this the film rolls along very merrily and is really quite entertaining. Set mostly in the club, the director may have watched films like Moulin Rouge, Cabaret, Dreamgirls or Chicago before walking on set, but there is a great visual style to it with well staged musical numbers which are quite catchy, with only the slow ballads being a bit cheesy. Perhaps the burlesque element is a little bit of a modern interpretation, with only a feather fan number alluded to traditional burlesque, but that aside the musical numbers make the flow of the film move well.<br/><br/>Aguilera is quite good as Ali, though it's not a big step away from her normal performing persona. Cher of course is Cher and doesn't really have to do anything, she's just great; there are two handsome lead male characters and while it seems Stanley Tucci came from the set of The Devil Wears Prada still in character, he is fun on screen and there is a nice relationship between him and Cher.<br/><br/>The film never really goes anywhere and the plot is painfully obvious, but it also never becomes too serious and the issues are light in their nature with only a brief foray into the a story about drinking. In fact the film is quite good fun, with some nice moments throughout, such as when Ali arrives at Sean's apartment only to find a male guest with neither of them remembering each others name.<br/><br/>Not as bad as Showgirls, but without as much style or drama of Moulin Rouge or Cabaret, this is still an enjoyable romp that's a lot of fun.<br/><br/>More of my review at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com"

I think Christina A. is a fantastic performer, however, and I was so looking forward to seeing her acting debut. Sadly it didn't seem to be her best thing but for that you can blame the script a bit.<br/><br/>If you liked Milli Vanilli and are into lip-syncing in general this is the film for you. When the performers do get around to ACTUAL singing the gig improves immensely.<br/><br/>It's not a waste of time but I rate it as ""we should have waited for the red box or cable""."
"gilligan-11","7","2","4","25 November 2010"," A campy, fun hot mess
","""Burlesque"" is definitely the campiest film to come along in a long time. Before seeing this film, I suspected that it might be the new ""Showgirls,"" but alas—it was much better than that. It truly embraced its lack of originality—small town girl with tons of talent escapes banal existence in Iowa and heads to LA to seek fame, fortune, and love. There were, however, some very 21st-century elements added: Stanley Tucci as the benevolent gay sage (Hey, Stanley, aren't you in danger of being typecast in this kind of role? Just sayin'), a hot—I mean HOT—I mean HAWT—male love interest for Christina Aguilera, played by Cam Gigandet (and not only is he Hot—or did I already mention that?—but he's also quite charming), and Cher in all her surgically reconstructed glory. I must admit that Cher's appearance was sometimes so distracting that my mind wandered from the story (not to worry though—it was quite easy to re-orient myself to the achingly simple plot) and I began to wonder whether Cher's enormous lips would go rogue and devour her face. At any rate, for a singer, Christina Aguilera proved to be a pretty good actress, although I doubt her ""skill"" could stretch beyond this type of role. The songs were adequately entertaining, and there were some clever bits of dialogue amid the mostly clichéd script. Overall, a campy guilty pleasure."

","What sticks with you from this movie is what a good singer Christina Aguilera really is. She polishes off ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" in better voice than Marilyn Monroe. The plot of the film is cliché-ridden, and no one who really performed in burlesque would recognize any of this as burlesque. But that is not the point. The reason to see this is to get a glimpse at what makes Aguilera so popular and to see how Cher's latest plastic surgery is holding up. As a story, it is predictable, but it takes some effort to produce so old-fashioned a musical in the 21st century, and Cher fans (of which I am one) will adore her singing ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me."" ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013"

","Here is the thing about BURLESQUE: it's a film with entertainment purposes that delivers just that without reaching some sort of superior level in the cinematography industry. At the end of the day, BURLESQUE is a film about a girl who has nothing in life but dancing and singing amazingly without any type of training who might or not get to succeed in life at a club she ends up loving. It's not bad: the songs are funny, Christina Aguilera's voice is amazing, Cher does her job as well, Stanley Tucci is funny and there is some romance and drama during the whole thing to make you interested. But it lacks some depth. Even though it's enjoyable and funny and cute, it's not exactly new - somewhere someone watched something already that resembles this. Also, I thought some things were happening too fast - I would prefer to have less plots. Instead, we had several characters that interacted, with several different plots that worked just fine but would work better if given the time - which was not given.<br/><br/>Basically, it is something people can watch and enjoy and some songs might make you want to dance or sing, but it's not something to be taken way too seriously. The idea is to entertain and that is completely delivered."

","I've watched this movie many times on reruns (TV). Christine has an incredible talent and frankly I'd watch just the parts with her singing. But she did very well as an actress and wasn't just 'used' because of her killer voice. The movie runs a typical plot with the unknown girl with a hidden talent who goes from the rags to riches while trying to balance her personal life with career, and of course the gambit of choosing the 'right guy'. The relationships between characters was very good. I totally love Stanley Tucci in anything he does, and as usual, he was great in this.

Christina Aguilera is not a great actress, but she was not half as bad as, for example, fellow pop stars Britney Spears in ""Crossroads"", and Jessica Simpson in... pretty much anything she's associated with.<br/><br/>While the plot is very clichéd and predictable, it's still moderately entertaining. It's a very eye-catching and polished movie, with lots of gorgeous costumes and some great singing from Cher and Christina.<br/><br/>I thought the antagonists should've been developed a bit better, which would have improved the movie significantly, but... oh, well. Actually, the same goes for Christina Aguilera's character. They didn't bother making her likable or at least less... one-dimensional; it's only her natural charisma that carries her through.<br/><br/>Also, the supposedly-romantic scenes could've been better -- they were predictable, unexciting, and forced.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie imitates elements of ""Chicago"", ""Show Girls"", ""Cabaret"", ""Coyote Ugly"", and probably some other movies, but it really didn't bother me much.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think this movie is worth seeing -- even if you're not a fan of either Cher or Christina Aguilera.

"larson-sara","8","0","0","14 February 2013"," Wonderful Updated Musical
","Since society is enthralled by glorified, flashy material, it's no surprise that musicals have veered from performing typical upstanding show tunes and wholesome dances to much more modern and scandalous versions, as shown with the movie Burlesque. The classical musical is all grown up, and Burlesque is the perfect movie to showcase the features of the updated musical.<br/><br/>As the movie begins, the audience can't help but inwardly groan to themselves, as Burlesque seems to be just another cliché about an aspiring young woman trying to make it in Hollywood as a performer. The standard, boring storyline. However, as the movie progresses the audience realizes there is much more to it than meets the eye, exemplifying a plot twist found in most flicks nowadays. The story of the main character, Ali, trying to succeed in Hollywood by performing at the Burlesque night club quickly spirals into a struggle to save that beloved club.<br/><br/>Although the plot lacked substantial substance and there was no ulterior motive for the production of the movie, the chemistry of the characters combined with fabulous musical numbers and costumes made for excellent entertainment. Christina Aguilera, who played the role of Ali, was the ultimate combination of sexy and sweet. Her character had a certain charisma about her; a mix of sheer determination, stubbornness, and confidence made her immediately likable. Cher played Tess, the Burlesque night club owner, and even though her untraditional beauty is off-putting at first, the audience grows to love her as she becomes a mentor for Ali.<br/><br/>And of course, no one can forget about Jack. Played by actor Cam Gigandet, Jack is much more than just flawlessly sculpted muscles, a chiseled jaw line, and piercing eyes. He's the good guy in Ali's life (even though she doesn't realize it). The audience encourages his blooming feelings for Ali, since we recognize that he treats her right and makes her happy.<br/><br/>Pushup bras and skimpy costumes that could easily be mistaken for lingerie are omnipresent throughout the movie, but with the expertly choreographed dances and Christina Aguilera's unbelievable voice (especially a breathtaking a cappella solo), the movie manages to keep the movie tasteful as much as possible. All the sparkles, sequins, and glamorous sets will not fail to make everyone, regardless of age or sex, wish they could have their moment on stage just like the girls in Burlesque.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie that you need to be actively and continuously processing in order to understand the story, Burlesque is not the movie for you. Rather, Burlesque allows the audience to passively and comfortably watch, but as they do, their mind can't help but wonder if the dreams they've been holding back on can truly be achieved after all."

Fed up with the hole she appears to be in she takes what she can scrape up and heads to Los Angeles.<br/><br/>When there she does the usual search in the classifieds, trying to find a job, when she happens upon the nightspot called ""Burlesque"", run by Cher as Tess. They are not hiring so she picks up a tray and starts waiting tables, without an invitation. She eventually gets a chance to show what she can do, which especially is powerful singing, and this forces Tess to reevaluate how she runs her show.<br/><br/>For a singer, I suppose inexperienced as an actress, Aguilera does a fine, believable job as Ali. Cher is of course fine, but the real actor among the cast is Stanley Tucci as Sean, gay jack of all backstage trades and Tess's right hand man. Eric Dane is fine as the bartender, songwriter, Marcus who also gives Ali a place to stay, destined to become Ali's love interest. Dianna Agron is Natalie, the absent fiancée of Marcus, and we only see her once when she returns to find Ali in her place. which is a loss for the movie, as Agron is very good.<br/><br/>The story isn't particularly novel or deep, but it is fun watching the actors and see how the story unfolds.

So what?<br/><br/>Don't tell me you've never seen and possibly even enjoyed a perfectly flat and shallow pop-corn action movie just for the sake of it. Why should shallowness be an exclusive right of action flicks?<br/><br/>""Burlesque"" is a perfectly enjoyable musical comedy that - unlike many other recent blockbusters - does not take itself too seriously, and in all fairness it's as unpretentious as it gets. True, it's basically a glossy and simplified remake of ""Coyote Ugly"" with some ""Chicago"" elements thrown in for kicks. But so what? Who ever said that a certain kind of plot can only be told once (again, cf. action movies). It's just as honest about only being meant to entertain as, say, ""The Hangover"", ""Red"" or even ""Mamma Mia!"". Not that one should compare it to any other film of the same genre, but the fact is that some films are simply not meant to be anything else but pure entertainment. And that's okay.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the humour is refreshingly effective, and compared to ""Coyote"" this flick may actually be much more romantic, appealing and gripping.<br/><br/>Yes, the carbon-copy elements we may have seen a thousand times might make our eyes roll like a merry-go-round (I for one could not believe they went as far as including even the robbed apartment twist from ""Coyote Ugly"" or - and that was priceless - the day-dream cut to Ali imagining herself on stage that looks exactly like the scene when Roxie first sees Velma performing in ""Chicago""). But these things happen all the time. It's not even relevant. People are taking ""Burlesque"" far too seriously, and certainly much more seriously than it actually takes itself."

So.. To me there's always a dispute between the overall impact of a movie, meaning how it made you feel, if it did at all, and how well are all of the building parts of a movie delivered (producing, directing, cinematography, views, music, blah-blah, you get the idea). Let me give you a fast example - Slumdog Millionaire. THE MOST overrated movie ever, for me at least. I get it that for the low budget Danny Boyle had at his disposal, he did something like a miracle, but.. actually that's all. I don't really care about that. This movie couldn't make me taste not one single feeling throughout the whole god damn movie. I'd rather have Hollywood spending 1 billion dollars on making a movie, that's gonna make me shed a tear, get on the edge of my seat or make me shiver. I hope now you'll get my point of view on ranking movies. Since I'm judging by.. well, let's say - feelings brought to me through the screen, I was overwhelmed by this movie. On several occasions I was either holding the seat tight, crying, or just staring with pleasure at the big white screen. All of the songs in the movie were, in my opinion, great, greatly performed and, well, greatly influential. Might be that I'm really into music, but that's ""a might"". Christina has a great voice and all the times she had to sing high notes, she gave me the chills. Cher, although not singing as much as her, gave a great performance as well. I loved this movie.

Ali, the headstrong career chaser she is, eventually gets a job at the club, and proves to be a dynamite singer, often getting on the wrong side of one of the club's main dancers, Nikki (Played by Kristen Bell), but the club is currently in danger of being closed down due to Tess's struggles to pay the bills for the club.<br/><br/>The film takes obvious influence from it's more mature cousins, Chicago and Moulin Rouge (Right down to the bling-bling costumes, saucy choreography, and fast beat music), but the film's first half is more than sublime enough for fans of those two movies, if only the second half had done a little better. The film has a tendency to drag, and to feel contrived, but it's cast is enough reason to keep watching. Aguilera is clearly cast more for her voice than her acting chops (Which are actually better than expected), and it must be intimidating for any of the cast members to have to hold their ground against standout, Cher, a cast that also includes Stanley Tucci, Cam Gigandet and Alan Cumming.<br/><br/>Oh, and as for the musical numbers, they're right up to par. They're decorated with shining, and lovely costumes and sets, and the accompanying lyrics and music, meshed together with the fast choreography should be enough to satisfy the fan of the musical genre. The movie specifically comes equipped with a beautiful ballad performed by Cher, and written by Diane Warren, that is by far and away one of the year's very best original songs. It's just such a shame that the film can't find a consistent tone.<br/><br/>Burlesque is certainly not a good movie, but I enjoyed it enough to give it ** out of ****"

","I had really low expectations for this movieREALLY low, yet I still in a weird way wanted to see the movie. I don't know whymaybe it's because I wanted to see if Christina Aguilera could actually actor maybe it's because I'm a bit of a sucker for musicalsI'm not sure. This movie exceeded my expectations by a long shot! Christina Aguilera was stunning, and her acting skills were pretty good for a first timerthough there were scenes where you could tell she was not sure what to do. The music in the movie was outstanding, and we all know that Christina has a powerhouse voiceso no need to critique the singing. Honestly, there were a few holes in the storylinebut that really didn't bother me as much. Overall, a fantastic movie that would please any musical lover out there, like myself.<br/><br/>For Daily movie reviews visit: http://kimsmoak.com/"

","As I said: not bad and peasant enough entertainment. A story about a young girl who goes to Hollywood from Iowa to find herself, enter show business and be a star, more or less, coupled with how a former dancer needs to get money together to pay her mortgage and other expenses, more or less, to save her night club, called Burlesque, from becoming an office building. I never was much of a fan of Christina Aguilera, but I clearly see from this movie that she is quite a talent. The long blond wig she wears--the color--is quite a better shade of blond than the her real hair, bleached that hideous white color she usually sports. She does quite a nice acting job, and is a finer singer--even singing an old Mae West song--and she does nicely at that too. I don't think she is particularly pretty, with her awful nose and too close together eyes, but she is talented. Now, Cher. She looks just awful. I don't see why she took this role. She sings one or two songs, but is not at all animated in this movie. She does not dance, but just seems to sit around, walk around, stand around...so what is the big deal of having her. I will say it again: she just appears to sit around. Stanley Tucci who seems to be in so many movies these days (liked him in a lot in Julie and Julia) does a god job, Cam G. is all right--I mean that part could have been played by any young male actor, but his tattoos are too distracting. What is it with these young male actors and their hideous tattoos? I heard a lot of people compare this to Dreamgirls. I disagree. Big time. Dreamgirls is totally different. To me, it is a movie I could see over and over, and I did--perhaps 8 times. Burlesque does not do it for me. I do recommend it as an entertaining movie, the songs are sublime, the story is really and totally sort of unrealistic, but, again: it is pleasant enough."

","Went with friends, expecting nothing, but came out of the theater wishing I could replay it immediately. I even sat through the lengthy credits. The story moves FAST. Its country girl goes to L A - BUT the plot is not tired at the breakneck speed of the music and fabulous editing. It is visually stunning and visually interesting. The club set is a masterpiece with lighting highlighting the dance routines. For its genre this movie is a prize. And p.s., Christina Aguilera hit every song out of the ballpark as Cher did with the title song. Plus you get Stanley Tucci. <br/><br/>The down side - Cher has a second number that is clearly stuck in there to give her a second number. I thought it the weakest song in the movie. The movie is PG 13. I think that is a fair guideline.<br/><br/>Lastly, the CD contains only 10 of the vocals."

","I will be the first to say that I went into ""Burlesque"" with concerns (and resistance) that it will be this year's ""Glitter."" To say that pop stars playing the struggling small time girl that makes it big (""Crossroads"" anyone?) is a concept played over and over is an understatement. My reasons for worrying that this movie would do the same are not exactly unjustified, however I found myself actually enjoying this film and (dare I say) became immersed in Aguilera's character. While the movie has its flaws and could have done so much more with certain story lines, the film was generally well executed and a joy to experience. This is coming from someone who had no genuine desire to see it in the first place. Cher proves once again that she can carry a film and Aguilera shows room for growth. It will be interesting to see where she goes with a film that is not musically based. Overall I would recommend the film to those who want a good time and don't go in with unrealistic expectations. My advice is to take ""Burlesque"" for what it is: a bright light, bass pumping joyride centered around a big voiced diva pop star and an entertainment veteran doing what they do best."
"Brainyackgirl","8","0","0","12 December 2010"," Lights, camera, action. Burlesque delivers what it promised.
","What do you get when you take a legend and mix it with a modern pop diva? (And future legend in her own right!) An old fashion, honest to god musical. Christina Aguilera while shaky in some scenes, (though for a first timer she holds up the lead role quite well) plays the small town Iowa girl with a big voice very convincingly. Adding to the mix her exceptional vocal chops, the venue is perfect for a debut performance. Her comfort level is obviously exceeded in some key timing and delivery scenes, but what she loses in experience she makes up for with bravado. Where she is most clearly herself is on the stage performing numbers and routines. And hopefully with her next project she will learn to take the fluidity and grace with which she sings and translate it to better character development.<br/><br/>Now on to the all powerful goddess we mortals call Cher. What more is there to say, her presence alone creates an almost visible aura, her voice and quick wit is just an added bonus. Not to mention the fact that while other women her age are lounging around in Moo Moos and Granny pants, Cher manages to fit into skin tight leather corsets better than most twenty somethings. Her two numbers are great, but her final song ""You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me"" represents her perfectly. While other starlets have been pushed out of the entertainment industry due to their age and personal lives, Cher along with an elite group have broken the mold. Not allowing anyone or thing to hold her back is Tess' character, but all the while it expresses Cher's own spirit.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great fun, with Stanley Tucci playing the prerequisite gay friend to Cher's divorced Tess. The two have wonderful chemistry and would be a pleasure to see together on screen again. As for the rest, Cam Giganget's Jack is sexy and sensitive, pulling off the black eyeliner with ease. His back and forth with Aguilera is cute to watch, and his characters sweet sense of humor immediately has you rooting for him and Ali. Others like Kristen Bell, Eric Dane, Julianne Hough, Alan Cumming, and Peter Gallagher all play their respective roles well. Although there is not much for them to sink their teeth into. (However from the little you see of Hough, she seems to have the sexy good girl next door quality that has made people like Jennifer Aniston mega stars.)<br/><br/>In summation, just go see it. If you like musicals you'll definitely enjoy it, and if you love either Christina or Cher, or both, then you will positively love it. So go and have a toe tapping, humming good time. And remember it's BURLESQUE!!!!!!"

","At least that's what I thought; I love the fact that they wear fishnets and stockings all through out the film fact that they are very pretty. The plot was basic I could tell you have every scene played out before it happened. I love Cher and Christina, but the movie kind of dragged on and so many musical numbers. The acting by Christina is OK, Cher I would say is better in my opinion. Not a guy movie at all, some light jokes, and basic dialogue but overall, the dancing and the singing was great, the rest of the movie like the plot and actors were par. the funniest and best actor in there was Cher's assistant.<br/><br/>My two cents"

","I would recommend this movie to people who wanted to be reminded of their old acting days or don't mind cheesy movies.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Aguilera leaving her small country town. The first scene was so miserable I penned it for another bad version of Coyote Ugly or Showgirls. It pretty much is, but then the jazz hands came up with Cher's name on the big screen and you know it won't be that bad.<br/><br/>Aguilera's acting skills are about at the level of an Acting 101 class, but when that girl open's up her mouth. That pretty face can definitely be a show stopper. Her scenes can really cheesy and predictable. If you don't mind this, and love a 90's movie house hunting montage then this might be your movie.<br/><br/>I did think some of the side plots were adorable. I must admit Tucci is probably the best actor in the movie. His part did fit him perfectly, and if one much choose from the big name celebrities Cher and Aguilera weren't bad for their roles either. Sure I'd rather see a Broadway girl play the part of Ali, but Aguilera's vocal box will bring automatic money to the movie.<br/><br/>It was a classic small town girl moving to the big city looking for fame. Definitely had the range of archetypical characters each one with bodies to drool over. They pulled out the story at the right time. It's been awhile, since a good movie musical. The economy is down and people would like to see their dreams come true, and with the popularity of Glee this is the perfect time to capitalize on an old plot favorite."

","Played a little hooky today and took my 23 year old niece to see Burlesque. We both enjoyed it - not because the writing was so smart or the plot so deep - it was just great fun. Predictable and I'm amazed it took $55mil to make. Be interesting if it breaks even. But I hope the studios keep making musicals that are both contemporary and a play on the past. It is fun to see spectacular dancing and amazing vocals. Cher is an entertainment icon we could enjoy forever. Christina needs to sharpen her acting to match her vocal strength. All of today's actors are being allowed to talk breathy - what is that spineless acting all about? The movie must have had something good going for it if an Aunt and her Niece both really had a terrific time. Thanks!"
"johnnybritton","Null","0","0","5 December 2010"," Does exactly what it says on the box, and does it well
","Cher! Christina! Sequins! You know exactly what you're getting into with this movie. And it's director Steve Antin's same approach that makes 'Burlesque' click. A movie like this will never be mistaken as brilliant cinema and Antin wisely keeps the politics light and the narrative tight, focusing instead on the towering presence of his two divalicious stars and a series of well-crafted musical numbers. The result is a competently-made, paper-thin pleasure that would be easy to criticise if it weren't so deftly handled. Christina Aguilera (as the small-town girl with big-time ambitions in a story that's been told a thousand times before) is no Meryl Streep but she holds her own here and truly excels when given the opportunity to do what she does best; put that incredible set of pipes centre-stage for her many show-stopping musical numbers. It's Showgirls-minus-smut meets Cabaret-minus-social-commentary. Cher, of course, tears up the screen and owns every shot she's in and it's an absolute thrill to watch this Grand-Dame of Divadom back in the musical spotlight. Stanley Tucci and Kristen Bell give able support in roles they have both played before, and 'Burlesque' brings all these elements together in a way that makes you want to watch it over again whilst at the same time being not-quite-brilliant. The 14A rating means it's lacking the edge that could've elevated this to camp-classic status but as an unapologetic, well directed and good looking treat this hits all the right buttons. Oh, and the soundtrack rocks."

I wish there had been way more of them.....theirs was the relationship I wanted to see more of. Their work on screen is an example of two really fine actors rising above a mediocre script. And what did they do with Alan Cummings' role? He was barely in the movie. Biggest missed opportunity? The duet with Christina and Cher....I really missed this. A duet should have ended this film. What were they thinking by not including one????"
"Ric-7","4","3","8","30 November 2010"," Pleasant but mediocre
","I think the general plot setup was decades old when used in ""Showgirls"" a decade ago. Except that the heroine in Showgirls had a dark side and was not a total saint. Christina did a fine job with the stock part she was given. It was also good to see Cher, but that's about all we did was see her. The leading men were picturesque, doing their part to ""flesh out"" the cast.<br/><br/>I didn't hate the show: it was pleasant. There seemed to be more production numbers than usual, but given the rather routine non-musical scenes, that is probably not a complaint.<br/><br/>My problem with the film was not the general unbelievability of the existence of a club with perhaps 20 tables, being able to support a technical production to rival a Broadway show: costumes, sets, lighting, etc., plus about six to eight dancers and a five or six piece band. The major deficiency was the script.<br/><br/>Alan Cumming as the box-office person? From MC in ""Cabaret"" to ticket-taker here. I don't know who to blame for that."

","Burlesque is visually stunning (costumes, makeup, sets, views of LA are all wows), has great music, showcases talented dancers, and has a promising cast. I really wanted to love this movie. Really did! But a flat storyline can't save this movie. Small-town girl Ali moves to the big city, overnight has a waitressing job in her dream location, and a potential love interest. She impresses the stressed boss, Cher. Cue the predictable challenge to overcome (she gets robbed and loses all her money), romantic stress (he has a fiancée), sudden break for fame (bitchy sabotage goes wrong when Ali proves she can really sing), quandary over who to trust (moneyed potential investor who may or may not have evil motives), and simple solution to resolve all the challenges her employer faces (spoiler: air rights). Xtina's vocal chops are undeniable but her dancing skills leave something to be desired. Thank goodness for rapid-fire editing to work around her. Cher is fine in her seen-it-all henhouse-mother strapped with financial problems and uninspired lines to say. She sings a couple songs but the audience doesn't get to see her in her performing glory so she's somewhat wasted in this role. Stanley Tucci is as charming and supportive as they come as Cher's right-hand man. Cam Giganget is hot!! as the roommate/love interest, Kristen Bell has moves and attitude to spare as the star being replaced by Ali, Eric Danes is sexy and dangerous as the investor/potential alternate love interest, while the incredible Alan Cumming is woefully underused in his 27 seconds of screen time. The soundtrack will be good overall, but the final song--written by Christina and specially picked to get audiences singing and dancing their way out of the theatre--is largely forgettable. Kind of like the movie overall."
"MovieProductions","5","3","9","28 November 2010"," A cliché script dressed up in glitter and revealing outfits
","** out of (****)<br/><br/>Going into Burlesque, one doesn't expect a contender for the Oscars. The mouth-watering fanboy at the box office expects to have a fulfilling time. After cinema's critical and financial flops about a girl moving into the big city hoping to get somewhere (""Showgirls"", ""Coyote Ugly"", ""Glitter""), can Burlesque break the mold? Unfortunately, not financially. With a poor one million dollar weekend opening on a mammoth of a budget (sixty million), Burlesque will go down as one of the year's biggest flops. And Burlesque isn't shaping up too well with critics (A 33% on Rotten Tomatoes, can you say ouch?). Well despite being a financial and critical flop, is there any sort of redemption with Burlesque? Well... sort of.<br/><br/>As for the script, yes, it's as formulaic and paint-by-numbers as the critics make it out to be. There's no twist or turn the director throws. There's no surprise. It plays out exactly how you think it would. While the script is pretty flat, I thought the performances were very underrated. Critics are bashing Aguilera's acting yet I think she did her job. I'm usually picky when it comes to acting, but Aguilera didn't do so bad. Cher is really the life of the party here. She is full of charisma and she puts on a show. Still, the duo aren't too bad together. The dialogue on the other hand is a little cringe-worthy. You'll get a handful of cheesy lines here and there. <br/><br/>For it being a big production musical, is the money well spent? Yes and I can say that with pride. The sets are certainly glamorous and you can tell every penny was used to perfection. Also, the visuals are pretty much eye-candy. The choreography is just as appealing as the set designs. Does the film deliver on its title? Unfortunately not. Burlesque lacks sex appeal to push the envelope like ""Nine"" did, but I suppose it didn't because they were going in a more family-friendly route. How's the direction? Pretty average. Steve Antin flies by Aguilera's past life and cuts to the chase. Apparently, he flies by a little too much and makes some situations seem pretty preposterous. Now most importantly, how are the songs? They are pretty fun, but you won't find any ""Chicago"" in these tracks. <br/><br/>All in all, ""Burlesque"" might not have lived to its fullest potential, but for what it turned out to be, it wasn't so bad. After all, you could do a lot worse. The acting and dialogue are certainly eye-roll worthy but the choreography, flashy set-designs, and the fun songs are really what the audience lines up to see. While I don't think the film's quality is high enough to warrant a full price, I do recommend it this time as seeing the film with a big crowd might boost up your rating. It sure did with mine. It's not ""Chicago"" but it's certainly no ""Coyote Ugly"". Aguilera and Cher pretty much go out of their way to entertain you for two hours. If that's what you're looking for, ""Burlesque"" is right up your alley."

This actually felt like showgirls but without the action. Although showgirls is trashy and unrealistic, it's still very entertaining. I guess Burlesque was just a platform for Christina Aguilera to make a transition into movies (which rarely works out for popstars). Cher comes off as unlikeable and annoying.

"allexand","4","2","5","9 July 2013"," Lively song and dance numbers with lavish backdrops but not much else
","Christina Aguilera seemed to be different from the garden variety teen idol princess. She seemed to have genuine talent despite a penchant for showing off just how many different notes she could cram into a single second and chose to focus solely on her music while her contemporaries such as Britney, Jessica, and Mandy Moore were embarrassing themselves in horrible movies. The fact that she seemed to be resisting the urge to make a crappy movie was in fact, quite admirable.<br/><br/>I guess I spoke too soon.<br/><br/>""Burlesque"" is yet another rehash of the plucky-young-girl-with-talent-makes-it-to-the-big-time type of story only with the goal being dancing in her undies as opposed to landing a record deal. It's a bright, shiny, loud film that attempts to distract you with bright lights, gaudy costumes, and bouncy numbers to compensate for how truly empty it is. You can tell a lot of effort was put into set design and wardrobe as they are the only things about this film that could be considered top notch. <br/><br/>Performances are passable, but nothing to write home about. Christina does the best she can with an insufferable Mary Sue of a character and Cher does a decent job but nothing worthy of a second Oscar. However, Cher got an obvious collagen lip injection before this movie started filming and her new fish lips are quite distracting every time she has a close up. Stanley Tucci reprises the same snooty gay man role he played in ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" Kristen Bell plays a rival with little motivation and everyone else is just kinda there. Alan Cumming, who can be entertaining, is wasted in a nothing role.<br/><br/>The music and the dancing are also pretty good but that's to be expected when you have an at-her-peak Christina Aguilera, Cher and ""Dancing with the Stars' "" ingénue Julianne Hough in the cast. The song lyrics, however, show an odd lack of imagination as four or five of them are about the art of burlesque alone. I was also disappointed that Cher only got two songs compared to the ten or so that Christina got.<br/><br/>The lack of creativity in the songs can probably be attributed to a non-existent plot. The plot revolves entirely around Christina's character, Ali, leaving behind her boring life in Iowa and taking a bus to L.A. where she lands a job waitressing in a nightclub and quickly works her way up the ranks and falls in love along the way snore. Other than the side plot about Cher's club being on the verge of bankruptcy, this is pretty much all that happens. There's some stuff about Stanley Tucci finding a boyfriend, Kristen Bell battling alcoholism, and Julianne Hough being pregnant but none of it has any bearing on the plot.<br/><br/>This spotlights the film's biggest problem: Ali is a blatant Mary Sue who monopolizes the entire movie. She comes to town and immediately wins everyone over. Cher promotes her to dancer in the show, Cam Gigandet leaves his fiancée for her and Eric Dane wants to get in her pants and throw money at her. Everyone loves her and she instantly becomes the main attraction of the club. She's a naturally gifted singer and dancer despite being an Iowa farm girl. They might as well have named her Strawberry Serenity Symphony Nightshade or something equally pretentious because she NEVER loses.<br/><br/>The plot also doesn't attempt to explore any of the ramifications of her rise to stardom. There's a sabotage subplot with Kristen Bell but it's quickly dropped. The movie never once deals with how Ali's new boyfriend might feel about her performing nightly in a highly sexualized stage show and it never attempts to explain her past or how a Midwestern girl with limited options in life and no family got to be such a great dancer and singer. Ali seems to have no aspirations beyond the club and despite being this amazing phenom who brings new customers in, it's still somehow going under. Perhaps if Cher would cut a few corners on her extravagant stage shows, she might save some money that way. Not to worry though because the writers find a different way for Ali to save the club, thus keeping her Mary Sue status intact.<br/><br/>Perhaps the saddest part of it all is that this movie not only derailed Christina Aguilera's career, it seemed to derail her personal life as well. After a mediocre showing, her marriage fell apart, she released the worst selling album of her career, she gained a noticeable amount of weight and gave several legendarily bad performances of the national anthem.<br/><br/>While the movie is deeply flawed, I don't think it's bad enough that Christina deserved to have her career ruined over it. She has no business acting but she still has a good voice and she should get a chance to redeem herself. If Britney can survive ""Crossroads"" and Madonna can survive ""Shanghai Surprise,"" ""Who's That Girl,"" ""Body of Evidence,"" ""The Next Best Thing,"" and ""Swept Away,"" then Christina should get to put ""Burlesque"" behind her too."

","In a name that cliché style a small-town orphaned Iowa girl Ali (Christina Aguilera) decides to skip her aimless diner existence and hop onto the fast lane of opportunities awaiting in Los Angeles (where else?). Once there she searches for job opportunities matching her dreams and abilities. After becoming obsessively inspired with becoming a girl at the Burlesque Lounge, led by the eternally optimistic and passionate Tess (Cher), a joint way past its glory days and awaiting imminent bank foreclosure, Ali forces herself into a job position as a waitress. Ali with her directness and never-say-die attitude quickly steps up the roster from waitress to dancer to star of the whole show. Meanwhile, until a betterment of fortunes comes around, she bunks together with bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet), an aspiring song-writer engaged to a Broadway actress.<br/><br/>Amongst other familiar caricatures we have the trusted gay sidekick Sean (Stanley Tucci), the spiteful competitor Nikki (Kristen Bell), the business-minded realtor Marcus (Eric Dane), intent on buying out the club and replacing it with high-rise, and the club partner, ex-husband, Vince (Peter Gallagher) hoping to sell the joint at a profit. Together they form an amalgamate of well-worn characters set into the most generic story possible, rife with every lack of surprise bound to happen around the next corner.<br/><br/>Thankfully the lead of Christina Aguilera, who delivers a surprisingly astute performance (albeit not one suggesting a glorious film career), carries the weight of triviality with her charm, pizazz and sexual appeal. Together with a host of scarcely clad beauties on high-heels, in cabarets and a lot of wiggle, the dance sequences are irrefutably engaging and well-done, even if they tend to be a bit repetitive by the fifth on-stage dance. Nonetheless wouldn't mind spending a night out on town in such a sparkling, luscious, if a tad outdated, establishment. On the downside Cher proves again why incessant plastic surgery is the death of a film career, as her face mimicry suffers from abuse and instead of focusing on the actress-singer, I subconsciously found myself attempting to pinpoint and name all operations Cher may have had in a vain attempt to prolong her youthful looks.<br/><br/>The movie also features a small, but absolutely brilliant role as a ticketeer by Alan Cumming, who manages to steal all the thunder away from the much weightier accompanying cast. All in all enjoyable, but so generic (with some dialogue so heavily laden with repetition it hurts), that they couldn't have made it more tired and trusted, if they tried."

Used to love Cher in her hey-day but now she's just a caricature of herself (plastic surgery and all) and it makes me wonder why she was ever a star.

It's just not the right vehicle for Chritina's first big role. Hopefully, we'll get to see her in the right film done the road."

","The movie definitely delivers to it's target audience i.e. Xtina fans, women and gay men. I find that mainly straight men are knocking this piece of art. It's a great movie, excellent cast, actors, plot and musical numbers. My opinion is biased considering I pass 2 of the categories of the film's target group. However let me add, I saw this movie with a few ladies. Meaning I persuaded them to come along, and I heard words uttered like, ""Wow I wish I was one of those girls"" (before the ending of the opening credits) and ""I wish I was Ally"". In my opinion this is a manifestation of Xtina's transformation from recording mega legend to movie stardom. It also shows you how much the movie connected with the audience and provided that level of escapism that we all look for in films. Guys if you were expecting Xtina to appear nude go watch Showgirls or if you want action watch a Jason Statham flick. If you want to see an incredibly well done musical, chick flick you've made the right choice. Finally for the Cam Gigandet fans you definitely will Not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Xtina is the name Christina Aguilera goes by as her fans will tell you."

I actually did not want it to end. It was just so much FUN! The dancing, the music and the performance overall was mind-blowing. And the costumes were to die for!<br/><br/>The movie was extremely steamy and hot without any nudity. Everyone in the movie is super good-looking which for me was a complete +1! It's just so much fun, the story isn't WOW but the movie was just great for its genre.<br/><br/>Christina -eventhough is not the best actress out there- was great for her role, because seriously she was gorgeous and her voice makes you tingle!

"Quinoa1984","5","2","5","12 December 2010"," one of the most entertaining bad movies of the year
","Don't make any mistake that the vote is five out of ten on the scale. This is in fact not a very good movie. That is, when you stop to think about it. The screenplay by Steve Antin was very likely cooked up after a Cliff-Notes stop to Syd Field's book-of-wonders, and not the updated version but the one that gives you Screen writing-for-Real-Dummies (his only previous credit as writer/director is a direct-to-video sequel to The Glass House, a movie me and two other people on the planet saw in the first place). And maybe that's okay. In these tough times of depressing economic circumstances, maybe people need a little PG-13 escapism. Yes, escape from your dreary existence to see (almost) family-friendly risqué dancing from Christina Aguilera and Cher (or, holy-god-that's-Cher?)<br/><br/>Ah, the story. The meat and potatoes of it is Aguilera's a small town girl, comes to LA, goes to the magically-out-of-ether apparent Burlesque club loaded with catty girl dancers and a few gay ones (Alan Cumming plays a Joel Grey out of Cabaret surrogate), and run by Cher, Stanley Tucci and sometimes-around Peter Gallagher. The club might close if more money doesn't come around! What to do? How about someone who can dance *and* sing. Gasp! In comes the incessant Aguilera, who in- between going all-out in her quest for acceptance roommates with a clueless guy who is engaged to a girl on the other side of the country, and shady real estate guy. One knows he's shady as Aguilera's character points out to him ""You're not the bad guy, you're the wrong one."" Touche, I guess.<br/><br/>Don't come for the story, or much of the dialog, which has lines like ""Alice, hm? Well, welcome to Wonderland."" Actually, that's a white-lie. Do come for that, but not because it's particularly intelligent or wonderful. It's a lot of camp, the movie is. It is Showgirls-lite, which means it's neither anywhere near as mind-bogglingly awful, though not half as ambitious in its intentions. As I said, the movie is kind of ""safe"", in a sense. It could raise the ire of some hardcore Bible- thumpers, but that's about it. The sexual content is only on occasion actually sexually charged, and is otherwise playful (at one point Ali does a number where she's covered through most of it, but only by a sheet really, naked except for that and singing a sorta sultry song), like the music video from Moulin Rouge that Aguilera and her contemporaries made, Lady Marmlelade.<br/><br/>Again, should I sell you on this movie? That depends. If you think there's something better to see, please, do so, by all means. It's like eating one of those pink-sugar things that's not even a twinkie but the counterpart that Woody Harrelson kept finding unfortunately in Zombieland. Cher, especially, as the co-star (though name above Aguilera), is prominently featured as one of the 'serious' actors of the film, though she too has lines that... well, I don't want to spoil, pshaw! As for her musical numbers, which is one of the more precise reasons that one could be curious to see the film, one is generic and one has no right being in a movie called burlesque as it's not burlesque nor good songwriting (""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"" is the number, which has absolutely nothing to do with the film itself, only for Cher to have one other number than her Welcoming song that comes conveniently as Ali enters the club).<br/><br/>Other numbers fare better, at least as far as being energetic, flashy, and showing off Aguilera's actual talent which, believe you me, is not acting. Luckily she's found a platform for her singing and dancing that works for her (unlike a certain Britney Spears from 2002's Crossroads, let's never mention it again). Her fans especially will be pleased to see her stretching her vocal chords and strutting her natural sexuality and appealing features for the camera. In a way these numbers do set off how much of the rest of the movie is either forgettable hooey or ridiculous trash. But hey, it's trash that doesn't kid itself; as far as bad movies go that are still out in theaters- or may be coming to DVD in a few months- it fares MUCH better than something like Skyline."

The fact that it stars Cher and Christina Aguilera is an indication that this is going to be nothing nearly as good as any of those films I mentioned. The fact that they both get to sing, and Aguilera gets to sing a lot, confirms your worst suspicions.<br/><br/>Plot is basic. The whole movie seems like one long Christina Aguilera music video.

"TOMNEL","4","2","6","18 July 2011"," Obviously the director/writer wanted to homage Bob Fosse girls, but this movie is pointless.
","From the ads, this movie looked pretty fun. Christina Aguilera has a great voice, despite not always using it, and Cher is an American icon who has charmed us for over 2 centuries (close to it anyways), so mixing these two together in a ""Chicago"" inspired musical film seemed like it would be great fun. Unfortunately, in order to have a great film, you need great characters, an interesting plot, a clever script, and this movie has none of the above. It has a largely drama free plot, with boring one dimensional characters, and a script full of lame one liners. By the end, you just wonder, what was the point of all this?<br/><br/>Ali (Christina Aguilera) is a small town Iowa waitress who wants to become a star, so she moves out to L.A., without a place to stay or much money. She ends up finding this burlesque house full of saucy female dancers straight out of the 1920s, owned by Tess (Cher), a boss with a heart of gold. She pushes her way into becoming a waitress for the place, and eventually tries out for a role on stage, while meanwhile she's living with bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet). Then rich businessman Marcus (Eric Dane) tries to buy out the Burlesque house...GASP...will he be able to?<br/><br/>Writer/director Steve Antin's sole purpose for making this seems to be to homage Bob Fosse. Literally, there could be no other reason. Possibly as a way of meeting Christina Aguilera and Cher, but story wise, there is nothing here to tell. This movie has no point, and could have easily been condensed into a bland 30 minute short film. There's such little drama in the story, and nothing ever seems very serious. There's never a moment where you pity any characters, or feel bad for anyone, and there's never any moments where you feel particularly sad or happy for anyone. It's such a middling picture that it just moves along, doing nothing, and thus that's what you get from the picture...nothing.<br/><br/>The performances are okay. Christina Aguilera is...okay. She's not great, and not bad. Her character is kind of irritating, and hard to describe. She's kind of pushy, and assertive, but also bossy, lazy and obnoxious. Cher's character is even harder to describe because she is given so few traits. Tess just kind of goes with the flow, and tries to run things, but gets frustrated. That's about it. And sadly, these two are the most developed characters. The performances reflect the lack of depth in the script, and everyone is just kind of hollow. It's like a script full of extras. We never get to know or care about anyone. <br/><br/>Despite a not great script, and boring characters, at least we can get some great songs and stylistic direction, right? Well, inside the burlesque club, we get an atmospheric set with some alright songs and boringly shot dance numbers. But at least the club has it's own charm. But any set other than the club, is completely boring, and everything not featured there feels like a bad romantic comedy. And many scenes shot in there just waste time through songs that don't have any point. In ""Chicago"" or ""All that Jazz"" or ""Cabaret"", the songs in the film advance the plot, or tell us how a character feels, or set up some background information. Here, the songs do nothing but play as songs. They mean nothing to the film, and even less to the plot, and they are there to make this a ""musical"" and for padding. Like anything else, the songs have no purpose to the story. <br/><br/>In order to create a work that replicates the works of Bob Fosse and Kander/Ebbs, one must not scratch the surface and say ""We need costumes, pretty girls, dance numbers and songs."", but instead one must listen to the lyrics and what they mean, and the wordplay, and watch how Fosse choreographed those routines, and in his films how he shot them. And of course, look at their plots, and how the songs have meaning to the plot, and how drama intensifies the film and makes the audience care. This movie is so bland, with boring characters and a plot that actually seems to give up on itself. You can't expect the musical numbers and costumes to run the show, but they do here. Quite a shame too. With all the talent involved this could have been great.<br/><br/>My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for sexy costumes (really a mild film)."

","Christina plays a small town girl who leaves town and her Mickey Mouse life and heads to LA during the credits. In LA she is attracted to a 1920's style burlesque club. The small club puts on a large theater type show with costumes and a band. So even with the $20 cover charge, on a great night they wouldn't come close to breaking even, let alone pay the band, which is more like a small orchestra. I'm not sure why they even have a band since most of the girls lip sync. The club has a surreal appearance and the men who work there are dressed as gang characters from ""Clockwork Orange"" complete with the derby and eye make-up, although they incorrectly make-up both eyes instead of just one.<br/><br/>Christina works as a waitress at the club and desires to be a star on this sinking ship. The star of the show is a problem child who shows up late and has an attitude. It doesn't take any imagination to figure out how this turns out. Christina belts out a few good numbers, but when she is not singing and dancing she really isn't acting. Cher does a fine job of acting and makes the rest of the crew look like a high school drama club.<br/><br/>Cher belts one out too. This movie is set up as a ""pass the torch"" symbolism. We saw how well that worked with the Madonna/Brittney/Christina kiss-NOT!<br/><br/>The movie is worth 10 stars on the strength of Christina's singing and Cher's acting."

","Anyone who gave this movie a bad review - are you sure you saw the same movie I did? To be fair, if you don't have a decent audio system, I can see where you may not have enjoyed it to its fullest, but the movie is entertaining, has a very good story, good acting, WOW dancing, and WOW singing. Even in a ""normal"" living room, it's still fun and should rank no less then 6.5 out of 10.<br/><br/>Where the movie really comes alive is if you have a REAL audio system and big screen (80 inches or larger). I have a real home theater and consider myself somewhat of an audiophile. I've watched / listened to the dance/music sequences 5 times in 3 days. I don't know that I've heard a cleaner, crisper, stronger soundtrack, or seen a better performance, recorded OR LIVE. They really put a ton of attention to details in this movie. When Christina first sings live for instance, they're lip singing to an old sound track, and it's 5.1, but more like MONO 5.1. Somoebody pulls the recorded plug, Christinga takes over, and YOU SWEAR YOU'RE SITTING IN THE CLUB LIVE. Christina sings in front of you, background singers, instruments, and crowd are in and around the room. Thre are a lot of good 5.1 movie sound tracks, but not many as GREAT as this. The drums are so strong at times I had to double check to make sure my sub volume hadn't been bumped up.<br/><br/>If you have a small audio system, small subwoofer, beware!<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed Cher didn't get a larger singing role, but she does a great job - she sounds better than ever. As for Christinga = WOW!! She's a talented performer, and I bought one of her 5.1 live performances, but that was quite honestly terrible. Oh, decent concert, but it's NOT 5.1 Christina. The Burlesque 5.1 surround performances are what you should be putting out.<br/><br/>I guess that's all I have to say - play this on a high end system and I can't see how you won't enjoy it, and listen to it over and over."
"JamesHitchcock","5","1","2","5 October 2012"," No cliché left unturned
","Although ""Burlesque"" is set in what is basically a high-class strip club, it is a film on the hoary old theme of ""A Star is Born"" and treats its theme in a very traditional way, with no cliché left unturned. It starts by emphasising its heroine's humble background. Alice ""Ali"" Rose is an orphan from a working-class background in a small town in Iowa, where she works as a waitress. Like all girls from humble backgrounds in films of this type, Ali harbours longings for fame and fortune, so she gets on the bus to Los Angeles where she hopes to find work in showbiz.<br/><br/>Like all girls in films of this type who long for fame and fortune, Ali finds that they do not (at least at first) come easily. She auditions for a number of showbiz roles, only to be consistently rejected. She eventually finds work in a burlesque club, but only as a waitress, doing the same sort of work as she was doing in Iowa. Eventually, however, her persistence pays off and when one of the dancers becomes pregnant the club owner agrees to take Ali on as her replacement. And then- like all girls in films of this type- Ali gets her big break to become the star of the show, not just a backing dancer.<br/><br/>One might think that the above synopsis contains more than enough clichés for one film, but just about every character is a cliché in his or her own right. We have the heroine's tough, feisty boss (in this case a woman) who turns out to have a heart of gold. We have the heroine's jealous, bitchy rival who turns out to have no heart at all. We have the heroine's kindly best friend (here, in one of the film's few breaches with tradition, a gay man rather than another woman). And then we have the two men in the heroine's life, one poor but caring and sensitive, the other rich but selfish and materialistic. (No prizes for guessing which one turns out to be the heroine's true love).<br/><br/>""Burlesque"" reminded me in some ways of ""Showgirls"", another film about a girl with showbiz ambitions who eventually lands the leading role in the sort of song-and-dance show whose performers wear as few clothes as possible. And yet, although ""Showgirls"" was almost universally panned by the critics, I actually preferred it- at least dramatically, if not musically- to ""Burlesque"". At least ""Showgirls"" had some sort of satirical value, achieved by making its leading character Nomi Malone a thoroughly nasty little slut with the morals of an alley cat. Ali, by contrast, is described by another character as ""beautiful inside as well as out"", and even though she earns her living by wearing revealing costumes and performing provocative dance routines comes across as just too sweet and wholesome to be true.<br/><br/>This film marked the debut of pop singer Christina Aguilera as an actress. She doesn't reveal too much talent in that direction, although to be fair to her any actress would have had difficulty in making Ali interesting, as she is less a character in her own right than a compendium of clichés drawn from every showbiz movie ever made. Xtina is also no worse than most of the others on display, including Cher (as club boss Tess), who has far more acting experience but whose contribution here won her a ""worst supporting actress"" Razzie nomination. Cher's main problem with acting these days appears to be her addiction to plastic surgery; her mask-live face, strangely smooth and unlined for a woman of 92 (or whatever age she is), is not the best instrument for expressing emotion. Kristen Bell as the heroine's bitchy, jealous rival Nikki is required to do little except adopt an angry, resentful expression every time Ali does anything. Stanley Tucci's role as the heroine's camp male best friend seemed to be a reprise of his similar role in ""The Devil Wears Pravda"", although in that film his character's homosexuality was not made explicit as it is here. Tucci appears to be getting typecast in roles like this, so I was surprised to learn that he is actually straight in real life.<br/><br/>""Burlesque"" is a musical along the lines of ""Cabaret"" or ""Fame"", the sort where the characters only sing or dance in situations where people normally sing or dance in real life, and therefore demands a setting in the world of show-business. The song-and-dance numbers are all very professionally done, and whatever Aguilera's limitations as an actress she has a very fine voice, not only melodious but also powerful and expressive. In her musical numbers she was able to convey her character's emotions much more strongly than she could through her acting. Aguilera performs most of the songs, although Cher (also very expressive) contributes two. In one of them she strips down to a revealing costume to show us just what a fine figure she has for a woman of 117 (or whatever age she is). Oddly enough for an entertainer who is well-known both as a singer and as an actress, this was Cher's first cinematic musical.<br/><br/>The film's saving grace, and the one thing which prevents it from getting a lower mark, is that, musically speaking, it is actually not at all bad. Its great fault, and the thing which prevents it from getting a higher mark, is that, dramatically speaking, it is completely lacking in originality, a badly acted rehash of hackneyed themes from every showbiz film you've ever seen. It is a pity that the energy of the musical sequences could not have been put to use in the service of a better story. 5/10"

This was mostly a showcase for Christina Aguilera and Cher, both of whom actually turn in decent performances, as does most of the cast, especially Alan Cumming! Aguilera, desperate, joins Burlesque, first as a waitress, then as a a singer/dancer, and the lady she replaces (of course) tried to sabotage her. The place is in serious financial trouble, and she helps Cher-the owner-try and rescue it as the bad guys close in with plans to demolish it and set up other buildings on the site.

The plot, in a nutshell, is small town girl makes it big in L.A...helping more than just herself along the way using mildly unexpected methods. And I loved it. Every clichéd, unrealistically happy, relatively predictable minute of it.<br/><br/>Christina Aguilera, Cher, Cam Gigandet and Stanley Tucci make for a fantastic leading cast. There is chemistry between every last one of them. So much so in fact that you believe that they all work together and watch each others backs for real. Christina Aguilera is full of wide eyed, occasionally annoying enthusiasm, as her character demands. Cam Gingandet manages to shine as a slightly campy - but oh-so-straight bartender. Now, I'm slightly biased in the sense that he is fantastic eye candy throughout the entire film - but his character (despite sometimes being a little underdeveloped) is extremely likable. In fact, even the supposed 'bad guy' Marcus is not totally hopeless. He is a believably human and non-evil cloud in the blue Burlesque sky.<br/><br/>It probably doesn't live up to Chicago, or Caberet - but I sincerely doubt it was ever meant to compete with these. I mean, just watch a trailer and you'll understand!<br/><br/>If you aren't up for a chick flick musical...or even a sweet romcom with music (yes, it is funny) then you shouldn't watch this film.

","Let me preface this with the fact that I'm a Sci-Fi horror sort of guy. I'm about the last person that would ever go to see a musical, although I like both Cher and Christina's music. It's not exactly what I would consider a movie I'm interested in.<br/><br/>I had a free Saturday morning and picked this up at a matinée with some friends who talked me into it. I was floored by this. I've seen a few musicals in my many years that I enjoyed. This one knocked it out of the ballpark, largely due to Christina. Her acting was actually acceptable and believable, but it was her singling that stole the show, and that is nothing to be ashamed of in a musical after all all.<br/><br/>When Christina first starts wailing once a little mischief pulls the power to the sound system, I was riveted to the screen. She has an amazing voice with a raw power behind it that's hard to describe. Sheer magnetism. It's one of those scenes that literally reaches out and grabs you. It made my heart skip a beat from the charge it gave. I can only describe it as powerful both in impact and visually.<br/><br/>Cher plays the owner of the Burlesque club. She's a bit like a tough and street wise matronly type but doesn't take too much crap. She's a good choice for the role. For those expecting a lot of Cher air time, you'll be somewhat disappointed as she spends relatively little time on screen, and I think that was the right decision. She wasn't great in this role, but she certainly isn't bad. She pulls out emotion in the right spots and a few grins to your face. Excellent chemistry between her and Christina Aguilera as well as Stanley Tucci.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci also brings a strong role to the film. As always, he plays a role that is executed to perfection. Stanley plays a companion to Cher (in the friend sense as Stanley is gay) and he pretty much manages the talent, gets the girls on stage and keeps things running with the minute of backstage details.<br/><br/>Last but not least, we have Cam Gigandet who plays Jack the bartender. He's an engaged man who offers his apartment to Ali (Christina) until she can get her own. Innocent enough at first, but Cam's fiancé is thousands of miles away working on another job and sparks start to fly between them once they settle in together. The ladies will appreciate Cam in this role. He's certainly easy on the eyes and also played his part well. I was a bit worried that he couldn't pull this type of role off as it gets a bit intimate, but he does well enough without getting to sticky sweet. Ali and Jack as a couple falling in love come off as sweet without being too gushy. A solid performance.<br/><br/>The storyline itself is, as expected, a little cliché but well executed. Just because a story has been done before doesn't mean you've seen it all or that someone can't come along and do it well, and that was my experience with Burlesque. Well worth he price of admission.<br/><br/>Take this from a Horror/Sci-Fi fan who was surprised as well. You won't be disappointed."

","The story is of Ali real name Alice who works in store to support herself in life as her mother passed away and it looks like she is now on her own fending for herself. Its a musical all singing and dancing reminds me of the pussycat dolls lounge but how can I be surprised the founder of the dolls and the director of this film are siblings so what goes in must come out he must have been bombarded with his sister love for burlesque and no wonder he made a film about it. Ali is played by Christina Aguilera and as a fan of x-Tina I could see Christina in her but a softer side but someone who would be rude if someone was rude to her and be easily offended by someone miss-treating her I wanted to get away from miss Aguilera but I only managed some what its no her fault she can sing the way she does but as soon as she sang the whole Christina thing was slapped in my face,again not her fault. The reason it isn't her fault is simply because the film is set around burlesque which is simply a set for various mini dramas to un-fold but Christina is the heart of everyones anger,excitement hope and dreams for the future prospects of the club . She replaces Kristen bells spot for a night and ends up being the *star* of the show because of her amazing voice the clubs morals change they come to see us dance not sing. Now they've come to see her sing and dancing goes with singing I guess,everyones excited but obviously being a film what's going to happen to cause a problem because Aguilera's and Bell's characters is borderline high school bitchy so the hate doesn't seen enough to hold a dramatic story to carry it through.So which is fine but the problem is *******spoiler Alert****** if you want know the story but not the end look away now! Anyway this guy who we don't know much about but looks like an arse hole enough so we get it but I feel no emotional connection that Tess's club(played by Cher)! Is going to be shut I don't know the history or her life situation maybe if it closes she can move on and eventually start up again in a year. This guy ants to buy out the club so Christina knowing about the building because he be-friends her basically says to the hotel opposite their going to build and be your rival in other words ""what you provide they'll provide better."" and you too will be out of business so she wins. Tess(Cher) is happy with her for saving the club which again if I knew the history of the club or the length it took for the girls to get where they are or dance like they do on stage I would have felt for them more.<br/><br/>Overall though an enjoyable light hearted film but for me to many mini stories I know only really on the surface but to positive I believe the stories but very good acting by the support cast."
"ingistefans","8","1","2","24 April 2011"," Delivers what it promises, and more!
","Despite the predictable premise, the cliché overall storyline and it's sometimes painfully stiff out of place dialogue, this movie is a absolute JOY to watch! The writing could have been better, I will give you critics that, but the music, dancing, set design, costumes, atmosphere and pretty much everything else that the filmmakers were actually FOCUSING on is just top notch! I have read a lot of negative reviews that mostly take aim at the storyline and writing but Im telling you, that was not why they made this movie. This movie was made to showcase great music, dancing and everything I mentioned above, not for award winning writing or acting.<br/><br/>Christina Aguilera does a fine job with the acting and superb job with her vocal and dance performances, Cher is great in her music numbers but her acting was a little bit stiff, Stanley Tucci delivers well despite the fact his role was extremely cliché, but my favourite performance by far, was by Alan Cumming, he is HILARIOUS in this! But his role was way to small, perhaps 10 minutes of screen time in total, but totally worth watching! Overall, if you like a great dance musical number with a happy ending, this is for you!"

","SPOILER?<br/><br/>Before going to this movie I asked all my friends about it and they all seemed to have different opinions... Some of my friends said it was amazing, and others said it... well, sucked. I would not say that it sucked. It wasn't great either. It didn't seem as if much thought was put into the dialogue between the characters, and most of it was put into costumes, choreography and music. But seeing how most of the movie is all about the music, that's okay. The songs were catchy, and the lyrics were nice. Also, seeing as (as far as I know) this is Christina's first time acting she did pretty well. The songs were fun, Christina and Cher were amazing, all the dancing was great and I had a lot of fun watching it. I recommend this movie for Christina Aguilera fans, romantic comedy fans and pop music fans. 7\10"

","Burlesque is exactly what we expected: both Aguilera and Cher do well - one thing is for sure - Aguilera gives it some shtick, but the film is nothing new, and you come away feeling like Coyote Ugly just went Burlesque.<br/><br/>Both Allan Cumming and Stanley Tucci are way underused and the substance of the film is non-existent. What we end up with is really pop videos and an American Idol feeling.<br/><br/>But it works.<br/><br/>It's actually fun to watch and there are way worse ways to spend time with friends. Watching it alone just doesn't suit this at all - it screams for an audience.<br/><br/>All in all, it's made for teenage girls who are having a film party, but lacks that Chicago kick that would take it to a sophisticated audience."
"sweetrupturedlight","7","1","2","24 January 2011"," I really enjoyed it
","I went in knowing that this movie had garnered mixed reviews. It seemed that critics were divided on whether the campy feel was good or bad.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was very entertaining. The numbers are great and whoever didn't know it already, surely knows that both Cher and Aguilera can belt out a tune and make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.<br/><br/>The story is a simple one. Ali leaves her small town and heads to LA to make it big as a singer/dancer/performer. With some persistence, she makes friends with the handsome Jack (Cam Gigandet) and lands a waitressing job at a downtown Burlesque bar owned by Tess (Cher) where he is the barman. Tess refuses to give Ali a chance, but she persists and gets the gig. During her debut, Nikki (Kristen Bell) the jealous reigning Burlesque queen, turns the tables on Ali in a plan that backfires. Ali sings her heart out and Nikki ends up looking the fool.<br/><br/>Jack and Ali share loads of chemistry but he is an engaged man and she is driven to the arms of Marcus (Eric Dane) a real estate developer who wants to sell the debt-laden club in an effort to tear down the club and create a sky-scraping paradise. Jack is jealous of Marcus, Ali is jealous of Jack's fiancé (cameo by Diana Agron) and while miscommunication ensues, the ending is pretty easy to figure out. The club is saved, Ali is a hit, Tess is happy and Jack gets the girl.<br/><br/>Jack and Ali have loads of chemistry and i was pleasantly surprised that Aguilera wasn't actually a horrible actress. I have seen ""Crossroads"" and there will be the inevitable comparisons to Britney Spears' acting debut. Let me tell you, i could care less, but where Britney failed miserably, Cristina shows promise at being able to play a role with some decency. Granted the subject matter - sing and dance - is an arena where she is pretty comfortable, but i thought she did an admirable job.<br/><br/>Cher is but Cher and there is nothing much i can say about her performance. Stanley Tucci, the actor most lambasted for choosing a part in this movie was great as Tess's best friend, seamstress and confidant. Did i mention Peter Gallagher was in here too? His role is mainly superfluous, but thats besides the point.<br/><br/>This movie is like an Aguilera concert. Singing, dancing with a dash of romance and a serious feel good factor.<br/><br/>I loved it! 7/10"
"phd_travel","9","1","2","20 January 2011"," Enjoyable - a real treat
","Aguilera is multi talented - she can belt it out in different styles and act as well. The dance and song numbers are over the top and well choreographed. The camera angles were good - didn't jump around much like some of the recent musicals like Chicago.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is top notch. Cher is a bit facially frozen but she is amusing to watch. Kristin Bell is a surprise here - who knew she had the vamp in her. Tucci and Gallagher are good. Eric Dane is just sleazy enough. Cam Gigandet is a cool boyfriend.<br/><br/>Loved the old fashioned feel good storyline and neat plot. The romance is lighthearted and predictable in a good way. No ugly characters and unnecessary angst. The dialog is quite fun and witty throughout. It was like watching a good Broadway musical but with a more attractive cast.<br/><br/>One of the more enjoyable musical movies of the past few years."

","Yes, i was dragged to this movie, kicking and screaming, by my wife. Surely a date night could be spent better than with an age-defying primadonna and a talented-singer-not-actress? The only mitigating circumstance I looked forward to was Stanley Tucci. Leaving the theatre, I felt refreshed, invigorated and fulfilled. The movie is a good, well-directed musical that could be seen by both youngsters as well as oldsters. The music caters for most tastes and some of the adaptations of oldies are catchy and toe-tappingly good. Even the acting was good. Perhaps it was because, as seasoned stage muso's, it did not require acting, but just doing what they do frequently. Yet, it can be said that there were no incidents of over-acting, forcing or stumbling. There were some cheesy moments, sure, but real life is also filled with them, so what? Overall, an enjoyable two hours well spent. May even buy the DVD..."
"DICK STEEL","7","1","2","17 January 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Burlesque
","With singers making their leap onto the silver screen from Mariah Carey to Britney Spears even though with varying degrees of success, it's taken quite the while for the pint sized girl with that tremendous big voice to cautiously and finally dabble with film, making her big screen debut playing a performer no less, guided by and given her break by the legendary diva Cher. Welcome to Burlesque, which is probably the cheapest ticket you can find in order to sit in a Christina Aguilera performance.<br/><br/>Written and directed by first timer Steve Antin, don't expect a story that will knock your socks off, as playing it safe is the catchphrase here, telling a tale that's been told a thousand times involving a small town girl aspiring to make it good in the bright lights of a big city, overcoming adversary and encountering romance as part of the package called Life. Burlesque doesn't attempt to deviate from formula about a from rags to riches story, where perseverance is the order of the day if one's talents should be discovered, and a chance given to prove oneself.<br/><br/>The opening scene establishes Ali(ce) (Aguilera) leaving her waitressing job in Iowa for Los Angeles, and finding herself inexplicably burgled, and waiting for that chance of a lifetime to perform in a cabaret called Burlesque, run by Cher's Tess, the only veteran performer who uses her real singing voice, amongst her posse of beautiful women who gyrate to and lip sync to classics. Think of it as one Bollywood song and dance routine on stage, with lights, colours, larger than life personalities such as the diva with bad attitude Nikki (Kristen Bell). Enter Ali into Tess's life by gatecrashing and working for free on the only job she knows how, picking up moves on the sly and barging her way into an audition which, well, turned out good. And as they say the rest is history.<br/><br/>She's Christina Aguilera after all, so how can one not be surprised by the quality of the vocals and performing routine? What Burlesque made up for its lack of a quality story and clumsy romantic subplot involving the bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet) and a rich real estate mogul Marcus (Eric Dane) setting his sights on acquiring the land Burlesque sits on, is that of Aguilera's performance with her powerful voice coming on when Ali has no choice when sabotaged on her lip sync routine, to let the real deal out of the bag. However even then the slower numbers turned out to be quite a drag, with the film actually coming alive with the more upbeat, electrifying numbers with Aguilera and the ensemble of supporting dancers and stage performers.<br/><br/>And those numbers, from Express to Show Me How You Burlesque, are bang for the buck and that's what musicals are made of, with performances, song and music that stand out from the competition, entertaining as hell, without trying to hard to stick a sultry image on Aguilera with the slower numbers in cheesy, cheeky cabaret routines. These set pieces are what made Burlesque worth that close to two hours to sit through, and one had hoped for an encore performance of sorts when the end credit rolled, which did not materialize.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is largely forgettable, with Cher playing a character who's bogged down by money woes to save her club, though her musical numbers You Haven't Seen the Last of Me, and Welcome to Burlesque will leave you wondering why she isn't given more to do, having to disappear in the middle section of the film to may way for the emergence of Aguilera's Ali as the very polished gem to have landed on her lap. Cher can't play mean and sarcastic, and the surrogate mom turn and potential wasn't capitalized other than a few sporadic scenes, which I suppose is expected from Steve Antin's rookie attempt.<br/><br/>Musical numbers don't move the narrative forward, having to stand out as standalone pieces of singular performances, which of course makes this almost akin to a Christina Aguilera concert. The supporting cast of Alan Cumming got wasted in scenes that don't last five minutes combined, Kristen Bell playing a prima dona that doesn't have much to do except hiss at Aguilera's character, and Stanley Tucci once again plays the saviour and shield type of character protecting young upstarts from the wrath of the resident boss, reprising a role already seen in The Devil Wears Prada, and probably an avenue and outlet for that character to explore should he be served the pink slip at the fashion magazine house.<br/><br/>Christina Aguilera fans won't miss this for the world, but for the rest of the movie going audience, it's more of a musical deja vu of stories set in a cabaret that could have benefited from a gutsier storyline and better fleshed out characters, but be prepared to be enthralled at how Aguilera can conjure up such powerful vocals for her size and allows for her character to breathe some hope into Burlesque."

","Musical at its best. Very beautiful images. Great songs. No evil characters or major conflicts in the plot (in my opinion). Everything is so smooth and nice and cheesy. Very relaxing. This is the perfect movie to take your date to, (even though I did not have a chance). Reminds me of the the Sound of Music very much. The movie takes the viewer to a different world, where everyone is a friend, where people care about each other and sings and dance. The only part that I did not like was the presence of homosexuality. I think it was out of place completely, but did not spoil the overall romantic relaxing mood of the movie."

","I think this movie is a great one to see. It is better than A Chorous Line because it shows more women than men. Christina Agularia can sing in this Broadway musical because she not only has singing talent, but dancing talent, which makes her excellent for many Broadway musicals. Many people worldwide would love to see this movie even if they are big Burlesque or any other Broadway musical fans. Even if Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears would do many other Broadway musicals because they also have both singing and dancing talent. Watch this movie more often, I think you will never get enough of Christina Agularia even if you are big Christina Agularia fans.

"cfrank_designs","5","3","12","26 November 2010"," Disappointing and Dry
","Although most people have found Burlesque to be an eye popping, mesmerizing movie musical, I have to take a firm stand to unfortunately say, not so much.<br/><br/>When I first saw the preview for this movie I was ecstatic. The preview brought us a colorful, high energy, refreshing movie musical with two of the most powerful singers to ever walk the earth. With Cher as the ringleader, I had high hopes that this movie would be better then the other movies where singers try to cross over into acting.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>Not only was Aguilera's acting under par, she actually made Spears acting debut in ""Crossroads"" look Emmy winning. The only good thing about the soul diva was in fact, her voice. Now don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting a Julia Roberts ""Eat Pray Love performance, but I also wasn't expecting her to leave me bored and wondering how much longer until its over. Her dance numbers were fascinating and incredibly perfect, her singing was nothing less then compelling, but everything else just was not there.<br/><br/>I'd tell her to stick with singing, but after her last cd, ""Bionic"", leaving me almost as disappointed as her acting in this movie, maybe she should just take a break.<br/><br/>Cher on the other hand was exactly what I had hoped for. A strong, powerful, over the top stunning beauty. But lets face it, its Cher, what else would we expect from her? Alas the stars of the movie were not the song belting sisters, but the men who stand by them.<br/><br/>Cam Gigandet, who plays Aguilera's love interest, was not only refreshing, but also romantic, funny, and overall sexy. He dominated every scene he was in, and kept me asking for more of his smile, and his cookies. Another male superstar was Stanley Tucci. His one-liners not only got me to laugh, but also kept me asking for more. I can say without doubt his acting has never disappointed me, and this movie was no exception.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is entertaining, but lacking one very important thing. A good storyline. The dance numbers, the set, the singing, the costumes, and most of the acting almost make up for lack of plot, but, well, they just don't. This movie left me bored and wanting so much more.<br/><br/>And to the people who are comparing this movie to Moulin Rouge and Chicago, or any other musical movie, lets be honest, this movie doesn't even come close."

"mirkobozic","3","1","3","4 January 2019"," Let's go camp-ing!
","When they hit the big screen, musicians tend to rarely show any talent beyond singing. Which is why the scripts usually focus on exactly that, with the plot used as merely a filler between songs. Hence we have Tess (Cher) as the owner of a night club she's trying to save from financial ruin. The former dancer throws in a couple of her own songs for good measure, but when the smalltown girl Ali (Christina Aguilera)starts waitressing at the club and expresses a wish to move from the bar to the stage, Tess says no. Ali turns out to have spectacular pipes, which unexpectedly starts a renaissance of the joint with Ali as the star of the show, who gains a grudge with the dancer Nikki and finds a friend in Sean( Stanley Tucci, who, once again, plays the gay assitant). I don't remember the guy in a straight role. Cam Gigandet as the bar tender is walking eye candy and Ali's roommate. The story, of course, is ridiculous and so full of cliches that it's hardly difficult where the whole thing is headed. ""Burlesque"" is an escapist sugarbubble that's offends only those with enough movie experience to see that this vehicle is like a huge salad of combined rip-offs, like Footloose, Cabaret and Chicago. Cher is desperately trying to convince us she's got more than that one facial expression and, rather unsuccessfully, that she didn't pay for it. Christina is performance-wise certainly much closer to Jeniffer Beals than Liza Minelli, but even that's an exaggeration. The final verdict would be that this is clearly aimed at Cher's fan-base, and since there's a lot of them, unfortunately it seems that didn't necessarily translate to the box office. This might work as a part of a karaoke or a sing-along, otherwise, stay away from it."

Watch it more than once, and you just might agree with me."

","Steven Antin's ""Burlesque"" has a routine plot - small town girl moves to Hollywood, hoping to make it big - and some interesting musical numbers, but overall the movie is hard to recommend. Probably because it makes everything look too easy. I personally thought that Stanley Tucci's character was the most interesting one in the movie, and I also liked Alan Cumming's character. I found the rest of the characters clichéd, and the movie generally seemed like something that I've seen many times on the screen. Your time would be better spent watching something else. Hell, if you're looking for a Cher movie, there's always ""Silkwood"", ""The Witches of Eastwick"" and ""Tea with Mussolini"".<br/><br/>PS: Steven Antin played the jock in ""The Goonies"""
"Lejink","3","1","3","24 July 2016"," Diva death-match
","Take a little ""Fame"", a bit more ""Chicago"", a little bit more ""Dreamgirls"" and a lot more ""Cabaret"", mix them all up, serve cold and hey presto - ""Burlesque"" a really very clichéd, stereotypical movie musical featuring divas from the past and present in the personae of Cher and Christina Aguilera.<br/><br/>You name it, almost every stock character and situation you can think of in this context is worked in and to death, the young, talented wannabe singer, her backstage, bitchy rival, the older Teflon-tough mother-hen club-owner with a heart of gold, her gay, sympathetic, through-thick-and-thin assistant manager, the grasping, super-rich property magnate out to buy out the failing club and the handsome, sympathetic barman who wouldn't you know it, is a gifted songwriter with a long-time, long-distance fiancé who puts up the young singer with predictable results. <br/><br/>The story really itself from all of the above in a wholly predictable manner which would be all very well if it was well acted, staged and acted but unfortunately it isn't. Cher's face us so botoxed that she can only just make her lips move to speak, Aguilera tries hard, way too hard, to impress leaving just Stanley Tucci to steal most of his scenes as everyone's shoulder-to-cry-on.<br/><br/>Like the aforementioned ""Dreamgirls"", the songs just aren't strong enough either and fail to lodge themselves in the memory in any way. When Aguilera's boy-friend near the end finally presents her with the big song he's been holding back for her, it's just a formulaic sub-disco effort. Moreover, it's ridiculous for Aguilera to make her big pitch to Cher by pleading to actually sing rather than lip-synch on the club stage, only for her to proceed to lip-synch all her own songs from then on.<br/><br/>The production numbers too lack the snap and imagination of ""Chicago"", never mind anything Bob Fosse ever created, leaving the film a rather empty construct, filled with paper-thin characters and a happy ending constructed, literally out of thin air.<br/><br/>This I'm afraid is one cabaret you don't want to come to."
"captzero","3","1","3","2 April 2015"," How Did This Get Made - Burlesque
","I sat down to watch Burlesque yesterday. My first thought: this is a cliché, trying to escape her small town, move to Hollywood, become a star, girl drama. It seemed to be a, middle of the road, union of Coyote Ugly and Show Girls. Both of which, in their own right, are terrible movies. So, no surprise, immediately, this appears to be a worthy candidate for HDTGM dissection.<br/><br/>This is a chick flick, through and through. Men simply can't identify with this type of story. Lets face it: a movie, in which a man packs up and moves from his home town to escape small town life and a dead end job, would be a three minute film of him tying his bootlaces together, tossing the footwear over a power line, followed by a shot of him driving away. Fini. Yes, this is a movie for chicks. Based on this realization, alone, this movie should never have been made. However, men are also horn dogs who enjoy looking at scantily clad, attractive, young women, in provocative poses. There's no denying, women aren't the target demographic for burlesque shows. So, in that sense, where the premise of the story and the acting fail, the movie, at least delivers for the men. They went to the theater and paid to see a burlesque show; the movie delivered on that count. This probably explains the 6.4 user rating on IMDb.<br/><br/>This movie had significant failings in it's plot. The biggest failing, for me, is the burlesque club itself. Firstly, you must suspend your disbelief that we live in a world where a club like this would even exist. Burlesque establishments are typically sexually deviant, back alley, basement dungeons. But the most flagrant, in your face, aspect of the club that causes you to instantly disconnect from an ability to care, is the fact that the finances and operation of the business are woefully mismanaged by Cher's character, Tess. Compounded, on top of delinquent payments of her property's multiple mortgages, a balloon payment that is due at the end of the month, she also has so many, unnecessary, expenses that are driving her into bankruptcy. A live band, for starters, when the vocals are lip synced?. Bringing the dancers expensive alcoholic beverages between numbers? These are reasons why Tess has no business running a business, and so I really don't give a crap if she loses the club, in fact... I was hoping she would.<br/><br/>My 'What the F**k Moment' was the scene where Cher does a solo rehearsal with her DJ. He pops in a compact disc--no need to include the band in a rehearsal--and she belts out a sorrowful ballad, that just so happens, to fit her mood at the moment. This is about as close to being a true musical that, Burlesque, could ever be. The problem is that the scene felt like it was a contractual obligation, between the studio and Cher, that they just wanted to get out of the way. Unfortunately, this isn't even a song that belongs in a burlesque show, and feels completely freaking alien to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>In the end, what we have, as far as a movie goes, is a two hour long string of choreographed hip-hop videos--comprising roughly 70% of the screen time--loosely strung together by an absurd plot, culminating as an excuse to see provocatively clad women prancing around a stage. So why did this movie get made? From budget to box office, the movie is about ten million in the red. For that reason alone, the movie should never have been made. I think this is probably a case of a studio that miscalculated the popularity of Cher and Aguilera in their ability to draw in an audience of their fans. The only redeeming value of the film, from a guy's perspective, was that there was plenty of hot women doing hot things to keep us from falling asleep. I'd just watch pornography, however, if that's what I was after. I've certainly seen porn with equally plausible plot lines."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","3","29 December 2014"," Cher and Tucci make this movie
","""Burlesque"" is a 2010 musical movie featuring some nice numbers. Cher really shines not only with her performance, but also brings it all to the table with ""Welcome to Burlesque"" and ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"". There's more musical numbers which work well such as the use of Madonna's ""Ray of Light"" or ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"". The latter, however, gets much worse when lead star Christina Aguilera (Ali) takes over. I totally wish they would have cast somebody else for that movie's central character. Her acting was mediocre at best and I am not a fan of her voice at all. It's all too much screaming for my taste. The only thing I can see going for her is that her looks are fine, better than most of the time during her pop music career. I remember always being more Team Britney when these two were the most influential new music stars. Still Aguilera looks good here. I found it a bit unrealistic though how such a girl has nobody how she tells us and her new boyfriend at one point. Apart from that, I did not find her really likable which she surely was intended to be. The way she tells Cher's character what to do comes off as pretty cocky and arrogant.<br/><br/>Cher plays Tess, the mother figure to all the girls in her club and I loved her scenes especially with Stanley Tucci, who is great as always and manages with ease to make this character his own. The film takes place in Los Angeles, near Hollywood, where dreams are made. A dream of mine would have been that the sometimes very cheesy script could have been done slightly better. When she tells Gigandet's character they are not brother and sister is one such scene. The whole relationship triangle with his fiancée felt a bit weak and half-baked. Also Ali's reaction at the end when the fiancée suddenly shows up is way over the top. If he did do anything wrong it was that he ended the relationship via phone, but Ali knew that and the way she lost it and ran away was simply ridiculous. The way she ran to the rich guy afterward had something slutty to it, even if it was only to find something out allegedly as we found out not much later. This one was played by Eric Dane, who you may know from ""Charmed"". For some reason I found myself cheering more for him than for Gigandet's character and that is quite a miss from the filmmakers. The negative highlight was maybe at the very end when Ali sang the song Gigandet's character wrote for her and neither the performance nor the lyrics did anything for me. At all. A very unworthy ending.<br/><br/>I believe ""Burlesque"" with some fine-tuning on the script and another lead actress could have turned out as one of the best musical movies in recent years. You can't even blame Aguilera as she has not acted before, but she is really lost in her scenes with all these professional actors next to her. I am usually not too big on Kristen Bell, but she was a revelation compared to Aguilera. What I liked about the film were the information on ""bought air"". I never thought about that, but it makes lots of sense, even if the final ""Ali to the rescue""-twist is a bit cheesy. The film is written and directed by Steve Antin and it is his first really big project as a director. He wrote a Sharon Stone movie in the past and acted in ""The Goonies"", but you can occasionally feel that he lacks experience as a director while watching this. If there is anything the movie is really worth watching for, it is Cher. She has not acted in seven years before this came out and she has not forgotten anything. Pretty good turn from her. Her song ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"" won Diane Warren her first Golden Globe (for her 5th nomination, almost 10 years after the last), but missed out on an Oscar nomination. Same goes for the costumes and art direction where the Academy usually likes to nominate or even award musicals. All in all, it is a decent movie where the strengths slightly outweigh the weaknesses."
"ashild-blovvig","4","1","3","8 May 2014"," Incredibly obvious, bad script, good musical numbers
","This is a chick flick to the bone. Now I'm not usually a fan of chick flicks, so obviously I don't like this movie.<br/><br/>The script is a huge cliché and it has all been done before, and you're gonna guess what happens very quickly. Small-town-girl with big dreams, goes to the city, doesn't have to fight long to get that star role she wants, has a jealous female enemy, love triangle, gets the hot guy, relationship problems follow very shortly, girl solves problems, forgives the guy and everything is fine again. The end.<br/><br/>The only strong parts about this movie is it's musical numbers, obviously, since that is Christina Aguilera's strong side. Since she's a pop star already, she's obligated to be a character that sings in her first (and hopefully last) movie. I'm not against singers in movies, and Aguilera is definitely not the worst I've seen, but her character is so thin and without depth that it goes bad anyway.<br/><br/>The songs are good (except the ones they obviously put in to have Cher and Christina sing about their current state of mind), the dancing is very nice and the costumes dashing. I only wish I had seen more of Alan Cumming. His number with the two girls were very similar to the ""Two Ladies"" number Cabaret. Also, the first scene in the Burlesque club is also a huge reference/rip off to Cabaret's first musical number, which sort of made me a little excited. The biggest problem I have with this movie is that the whole Burlesque club is filled with glitter and expensive costumes and enormous props, and let's face it, Tess's financial problems could've been solved right away if she got rid of even half of those stuff and just toned down the club a bit. It would still be good, the dancer's wouldn't be any worse and it's still easy to make it look good. You don't have to make a Broadway musical to make a show good.<br/><br/>I love the art of burlesque (both the old kind and the new kind), and this is NOT burlesque. It is a cabaret, with a little burlesque dancing. But they had to make this movie available to all the teen girls who love Aguilera out there, so actual burlesque was probably out of the question.<br/><br/>This movie isn't horrible, but it can't be watched with a serious eye. The poor plot and the thin script is laughable and even with great music numbers, the incredible cheesiness of it all makes me not want to see this movie again."
"shanatalks","Null","1","3","12 November 2011"," Burlesque: Just another Musical Movie
","Full review posted at shanatalks.wordpress.com<br/><br/>When I heard that Cher and Christina Aguilera will team up for a movie, I initially thought ""What the heck? Is this another Glitter or Crossroads?"" Both movies didn't make it to the box office and I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only person who thinks both movies sucks. Those pop icons turned actress should have stuck with their forte—singing.<br/><br/>I never really had any expectations when I watched the movie, so I hesitantly bought the DVD and after watching it—I'm singing ""yeah, yeah, yeah"".<br/><br/>To be honest, Burlesque is not the best musical movie I watched (compared with Phantom of the Opera) but I can say it's not a bad movie either. I must admit it; I was not impressed with the movie's story because it's too common. A girl wants to make her dreams come true so she left her hometown, moved to the big city with no one else to turn to. She did find a place to call her own, found friends, family and a partner. Then she lives happily ever after. Very familiar? You bet it is.<br/><br/>Though the movie's screenplay was pretty weak, I can say that the music used for the movie compensated what's lacking from its screenplay. The movie has strong numbers and there are songs that really made its mark to the movie goers. I loved Cher's performance of ""You Haven't Got The Best of Me"" and Christina's ""Show Me How to Burlesque"" number. I kept singing the line ""Let me hear you say, yeeaah!"" for hours. The movie did give me LSS (Last Song Syndrome).<br/><br/>I really don't know if I can recommend this movie to everyone but if you're just looking for a movie that can entertain you and for you to pass the time; Burlesque is not a bad choice. If you love Broadway music, you'd certainly enjoy watching this; However, if you're the movie goer that won't settle for anything less, forget watching this movie."

","I don't know what the negative reviews are all about. We have a nice movie here with Christina Aguliera belting out her songs quite well at a Hollywood burlesque place where she is working.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I could say about the movie is the real lackluster performance by Cher. True, she has her moments, especially when she belts out the title song. Otherwise, I found her lacking in emotion with her continuous deadpan expression, or lack of expression.<br/><br/>The dance numbers are well staged and there is a gem of a performance by Stanley Tucci, the gay director of Tess.

","I'm shocked at some of the other reviews. This was a movie and thats all it was. I'm sure the director had no intention of reminding you of your past in the real Burlesque world. IT WAS JUST A MOVIE... It was a great movie, will there be academy awards for Christina, probably not, but she did a great job. She played the part well, I wasn't expecting nearly that much from her. The Characters are great, the story is cliché but thats what makes it so good for a movie. My only advice(to those who haven't seen it) is if you wanna see a movie to make you escape reality for a while and to put a smile on your face then go see this movie...its well worth it. If you want to go see a documentary based on the true life facts as written or told by people in the burlesque business...then go see another movie"

Burlesque in California, why not the east coast where Burlesque ruled for a time? And, if I heard correctly, the performers lip-synced the songs for the customers because this was really a strip club, but no one stripped. I kept watch for that. Nada., nothing, zero <br/><br/>Burlesque, as I had heard, had comedians as well as song and dance girls. Not in here. But, the music was of such a toe-tapping nature, we didn't miss the comedians. All was good. I have new respect for Christina Aquilera. The girl can sing. Maybe a few acting lessons are in her future, but she held her own. And, Cher sang the opening song and I kept hoping for more of her singing. She did sing one more song later on and WHAT A TALENT !! Can't say enough about her singing. And, her acting is right up there too. <br/><br/>What really made this good with excellent pace was the story interspersed among song and dance acts. Very lively, very real, and very good. The editing for this was fantastic. <br/><br/>Over all a good time, very entertaining. <br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb was heard.

","OK, I'm a huge Christina/Cher fan. When i heard that there was going to be a film featuring both of them, I was hoping it would do them justice. My verdict, an overwhelming yes!!! This is just a brilliant film which has humour, pathos, great music, and a great story. I have watched this film many times and it always cheers me up, and what are films for but to make you engage with them on whatever level works for you. The music is just amazing, my only regret is that there is not more to enjoy. Christina's voice is so powerful and combined with Cher, who should have had more songs, is just genius. Stanley Tucci is the standout male performer who, with Cher, enjoys a great double act with great dialogue. If you haven't seen this film, do so without delay!!!"

","Burlesque is for Christina what Glitter (2001) wasn't for poor Mariah.<br/><br/>The movie is just OK... there's not much to say about it as it's a piece of Moulin Rouge, Chicago and Nine, the trilogy of new modern musicals that popped theaters and now are becoming a tired formula. It's a linear easy going movie to catch all ages and people, mainly those ones who are Christina fans because the whole movie is all about her.<br/><br/>As an actress, she's just playing her part well, thinking that this is her first big role and also her debut. As a singer there's not much to prove either because all that she sings there she already did with her 2007's Back To Basics album and this music style is almost stereotyping her career when the movie was much more successful than her new album - which got a totally different direction and was a complete commercial failure.<br/><br/>The movie is not entirely a musical... it has a lame background story and other parallel ones that doesn't add anything interesting. Cher is okay and her acting level is equivalent to the facial expressions she's able to do, that's why she isn't making so much movies lately... Stanley Tucci is okay, being the example of people that sometimes do amazing movies and sometimes don't... Alan Cumming in a super-supporting role isn't okay. That's almost an offense as much as watching Michael Caine appearing for just 2 minutes in 'Inception' (2010).<br/><br/>It's what a regular musical is supposed to be, even when sometimes I just used the FF button because all Christina's burlesque vocal performances were making me dizzy.<br/><br/>Just watch it before bed."

","If you want to see a movie that brings out the mood and after the end leaves a strong desire to dance, then Burlesque, is the ideal choice.The beautiful girls, the costumes that leave no many in imagination, the nice choreographies, the uplifting music and the sexy atmosphere is unique characteristics of this musical, who certainly not bet at the script, which is irrelevant and banal, but at the debut of Christina Aguilera. Without being impressive and without being disappointing the famous singer, responds to a large extent at the demands of the role and of course a big help is her amazing voice. In contrast Cher is weak and is saved by the presence of Stanley Tucci, who even if repeats, always wins the spectators. The songs, while not affecting the aesthetics, they are all, irrelevant. Can for example the song lyrics, at «Nine» to be moderate, but by leaving the Cinema we humming 'Be Italian'. Here, unfortunately we have neither a memorable melody. Burlesque certainly not remembered for long -for men of course, quite the opposite will happen-but we had fun, although the whole show now seems somewhat obsolete."

","Since the advent of sound and the first Best Picture Oscar winner in the sound era (1929 winner ""The Broadway Melody""), Hollywood has been fascinated with the musical and namely the 'small-town girl has huge dreams in the big city' genre. The 2010 version of this sometimes-proved formula gives us ""Burlesque"", a film that wants to continue the trends of ""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""Chicago"", but looks more like the genre when it was fleeting through the 1970s and 1980s with that Bob Fosse take on the material. Christina Aguilera is that small-town Iowa girl (!?) who comes up with the idea out of the blue one day to leave the simple Midwest life for Los Angeles. Times are tough though as she has no luck until she wanders aimlessly into a nightclub that has the feel of Fosse's ""Cabaret"". There she encounters the club's owner and creative force (bravura role for Cher, doing her best work in two decades) and a whole array of fascinating characters (namely love interest/bartender Cam Gigandet and the scene-stealing Stanley Tucci). Inside the club, the typical soap operas play out with Aguilera wanting to be a star, Cher having her doubts, Cher's ex-husband Peter Gallagher worrying about the club's enormous debt, Aguilera having a rivalry with star attraction Kristen Bell, big-money sleaze-ball Eric Dane eyeing the club and many of the female performers for himself, Gigandet's long-distance relationship with fiancé Dianna Agron, and even an unplanned pregnancy via role player Julianne Hough, and so on. In the end there is nothing just earth-shattering here, but there is still something about this film that makes it pop nevertheless. The musical numbers and dance sequences can be looked upon as exciting or downright tiring, but the women do sizzle and keep the audience and intensity up throughout. Relative film-making newcomer Steve Antin (who directed the film and wrote the screenplay) shows kind of an intense MTV-styled 1980s consciousness which likely comes from his hay-day acting career during that decade (being in films such as ""The Goonies"" and ""The Accused""). Is the film successful in its goals? I think in this case it is up to the viewer and ultimately there were enough pluses for ""Burlesque"" to be one of the more guiltier pleasures of the past few years. 4 stars out of 5."

","Although I read a fairly good amount of negative reviews, I still decided to go see Burlesque with my friends. To my surprise, I sat in the theater for almost 2 hours truly amazed by this movie. It is a cliché, a familiar theme that has been told before. Nowadays, a lot of movies are clichés. And there are quite a few remakes also. However the movie is truly entertaining, fun, interesting. The singing, dancing, dialogue, acting ... are all excellent. Christina and Cher deliver some great songs. The chemistry between Christina and Cam Gigandet is adorable. Cam Gigandet is by far my favorite actor of all time. I am so happy to see him have decent screen time, and to see him perform such a lovable strip scene. I could have paid $500 just to see his Famous Amos cookies scene. I give 10/10. I anxiously wait for the DVD to be released."

","Imagine, if you will, Judy Garland getting the chance to come back to life (a.k.a. ""Our Town"") to live one day - one day in which to experience the thrill of being at her best - reprising, at age 21 - in a movie showcasing her talents. It's a busy day in heaven, so God arbitrarily assigns her to play Andy Sachs, the popular heroine of The Devil Wears Prada, forgetting that Garland's voice is, after all, her greatest asset. She complains; He says, ""fine - let's try something else - bring along the same characters, the ingénue, the difficult boss with a uber-loyal sidekick manager and an impossibly bitchy colleague: but to add the music you say you want, let's set the story in ..in."" and now He's stumped, because 2010 is a far cry from Garland's prime, the 30s and 40s. ""A cabaret?"" she suggests, helpfully. ""Well, along those lines, but this is America, so, not exactly.""<br/><br/>""Right,"" she nods, ""so, say, L.A., and 2010, so the sexuality has to be kicked up a notch..so can I tart it up a little? And throw in a few gay references?"" ""Well..."" He responds reluctantly. ""A promise is a promise. Just keep your clothes on but anything else goes. Got it,"" he agrees, scribbling the script on a cloud and kicking the story into action.<br/><br/>Welcome to ""Burlesque."" Derivative? Totally. A strong talent base? Absolutely. Christina Aquilera channels Garland, or least matches her considerable talents, both vocal and dramatic,as the ingénue. Cher is the seemingly ageless, club-owning boss, who confidently owns the stage in a big opening number with the same title as the film. Rounding out a stellar cast are Stanley Tucci, the AC-DC right-hand friend and manager; Kristen Bell as the impossibly wicked fellow dancer; Cam Gigandet as the low-key love interest for the heroine; and Eric Danes, the too-good-to-be-true wealthy would-be lover pushing for a chance with the New Little Dancer with the Big Hidden Talent. <br/><br/>The problem is that the talent deserves a fitting forum, but the plot is so full of holes that it ranges from being merely tedious to being ludicrous. In a strip-joint setting where willingness to show skin and lynchsync is the only required skill for dancers, and in an industry where the women are a dime a dozen, Our Plucky Gal Ali can't seem to beg her way out of waitressing and onto the stage. Later she gets the chance only when Rival Nikkie(Bell)is sent away, drunk; Nikkie then sabotages Ali's big musical number by cutting off the sound, out of sheer jealousy. Despite all this, the venom-spouting Nikkie gets to keep her job with not a single eyebrow raised. And then there's club owner Tessa (Cher), who has supposedly has been savvy enough to run the club for decade, yet seems clueless as to why she is in debt or what to do about it. Jack (Gigandet) finally beds Nikki after her extended resistance, without mentioning he hasn't really broken off with his fiancé after all. Said fiancé storms into the apartment and Nikkie is disgraced and thrown out in the middle of the night with Jack's consent - but after an attempt at apology from Jack a few days later, no prob, all is well and happily after after. There's more, but you get the picture. So--film potential, a thousand percent; realization, not so much.<br/><br/>If you're all about the music and dancing, go for it - this is a movie you'll love. Aquilera fans - yes, this movie shows her in top form. Cher lovers - yes, she's still got what it takes - although she seems to have had so much ""work"" that one struggles to remember her original lips and eyes. The other actors work hard to pull it all together. But for those wanting the whole nine yards - the kind of movie musical that made Judy Garland the darling of her day and revered throughout America - this ain't it. This is a muddy bog of a story, sprinkled only at odd intervals with all too brief glimpses of talent. Garland, in looking at the big picture, might even have taken a pass - and gone back to heaven to savor memories of ""A Star is Born."" It's a shame that, in trying to be that movie - and ""Prada,"" and ""Cabaret,"" and ""Fosse"" that ""Burlesque"" has yet to find an identity of its own."

","The biggest surprise for me was Christine Aguilera's performance as an actress. She did very well. There are many actors who get regular gigs and have less talent. She was able to show off her range as a singer. She proved she is not just a Pop singer. For her debut in acting on the big screen, she did a really good job.<br/><br/>Cher is showing her age but still put out a solid acting and singing performance. Other than the two main actresses, there are two actors who really kept the film moving and enjoyable with a fair share of the laughs: Stanley Tucci and Alan Cumming.<br/><br/>The casting was very good. The above two gems of supporting actors really helped the film overall. The director kept the film about the story, and not the costumes and burlesque theme.<br/><br/>The music selections and choreography were quite enjoyable. Sure the style and feel may have been seen in other productions, but they are still fun to watch. Plus, how often do you get to see Cher perform with the polish of a major movie production? This is certainly a movie to go see and have fun with. It is not just a ""date"" movie. By the reaction of the females in the theatre, it would seem there is more eye candy for the women.

But anyway moving on from that.<br/><br/>Christina Aguilrea follows the likes of Mariah Cary(Glitter),Jessica Simpson(Employee of The Month),Britney Spears(Crossroads) and a few more stars who failed to become an actress while the likes of Justin Timberlake,Will Smith and Mandy Moore are now full time actors but out of the three Timberlake is still both an artist and an actor. Here Aguilrea plays Ali a girl who dreams of being a burlesque dancer in Los Angelus. Of course she does go there and meets Tess(Cher who I swear looks like Gothel from Tangled) who was also a burlesque dancer herself. But a drunk burlesque dancer called Nikki(played by Kristen Bell who stars in the most overrated movie of all time Frozen wearing a dark wig here)doesn't want Ali to shine on stage. But can Ali pull of the launderette outfit at the strip club where they lip synch and not sing? or will she use her own voice to blow them away with romance blossoming between her and Cam Gandent)?.<br/><br/>So what did I think of this movie. Well its not the best movie of all time and certainly not my all time favorite movie but if you like Aguilrea than check it out.

","BURLESQUE, written and directed by Steve Antin, is a terrific cinematic definition of what the word 'burlesque' means: 'a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which itself derives from the Italian burla - a joke, ridicule or mockery.' This is a riot of color and good fun and snazzy production numbers a la Bob Fosse takeoffs. The story is predictable and silly and the script borders on mediocre, but with the talent and pizazz of the cast, none of that matters! <br/><br/>Ali (Christine Aguilera) flees Iowa in hopes of a career in show biz and happens into a Sunset Strip Burlesque House run by 'still not down' Tess (Cher) who knows her business is failing, despite the solid help from her gay assistant Sean (Stanley Tucci) and the warnings of her ex- husband/partner Vince (Peter Gallagher). Tess has problems with some of her lip-synching cast, namely Nikki (Kristen Bell), and is being hounded to sell her club to the wealthy boyfriend of Nikki - Marcus (Eric Dane). Ali observes, wants to be in the show, but is offered the job of waitress in the club by bartender/songwriter Jack (Cam Gigandet), a guy so kind that he shares his little flat with her. Ali is persistent and when given a chance to audition she gets into the cast. Her trump card is that she is such a terrific singer that she converts the club away from lip-synching into a full-blown song and dance place. Romance of course flutters in as do other little sidebars (including a strange quickie by doorman Alexis (Alan Cumming), but the main attractions are the glitzy stage numbers by a surprisingly fine Aguilera and by Cher herself. It is all very corny and very wonderful entertainment. Definitely worth an evening's pleasure. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

I liked both of those movies back in 1983/84, when I was 24/25 and full of sexual urgency and star potential. Burlesque – like Purple Rain and Flash Dance – is a sexually charged if coy fairy tale saddled with the hopes, dreams, demons and darlings of its protagonists.<br/><br/>This movie is best viewed before 30, before your own silly dreams have been crushed."

","This movie was excellent. Took my mum and 10yr old daughter to see this on Saturday night. Christina A was awesome and Cher was also. I give this movie a 10 as it was entertaining, a little comedy (which was good to break up the singing and dancing) and the romance was just enough. Christina A, first time to the screen deserves a lot of credit. Welcome back Cher. The bar guy plays a great part and add's spice to the movie. The supporting actresses which are the other Burleque dancers add that bitch factor which everyone loves to hate. Overall this is a great movie. The M rating is true to it's rating with a couple of M rated things but they went over my 10 year old daughters head and there were no sex scenes."

","What My Husband and I LOVE most about BURLESQUE, in addition to its PHENOMENAL Soundtrack on CD and within the movie, is that BURLESQUE brings all of the classic elements of entertainment onto the Silver Screen - Music, Comic Relief, Drama, Romance, Sex Appeal, and Electrifying Performances across the board, with PHENOMENAL music posing as the Greek Chorus, carrying the plot along! <br/><br/>The characters are not typical of the Los Angeles portrayal of ""real people!"" They are portrayed as real, colorful people, not over-the-top pretentious, making it easier to identify with the characters and discover a ""new look"" on the REAL people of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>BURLESQUE does not promote Teen Drinking/Smoking/Partying in any way (While it is inferred that one young character is an avid drinker, they are never seen drinking); and though sex is also inferred, there aren't any sex scenes, even between the gay male characters in a world where gay men are portrayed as overly gorgeous, sex addicts, giving the movie a heart, with a tremendous sex appeal for all Audiences. <br/><br/>In addition, the PHENOMENAL Soundtrack within the movie, but not yet released on CD for a very well-deserved second CD of BURLESQUE, has inspired My Husband and I to purchase the full albums of the featured Artists/Groups within the Movie's Score/Soundtrack. Keri Hilson's ""In A Perfect World...;"" Neon Trees' ""Habits;"" Alphaville's ""Forever Young;"" Boston's ""Boston II;"" Miranda Lambert's ""Revolution;"" and Christina Aguilera's ""Back to Basics,"" creating Our own BURLESQUE Playlists.<br/><br/>Overall, BURLESQUE, in My opinion, is a Classic Musical - the story is simple, and the Musical Performances are ELECTRIFYING! Go out and see BURLESQUE! During the stress of the Holiday Season, BURLESQUE is a Great Escape from the Exciting Holiday Madness!<br/><br/>As an Actor in My Native NYC, raised in a musically-inclined family and going to Broadway shows ever since I was a kid, I've always appreciated musical movies, such as BURLESQUE, that remind me of other movies I've enjoyed throughout the years - TOMMY, SPARKLE, GREASE, XANADU, FLASHDANCE, Saturday NIGHT FEVER, ALL THAT JAZZ, ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS, GRAFFITI BRIDGE, MAHOGANY, GLITTER, PURPLE RAIN, and of course My All-Time Favorite, SHOWGIRLS.<br/><br/>Lastly, BURLESQUE has a sentimental value to My Husband and I because it is the very first movie that We are BOTH crazy about, including the Soundtrack! Together, We've seen the movie 5 times! Prior to meeting each other, We never shared Our enthusiasm for MANY things with that Someone Special before in Our Lives, so BURLESQUE has a lot more significance in Our Lives than just becoming Our All-Time Favorite Movie! <br/><br/>Some May Be Able to Relate to Us and/or this review, Some May Not Be Able to Relate to Us and/or this review!"

","Saw it with the wife. Not a bad film but not something I would see myself. I'm no fan of Cher or Christina. It wasn't offensive or extremely entertaining, just a movie made for fans of these singers. Cher, who I think it like 85, looks like a drag queen. She is not aging gracefully and is the perfect example of bad plastic surgery, however I do not deny her talent (but again, I'm not fan).<br/><br/>The numbers are done well and again, this is a well made film but if you're not into this type of movie or either one of these singesr, this is a date movie at best. I saw many couples in the theater so I think it was all guys whose wives dragged them to see it, and some younger ""Glee"" type fans and fans of Christina. I did not see any guys with other guys although I'm sure in certain parts of the country, there was that in the theater too."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Just back from a screening and must admit that I was blown away by Christina Aguilera. The film is first and foremost a showcase of her talent ... and quite a talent she is!<br/><br/>Ali (Aguilera) is a bored, small town Iowa girl who heads off to find the bright lights of L.A. She stumbles into a Burlesque club and is immediately enchanted by the songs, the dancers and the overall feel of the place. The club is co-owned by Tess (Cher) and her ex-husband Vince (Peter Gallagher) and is headed towards financial disaster. Local real estate developer Marcus (Eric Dane) rides in on a white horse and fat wallet and offers to rescue Tess and Vince. Of course, his plans for the club are anything but altruistic.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Marcus and Jack the bartender (Cam Gigandet) battle over Ali, though neither are very good at it. While that battle is going on Ali manages to beat out Nikki (Kristin Bell) for the spotlight on stage. This is when the movie really takes off, musically speaking.<br/><br/>From a musical perspective, Cher belts out a couple of solos that easily convince that her pipes are still full strength. Her two songs are definite highlights and it's a pleasure to see her still in top form. Aguilera has so many numbers that I lost track. Most are average songs at best, but her voice is so unique and powerful that the non-descript songs come off fine.<br/><br/>Must also mention Alan Cumming and especially Stanley Tucci. Mr. Tucci is clearly the best actor in the movie, though he basically reprises his character from The Devil Wears Prada.<br/><br/>There will be comparisons to Dreamgirls, Moulin Rouge!, Cabaret and Chicago. Writer and first time director Steve Antin pretty much stays out of the way of Cher and Aguilera, while delivering the expected product to his intended audience ... not that there's anything wrong with it."
"Wuchakk","6","0","3","24 March 2017"," ""Coyote Ugly"" meets ""Chicago"" with Christina Aguilera & Cher
","Released in 2010, ""Burlesque"" is a drama/musical about a bored small town girl (Christina Aguilera) who moves to the big city to better her life and, hopefully, do something with her great talents. She gets a waitress job at a nightclub and eventually talks the owner (Cher) into allowing her to perform. Cam Gigandet plays the potential beau while Peter Gallagher appears as the club owner's ex-husband and part owner. Stanley Tucci plays the likable stage manager while Kristen Bell & Julianne Hough are on hand as dancers. Eric Dane plays the arrogant mogul who wants to purchase the club and build condos. <br/><br/>My title blurb says it all: ""Burlesque"" combines the plot of 2000's ""Coyote Ugly"" with elements of 2002's ""Chicago,"" particularly the curvy women and burlesque dancing sequences. While it failed to achieve the moderate success of ""Coyote Ugly"" at the box office, it's a significantly better movie. Although both films have the familiar formula plot, ""Burlesque"" has a more compelling story with a more dynamic cast and superior song & dance. It also has better women, as far as curvy appeal goes (with the arguable exception of Piper Perabo, the women in ""Coyote Ugly"" had the non-curvy shape of 12 year-old boys). Someone criticized that Aguilera was too ""old"" for the role. Poppycock. She was 29 during filming and easily passed for someone in her late teens/early twenties. Despite her alluring powers, she had the youthful/winsome/innocent vibe to pull off the part. <br/><br/>There's a surprising peripheral plot about how homosexual relationships start with 'sex' and proceed from there. <br/><br/>The film runs 119 minutes and was shot entirely at Sony Pictures Studios, Culver City, California. It was written & directed by Steve Antin. <br/><br/>GRADE: B-"

As you know, this is musical movie, but song and dance and performance are so excellent, so people definitely listen to the voice every day. The story is that main character overcome challenges to fulfill dream, but this film is not predictable. There are many scenes of her for example,happiness and sadness and anger, so people can feel her emotion through this movie. It is good text for senior high school students and adult because this film push their back. Also, its content is brilliant, so girls and women can enjoy the time.

","At least it's got Cher, and the iconic ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"". There isn't much else to see or listen to. Annoyingly unoriginal story about an ambitious, small town Iowa girl named Ali (Christina Aguilera), who leaves the slow lane for the fast lights and glitter of L.A.<br/><br/>There, she too easily lands a job at a nightclub overseen by Tess (Cher). The club features small tables and a stage whereupon mini-clad young ladies dance, lip-sync to the music, and pose evocatively for mostly male patrons. Ali gets her chance to replace the lead performer. Along the way, various characters and incidents intersperse the club's stage numbers to keep the contrived plot moving along.<br/><br/>You get the feeling that the entire script was written for Aguilera. Yes, she can sing, if by singing you mean yelling out lyrics attached to modern rap beats, nominally called ""music"", devoid of melody or substantive meaning. Aguilera specializes in loudness. The stage numbers start out fine, before Aguilera horns in, but then deteriorate. The final stage number reeks of cringe inducing, vapid noise.<br/><br/>Further, Aguilera is miscast. She looks too little-girl innocent in the first half; in the second, with all that garish makeup and posing, she looks horribly fake. Cher is better cast and I like her backstage presence. Performances are okay. Indoor lighting looks convincing. But the stage seems to change size; in one scene, it looks small, in another, overwhelming.<br/><br/>I would have preferred a more unpredictable plot, more emphasis on Cher's character, a different actor for the Ali character, and stage numbers that didn't sound like they came from the portfolio of Justin Bieber. Still, the presence of Cher elevates ""Burlesque"" to borderline entertaining. It's worth a one-time watch."

","Burlesque (2010): Dir: Steve Antin / Cast: Christina Aguilera, Cher, Stanley Tucci, Eric Dane, Kristen Bell: Total xerox of Showgirls as if that is much of an inspiration. It regards expression and how a small town waitress ventured to Las Angeles in hopes of becoming a sensation. Director Steve Antin is backed by several energetic musical numbers that are full of flair but the story is just a recycled mess. Christina Aguilera is traveling familiar territory from small town to big time impressing everyone. She definitely has the pipes to carry a concert but as an actress she isn't quite as polished as someone in the heights of Cher, but as a musician she holds her own. Cher is the one solid performance as club owner struggling to pay to keep her business. We know that she will be impressed with Aguilera and ultimately save the club, but saving the film is beyond her reach. Eric Dane as the bartender whom allows Aguilera a place to crash is a complete prop. He is basically there to romance her while talking about an out of town girlfriend who is not available just enough so that it becomes unnecessary. Stanley Tucci plays Cher's gay production director who assists Aguilera while providing emotional support for Cher. Even Kristen Bell makes an appearance and all her charm cannot muster up a hint of originality. The dance numbers are not bad, and sometimes even flashy and inspiring but it is within a screenplay that is anything but inspiring. Not so much about dancing as it is its lame sidetracked subplots that we have seen in a dozen other films about hopeless dreamers. Score: 3 ½ / 10"

","Several attempts have been made to re-create stories based upon The Star Is Born. A few of those have been based upon Burlesque theatrical dance. This movie is one of them. The burlesque style is essentially women dressed as prostitutes dancing provocatively on stage without exposing their bits.<br/><br/>As a movie showcase for Christina Aguilera songs it succeeds. Christina is sweet then raunchy and performs her routines with the high quality visual sexiness we have come to expect from her music videos. This movie came after her Back To Basics album which explored a variety of 20th century dance and singing themes. In the movie she is joined by Cher as the club owner, who in my opinion, has the best ballad in the movie.<br/><br/>In spite of the raunchiness, this is a movie directed at the female audience rather than at the boys. It is about woman having fun dressing up, applying their make-up and enticing men around their little fingers. There are no doormen throwing out troublemakers from the club and no fist fights let alone a gun. This is the opposite of say Roadhouse. Humour is provided superbly by Stanley Tucci.<br/><br/>The song and dance acts are stylish, however the plot of the story is tediously predictable. You won't find a single surprise in this movie.<br/><br/>Burlesque scores highly for it's imagery but it falls far short of the movie Cabaret as a story. Burlesque plays safe whilst Cabaret was a lot more edgy."

","TL;DR: Good musical entertainment, not a good MOVIE as a whole. Come for music and dance, not for acting and plot. To be enjoyed in musical zombie mode. Straight to the point, Burlesque's musical numbers are exciting and attractive but has almost no plot (at least not as far as it tries to make me care). I watched this with my mother who knows little English so she only enjoyed the musical numbers and the pretty faces. Later, I felt like that was all I enjoyed too. Good thing for the film, the music is frequent and enjoyable.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the layers to the story are simple: a financially- troubled club, a small-town hopeful and a love interest. Despite working on very familiar premises for a plot, the film makes no effort whatsoever to make any magic happen. The story doesn't take the back seat, it's in the trunk. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters as long as they lived to perform another song. However, the script-writing does win some points for its witty humor, which would have helped inspire more praises if only the story was as good as the songs."

","Picture it: Super bowl 2014. I had to find the movies to watch during ""the game"" that would be such the opposite from what the core audience of that silly football game would want to see. Part I of my night was my first time seeing: Burlesque.<br/><br/>Now, I absolutely love Cher. Mildly like Christina Aguilera and the rest of the cast, but I live by and salute Cher. Still, it took me until 2/2/2014 to see Burlesque. Maybe because I thought it was a musical, or because the trailers that spoiled everything, weren't that appealing.<br/><br/>After seeing the film, I recognized all the clichés, the problems, the bad acting, bad dialogue and been-there-done-that moments. Still, I liked it. With reservations.<br/><br/>Small-town girl with a big heart gets sucked into the glamour of showbiz and, SHOCKER, she makes it big. Glitter takes over and she has to remain grounded long enough for her and the All About Eve Mentor (i.e. Cher,) to both get along, but work together to defeat the thin plot of their adversary.<br/><br/>This movie is a definite leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature. It's nothing huge, special or refreshing, but it is fun when you ignore all that's come before it. Perhaps, I'm biased, but c'monit's Cher. She's not getting any younger and it's great to see her spunk once more. And the music's great, the humor, though obvious, is still nice and the set/costumes, while unrealistic, are still entertaining.<br/><br/>They didn't make a groundbreaking film and I'm sure all involved would admit that. But, they made something enjoyable for a laid back, mid-Saturday feature to watch.<br/><br/>Take heed, however: You probably should really enjoy Cher to enjoy this. Or maybe think Christina's hot? I dunno.<br/><br/>What I do know is: don't expect the world, and you'll want a ticket to Burlesque.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: Oddly enough, though I did chose this as my first film of my double feature during the 2014 Super Bowl, it would also serve me when I later discovered the podcast: How Did This Get Made? This was their very first podcasted subject, so I could safely listen to that spoiler-rich 'cast while they unabashedly and hilariously bashed the film. They also pointed out a ton I missed. But, then, again, I wasn't looking too deep. Like watching a Friday the 13th sequel – a later one, that is, one cannot expect 5/5 stars. Just leave that brainat the door."

","Will we be strong enough and be able to turn back time to remember a time without the ageless diva who made it big, not only in music, but on television, on Broadway (in a play, not a musical) and in movies? Yes, Cher is not as active in movies as she was when she shot to the legend of cinema goddesses winning an Oscar for ""Moonstruck"", but her legendary status has not diminished with age. When I talk with people from age 15-85, they all say one person embellishes it all in the world of entertainment, and that is Cher. You can praise Barbra, Liza, Ms. Ross, the Divine Ms. M, Madonna, etc., and I adore (most) of these ladies. But there is only one who touches each generation, every race and nationality without reluctance.<br/><br/>Now that I've gushed, I must confess that I went into this movie with mixed feelings, and I came out of it a bit surprised. No, this is no classic, and I can honestly say that in my 25 years of living in Los Angeles, there is no club on the Sunset Strip that represents the club that Cher owns here. The club is more Crenshaw Blvd. than Sunset Blvd., the strip loaded with its expensive restaurants, comedy clubs, rock clubs and strip joints (mostly towards downtown). This is more valley than city, but like ""Connie and Carla"", another favorite of mine, I look beyond its misrepresentation of what it shows L.A. to be.<br/><br/>Christine Aguilera really surprised me by what a natural actress she is- likable, not at all annoying, and someone you root for. She is Ruby Keeler of ""42nd Street"" in leather and lace, with Cher the Warner Baxter putting on the show and Kristen Bell a younger version of Bebe Daniels, the star who is always late (and usually drunk). Cher tells her to go ahead and ""Spend the rest of your life pouring vodka on your Cherrios"". She is also the den mother to the girls, reminding Bell of how many nights she held her head over the toilet so the poor girl wouldn't drowned in her own vomit. <br/><br/>When Cher breaks into ""Welcome to Burlesque"", I cringe at the thought that this multi-talented woman has never stepped foot onto the Broadway stage into a musical, and it took this standard story (beefed up for modern times) to allow her to sing in a movie. Any flagging Broadway show would be lucky to rush her into the cast so she could strut herself. Cher in ""Mamma Mia"" as Donna, anyone? I found Aguilera's persistence at getting a job at the bar so amusing, her gall both perplexing and pleasing to the deep-down gold-hearted Cher who is so afraid of loosing her club that her distraction by the younger girl ultimately wins her over. <br/><br/>Eric Dane, as the bartender who befriends Aguilera and takes her in may seem to some to be like a Chelsea boy than the sweet heterosexual man he plays, but I think that had more to do with his bartender costuming and the overabundance of showing off his body than anything else. Peter Gallagher, Stanley Tucci and Cam Gigandet give fine supporting performances, but I wanted to see much more of Alan Cumming as the door man with more than just a passing resemblance to his ""Cabaret"" emcee. The Golden Globe Winning ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"" is Cher's big 11:00 number, and may not have the greatest lyrics, but in the way Cher performs it, the result is unforgettable.<br/><br/>I've heard people call this the L.A. ""Show Girls"" and an updated ""Valley of the Dolls"", but it actually offers some intelligence, especially with its denouncement that does what a musical is supposed to do-be triumphant."

","The musical ""Borelesque"" I mean ""Burlesque"" was grotesque with its formulaic tune. ""Burlesque"" stars Cher as Tess, an L.A. burlesque-club owner who must come with a big show of cash in order to save her struggling club. However, the movie is really the showcase of Christina Aguilera who also stars as Ali, an aspiring singer-dancer who heads to L.A. from Iowa to make it big, what an innovative concept for a movie! Sorry, I used to work at Sarcasmesque. Anyways, Ali slips into Tess' club, and well you could figure out the rest. female protagonist stars with lousy job, her co-workers think she is a nobody, she meets a male friend, she gets a chance to show her talent, she makes it big, she falls for male friend, she has a jealous rival out to ruin her, she has conflict with lover, she has a conflict with her superior, problems eventually get solved and the rest is. well, you get the picture. Or maybe you should not get this picture. Writer-Director Steve Antin's directorial and screenplay ""Burlesque"" antics were making me hope that the show must not go on. I was not moonstruck with Cher's over-the-top performance as Tess; if I can turn back time, I would have fast forwarded all her scenes. Aguilera was not too shabby in her debut acting performance as Ali, but I was more impressed with the voice than the act. Stanley Tucci's performance as the club's gay fashion designer in ""Burlesque"" was dressed with the same characterization as his duplicate character in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". What's next ""Tucci Wears Gucci""; sorry Stan, I know you are a hell of an actor. Eric Dane seemed bored in his portrayal of Marcus, the wealthy magnate who is trying to buy Tess' club. Kristen Bell's work as the villainous dancer Nikki also danced itself with too many over-the-top moves. Cam Gigandet's performance as Ali's love interest Jack (who is also one of the club's bartenders) was a bit charismatic but not gigantic enough. The music of ""Burlesque"" was at zero level in my goose-bump meter. So I guess it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that ""Burlesque"" to me was a near complete mess. ** Needs Improvement"

I wasn't expecting a stellar performance from Christina Aguilera (I don't even care how to spell her last name) but whatever you want to call it, it was BADDDD. It was probably because her character was so annoying. Really, I hated the main character; just so stupid. Why the hell didn't she just start singing in the first place and make Cher shut the hell up?? Cher's character was a pain in the ass too; just the shut up and listen to someone for s**t's sake. What killed me the most was the WORST romance in a movie I have ever seen. Holy freakin' s*** was the love story so lame. The guy's engaged, then thinks it will be fine to share his apartment with a nice piece of @$$, watches her get changed and perform half naked then ""falls in love with her."" Just so terrible. Oh yeah, then his fiancé walks in on them in bed. HAHAHAA. Worst. Oh, about the music...some of it is good, not going to lie about that. Unfortunately though, it's not enough to save this trainwreck..or Stanley Tucci for that matter. I like Tucci, and it's a shame he's connected to this movie.

","BRAVO! How wonderful to see this lost art. Christina Aguilera was very smart to produce this terrific musical. Burlesque is unfamiliar to so many they may completely alien to its appeal. Not a strip club, but still very sexual in nature. The story behind it all was secondary, as in most musicals like Coyote Ugly. Burlesque has received many bad reviews I believe it does not deserve. Our most beloved and successful musicals started on Broadway, some made over and over again like Chicago, the others had much time to be adapted, to take out the slow periods, add more character to a character, rewrite parts, and take out bland numbers, jazz up other numbers like, to perfect them by the time they went to film like, Phantom of the Opera, Cats, A Chorus Line, My Fair Lady, Grease, All That Jazz and Chicago which ran three times on Broadway, once with Bob Fosse as the choreographer; this is why they are icons in our memory. Burlesque captured the music perfectly, the dancing not so bad, and absolutely the singing, the back story wasn't nurtured the way the rest of the movie was, but then, I didn't really expect it would. This generation doesn't not know anything about burlesque shows anyway, thank God we didn't have to endure any hokey comedians in between songs while the girls changed costumes. The cast was wonderful, the songs were great, and the choreography was so enjoyable. The back story, well give it a few runs on Broadway and let a few writers go through it and that will even be as nurtured as the rest of the movie. Christina Aguilera couldn't be lovelier and her voice is absolutely awesome. Cher, geez will she ever age? All though she seemed to lose her singer diva title next Christina's voice, but who wouldn't? How could Stanley Tucci be bad in anything? His performance was wonderful as usual. Cam Gigandet was not a complete new comer, but was great as the romantic lead. I think Christine was brave in backing this movie. When we all got to leave we all said, geez, I wish there was a place like to go to around here, we'd go in a minute. What fun to go to a Burlesque place on the weekend.

","Burlesque actually looked promising to me. I like musicals, I like movies about dance, I like the concept of a struggling young artist come to make it big (Coyote Ugly, Showgirls) okay maybe not Showgirls. But Showgirls is actually exactly what I could compare Burlesque to most, minus the adult content. The most disappointing thing about Burlesque is there is some really great actors that are totally wasted. The choreography for a dance film, with two incredibly talented performers, is ridiculous and almost near boring which is just sad and wasted. The characters are almost entirely vapid and empty and if it weren't for the charisma that the three main characters bring to the screen just by being there this would be a huge stinker and a whopping zip out of ten. But because I just couldn't give such a horrible score to the likes of Cher and Tucci. Still even little girls looking for glitz and glam can't find much of anything to hang on to in this. It is a mess and you will see why reviews and theatre performance was so bad.<br/><br/>Christina Aguilera in her debut big screen role is Ali, the young and headstrong singer/dance that wants to be the title role in the Burlesque show that enamours her. There is nothing wrong per se with her acting ability. I think her character was written with very little depth other than the obvious. I think its unfortunate because she probably has some acting ability. Academy Award Winner, the legendary Cher should be perfect as the head of the show, a sassy, and jaded club owner. Again...no depth. You can list her characters qualities on one hand. She is still luminescent on screen because...well...she's Cher. Stanley Tucci as usual steals his scenes as Cher's best friend and business partner. Tucci is just such an incredible actor, he can make any role seem better than it is. This is no exception. Peter Gallagher also has a really good role in the film that actually has a little bit of depth but he is way underused but he does a good job with what he is given. The stunning beauty but utterly boring in this film Julianne Hough plays one of the dancers, Georgia. The supporting cast especially the Burlesque girls are utterly wasted and pointless. That's unfortunate too given they hired girls with actual names like Glee's Dianna Agron, and Kristen Bell.<br/><br/>So who is to blame for this potential filled but utterly wasted mess? Director and writer Steve Antin is not a long time professional. He has a few credits to his name but certainly nothing substantial. I think maybe his screenplay lacked depth and he just missed a lot of key emotional elements. How he, or the studio, got the likes of the above actors to join this is a mystery...especially Cher. I have to keep going back to her because she has done some brilliant acting roles (my personal favourite is Mermaids.) This is her first significant role in ten years and she followed it up as the voice of an animal in Zookeeper...what you doing Cher? After this you're gonna wanna turn back time. This will also put a roadblock up against Christina Aguilera's acting career and I just don't think that's fair because this script was not good for anyone. Steer clear of this wreck because there is very little redeemable qualities about it. 4/10"

","Hands up if you love Cher. I love Cher. The gay friend who accompanied me to the screening loves Cher. If you love Cher then you will love Burlesque. If you don't love Cher, don't see Burlesque.<br/><br/>In a recent interview, Cher revealed that she brought her own clothes to set as the costumer's tastes were a little on the sober side. Thank goodness for this; the gay friend and I went to see Cher being Cher, not Cher playing someone who is not Cher, and she delivered. Unbridled adoration aside, Cher belies her facial paralysis to give a camp yet sincere performance as the staunch club mistress. An eyebrow raise is worth a thousand words; and she could have done with fewer words and more eyebrow raises. The writer/director Steven Antin's only saving grace is that the script is so bad, it's good and Cher carries his words off with facetious charm.<br/><br/>The same cannot be said for the lead (for Cher is technically the support) Christina Aguilera. As Ali, the personification of the small- town girl dreaming big cliché, Aguilera is sickly and stiff. She has only ever played herself before on the silver screen and it shows. Obviously complacent in the knowledge that Antin wrote the part for her, Aguilera bats her eyelashes through the first half of the film before letting her abnormal singing ability carry her through the rest. And she's not even as bad as it gets<br/><br/>I'd like to name and shame the casting director responsible for placing Kristin Bell in the second supporting role opposite Cher but there doesn't seem to be one. I can only imagine that Mr Antin himself took on the role with a bevy of assistants, which explains the gargantuan error. Rumour has it that Jessica Biel and Lindsay Lohan were considered for the role. Why it fell to the dry, sexless Bell to perform awkwardly alongside glittering professional dancers I can't imagine. Happily, she seems to be the only bad egg in the mixture of talent that makes up the rest of the basket.<br/><br/>Relative unknown Cam Gigant smolders inoffensively throughout, bringing some light relief to Aguilera's domestic scenes. Alan Cummings sparkles in a couple of well placed cameos, lending an air of retro cabaret in this fluffy nod to the industry. And then there was Stanley Tucci. This man seems to pop up in the most unexpected of roles and in films where they need him the most. Tucci is the thread that holds this film together. He (somehow) feigns a fatherly chemistry with Aguilera and makes all those he converses with shine for a millisecond. He adds some weight to Cher's naturally occurring campiness and makes the audience question whether the film really is awful or if they just don't get it. ""If Stanley Tucci is in it, it MUST be good.""<br/><br/>Failing all else, Burlesque hired Blade Runner's costume designer, so at the very least you can get lost in a blur of sequins and flesh. A trick highlighted by the song Razzle Dazzle from Chicago (a camp musical that actually made money) ""How can they see with sequins in their eyes? Razzle Dazzle them and they'll never catch wise."" Fooled me; I loved it."

","I normally like to watch dark and depressing films with a lot of substance, so every now and then you need a film like ""Burlesque"" to blow away the cobwebs and replace them with flashing lights and catchy tunes for your own entertainment. ""Burlesque"" is the exact opposite to what I normally watch and I loved every minute of it! ""Burlesque"" is a breath of camp fresh air, it's full of life and style. Everything is just a joy to watch, from Christina's raunchy routines to Cher's incredible one-liners, ""Burlesque"" has got it all. The obvious highlight for me has to be the wonderful Cher! She made this film as the stressed-out club owner, giving out some hilarious one-liners like ""How many times have I held your head above the toilet as you threw up everything but your memories"" what does that even mean? It doesn't even make sense and that is why she is just hilarious! Cher's acting is also superb, I've never seen her act before but she is fantastic and very likable indeed.<br/><br/>However, it's not all rosy, because although Cher belts out an incredible power ballad that puts Christina's voice to shame (the bloody Cher wannabee!) Cher only gets to sing two songs! The first one being her in some very risqué clothing for an 80 year old (still looking fresh Cher). This is the Christina show and although she is actually a pretty good actress and bearable singer, she is just no match for Cher. Whenever Christina is on her own your just waiting for your next Cher fix because she has all the best lines and also is THE best character in the film.<br/><br/>""Burlesque"" is also incredibly cliché. It has read all the rom com musicals in the business because ""Burlesque"" is something you could read like a book! but still, this only adds to the entertainment factor and you can't help but enjoy it more because of it.<br/><br/>The directing and cinematography surprised me, with most of the dance and song sequences being filmed really well, and although the plot is something we've all seen before the script is hilarious at times and Stanley Tucci is also funny as Cher's gay friend/colleague.<br/><br/>As I've said, ""Burlesque"" is a hugely enjoyable show, performed on a stage full of likable style and remarkable glitz (whatever that means). It boasts great acting (Cher), catchy songs (Christina), powerful voices (Cher) as well as unintentional hilarious lines. I shouldn't really like this mega camp-fest but I loved every minute of it."

","""Burlesque"" is not so much a bad film as an unnecessary film. The protagonist Ali (Christina Aguillera) walks into the ""Burlesque"" club one day and wants to work there as a dancer. She eventually becomes a dancer who apparently can also sing. Accompanying this plot line is a predictable love affair involving Ali and a love interest, Tess's (Cher) valiant efforts to raise enough money to pay off the mortgage so that the bank does not foreclose on the club (a plot recycled from dozens of other films), the jealous dancer who feels threatened by Ali (saw that before many times), and an evil developer who wants to tear down the club so that he can build a big sky scraper with nice views of the ocean. I suspect that if Ayn Rand was in charge of writing the screenplay, the developer would be the hero in this movie and Tess would be the evil collectivist. If you don't understand the joke, nevermind...<br/><br/>The problem with this film is there is nothing new, or entertaining, about the story line. Or, put another way, if I had to decide whether to make the screenplay for ""Burlesque"" into a movie, I would be asking myself, ""What is the point of turning this script into a movie?"" The other problem with ""Burlesque"" is the set. According to wikipedia, this movie apparent cost $55 million to make. Yet looking at the sets, I have no idea where the money went. The ""Burlesque"" club looks like a cheap strip club where the strippers keep all their clothes on. Yes, that's right folks! Not only are you made to feel cheap going to this ""Burlesque"" club, but you also do not see women getting naked for your pains -- which explains why this movie qualified for PG-13.<br/><br/>The only plus in this film are its occasionally interesting characters. Christina Aguillera's sluttish dancing is always appreciated and a welcome distraction from the film's boring plot. Sadly, though, Aguillera appears to lip sink so much of her singing, contrary to the screenplay's premise that she is the only dancer who sings her own songs. The Cher character can also be interesting, partly because Cher is an interesting person in real life. Stanley Tucci repeats his warm hearted performance as the nice homosexual from films, like ""the Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Easy A,"" and he sort of pulls it off. There is nothing new in Stanley Tucci's performance, but he reminds you of an old friend that you do mind having a chance meeting with now and then. But overall there are better ways that you can spend your two hours than watching ""Burlesque"" -- perhaps by going to a strip club."

","that said, I was expecting the film to be much better. It all seemed so mediocre (script, line delivery, acting, editing etc.) the only thing good about it was the music and now that I have seen it I am no longer upset that it wasn't nominated for the Oscars and other prestigious awards. It just wasn't up to par like CHICAGO, DREAM GIRLS, MOULIN ROUGE or even NINE. Christina Aguilera is the undisputed star of the entire cast and her vocals were flawless, in fact her singing carried the entire film which was otherwise boring and seemed to drag on after a while. I also liked Cher but just like Alan Cumming was hopelessly underused in a genre that they practically own. The guy who played Jack, Ali's(Christina Aguilera's character) love interest needs some serious acting lessons, he was painful to watch in this film, I think his being so self conscious in front of the camera made Christian nervous as well which made their scenes seem so forced, over-rehearsed and wooden.

I take some comfort in this fact, because if not, this'd be the saddest production I've ever seen. Everyone's just trying so hard to be ""sexy."" But the movie actually works perfectly as a parody, even though I have a sneaking suspicion that Both Christina Aguilera and Cher are secretly quite pleased with how they looked on screen.<br/><br/>I actually watched this movie at the request of one of my regular readers. She suspected (and was correct), that I'd have some pretty strong opinions about this little number. It certainly wasn't because she's a huge, secret Cher fan. So, like I said, I'm pretty sure that all the actors in this film were in on the joke. There's an awful lot of mugging for the camera, and general hamming it up. But, don't let that fool you into thinking that this will stop Christina or Cher from trying to nonchalantly out-diva each other throughout the whole film. Those gals are always finding some pretty flimsy excuses to give the audience some full-on, eyes closed, hand in the air, belt-it-out musical numbers. Of course, they always try to shrug these off later on. It's the musical equivalent of, ""Oh, this old thing?"" I guess it's pretty hard to turn off the inner drama queen. But then, these are two of the most notoriously vain women in show business we're dealing with.<br/><br/>Then again, this movie really was designed just to be a vanity piece for these two. The story line is so clichéd and simple that we can safely ignore it, and focus on our leading ladies' glorious voices. Small-town girl moves to Los Angeles to become a star, and with a little dedication, and elbow grease, she rockets to celebrity, saving all the poor, downtrodden souls she meets on the way. And she finds true love too! You've seen it a thousand times before. But, have you seen Christina Aguilera and Cher's version? Have you seen it with sparkly lingerie and tons of bleached out hair? This is a film for die-hard fans only. But that's who it's really designed for anyway. It's just one, big, tongue-in-cheek wink right at both of these ladies' dedicated admirers.

","Christina Aguilera gets help from Cher & a good solid supporting cast of friends to pull off a decent film. There aren't many musical films and there are 2 things this one suffers from. The first is the plot was done in 1930's musicals.<br/><br/>Cher is the nearly bankrupt Burlesque club owner fighting to hold on to her club. She has an offer to sell her club & get out but refuses to do it. Christina is the wide eyed Iowa farm girl who runs away from a waitress job to wait tables and move on up at Cher's club. There is a romance which is played the same as romances were played in classic musicals other than the the new found male nudity shots that are becoming more commonplace in films now.<br/><br/>The second thing that suffers here is the music, while it is good, there are no great songs. We don't have a Jennifer Hudson knockout song like Dream Girls had a few years ago. The lack of a knock out number makes this an OK movie but keeps it from being a great film.<br/><br/>To their credit, the costumes and staging of the numbers is top notch. Cher is carefully used by the camera to try & hide her age by using short sequences of her on camera and using darkness at times to hide her figure which at age 65 or so is not what it once was.<br/><br/>Cher does do two numbers and her voice still hits the notes well. Aguilera sounds great too. We have a good looking musical which kind of doesn't quite cook. At least Cher can start getting her Social Security though I doubt that will bail her out at the bank if she financed this one."

The business is about to be lost due to a real estate developer. But our heroine saves the day, and gets her man! ""Burlesque"" follows this routine cliché to the T! <br/><br/>Ali (Christina Aguilera in her film debut) is from Iowa. She goes to LA and gets entranced by a Burlesque joint owned by Tess (Cher). Tess is problematic because she owes money to her ex-husband (Peter Gallagher) and a real estate developer (Eric Dane) wants her to sell her place to him. Meanwhile, Ali graduates from waitress to back-up dancer to star because of her awesome singing talent. Her friendship with bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet) also graduates from friendship to love. All so predictable! Nothing really to spoil, all the way up to the happy ending.<br/><br/>This thin story gets stretched to two hours because of numerous burlesque song and dance numbers. I am not really fond of this type of entertainment. Christina Aguilera can really sing though. I have seen a concert of hers once, and she had done the same burlesque type numbers already before. Her acting was too shrill and unrealistic. I was not really rooting for her because she came across as cocky and annoying. I did not find any of her songs memorable.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I admire Cher and her voice. My favorite song number from the movie was by Cher, a breathtaking ""You Have Not Seen The Last of Me Yet."" The way it was introduced was a bit forced, but the song is very good. It won the Golden Globe for Best Song, but I wonder why it was not even nominated for an Oscar. She sort of plays herself here, as Tess is an aging star, like her. She did not really need to do any acting.<br/><br/>This is not as bad as ""Glitter"" by any measure.

If you mix ""Flashdance"", ""Coyote Ugly"", ""Cabaret"" and certain elements from ""The devil wears Prada"", you will get ""Burlesque"". The greatness of ""Burlesque"" is that all its clichés joined together make a wonderful story. Every single flaw of the story is fixed thanks to some great musical numbers and with very modern songs. The musical numbers are some of the greatest in modern musical productions.<br/><br/>The story centers on Ali(Aguilera), a girl who goes to L.A to become a star. Then, one night, she finds a club called ""Burlesque"", she goes in and finds a wonderful night club directed by Tess(Cher). Ali falls in love with Jack, a man who works at the club. During the entire movie there is a story about love, jealousy, conflicts, and everything ends with a happy ending.<br/><br/>Aguilera gives an acceptable performance, I mean she can't even reach to the level of Madonna in ""Evita"" and she looks very artificial at times, but she's not bad considering it is her first leading role. Cher and Kristen Bell don't give the best performance ever, actually it looks like they overact at times, but they are fine. The advantage is that for ""Burlesque"" they work perfectly. The movie doesn't need extraordinary characters to work, it actually needs average characters to maintain its magic.<br/><br/>But the thing that rises the movie from being an average musical, to an absolutely charming musical, is its great musical numbers. They are so elegant and modern, so well illuminated and danced, that they are inarguably the best of the film. Aguilera and Cher are both great singers and dancers and, even when their acting is not very good in the film, they sing so well that during their songs you forget that you are watching a movie, you forget about the plot, and you are transported into the magical night club.<br/><br/>The movie might not be the greatest thing ever made, and maybe it deserves the Razzie to worst screenplay, but all its flaws joined together make of it a deserver of the nomination to the Golden Globe to Best Picture Comedy/Musical. The songs, specially ""You haven't seen the last of me"", really deserve an Oscar nomination, at least one of them won a Golden Globe.

","'BURLESQUE': Two Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Over the top musical depicting the glamorous life of a burlesque club in the 70's starring the aging ex-diva Cher and the past her prime pop singer Christina Aguilera. Aguilera is better than Britney Spears and a few other pop stars turned actresses but still not leading woman material. Cher has fun with her role but is uninspired. The film is filled with a much more talented and impressive supporting cast including Kristin Bell, Stanley Tucci, Peter Gallagher, Eric Dane, Cam Gigandet and Alan Cumming (who's performance is slightly reminiscent to Joel Grey's academy award winning turn as the 'Master of Ceremonies' in 'CABARET'). The film is written and directed by Steve Antin.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a failing burlesque club ran by an ex-dancer named Tess (Cher). The club was popular in it's heyday but is now long past it's prime and struggling to stay in business. A local successful businessman (Dane) has offered to buy the club but Tess really doesn't want to give it up. A young girl from Iowa, named Ali (Aguilera), shows up looking to escape her past and falls in love with the burlesque life. She's given a shot at dancing, much too the disappointment of the club's pampered star Nikki (Bell) and the rivalry gets even more heated when Ali shows off her amazing singing voice and breaths new life into the club.<br/><br/>The film is full of big numbers and lavish costumes and set designs but it really doesn't live up to it's promise of a big brash musical. The dialogue is intentionally funny and clever at times but also unintentionally laughable at others and the drama is a joke. The songs are mediocre at best although Aguilera does have a more than decent singing voice. Bell is great as the bitchy villainess and it's nice to see her breaking her type cast and getting away from the goody tushu princesses she usually plays. Although the movie probably would have been much better if her and Aguilera had switched roles. Tucci and Cumming are great as well as the rest of the supporting cast but their admirable effort just isn't enough to save this movie from the trashy musical that it is.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8"
"estebangonzalez10","5","0","1","24 January 2011"," Burlesque barely misses the mark
","¨I'll be back, back on my feet. This is far from over. You haven't seen the last of me.¨ Burlesque is not actually as bad as I expected it to be, but it still has a long way to go if it wanted to revive a dying genre: musicals. Moulin Rouge and Chicago were actually great films and it seemed as if the musical genre was finally going to have a comeback at the beginning of the decade, but in recent years these films have disappointed (with Nine almost burying the genre altogether). We have a long way to go if we want to get back to the glory days of musicals from the 50s and 70s. My favorite musical all time is Oliver! and I just happened to watch that movie a few months ago, so it's a little unfair for me to judge Burlesque under those terms. The problem I have with musicals today is that most of the time the music is not part of the story, they are just there to entertain us and the story is told through acting, while on the other hand before each musical was used to tell the story and served a purpose. In Burlesque there are some good musical performances and fans of Christina Aguilera will probably be satisfied because she has several musical numbers and she is the main protagonist. This is her first acting job and she is not great, but her voice makes up for it and she does a lot of powerful singing. Fans of Cher might not be too excited because she has very little screen time and has only two musical performances (although ¨You Haven't Seen the Last of Me¨ is probably the best one of the movie and should receive an Oscar nomination for Best Song). Burlesque is Steve Antin's first feature film as a director and he also wrote the script for this movie. As a writer he hasn't had a very promising career (Chasing Papi and Glory anyone?), but this is perhaps his best work to date (not much of a compliment however).<br/><br/>We are first introduced to Ali (Christina Aguilera), a waitress from a small town in Iowa who has big dreams and aspirations so she decides to move to Los Angeles. Once in LA she discovers a Burlesque club and immediately falls in love with it. The Burlesque Lounge is run by Tess (Cher) who owns half of the club- the other half belonging to her ex husband Vince (Peter Gallagher). Not everything is working out well for them as they are having great financial troubles and if they don't come up with the money they will have to sell the club. Marcus (Eric Dane) is a very successful businessman (and ladies man for that matter) who wants to buy the lounge for personal reasons, but Tess is not ready to give up on her dream. Ali finds a job in Burlesque as a waitress and befriends Jack (Cam Gigandet), the bartender with whom she moves in with. Ali is waiting for her shot to become one of the Burlesque girls and when the door opens she will stop at nothing to make the best of it. When Tess hears her voice she realizes that the show must revolve around her, but is it enough to save the club? The characters are one dimensional, but I'm guessing most people that go see Burlesque aren't expecting three dimensional characters, they just want to hear these girls sing. In my opinion the burlesque lounge began as one and somehow along the way it got lost and became a Christina Aguilera concert (even the stage seemed to get bigger). The film also seems to resolve itself rather easily by the end. The highlight of the film for me was Stanley Tucci's performance as Sean, the gay Stage Manager. Tucci is such a great actor and we have seen him give some terrific secondary performances before (The Devil Wears Prada) and he does so once again. The funniest moments of the film are thanks to him and he steals absolutely every scene he's in. Burlesque was worth it just for his performance alone, but then I am not a Christina Aguilera nor Cher fan so it did grow tiresome and long at times for me. Cher doesn't seem to have aged at all, she looks the same as she does ever since I can remember. Time seems to pass for everyone except for her. Her song ¨You haven't seen the last of me¨ was my favorite performance from the movie. The movie is about two hours long and after a while you begin to feel the length of the film. I wouldn't recommend this film unless you are a Christina Aguilera fan and in that case you will most probably enjoy her performance.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

He is unstoppable all supporting roles, Burlesque being no exception."

","When I saw the trailer I liked the look of it, it looked like some kind of near copycat version of Chicago, not necessarily as musical, and I was very keen to see the singer with the powerful voice in her first film role. Basically Iowa waitress Alice Marilyn 'Ali' Rose (Christina Aguilera) quits her job and take the money she needs from the till to travel to Los Angeles for a new and more exciting career in singing and dancing. After trying a few places in the newspaper she finds a place on Sunset Boulevard called ""Burlesque"", a bar and club where people do well choreographed dancing, but mime to all the great artists rather than sing themselves. She meets bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet) who points her to the manager of the struggling club, retired dancer but still singer Tess (Cher), she isn't persuaded to give her an audition to be part of the team on stage, but Ali does get a job as waitress. After a while of working there a few people notice Ali around, and soon enough Tess and her ex-husband Sean (Stanley Tucci) are holding auditions for new talent, and she manages to sneak on to try, and eventually the owner gives in and allows her to be a dancer. After being robbed Ali shows up at Jack's apartment asking to stay with him, he accepts, and he proves he may have hidden talent as well as he is a talented musician, but he also has a fiancée. Tess and Sean are trying to sort the financial difficulties, and they are not giving into the offers from Marcus Gerber (Eric Dane) who wants to buy, but Vince (Peter Gallagher) doesn't think they can last much longer. One night when performer Nikki (Forgetting Sarah Marshall's Kristen Bell) turns up drunk and is refused to go on stage, she stops the music that Ali is miming to, and just when Tess starts bringing down the curtain she sings acapella to high appraise. Tess didn't realise how well Ali could sing, and she instantly becomes the star of the new show they will create, and slowly the club gains many more high rolling customers. Despite offering money to buy Burlesque, she starts going out with Marcus, but her true feelings are of course going towards Jack, they have a slightly heated relationship, but they end up in bed together. His fiancée Natalie (Dianna Agron) turns up and catches them, and while parted from him Ali goes to the apartment of Marcus, where she sees a miniature model of a high rise set on what is the location of the Burlesque. Knowing they only have a day and a few hours to save the club, Ali and Tess come up with a way to stop anyone buying the club and them losing it, by telling the owner of large apartment buildings that he will lose his view if he doesn't help fund the club, so he does and the money goes to Vince to buy him out, and Ali and Jack kiss and make up before a final performance. Also starring Julianne Hough as Georgia and Alan Cumming as Alexis. Cher hasn't had a good role since Tea with Mussolini, look at Stuck on You, so a good return, and Aguilera with her brilliant voice and dancing talent makes a fantastic debut, and the supporting members of cast, especially Tucci are good too. A critic described this as Showgirls, without the constant removal of clothes of course, but this is much better than that, with great songs, including the title song from Aguilera, performed on The X Factor, and power ballad ""You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me"", a good musical drama. It is nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, Best Original Song for ""Bound to You"" and Best Original Song for ""You Haven't Seen The Last of Me"". Worth watching!"

","Being a Christina Agulera and Cher fan, the prospect of this film, and the trailer really enticed me to go and see it, however I was bitterly disappointed. Where the film really excels is on the stage. The dance routines are well choreographed and staged and do have an air of excitement about them, however once the heftier dialogue scenes took place you can see that neither the script nor the storyline have legs.<br/><br/>The characters were very two-dimensional especially from the younger cast. Agulera's character didn't even seem to transition as she went from place to place, through each struggle. She played a so sweet she'd rot your teeth small town girl, with a big brain and big talent and her aggressive outbursts were laughable. Clearly Agulera does have a talent, which was over showcased, for singing. Her acting ability needs more work, her chemistry with the insanely good looking Cam Gigandet was as flat as the glass of coke thats been by my bed for 2 weeks. Other performers also failed to shine, Stanly Tucci who I am a fan of played his usual gay character with little enthusiasm and Kirsten Bell acting her abysmal dialogue as best she could.<br/><br/>Cher clearly had the best character to work with, and played it reasonably well, and though with an inferior voice to Agulera, her numbers were a nice break from the excessive use of Agulera. Her face, however is so frozen in time that her acting ability is marred by the lack of expression her face can muster.<br/><br/>The storyline was extremely weak and some of the scenes in the movie seemed to come straight out of the far superior Cabaret, starring Liza Minelli. Even though musicals don't have to have amazing story lines, it at least has to try and make the one it has as enjoyable as possible. Too much was crammed in. Several love affairs, the financial difficulties of the club, rivalry between the girls, hidden talents and friendships. Choosing one or two paths may have made this film far better, but it tried to fill too much into its excessive running time. The songs in the film though enjoyable were a little uninspired, and with Christina Agulera singing virtually every number they all start to sound a little too similar.<br/><br/>All in all I really would not recommend this film, good song and dance sequences cannot lift this film from mediocrity and below. I went in knowing Christina Agulera had a good voice, I came out knowing nothing of the contrary. A little more scope and storyline could have made this film a whole lot more enjoyable. Instead I recommend watching Chicago or Cabaret again."

","I must say I have never seen Christine Aguilera sing and dance like this-she was absolutely fabulous-what a voice! And she danced with the athleticism and skill of the best of Broadway, as did all of her supporting cast. Cher's voice as portrayed seems to be holding up well, and she played her role with sophistication and style. The plot is the same old same old girl leaves small Iowa town to go to Hollywood and be discovered, but frankly no one cares abut the plot given that the singing and dancing are so utterly spectacular! The music was surprisingly original, at least to this reviewer, and served to showcase the lead voices well. The choreography was suggestive, exhilarating, and slick as would befit the venue in which it was performed. We just went to see this movie because it was raining and we couldn't play golf, but we wound up talking about the cast performances all the way home. Go see it!!"
"preppy-3","7","0","3","9 December 2010"," Was it good? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes:)
","Obvious story of beautiful talented singer Ali (Christina Aguilera) moving from Iowa to Los Angeles to find fame and fortune. She (almost immediately) finds a job as a bartender in a bar called Berlesque Lounge run by Tess (Cher). She quickly becomes a top singer in the bar and is romanced by hot hunky roommate Jack (Cam Gigandet) and rich Marcus (Eric Dane). Totally obvious complications follow. It leads to an ending with EVERYBODY happy--and had me smirking at the screen:)<br/><br/>OK--this is a terrible movie--there's no two ways about it. The plot is ridiculously obvious and topped by truly horrendous dialogue. There's also incredible leaps of logic--Jack is as bartender but then we see him playing piano in the band. He can do both at once??? Also Ali's rise to fame is ridiculously fast. The acting is terrible. Gigandet is a good actor--but you'd never know it from this. However the guy has NOTHING to work with. His brief nude scene is nice though:) Aguilera can sing and dance--but can't act. Some of her attempts at acting were embarrassing. Cher seems unable to move a muscle in her face. I love her but she's had TOO many face lifts! Alan Cumming,Peter Gallagher and hunky Eric Dane were shamefully underused in small roles.<br/><br/>On the up side--the singing and dancing (and there was a LOT of both) were great! The songs were good and the dancers (male and female) were good-looking and full of energy. The last number is a true show stopper. Stanley Tucci is GREAT as the gay club manager. He easily throws off one liners in a hilarious manner. And also Gigandet is ridiculously attractive (and blows equally hot Dane off the screen). And, best of all, the dance numbers weren't edited by somebody who is ADD addicted. The camera actually stands still a few times and you can SEE the dances.<br/><br/>So--is it good? No...but I had a fun time watching it. The singing and dancing WAS incredible. I give it a 7 for that alone...and Gigandet:)"
"jonnyhavey","5","0","1","8 December 2010"," Glamour and Tucci
","""Burlesque"" is a musical drama that relies on glamorous costumes (or lack there of) combined with pretty women to captivate audiences. The songs are kind of bland throughout and because the girls' job at the Burlesque Lounge is literally lip sink to all of the classic songs no one is able to shine. Cher's character Tess gets a couple shots and really owns one of them while Christina Aguilera's character Ali is given numerous opportunities to sing. However, with only one star the rest of the girls are left behind in the shadows. The basic plot of the film begins as Ali quits her job in a small town in Iowa and moves to Los Angeles to make her singing and dancing dream come true. She has a lot of trouble at first, but finally finds Tess's Burlesque Lounge. There she meets a bartender named Jack (Cam Gigandet), Tess's gay studio partner Sean (Stanley Tucci), a snotty dancer named Nikki (Kristen Bell) and a very wealthy man named Marcus (Eric Dane). Rejected by Tess initially to join the show, Ali begs Jack to let her be a waitress for the Lounge. The Lounge is in great financial trouble and is going to be bought by Marcus if something cannot be done. Eventually Ali gets her shot and as her career starts flourishing the big question is if Ali, Sean and Tess are going to be able to save the Burlesque Lounge from Marcus's plans? Also, who will Ali fall in love with Marcus or Jack?<br/><br/>The glamour of the film is undoubtedly the best part of the film and is very extensive and glamorous. The costumes exemplify exactly the kind of film that it is and are elaborate enough to brighten up the screen. The dancing and choreography is very good as well. And yes Christina Aguilera owns the screen when she is singing, dancing, and performing. Cher also very good, but she does not get as much screen time as she should. Kristen Bell is in familiar territory with her role that is almost a mirror image of her Sarah Marshall character. However, the standouts in the film are the three main males; Cam Gigandet, Eric Dane, and Stanley Tucci. They are able to shine through the estrogen filled screen with very good performances. Stanley Tucci is on top of his game year after year and this film is no different.<br/><br/>The flare of the film is gone when the characters are not on performing in the Lounge causing the film to rely on Christina Aguilera's acting ability with little snippets of Cher and the three males as stated above. Aguilera does a much better job than other singers turned actress, however, the film is too much about her and only her forcing her to act more than she should have. It isn't even her fault that the film tends to struggle outside of its musical center because unlike Musicals like Chicago, Moulin Rouge or even last year's Nine (that probably wasn't as good as Burlesque) the film does not carry over the magic of the musical genre when outside the Lounge. The film breaks entirely out of the musical genre away from the light and color spectacle and becomes just another drama without the magic and mystery of music.<br/><br/>A very entertaining film while in the Lounge, but the magic is lost once the actresses get off the stage and the performances of the film's males in a drama setting take over. This makes the film something that its not, but allows a man like Stanley Tucci a chance to show off a little bit. Therefore, ""Burlesque"" is not the must see musical of the season, however, it is the only musical and its more entertaining than last year's NINE. However, save some money wait for the dollar theaters or wait a little longer for DVD."
"zinjo","6","0","3","1 December 2010"," From Great to WTF?
","The first half of this film struck me as a pleasant throw back to the classic movie musicals of old. A familiar structure, where a love story is set at a theatre which gives the film its excuses to perform the musical numbers. It was refreshing NOT to see yet another Broadway show brought to the big screen. All the performances were solid and Christina Aguilera's freshman effort was particularly note worthy.<br/><br/>Then the wheels fall off (Another example where a writer/director needs a second pair of objective eyes taking a pass at their script before shooting begins). The second half almost literally looses its identity. The love story is well set up with effective dramatic tensions between the two reluctant lovers and the rival suitor. Then it is inexplicably abandoned for a sub-plot about Tess loosing her club. Suddenly the club becomes the focus for the climax, WHY?! The resolution of that particular problem was clever, but it turned the whole love story into some sort of well written / performed McGuffin, which annoyed this viewer and was such a dis-service to the performances of Aquilera, Gigandet and Dane.<br/><br/>The second half musical numbers were glorified music videos that paled in comparison to the outstanding staged numbers earlier in the film. The only redemption to this lack of imagination was the amazing closing number that resurrected that classic ""show"" style we saw at the beginning. What made these music video offerings palatable was Aguilera's outstanding stage performances. Something she is very comfortable with.<br/><br/>I am not sure why Kristen Bell was brought in to play Nikki. Yes she did a great job, but such talent was largely wasted in a peripheral role that was barely fleshed out. Later in the film we surprisingly find out that Nikki had been a long time friend to Tess and with her from the beginning of the club's opening. Yet that idea rang very hollow when one considers Cher's age compared to Bell's.<br/><br/>Beware of the ""DRUNK CAM""!! It was most noticeable during the heavy dialogue scenes in Tess's office and in the parking lot scene between Nikki and Tess. Whoever convinced Antin that giving the audience the POV of a drunken dwarf was a good idea should have been FIRED! What a distracting and annoying bit of camera work that was. Why would anyone deliberately distract the audience from the action in a scene with a bobbing and weaving camera?? <br/><br/>Christina gave us a strong sense that she can act and with more training and experience, I think she will become a talent worth seeing. She might wish to take the route Justin Timberlake has taken with his acting. Take on smaller roles to build up experience and get exposure to more seasoned actors . Build up a strong skill set before taking on a lead role again. This film played to her strengths, but if she is serious about acting she needs to further develop her craft to be capable of doing a variety of roles with convincing depth.<br/><br/>For a film to start out so well and crash so dramatically by the climax is a bit of a tragedy in my opinion. The set up was nearly flawless, the love story well thought out (though not perfect) and paced, early musical numbers were very entertaining, but the final act left the audience feeling cheated with an impotent conclusion to the dominant love story and a confusing focus switch to Tess's business troubles.<br/><br/>After seeing her performance, I hope Ms.Aguilera continues her acting pursuits as I believe she would do well if she further trains and gains experience in the craft."
