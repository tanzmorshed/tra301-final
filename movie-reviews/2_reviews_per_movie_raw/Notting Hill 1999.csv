"Chrysanthepop","Null","66","73","26 June 2007"," Brit Wit Rom Com in one of London's most famous districts
","After reading the synopsis, 'Notting Hill' sounds like just another melodramatic Julia Roberts rom com. Fortunately, that ain't the case. 'Notting Hill' is fun, sweet, intelligent and  well, simply said, very entertaining. London's Notting Hill does seem like a street you'd like to walk on.<br/><br/>While the storyline itself is larger than life, the characters are real. There is no overt melodrama. We can see that Curtis put a lot of heart and some Brit wit humour into the writing. After meeting William, Anna, Spike, Max, Bella and Honey, we, as audience, really connect to these very interesting characters and care about them. The table discussion in Honey's birthday scene shows how all the characters connect. While a nervous Anna, is new to the group, we see that she eventually gets a hang of them and feels comfortable enough to talk about herself.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant isn't anything different from his other rom coms. Julia Roberts is brilliant. I never liked any of her romantic comedies (e.g. Pretty Woman, I Love Trouble, Something to Talk About etc) but 'notting Hill is an exception. She gives a subtle portrayal as hugely famous but very vulnerable Anna Scott and does full justice. This indeed is one of her finest performances. Rhys Ifans as Spike is standout! While Tim McInnerny, Emma Chambers, Hugh Bonneville and Gina McKee (love her) are excellent. McKee's comedy is extremely subtle and her character is one of the most appealing. She underplays her part with tremendous grace and maturity.<br/><br/>All the actors share a very warm chemistry that just keeps adding on to its quality. The relationship and friendship between the characters is shown in a very sensitive way. While Spike and William are roommates who just seem to get along, we know that they like each other. Also William is about to cancel a date with the world's most famous actress to attend his sister's birthday party. The relationship between Max and Bella is beautiful.<br/><br/>Additional credit must be given to Coulter's amazing cinematography and the visuals. Watch the scene where Thacker is walking through the market and we see the weather change (indicating the passing time). There's a beautiful soundtrack that recites the moods of the scenes. And last but not least, thanks to Roger Mitchell for putting it all together to tell us this sweet entertaining story."
"SteveReed007","10","138","165","9 February 2000"," Sparkling romance at a deliberate British pace
","It may be a paradox to say that a film can sparkle slowly, yet that's the only way I can describe this charming romantic comedy. The star(dom)-crossed lovers don't know that they are Meant For Each Other ... yes, this is the standard RomCom setup. But the -way- they don't know? That is put across in a most British and deliberate pace and setting. And it makes the ending that we all know is coming gather color and charm.<br/><br/>""Notting Hill"" takes over a third of its running time to show William (Hugh Grant) as he is immersed in his daily life, wanting to be supportive of his friends, yet searching for his own inner life. The five closest friends all show something he lacks: ""happy"" conformity, a loving marriage transcending obstacles, a sister who takes bold risks for finding love, and a roommate that sees through pretense and says so (and, yes, is delightfully vulgar).<br/><br/>That very British character-in-a-wry-setting pattern borrows from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" but the only friends there that I could consistently believe -mattered- to Grant's character were the gay couple, one comic, the other showing profound emotion. Here, all of the lead character's circle deeply cares about him, as he does about them. This makes all the difference.<br/><br/>Where it matters most is in giving him support when the American film beauty (Julia Roberts) comes into his life, then out, then in, then ... and all in ways that are believable for such dissimilar lovers. The romantic turns are more plausible because Grant's character has such support and a place for sharing his emotional roller-coaster ride. He isn't crushed by the down moments, but picks up his individuality and moves on. And his friends tell him, sometimes with only searching looks, just when he's picked up -too much- of being on his own. (Okay, the moment towards the end when Spike puts his exasperation into three pointed, even vulgar, words is a refreshing change. Sometimes, when a friend lets loose with the pithy truth, it hits the needed spot.)<br/><br/>All this backstory, character richness, and pointed use of the ""right"" words are British qualities that we don't get with the standard American RomCom setup.<br/><br/>Gina McKee's turn here as Grant's wheelchair-bound female friend is of someone with deeply felt individuality and unique perceptiveness, including her own tender perspective on loves past and present - especially her husband. It's a glimpse into a woman with distinctive qualities that -she- has chosen. This makes her both appealing to all her friends, and forceful by quiet understatement. She also ends up being much funnier, when you've rewound the tape and end up thinking about the story. (Listen for her spoken turn on ""standing up."" No, it's not a cheap play on her limitations. Not in context. And that's subtle comic acting.)<br/><br/>Richard Curtis's inventive screenplay is one of the best in years, and would reward a look in book form as well. He takes this backdrop of supportive friends, puts in the sparkle of Roberts invading and shaking up their world, and creates a skein of personal truths and imposed celebrity nonsense.<br/><br/>Grant and Roberts are both passionate and bemused observers of the absurdities of fame that end up surrounding them, but they act this out in comic byplay and inventive responses. This isn't an American breakneck-pace (or ""screwball"") comedy, and their subtle discovery of each other's -minds- and substance wouldn't work in such a setting.<br/><br/>Roberts has both the easy familiarity with and the hair-trigger of frustration from fame, both coming out to undermine her when she least expects it. But she shows that she can grow and learn from her mistakes. (Unlike her well-acted but overexplained realization at the end of ""Runaway Bride."") She even has one scene -sans- makeup that is a genuine romantic turning point. I don't see many other actresses being willing to try that.<br/><br/>Grant shows an astonishing inner strength and self-awareness, not being willing to hide how -he- sees reality. (He did the same realistic turn in ""Four Weddings,"" but didn't try nearly as effectively to figure himself out.)<br/><br/>The photography and settings show off London beautifully, and the story's interior scenes make highly imaginative use of a narrow, stacked-up Notting Hill mini-townhouse.<br/><br/>I do feel the director fails to take up some opportunities to build on the comic or dramatic moments in the screenplay. He coasts on the words. They're excellent words, but they need a twist at times.<br/><br/>My only take-off-a-point[*] quibble is with the music. It's mostly popular tunes that underscore the action. One of these is luminous, and frames the story perfectly - Elvis Costello's cover of ""She."" Others, though, use their lyrics to overstress plot points. Some are performed too high in volume, sometimes lapping against dialogue.<br/><br/>(The two original themes by Trevor Jones are beautiful, lushly written, and quite fitting to the main characters. We should have had more of his work, but they're less than a fourth of the film's music.)<br/><br/>The British often put more creativity below the narrative surface and into the setting than Americans do, and often get beyond formula. To discover this in a film is joyous. You'll feel this when you find yourself compelled to see this deeply felt, yet very funny, film twice, thrice, or more. For me, it's still delightful after nine months and nine viewings.<br/><br/>[* Edited on 21 April 2011: After another decade and another ten viewings, this love story has only become more resonant and beautiful. The pop-song choices feel notably less obtrusive. The acting of both Roberts and Grant has evinced more depth. And I see no reason to not give it a full 10 rating.]"
"JamesHitchcock","7","124","149","17 December 2004"," Warm and Human British Comedy
","Notting Hill is a district of west London that was built as a fashionable Victorian suburb, became very run down during the mid twentieth century and is now once again fashionable, but which retains a distinctly cosmopolitan atmosphere, with London's biggest street market and many small specialist shops. (My wife and I sometimes go there to shop for bargains). The hero of the film, William Thacker, is the owner of one of these shops, a travel bookshop. The film concerns the romance which develops between William and a young woman named Anna Scott whom he meets when she comes into his shop.<br/><br/>As another reviewer has pointed out, 'Notting Hill' is based around a theme, love between people of unequal social standing, which has provided literature with some of its greatest works, both comic and serious, dating back at least to the tale of King Cophetua and the beggar-maid. Although many of these stories tell of a poor but honest lad who aspires to the hand of a princess or titled lady, Anna is not part of the Royal Family or the British aristocracy. She rather belongs to an even more exclusive elite, the Hollywood starocracy. She is a hugely popular film star who earns at least $15,000,000 per film, and pops into William's shop during a brief stay in London to publicise her latest movie. <br/><br/>Although Anna is played by a real-life Hollywood superstar, Julia Roberts, the film is very typically British. William is similar to an number of other Hugh Grant characters, being a shy, diffident middle-class Englishman, probably public-school and university educated. (Despite this background, he is not particularly wealthy following a divorce from his first wife and is forced to share his lodgings with an eccentric Welsh flatmate, Spike). The humour of the film, particularly the dinner-party banter between William and his friends, is mostly of the typically ironic, self-deprecating variety popular in Britain, especially in middle-class circles. Rhys Ifans's Spike, by contrast, typifies another strand of British humour, the eccentric zaniness found in the likes of 'Monty Python'. Spike's strong provincial accent suggests a more working-class background; this possibly accounts for the teasing that he has to put up with from the other characters, although he takes it all in good part. <br/><br/>William may be diffident, self-deprecating and unsuccessful, but he is probably the stronger of the two main characters. Anna is beautiful and successful, but underneath it all she is insecure, worried about losing her fame and fortune and about her inability to form lasting relationships with men. Early on in the film she has another boyfriend, Jeff, but it is clear that he is only the latest in a long string of unsatisfactory romances which have left her emotionally (and in some cases physically) bruised. The scene where Anna says to William 'I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her' is the one where we see her at her most vulnerable. Although both characters are in their late twenties or thirties, it is noteworthy that Anna refers to 'girl and boy' rather than 'woman and man'. Anna's vulnerability also comes through in her reaction in the scene where hordes of paparazzi appear on William's doorstep; William tries to play down the incident, and Spike finds it hugely amusing, but Anna is horrified. (The film was made shortly after the death of Princess Diana; this scene possibly reflects British disgust with the antics of the paparazzi, who were regarded as being partly to blame for the Princess's death). Like others, I found myself wondering how much Anna's personality reflects Julia Roberts's own; she too has had a number of unhappy relationships. <br/><br/>Important roles are also played by Tim McInnerny and Gina McKee as William's best friend Max and his disabled wife Bella; the love of this ordinary couple for each other provides a more realistic, down-to-earth counterpart to the fairy-tale romance of William and Anna, helping to anchor the film more firmly in reality. The main charm, however, lies in the relationship of the two main characters, as Anna comes to realise that the seemingly ordinary William has a kindness and decency which count for more than the monstrous egos of Jeff and his like. Like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', which was also written by Richard Curtis and starred Hugh Grant, 'Notting Hill' is one of the warmest and most human British films of the nineties. 7/10"

"roghache","8","16","17","16 March 2006"," Sparkling fairy tale romance, film star meets ordinary bookseller
","Whether or not realistic, this is a wonderfully touching fairy tale like story of the romance between two people of unequal social and financial standing. The beautiful, rich, and famous American movie star is superbly captured by the incomparable and always endearing Julia Roberts, who brings such a wonderful vulnerability to her roles. Hugh Grant is perfect as the shy, stammering, bumbling, unassuming, obscure, and not very affluent London bookseller, who shares a flat with his zany, weird roommate, Spike.<br/><br/>The tale revolves around the world's most famous actress, Anna Scott, who visits a Notting Hill travel bookshop and thereby meets the very ordinary British bookseller, William Thacker. Improbable as it might seem, the two fall in love despite the fact that Anna already has a 'significant other' in the form of the obnoxious star, Jeff, who treats her poorly. Alas, Anna and William's romance is of course subject to hounding by the ubiquitous media, making the course of true love definitely not run smooth.<br/><br/>Just an aside, but did the screenwriters get Hugh Grant's character's name from the Victorian novelist, William Makepeace Thackeray? It seems quite a coincidence. Ha, ha. Anyway, nice name...<br/><br/>The film does a marvelous job conveying what must resemble Julia Roberts' own fishbowl life, subject to constant media scrutiny and innuendo. She must have identified strongly with the character she was playing, not only the media nuisance but also the failed relationships so common among film stars. Her hounding by the paparazzi is also of course reminiscent of that plaguing the late Princess Diana, and of course, sadly, resulting in her death.<br/><br/>The portrayal of William's friends is very touching here, as their reaction transforms from understandable awe at socializing with such a famous star, to accepting and treating Anna as basically an ordinary person and good friend. The viewer gets a sense of how much this response, this genuine friendship means to Anna. One of William's friends is a disabled wife in a wheelchair. Her normal, ordinary life and attitude are well captured and would be well received, I believe, by viewers with physical disabilities.<br/><br/>The love story is beautifully depicted. The sadness of Anna's failed past romantic involvements is conveyed, and despite the fame, her vulnerability as being really just 'an ordinary girl in love with an ordinary boy'. The portrayal of William is touching, as he copes with all the media attention, sees the actual person behind all that fame, wealth, and glamour, and tries to give Anna the genuine security and the 'ordinary life' she so desperately craves. A fabulous, moving, and ultra romantic film with a relevant message regarding modern society's perception and treatment of its movie stars. We can all learn a lesson here."

","Notting Hill proves one thing -- jokes lie in the oddest places.  This film is an excellent vehicle for Julia Roberts to put her own life as an actress under the microscope.  While Roberts' ""Anna Scott"" character isn't an autobiographical figure, the Scott character allows for some biting satire at the life of Roberts herself.  Need I mention some excellent one liners in the film like the sister of Hugh Grant... ""I feel like we are sisters"", an excellent throw-back to ""My Best Friend's Wedding""...  or my favourite, a discussion about nude body doubles just before a nude Julia Roberts (or a Julia Roberts body double) crosses the screen.<br/><br/>Apart from the small bit of satire, Grant's character plays on the emotions of every guy who has ever unexplainably fell in to, threw orange juice-on, lost out on, and fell back in to love.  Roberts character can only help us understand how such a relationship as the one her and Grant share in the movie, could be ""Surreal, but nice.""<br/><br/>A sweet film surely not to be missed!"

","Visually lovely, ""Notting Hill"" becomes an enchanting fairy tale.....a magical and endearing love story, from the opening credits to an afternoon of quiet sharing in a London park.  Being a romantic at heart, I was emotionally drawn to this well produced and entertaining motion picture, enticing me to view it a number of times more.<br/><br/>Some friends have indicated that the ""plot"" is boring and in 2 hours and 4 minutes takes too long to come to an expected conclusion.  But the lyrical chemistry between William Thacker (Hugh Grant) and Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) give intimate glimpses into the human heart and spirit. As in Mary Poppins when Burt jumps into the chalk sidewalk drawing, I longed to join this tapestry of two people falling in love, among caring friends and relatives.  To longingly look into Anna's eyes and to see a reflection of your very own soul of hope and humanity may seem less than exciting to some people.....too involved in their fast paced, action world and who fail to see the beauty of life around them....to smell the roses.<br/><br/>Watching the inflections of Julia Robert's face became a mesmerizing cinema experience.  And Hugh Grant's thoughtful and honest, yet quirky presence gave hope to what could be possible. Then wrap all this with a humorous, loving and insightful group of friends and family......WOW!<br/><br/>After watching ""Notting Hill"" with my wife and giving her a big hug, I saw that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, wanting to be loved!<br/><br/>What greater joy of meaning can be given by a film?<br/><br/>""Teach me the Magic of Wonder, Give me the Spirit to Fly"" - John Denver"

","Julia Roberts is the queen of Romantic Comedies. Her iconic role in Pretty Woman should give her the title alone, but she's been in tons, some good while others weren't. However, she chose a good one in Notting Hill. <br/><br/>Notting Hill is a sweet, good-natured romantic comedy that succeeds on every level it is trying to be. The story is well-written and more original then it may come off from the trailers. This is a film about movie stars that actually have meaningful conversations about being movie stars. Hugh Grant is also dashing in the leading man role. Roberts actually gives best ""Rom-Com"" performance here, aside from the Oscar-Nominated, Pretty Woman. She restrains herself and isn't loud or obnoxious, just true to the character. This is some of her most underrated work. <br/><br/>With beautiful shots of London and a sweeping romance, Notting Hill is an example for future romantic comedies. I only had one problem: there is a huge gap in the middle where Roberts is off in America. I understood it was important to the story, but it didn't have to last 20 minutes. This is her story as much as it Grant's, but the writers put her on the back-burner. <br/><br/>While the ending is predictable, it's sweet and makes you smile. Wonderful film; 8.5"
"bacooda","9","48","60","20 February 2007"," A modern Cinderella tale with English charm and humour
","Can lightning strike twice? Well with writer Richard Curtis it has! I understand he wrote this screenplay and completed it before he realised just how similar it was to his previous hit, Four Weddings and a Funeral.<br/><br/>Let's examine this a second: Hugh Grant is the hero; There's an elusive and glamorous American that he falls for; He has a circle of friends, each in their own way a success AND a failure in life, and yet Hugh's character (William Thacker) is somehow trailing them all; there's the kooky yet endearing sister; the character with a tragic disability; a complete buffoon of a sidekick; and several near-misses.<br/><br/>Yet it's all so thoroughly entertaining, AGAIN. It's like a delicious dish, and its recipe for success is cooked up time and again by Curtis as Jamie Oliver's older and wiser brother.<br/><br/>As a single bloke in this day and age I AM William Thacker, and I AM Charles in Four Weddings. So on the one hand you'll have parts of the audience identifying with the hero, and parts of the audience wanting the hero to be their real-life partner. Yet character empathy alone is not enough to carry a film.<br/><br/>The path that the hero follows needs to be a roller-coaster ride. Sometimes it's up, sometimes it's down, but it's never boring. In fact, the pacing is assuredly steady just as, in one excellent scene, we see the indication of time passing in an extremely effective way. I feel that Curtis learnt from Four Weddings and tightened the strings on the time line in this movie. Where Four Weddings very occasionally crawls, Notting Hill paces along assuredly.<br/><br/>In addition, our hero's roller-coaster ride must be believable. Could this really happen? Why not? Do movie stars ALWAYS fall for other celebrities? <br/><br/>So what of the performances? Well Hugh Grant is really Hugh Grant (again) in this role. But isn't that why we go to see Hugh Grant movies? He's funny yet tragic, vulnerable yet assured, and I can't imagine anyone else playing William.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts is one of those stars who, love her or hate her, delivers in every role. She's very believable as Anna Scott, showing the resolute public charm of a movie star, whilst exposing the hidden human frailty behind Hollywood's finest. And this despite the undoubted (and wholly false) criticism that she's simply playing a movie star like she in fact is. She perhaps COULD have leaned back and simply ambled through the movie expecting it to be an easy role for her, but in a truly professional manner, she's sought to add depth and weight to her character.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast sparkle in their roles, most notably Rhys Ifans as Spike. But even without the requisite comedy set pieces that Rhys revels in, actors of class such as Tim McInnerny, James Dreyfus, Gina McKee, Emma Chambers and Hugh Bonneville expertly fill in the no-less important landscape of this joyous and warm piece of art.<br/><br/>Watch out, too, for memorable cameos by Alec Baldwin, Mischa Barton and Matthew Modine.<br/><br/>So who is Cinderella and who is the Prince? At first glance William is the hopeful nobody. But really, as the story develops, we'll see that there are two character's dreams unfolding in Notting Hill.<br/><br/>Why then not 10 out of 10? Well, full marks would have been ME starring as William Thacker... ;)"

","This film was surprisingly good, not my favourite romantic comedy in the world, and personally I think Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral are better. But it is a good film, thanks to the strong performances, fresh script and the film's look. While not laugh out loud funny, Notting Hill is nonetheless warm and charming. The script is fresh, sometimes funny, sometimes insightful. The part where Anna says ""I am just a girl, standing in front of a boy, waiting for him to love her"", may be cringe worthy to some people, but for me no matter how clichéd it is it shows a vulnerable side to Anna's character. The film is based on love revolved around unequal social standing, William being diffident and unsuccessful, Anna being the complete opposite. The photography is fabulous and the direction is excellent. Hugh Grant is charming as William and Julia Roberts is positively luminous as Anna, and the two have strong chemistry. Out of the supporting performers, Rhys Ifans stands out in a very zany turn as Spike. The music is lovely too. All in all, this is very warm, charming and pleasant, yeah the ending is predictable, but this is a well written and quite irresistible film. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"shevaunhodge","10","8","8","5 April 2019"," British films are the best
","Such a heart warming film. Yes the story line is cheesy, but you end up loving it. This is probably because Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are so talented and pull of their rolls so well . They also have two other very famous actors that are brilliant. These people being Emma Chamber and Rys Ifan. Also, from what I can read on google most of the other actors are very famous and talented also which probably also adds the how good the film is. The meaning behind the story is that just because someone is famous doesn't mean they are not normal like everyone else. Like Anna Scott states in the film, she says something like ""The whole fame thing is fake really. I'm just a girl who likes a boy"". This film will send a much needed message to young people these days that famous people are just normal people and are no different to anybody else. Yes there are benefits to being famous making lots of money, meeting other famous people, doing all the things you dreamed of. However, the down falls can have dramatic effects on the person. I mean if you were famous you could't just go out for a casual stroll with your hair a mess and no makeup on because you would probably end up with your face plastered all over some silly magazine and this film highlights this. This film is heart warming with also a good humor all the way through. You must see it."

I was not disappointed.  <br/><br/>Hugh Grant's jittery, bumbling charm has never been more endearing.  The vulnerability Grant infuses into his character is definitely his best quality, and it's perfectly understandable that he might decline the opportunity to date a megastar actress out of trepidation.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts' legions of fans will not be let down by her character.  It's dead-on Julia.  But those who are not among her fans will be slowly but surely won over by the honesty and directness of the character.  I don't care what your testosterone quotient is, there won't be a dry eye in the house when she almost whispers, nervous smile masking the hurt, that she's ""just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.""<br/><br/>The story is by the writer of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones' Diary, so it's a sure bet from the start.  But Grant and Roberts take what might have been a slightly weak treatment and make it sparkle.<br/><br/>
I get so sick of everyone who pooh-pooh's a happy ending because it's somehow so unbelievable that things ever work out right.  Instead we demand tear jerker disappointment at every turn and end up with Kevin Costner drowning like a sacrificial lamb at the end of Message in a Bottle to satisfy our lust for tragedy.  I love it when things work out well in my life, and sometimes I like to see films about things working out.

",">  After suffering a divorce, a marriage between a best friend and an ex-lover, not to mention living with a complete slob for a roommate, travel bookstore owner William (Hugh Grant) was just trying to live a peaceful existence in Notting Hill, England with his disastrous lovelife and a fledgling bookstore.  When American film megastar Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) comes in to browse for books about Turkey, the two sense a mutual attraction and begin a delicate love affair that threatens both their complicated lives.  The crux of ""Notting Hill"" is this : can two exact opposites in the complex world of publicity and disposable relationships stay together forever? Screenwriter Richard Curtis's (""Four Weddings And A Funeral"") goal this time around seems to be a sharp satire of the Hollywood starlets and their psychotic relationships with the public and themselves, and the old wacky English humour we've come to expect from any film with Mr. Grant.  It's a very odd mixture of the audience-pleasing easy comedy and something more sinister - possibly due to both lead's past public lives.  He creates two compelling characters in Anna and Garrett.  They both have very convincing motives for the courtship, it isn't just a roll in the hay and then the aftermath like most films.  Director Roger Michell keeps the flow nice and the two leads make good on their promise for charm and beauty. I'm a little irritated that so many would consider this a big step for Julia Roberts in the acting department.  She already gave a commanding performance in last year's ""Stepmom"".  With ""Hill"", Roberts continues her impressive growth spurt into real adult acting and role choices.  Her work with Grant here is the most easy going I've even seen her do(Maybe one too many close-ups of that smile though...).  Hugh Grant does his stammering best to make William seem lovable.  I'm not a fan of Mr. Grant, but I will easily concede that this is his best performance to date.  Rhys Ifans is disgusting (a good thing) as Spike, William's flatmate.  He brings some very much needed brevity to the proceedings.  If anyone ever needs an actor to represent an English skuzzball, they should call this guy. If the charming ""Notting Hill"" suffers from anything it might be the ""She's All That"" syndrome.  Whenever you get the relationship ball rolling, it seems in everyone of these movies we need a forced situation to break up the two leads, just so we can cheer when they reconcile.  That's fine, no complaints.  In ""Hill"", this syndrome is put to the extreme test.  We follow this romance through, I believe, at least three breakups.  That's too many for a two hour film.  We never get sure footing on to why these two should be together and that is a frustrating element.  Director Michell tries to hold onto the reins, but the climax of the film is forced and seriously uncharacteristic of the movie. ""Notting Hill"" has a lot to say about fame and the effects of it on a life. It never bothers to take a stand or really explain if Roberts's character embraces her superstardom or is oppressed by it.  Screenwriter Curtis makes compelling arguments for both sides of the debate but strays away from truly looking deep within the fishbowl. When you think about it, William was a fan of Anna before meeting her, yet that subject seems too taboo for the film. What we get is just puppy love, no strings.<br/><br/>""Notting Hill"" is an extremely charming film with so much love to offer. It's a concoction that's hard to resist.  You'll come out of it with a warm fuzzy feeling in the tips of your toes.  It's nice to have a film that just wants to please, I just wish they didn't lay such a heavy topic wet blanket over the proceedings. --------------- 8"

","Notting Hill is a romantic comedy or rom-com from 1999 made by a successful production company (Working Title) and written by an equally successful screenwriter of the time, Richard Curtis.<br/><br/>The team had been behind another successful rom-com of the 1990s, Four Weddings And A Funeral.<br/><br/>It is as the title unoriginally suggests set in the Notting Hill area of London. An affluent area some would say yet at the same time home of immigrants and the annual carnival. It is also the home of a bustling market. I digress!<br/><br/>Back to the film. Anyway, Hugh Grant plays a travel book shop owner William Thacker who lives within walking distance of his shop conveniently. A shop that isn't particularly financially successful.<br/><br/>Grant has a couple of failed marriages to his name and lives in a terraced house with a rather scruffy, yet likeable Welsh lodger Spike (Rhys Ifans).<br/><br/>The film has all the traits of the rom-com film at hand. You could say it is split into three distinct acts:
1. Boy Meets Girl
2. Boy loses girl
3. Boy wins her back and everybody lives happily ever after!<br/><br/>The boy in question is really a man, Thacker! Although Grant plays Thacker with his usual rather tedious surreal but nice attitude. He's done it in several of his films before and after.<br/><br/>The girl, or lady is successful Hollywood actress Anna Scott played by Julia Roberts.
Now the meet-cute scene is classic rom-com staple. Scott is in London and happens to browse the bookshelves of Thacker's book shop. Although his initial attempts at link-selling leave a lot to be desired!<br/><br/>All I can explain about the scene is surreal but nice!<br/><br/>Grant struggles against the media frenzy that follows Scott and her movie enterouge, at one point pretending to be from Horse and Hound magazine!<br/><br/>Thacker introduces Scott to his wacky relatives/friends at dinner. The supporting cast here includes the likes of Hugh Bonneville.<br/><br/>Now there are obstacles to the relationship developing. Not least the fame and 'adulation' that follows Scott at every turn. The media frenzy and tabloid revelations about old videos.<br/><br/>The obstacles also come in the form of a supposed relationship with a fellow actor, cue a cameo by Alec Baldwin.<br/><br/>Scott seemingly has little independance but shows Thacker a good time. In one scene breaking into a Notting Hill square garden over locked railings whilst Thacker struggles ala Alan Partridge!<br/><br/>The casting is a high point of the film. Grant is a regular at these roles throughout his career and Roberts probably had her most successful role to date in Pretty Woman.<br/><br/>Rather than a gay best friend, Thacker confides his concerns to his relatives/friends including Ifans who is funny as Spike.
Now Thacker loses Scott whilst she faces her media demons and cross Atlantic way of life.<br/><br/>Cue a musical montage scene where Grant walks through the Notting Hill market to his shop through several changing seasons to depict the passage of time. For the musical geeks out there the track in question is Ain't No Sunshine by Bill Withers.
The soundtrack also features some brothers Gibb input and Ronan Keating.<br/><br/>Thacker faces his moment of despair around the 3/4 point of the movie toward the end of the second act.<br/><br/>The final act sees Grant racing through London traffic aided by his friends to reach Scdott's latest press conference at the Savoy Hotel. Horse and Hound is back!
The inevitable outpouring of love occurs and Thacker and Scott appear to live happily ever after!"

","You'll find, that with most British comedies, there's a lot of wit, that they carry, which will be lost of most people.

It's a great film that deserves all the credibility and recognition that it has already received...and then some.<br/><br/>Don't pass this film up.

"yes_i_am84","8","5","5","29 August 2005"," Funny and uplifting... and I don't usually like romantic comedies
","The simplest story you could ever think of... and quite unrealistic at the same time, isn't it? Nice but anonymous guy meeting by chance the most famous actress in the world, and a relationship - somehow - starts. Romantic comedies aren't my thing, usually, so when a friend asked me, a few years ago, to go to the cinema with her and watch *this*, I was very skeptical. Two hours later, I got out of the séance with a smile on my face, feeling refreshed and uplifted. As regards romantic comedies, and comedies in general, you'll hardly find anything better than ""Notting Hill"", at least in the last twenty years.<br/><br/>The simple and unrealistic story - yes, that one - turns out to be handled with such skill and talent from screenwriter Richard Curtis that, very early in the movie, you find yourself *captured* already. From the ""Rufus-the-thief"" scene on, you smile, you laugh (softly - the humour of the many memorable quotes in this movie is too nice and... well, British, to laugh out loud), you smile again, until the press conference climax is reached. You care for every single character, just because they are making you smile. Julia Roberts' Anna and Hugh Grant's William, despite their being a representation of two categories of stereotypes, turn out to be someone you want a good final of the story for, and the two actors are perhaps the two more suitable actors for their respective roles (Grant in particular, even if he can be irritating in some other roles, he is really created for this one). But the honorable mention is actually deserved by the supporting cast, William's circle of friends, everyone of them would deserve a screenplay for his own character only. Very enjoyable.<br/><br/>""Notting Hill"" isn't a masterpiece, neither has it any deep meaning... but come on, don't be snob. It's cute, it's cheerful, it's smart and it deserves your staying at home and watch it on a quiet TV evening."
"Red-125","8","8","9","27 June 2008"," This is what romantic comedy looks like!
","Notting Hill (1999), directed by Roger Michell, is a showpiece for Julia Roberts and for London. (Hugh Grant is pretty good too.)<br/><br/>The movie is undoubtedly formulaic. From the moment Julia Roberts--Anna Scott, the most famous woman in Hollywood--steps into Hugh Grant's bookstore, we can pretty much predict how the rest of the movie will turn out. My comment about this is, ""So what?"" No one wants a romantic comedy with a sad ending, and no one wants to think about whether ""the most famous actress in the world"" could really enjoy life with a kind and gentle man who lives and works in Notting Hill.<br/><br/>The movie has some real strengths: William Thacker (Grant) has a loving, lovable sister (Emma Chambers), and some great friends. The Portobello Road market and the Notting Hill section of London look colorful and authentic. London gleams in the sunshine, and the posh hotels look, well, posh. <br/><br/>Most important, Julia Roberts is perfect for the part. The clichÃ© is that the camera loves Julia Roberts. I would say instead that WE love Julia Roberts. The camera just transmits her beauty and charm so that we can appreciate it. <br/><br/>Note: Watch for the lovely Emily Mortimer who plays ""Perfect Girl."" That is, she and William are brought together after Anna breaks his heart, and she would, indeed be perfect for him. However, who wants to see a romantic comedy where the hero says, ""Sure, who needs Anna Scott when Perfect Girl is around?"" It just wouldn't be romantic, and it wouldn't be comedy."

","This movie is almost entirely character driven and it is great. It's very funny, positive and enjoyable. The story is very simple - classic boy meets girl (or vice-versa) scenario. However, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts' outstanding performances propel this movie to greatness.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant delivers one of his best 'average, humble' guy performances in this movie. Many of his lines were some of the most witty and clever dialog I've heard in a while. Almost reminds me of how Jimmy Stewart could mumble lines and come off as brilliant.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts was sparkling as a somewhat forward but grounded movie star that one could relate to. It was pleasant to see lots of big smiles from Julia.<br/><br/>The other characters were literally 'characters' - bizarre, off-beat, odd-ball, goofy - but at heart warm and enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>If you're in the mood for a good laugh and pleasant movie-going experience, this is a great movie to watch."
"LinOnnLine","Null","73","114","18 July 1999"," Subtle, embedded messages emerge to create positive view of people with disabilities.
","Notting Hill, this totally implausible, happily improbable, feel good flick, does more to influence positive attitudes about people with disabilities than any all day sensitivity training seminar could ever hope to accomplish.<br/><br/>As significant as the two leading characters is the ever-present, fanciful circle of friends. Wouldn't we all love to have a close group of intimate chums like these! The collection of assorted characters includes Bella, a woman who uses a wheelchair, a sleek Quickie Ultralight at that. I love the easy nonchalance of her introduction to the viewer. She is merely one of many diverse folks in the day-to-day life of William Thacker, the film's protagonist.<br/><br/>In one after-dinner scene, the group sits around a big, friendly, worn farmhouse table, consuming way too much wine and sharing what stinks about their life. Bella reveals that she and her husband discovered they cannot have children. I like that she also dares make a complaint about ""sitting in this damn chair"". She is being honest; she is not burdening herself with feelings that she should sugar-coat her life for others. Nor does she feel compelled to be upbeat and cheerful no matter the cost to her own integrity.<br/><br/>This character lives a typical, dare I say ""normal"" life. She is married, throws parties, gets drunk on occasion, and interacts with the able bodied world around her . . . all with unaffected naturalness. I like the message this sends to the viewing public: people with disabilities are a whole lot like people without disabilities.<br/><br/>In a scene when Anna Scott and William Thacker leave the birthday party celebration, the very first words out of Anna's mouth are, ""Why is Bella in a wheelchair?"" This is precisely, to the letter, as it would be in real life. When folks come in contact with a person with an obvious disability, they understandably want to know what happened.<br/><br/>Bella's husband tenderly lifts her out of her wheelchair to carry her up the staircase to bed. My thermometer was on . .. testing for feelings of excessive sympathy or sorrow in myself or in the audience. There were none. There was only empathy, warmth, and tenderness, much of what one would feel watching any loving couple where the man lifted the woman over a doorstep, for instance, into their first home. Kudos to the director and the actors for not playing the pity card here. Thankfully no soaring violins tugged at our tear ducts.<br/><br/>As the culminating scene of the movie approaches, the group of friends all impulsively jump into a small European car to race off. There was Bella left waving goodbye from her Quickie. No, wait a minute. This was not to be. They wanted Bella with them; she belonged with them on this mission. There were no complicated maneuvers of how will we squeeze her into the car, what will we do with the wheelchair, no exasperation from the characters. They just did it. They made it happen. Before we knew it, Bella was sitting in the front seat; a few others had rearranged their positions and crammed into the back seat, and off they all went charging away full speed ahead.<br/><br/>In a final scene, the friends are attempting to 'crash a private party' so to speak, and having trouble getting past the hotel management. In a boldly triumphant move, Bella comes wheeling authoritatively toward the hotel bureaucrat, confidently announcing in a power voice: ""He is with ME. I am so-and-so from such-and-such journal writing an article on how your hotel treats people with disabilities.""<br/><br/>Swoosh! All doors opened to the group! Bella saved the day in her quick-witted plot to get past the hotel magistrate. Aside from the glee I felt at her being the savior of the day, I also applaud the embedded message: Disability rights are expected; don't tread on disability civil rights; disability access is what's happenin' in the Nineties.<br/><br/>This film has broad cross-class mass appeal, from the teenybopper to Joe Six Pack to the intellectual, and therefore has the power to impact the sensibilities of millions of viewers. I applaud Notting Hill for its contribution toward influencing positive attitudes toward people with disabilities."

","Julia Roberts playing a famous American movie star wasn't quite a stretch and yet it felt unconvincing. The humor works the second you're seeing it but then it vanishes into thin air. It feels self conscious and forced. Once all that is said, ""Notting Hill"" emerges as a pleasant enough improbable romantic comedy in the ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" mold without ever reaching the smart, disarming charm of its model. Hugh Grant is lovely in a part destined to seem Hugh Grantish with all the clipped bit of nonsense that have made Grant a household name. The quirky friends and bizarre room mates are the questionable salt and pepper of this romantic tale. I found myself smiling, getting impatient and enjoying it, all at the same time. I'm too much of a Preston Sturgess fan to be able to sit through a modern comedy in the way I did with ""The Lady Eve"" for instance. My favorite moment: The Horse and Hound sequence. Very funny. If you've never seen a Preston Sturgess, Ernst Lubitch or Billy Wilder comedy, you may like ""Notting Hill"" much more than I did."

","A wonderful movie about celebrity meeting normality. Nothing Hill stars Hugh Grant, as a book store owner, whose life is changed when an international movie star, Anna, played by Julia Roberts, walks into his book store. By fate, William collides into Anna knocking his lunch all over her. William offers Anna the opportunity to clean up in his flat across the way. Anna agrees.<br/><br/>Suddenly William has an international celebrity in his house. He desperately tries to keep her there by offering everything in his refrigerator. Anna leaves, but comes back and they kiss. Seems a bit Hollywood, am I right? No, I'm wrong. Nothing Hill's a wonderful film from start to finish. William tracks Anna down, and they start dating.<br/><br/>The movie basically has the same premise as Woody Allen's wonderful Purple rose of Cairo, even though Purple rose leans more towards fantasy than reality. Both movies contain quiet, humble, perfectly normal people confronted by celebrities.<br/><br/>Nothing Hill perfectly nails the relationship between celebrity and normality. Not just on a romantic level, but on a general level as well. In a wonderful scene, Anna's invited to William's sisters Birthday party. At the table, she's filled with happiness and joy by how happy, and simple it is to be normal. Opposed to living the false life of celebrity. I'm sure 98 percent of society would love to be in Anna's position, but maybe being a celebrity is not what is appears to be. Not everyone thrives off celebrity, getting a great deal of pleasure out of the shallowness of fame and fortune. Not everyone worships their own celebrity status like the Paris Hilton's of the world.<br/><br/>But on a romantic level, Nothing Hill succeeds amazingly as well. Just seeing William and Anna walk down the road, sit together, in a restaurant together, has amazingly wonderful charm to it. It's easy to put your self in William's shoes and feel his pleasure and excitement, basically why I loved this movie so much. I felt William's excitement the same way Cecilia felt everyone's on screen in the Purple Rose of Cairo. I escaped my own normal existence through William's wonderful situation with Anna.<br/><br/>It must be every man's dream, especially a humble man like William's, to have a beautiful superstar walk into their life and fall in love with them. Oh, how'd I love for Natalie Portman to walk into my bookstore and kiss me. It won't happen, because A) I don't have a book store, and B) because reality bites. But why not dream? Anyway, William and Anna fall in love, share intimate moments, and the shallowness of celebrity mixes in. Anna pisses me off towards the end of the movie when the paparazzi show up at Williams's door snapping a photo of him in his boxers with her upstairs. Anna suddenly puts her career before the likes of William. Anna leaves, William mopes around, but his flat mate and sister track down Anna for him.<br/><br/>Of course, William tracks Anna down on a movie set a few months later after she wins an academy award, which Roberts would win in reality a year later for Erin Brockovich, but mistakenly hears her say a rather rude remark about him. Little does he know it was in character. But Anna, once again, returns to Williams's book store, confesses her love for him, he turns her down, his friends make him realize how dumb of a mistake it was, and then he tracks her down at a press conference. And they live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Of course, in reality, this probably wouldn't happen. But why couldn't it? Why can't celebrities and every day people fall in love? Like Anna says, she's just a small town girl. Nothing Hill's a wonderful movie no matter how you look at it. Everything about it's perfect. Julia Robert's and Hugh Grants best work. 10-10"

Their paths cross several times and after the media discovers the blossoming relationship, Williams life, and Anna's also, will never be the same.

Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is a very famous American actress who comes to William's shop to buy a book. While Roberts and Grant are wonderful in their roles, it is definitely the supporting characters that set this movie apart from others in the genre.<br/><br/>Perhaps there are people who think this is a real girls-movie, but I'm a guy and I loved it as well.

","I have since purchased this movie on DVD, and watched it several more times. The supporting characters who make up William Thacker's (Hugh Grant's) world seem a bit less freakish with greater familiarity. <br/><br/>Moreover I now ""get the point"" that Thacker's genuine love for, and patient acceptance of, all these zany people -- even the shoplifter -- is precisely what Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) finds so appealing about him. He is that rare sort of guy who would love her and accept her, no matter what changes fate and time should bring. He would also love their children with equal if not greater devotion, not just because they are his, but because that is how he treats everyone in his life. <br/><br/>Perhaps this was a type of love that Scott had not realized was possible for her, something she had not even known to want until her chance meetings with Thacker. And this explains why she took such reckless risks to woo him.<br/><br/>Now that I ""get it,"" I really like it. <br/><br/>*<br/><br/>Directors, even more than writers, confront a paradox of timing. They spend endless hours, weeks, and months planning, shooting, cutting, and tweaking a film, growing deeply intimate with every detail, including the ones left out. <br/><br/>But they must ultimately release their movie in a form that is perfectly comprehensible and engaging to the audience, so that people for whom it is all brand new can still get the whole thing in one unbroken take (there ain't no pause buttons in the multiplex). At least with a book (and now with DVDs) the consumer can re-read a passage or replay a line that did not connect the first time. But movies are still made for theaters, and must work there the first time, in real time. <br/><br/>The best movies do work the first time, but also reward repeat viewing with enhanced pleasure and deeper insight. But some very good movies, including this one, can only be fully appreciated after several viewings. This is yet another reason to be grateful for DVDs. <br/><br/>9/10"

I often see a trailer and feel that the movie didn't add anything to the trailer: in fact comedies often put all the good jokes in the trailer.

Practically every scene incorporates humor, and it's all fresh; nothing cliche.<br/><br/>The supporting characters complete the cast and also create humorous moments of their own.  Every scene that involves Spike, William's disgusting flatmate, involves some type of oddity, even if only Spike himself. Notting Hill is a fantastic movie that I can't wait to watch again and again.  Without a doubt one of my favorites.  I give it a 10!"
"Big O-7","8","6","7","11 November 1999"," What can I say? JULIA is back
","This film is really quite special.  It is a film that promises only one thing, and delivers.  Not many films can actually claim that.  This one promises a funny, snuggly kind of romantic-comedy, and it does deliver. Julia Roberts is perfectly cast as a superstar trying to deal with the aspect of fame.  I have a theory that in any movie starring Ms. Roberts, the co-stars take 5th seat and back, because Ms. Roberts is a genuine superstar (one of those special people that only walk on the earth every few decades or so) in the Marilyn Monroe tradition, one who just becomes so charismatic that no mere mortal stands a chance (look what happened to Richard Gere in RUNAWAY BRIDE).  She is wonderful in this movie.  But does all this mean that the rest of the cast does not matter ... well, almost.  But the always game Mr. Grant and his co-conspirators all do add to the film, and with Ms. Roberts leading the way, they bring this one home solid."

"jcox713","10","7","9","6 July 2010"," 10 stars for the supporting roles! Brilliant performances.
","The opening scene and song from the movie had me groaning ""oh, puh-leeease."" Corny right out of the gate, as were the brutal country songs mixed in after that, but that aside, the movie actually picks up in comedic pace and in story development which yields promise. The plot, dialouge and characters strongly mirror Four Weddings and a Funeral, one of my all time faves, and is worth watching for the whimsical quirky writing and the performances of the supporting cast. There really aren't any real sparks of chemistry between Julia and Hugh but it is still a pleasure to watch their interaction.<br/><br/>I probably would have chosen a different actress than Julia Roberts, though her performance is still excellent. I don't know who I would have cast, but someone else. Same criticism of Andie Macdowell from Four Weddings. But the key is to minimize the importance of the leading lady performances in both flicks for the real entertainment factor is to be found from enjoying Hugh Grant's character and ESPECIALLY the sparkling combination of his British friends. Both movies are absolutely made by the interaction of the supporting characters.<br/><br/>The ending sequence is particularly promising and is set up to make the film a real winner (one of the best laugh-out-loud scenes is toward the end)and you may find yourself holding your breath for that true heart-soaring moment. You may find it delivers - or maybe you won't. I personally found Notting Hill as well as Four Weddings to have the same ""eh"" endings - the kind that are set up to be so wonderful, but when the two would-be lovers don't have that moment (you know, THAT moment of explosive passion and love and connection?- it falls just a little deflated. But that is just my perception! Maybe you'll disagree. You'll have to decide for yourself."
"Jakemcclake","9","7","9","22 September 2009"," More of A Good Romantic Movie Than A Comedy
","Spoilers<br/><br/>I have read the negative reviews and I agree with most of the comments, made, but I still love this movie. <br/><br/>This movie has a (somewhat) ground breaking premise of a famous and very attractive movie star getting involved with a person of no fame and no notoriety. It seems like a logical choice of movie scripts for Julia Roberts, considering Julia's prior marriage to Lyle Lovitt. The movie goes on about the conflicts that cause this couple to stay apart. In that sense it is not very funny and I agree with those people that critique it on its lack of humor. This series of conflicts cause the movie to drag on in a serious, un-entertaining way. <br/><br/>However, the character Spike tends to add tremendous comedy to most of the scenes that involve him, so it does not drag too much. <br/><br/>After all of the conflict, the movie suddenly focuses in on one of Julia's lines, regarding the issue of a famous movie actress wanting to be involved with a not so famous man. <br/><br/>This fame thing is just an illusion, well, what you really have here ""is a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her."" It was a very powerful line if it stood by itself, but then it gets repeated later on, which they did not need to do. <br/><br/>The ending was powerful also, but the music messed it up, as they used the song ""She"" by Elvis Costello for the climax. Nonetheless, still a powerful ending showing that the famous and the not so famous can be together. <br/><br/>I give the movie 9 stars. I have watched the ending of this movie a dozen or more times, sort of ignoring the the repeating of Julia's line and ignoring climactic song ""She"" and just watching the actions on the screen."

","Notting Hill is one of the best romantic comedies out there. The reason for its status is the well written story, the dialogue, and the actors.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of a simple travel bookshop owner (Hugh Grant) who meets a famous movie star (Julia Roberts) when she walks in his shop. And it goes on to show the resulting relationship that starts from this point. <br/><br/>The story follows the guidelines of most romantic comedies but it does so with its own flair. The dialogue is very sharp and the characters' conversations with each other are either thought provoking or laugh inducing.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the actors on this film was perfect. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant dazzled in the lead roles. They make the audience care for each of the character's storyline no matter where the story takes them. The supporting cast compliments the main characters immensely. Rhys Ifans as Spike, Hugh Grant's flatmate, is comedic genius. <br/><br/>Notting Hill is one of the best romantic comedies because it is so much more than just that label. The film sucks in the audience and at the end gives the viewer something more than just laughs and a happy ending. It gives the viewer insight and hope. I don't want to explain why because you should watch the film and find out for yourself."
"Keyska2004","9","5","6","15 November 2010"," A Romance to bind two Countries
","Julie Roberts to me is not the star of this film, she is ""A Star In The Film"" but Hugh Grant soars in this romantic comedy. Hugh plays a small travel bookstore owner in London who lives in the heart of all the action, but his life is anything but outstanding. His wife had left him for another, and his ho-hum life could be called the pits. His gay assistant/clerk has some great lines that come across at the right time. Julie Roberts had the easiest job: playing a rich celebrity who has no private life style (be careful for what you ask for kids) with the Press hounding her and any little thing that happens to her. This movie could be taken directly out of the grocery store check-out lines tabloids. Hugh's character interplays with each of the side characters so nicely that you experience it as if it was your life, and your friends that you are watching on the big screen. This is in my top ""5"" all-time Romantic films to date."

The day she has to leave UK, Anna makes a declaration of love to William as a last chance. He declines her offer there, but after talking about it to his friends<br/><br/>The acting is very nice!! Especially Hugh Grant performs the part of an honest bookseller owner perfectly, I think. And a heart-warming movie helps viewers open our mind. The plot is not so good, because the scene of a casual meeting of two is incidental. I do not be touched at that scene."
"terraplane","9","5","6","29 September 2006"," Ah, the romance of it all...
","Do you like a bit of romance? A bit of comedy? A bit of simple feel-good entertainment? Then look no further than Notting Hill. Here's Hugh Grant in the movie that is the perfect vehicle for his awfully-nice-but-a-bit-dim Englishman. And it works beautifully. His character lives in a little world of awfully nice people that never quite make a success of anything but they don't really care much. It's a small world of good friends, enjoying their lives, smiling at misfortune...very British. In fact, it's really quite a small movie, an ensemble piece that Hugh Grant uses to demonstrate his great talent for comedy acting. His characterisation of William is perfectly presented thanks to his natural talent for this kind of role. Of course he has played the same role many times but if that's what the director wants, then Hugh is your man. The supporting cast play their roles to perfection, some of the little cameo parts are as good as you will see anywhere. James Dreyfuss as the effete and just-a-little-bit-dim Martin is hilarious but tinged with the same resignation of failure as all the rest. Rhys Ifans plays the slightly unhinged Welshman perfectly, an extension of the part he played as one of the psychotic, drug fuelled Lewis brothers, bent on revenge in ""Twin Town"" And what of Julia Roberts? Well, she plays along with all these warm hearted British types, looking a little bit bemused but all she has to do is play herself, a Hollywood star who falls for an ordinary mortal. Which is what she did when she married Danny Moder in real life. Notting Hill is a perfect piece of romantic escapism, watch it with your loved one and enjoy the romance of it all. And when Elvis Costello sings 'She' at the end of the film, well, it brings a tear of happiness to even the most cynical of eyes. Ah, isn't it lovely!<br/><br/>One day I'll watch it with Annushka, but I hope she doesn't fall asleep half way through it :)<br/><br/>Ya tebya lyublu."

","For refreshment this comedy is good at all. The plot is very real, nobody can say that a movie star cannot love a simple man, perhaps this may happen even better than the love between an actor and an actress. The actress (Julia Roberts) was in fact looking for new air and trying to escape from the routine of journalists, photographers, critics and others. She was tired of all this circle and wanted something different. Hugh Grant, the bookshop owner, showed her modest life, good friends and other environment much better than the one of million US dollars. Congratulations to Roger Michell for this film that anyone can see several times, it has also excellent music with songs of two Bee Gees (Barry and Robin Gibb)and Charles Aznavour, congratulations once again to Julia Roberts, who is simply at present the best actress in comedy in Hollywood. Appreciation also to the work of British actor Hugh Grant, always very efficient."

","Well there are many people asking questions like, ""Why would someone like Hugh like Julia, in this movie"", well that's the beauty of it, when someone falls in love, it doesn't matter how bad or good the other person is. It only matters what the other person is to you. Sometimes they are cruel, sometimes sweet, but who likes whom, how can we define?<br/><br/>The jokes in this movie aren't all perfectly timed, and that's what that makes it more realistic. OK not all parts were realistic, but this is a very sweet and heart warming story. Its a story of hope, which we lately need a lot of. Hugh grant was the best thing in this film, his weird way of saying things and strangely accepting every unintentional crap his roommate threw at him, and the way he dealt with it (like the glasses scene) was hilarious. All in all this is one of my all time favorite Romantic Comedies. Especially the bench scene in the park, where Julia says ""Sit with me"", with Ronan Keiting singing in the back, ""When you say nothing at all"", was truly the scene to remember.....<br/><br/>First, truly fall in love then try this again....."
"film-critic","10","6","8","13 January 2005"," Whoopsidaisies!
","I first saw this film when it was released in May of 1999. I saw it as an instant love comedy classic combining the taste of Noel Coward as well as the subtle wit of Four Weddings and a Funeral. There was something original about this tale, something that just made the entire movie-going experience monumental. I was very impressed with both the talents of Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, and newcomer (that would eventually make a name of his own) Rhys Ifans. I loved the modern fairy-tale story that Richard Curtis created (and would soon repeat again and again with success) and felt that the chemistry between Grant and Roberts could not have been done by anyone else. America's sweetheart coupled with Britain's poster-child was immaculate. This was a near perfect film that could be rediscovered again and again.<br/><br/>Sadly, I still haven't bought this film, but when my wife and I chose to rent it the other day, I was curious to see if the emotions and excitement that I felt when I initially watched it would survive in the year 2005. Sometimes films have this uncanny habit of becoming dated and musty with age. The jokes seem to be less funny, the characters seem old (because Hollywood may have recycled them in other films), and overall the film just feels like 1999. As I watched this film again, the first time in several years, it became obvious early on that it did not age in any way. The jokes still had me rolling around in my chair with laughter, the quirkiness of the characters still redefined Britain, and Julia Roberts still shined in one of her best roles to date. It was impressive to see how well preserved Curtis was able to keep this body of work.<br/><br/>The characters are what preserve this film so well. I do not think that Hollywood has ever recreated Rhys Ifan's Spike, and if it has it was not as memorable. Hugh Grant is an awesome screen presence with his quick tongue and insecure personality. I have always been a fan of Hugh Grant's work, and am constantly impressed with the resume he has built. Julia is, well, Julia. While some will argue that she plays the same character over and over again, I would have to agree. She is a typecast character, but in Notting Hill it works. She is supposed to play herself, and she pulls it off with the greatest of ease. I did not see this film as a stretch for Julia, but an opportunity to show the world what Grant has to offer. He successfully built this multi-dimensional character that believed in love so deeply that once it was given to someone, it could never be taken back. You don't see that sort of theme in the cinema today. Even the cheesy ""boy and girl"" line was not as bad as other films. I thought that it fit perfectly and gave Grant a reason to continue. Nothing could be as bad as ""You had me at Hello"". To see a cheesy romantic comedy last through time is due to the work of Richard Curtis' screenplay and some amazing (yet simple which is why this film works so well) direction of Roger Michell.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt the story was bold and imaginative. The characters were played with so much respect and dedication that it felt almost real. It was a love story that has lasted the test of time due to the huge talent and simplistic themes. I laughed through this film again in 2005 just as hard as I did in 1999. That says something about a film if it can still evoke the same emotion nearly six years later. I am impressed with this movie, and with everyone involved. Go see it if you haven't yet, I know you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Whoopsidaisies! <br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"

","Notting Hill is an exceptional Rom-Com flick, and one of the very few which actually take your breath away.<br/><br/>William Thacker, a divorced gentleman from London, who stays with a quite tolerable Welsh room-mate, strangely meets the gorgeous American Actress Anna Scott in his tiny not-so-profit making Travel Book Shop. When a non-affordable Orange juice is spilled all over Ms Scott, the plot begins to unfold in a series of emotionally complicated twists and turns as we dig deep into the lives of this made-for-each-other couple with a constant Fate (sometimes spelled as Scott's Annoying Boyfriend) Intervention.<br/><br/>All praises for the cast of this film. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts play two totally contrasting characters; Roberts- the foul-tempered, moody, controversy-phobic girl and Grant- the humble, charming, and at times a reality-struck lad. Also, apart from the brilliant supporting crew, a person of interest to me was Dylan Moran, as Rufus the Book Thief, who ironically goes on to create and host a Book related Popular TV Series later on.<br/><br/>At times of depression, Roger Michell beautifully uses Hugh Grant's subtle sense of humor to get the momentum back on track. Some real intelligent use of comedy, some intentional puns (Robert's Big Feet, Large Shoes) and some British Classics (Whoopsidaisies!) make this movie a thoroughly enjoyable film.<br/><br/>A predictable end is expected, however, Julia's beautiful smile and Elvis Costello's 'She' makes your heart pump up with unexpected Love hormones. I enjoyed the entire 124 minutes and can definitely watch it numerous times. If only Julia's interpretation of Chagall's work was true, the quest for Love would be simple, or would it?<br/><br/>I give it a well-deserved 9 out of 10."

"theowinthrop","10","8","12","13 December 2007"," Can a diffident and shy travel bookstore owner find happiness with the reigning female movie star?
","With few exceptions that the public recall, both Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant have been singularly blessed in their film choices. My own recollection for Roberts was some unfair carping about her nice follow-up (with Richard Gere) to PRETTY WOMEN, RUNAWAY BRIDE. Basically a different storyline, the fans of the former film were confused by the nuttiness of the latter one. For Grant there has never been a negative comment about his films that I recall, but rather that embarrassing prostitute incident a few years back that really just showed that the actor was human. Both have a nice film charisma that makes their myriads of fans very happy. In NOTTING HILL the charisma of both mixed well on screen. It is a very sweet comedy.<br/><br/>Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is basically a clone of Roberts - she is a multi-talented and beautiful film star who is known around the globe. One day she is doing a ""Haroun - Al - Raschid"" act (like the Caliph in the stories of THE ARABIAN NIGHTS who goes in disguise among his subjects). She is doing some simple sightseeing and shopping in London's Notting Hill Section. She enters a bookstore specializing in travel books. It is owned by William Thacker (Hugh Grant), who lives in the neighborhood. Thacker's business is struggling along, with too many people coming in expecting it sells best-sellers (John Grisham) or classics (Dickens). He keeps correcting them about this.*<br/><br/>(And the script writer makes a mistake - a minor one. Dickens, unlike what Thacker tells a stupid customer, did write several travel books: THE UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVELLER and PICTURES FROM ITALY are two of them.)<br/><br/>Due to an accidental collision between the two in the street, Thacker invites Scott into his home to clean herself. He behaves with typical charm and care not to offend her. She leaves, but a moment later rings the bell again, and when inside kisses him. Later she leaves a message (that is nearly lost due to Thacker's idiot roommate (Spike - Rhys Infans)) to visit her at the Ritz Hotel in London. Thacker does see Scott, but has to pretend he is a movie reviewer for the magazine HORSE AND HOUND. He ends up asking questions to her and her co-stars about their latest film (which he knows nothing about), and how it relates to horses and hounds (it is a space epic, so it doesn't). But Scott and he go out together that night to a dinner party at Thacker's family's home.<br/><br/>The film progresses like this, as we see the attraction between the two develop. Both are basically simple types, and the glitz of Scott's film reputation belies her feet on the ground approach to life - except for her fear about scandal. Like all celebrities she tries to avoid that shade of limelight that Holly Golightly says really ruins many girls complexions. This makes things difficult for Thacker's dating of Scott, as she frequently is aware of cynical comments made about her (watch the scene in the restaurant for this), and she has to also put up with hyped publicity stories such as her long standing relationship with a prominent film actor (Alec Baldwin in a nice single scene). Finally, she flees to Thacker after a couple of months, when she is facing an embarrassment over some nude photos and an old (secret) nude film that was shot of her. Thacker gives her what seems to be quiet and protection in his home, only to find that the press is tipped off. Scott is aware that while Thacker will be able to shrug this off in a short time, she will have the scandal of their relationship follow her for her life. She leaves him in anger.<br/><br/>Will that be the end of the line for the lovers? I'll let the viewer see the film. Savor the performances of the leads who do fit well together, but also of Infans, who is the guileless dimwit who never realizes the long range results of his blunders. Yet in the end he proves to have more sense than Grant does in what to do about the relationship with Roberts.<br/><br/>NOTTING HILL is a real charmer for the movie fan, and a rarity in the present age of angst and bloodshed in our films. I recommend it heartily."
"dcbusiness-1","9","9","14","21 March 2012"," How On Earth Is This Film Only Rated 6.9
","At least when I write this review, this wonderful film is rated only a 6.9. Largely speaking I avoid most films that fall under the magic 7 out of 10 rating. However, there are hundreds of films on this site that, in my opinion, are far inferior to this gem. I am not a fan of romantic comedies in general, as the vast majority are so much shallow pond water - full of rather tasteless odds and ends and leaving a bad taste in the mouth. There are some exceptions, and this is one. Julia Roberts plays the part of the flawed but beautiful film star, and Hugh Grant plays his diffident best as the understated dry humored Englishman. But what makes this film great is the whole cast, from the effeminate book shop assistant, to William's quirky sister, Rhys Ifan's delightful gently crude and socially inept Welshman, Bernie the failed stock market trader (Played immaculately by the now famous Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville), I could go on!<br/><br/>The genuine and realistic relationships that the group of friends has contrasts with the world of fame represented in a somewhat satirical fashion. This only serves to leave you feeling warm and fuzzy with the thought of ordinary well-meaning people who love and appreciate each other and stand together through life's vagaries. How anyone cannot be moved by the response of Anna (Julia Roberts) at the end smiling like 'a little girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her' and what's more to a stirring rendition of 'She' by Elvis Costello; Come on, there is enough cynicism in the world not to delight in this gem of a film that oozes happy endings and feel good lives! This is probably the 5th time I have watched it and I admit unashamedly to tears welling up at the end.<br/><br/>Give it another viewing, you won't be disappointed"
"hitchcockthelegend","7","5","7","20 May 2009"," Oh, sod a dog. I've made the wrong decision, haven't I?
","Bookshop owner William Thacker's (Hugh Grant) life is turned upside down when Hollywood star Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) ventures into his shop.<br/><br/>By definition, Notting Hill is crowd pleasing fluff for the romantically inclined. Nothing wrong with that of course, chances are that if you have tuned in on TV or loaded this film on your player, you are fully expecting a fluffarama with lots of toothy smiles. Sure enough Notting Hill, written by Richard Curtis and directed by Roger Mitchell, delivers everything that the wish fulfilment plot synopsis suggests it will. And nicely providing a few laughs into the bargain as well.<br/><br/>That it stops short of being a top line rom-com falls at the feet of Curtis and his over egged script. The comedy is razor sharp and the romance is excellently fleshed from start to finish, but in his need to add drama via media intrusion and a ""woe is me"" life of the actress, Curtis comes dangerously close to fluffing his, well, fluff piece.<br/><br/>Still, it's a flaw that doesn't sink the film, because hey! We want feel-good and that's what we shall bloody well get! Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts take the lead roles of our mismatched (matched) coupling, and as it turns out it's a fine bit of casting. Roberts is not asked to do much other than smile and work well opposite Grant's wonderful foppish charm, while both actors benefit from an excellent supporting cast who rise above what in essence is a roll call of rallying around your mate mates!<br/><br/>Especially praise worthy is the efforts of Gina McKee and Tim McInnerny, whose sub-plot story could have been twee, but thanks to both of them it actually adds an emotional pull rather than being a shoehorned hindrance. Cringe comedy comes courtesy of Rhys Ifans (owning every scene he is in) and James Dreyfus adds extra light relief as William's assistant at the shop, Martin.<br/><br/>There's no Wet Wet Wet theme tune to outstay its welcome, and Roberts says her cringer line with far more oomph than that of Andie MacDowell. To which all told it makes Notting Hill no masterpiece in a much loved genre, but crucially it is however a delightful frothy film that hopefully makes you smile as much as it does yours truly. 7/10"
"secondtake","7","8","13","14 December 2011"," The best parts are warm and clever--the worst parts you can live through, so do it!
","Notting Hill (1999)<br/><br/>At first I though this was going south fast--the narration by Hugh Grant as the intro got going was straining too hard to be funny, and taking too long to click into gear.<br/><br/>But then it switched to a more usual romantic comedy, the kind that Grant has made his bread and butter (lots of both--he's really good at this). Later, when the narrative voice-over returns, it works just fine. He's the consistent charming low-key Hugh Grant that we've seen in many films before, and if you don't like him, you should steer clear. If you do, here you go!<br/><br/>Of course, there's Julia Roberts, too, and I find her completely fine, the dependable Roberts who really can't quite ""act"" but who is always likable and so acting isn't the issue. And to make it even easier, her role here is to be a huge mega-star actress. Which she already is. Voila, a perfect fit.<br/><br/>The magic and romance that is meant to spark between the two leads isn't always convincing, but there is a sparkling kind of dialog between them, and among extended family, that keeps it going. There is some really sharp writing here.<br/><br/>And there is some really stupid acting. The goofy roommate is just too goofy and caricatured for the rest of the cast, and he is given some of the weakest script to read, as well. The first appearance of Grant's family might strike you as forced, as well, but they gradually work their way into the film and are actually warm and very funny. I wish they had been larger and the roommate smaller in the plans.<br/><br/>Director Roger Michell has a short resume, including a well-regarded ""Persuasion"" which didn't persuade me (I like Jane Austen too much, I think). But there is a sensibility in that film that carries over here in some of the family scenes. Well done, as far as the script takes it.<br/><br/>Don't expect a great movie. It's entertainment, pure and simple, but enjoyable, and with some shining moments."

","Let me get through it, how i became so obsessed with this movie, i was just rolling channels on my home TV and i was just checking out same TV channels with the different programs and eventually, i got myself at HBO, there was a scene when a random woman which i considered at that time, walked-in in some kind of book store and was looking for the guy (William Wacker) and then he came and struck up with the most deep proposal conversation. I listened that and watched that scene so desperately and i loved it, As the movie went ahead, there came a most beautiful scene i have ever seen on TV when the William Wacker and Anna Scott sitting on the bench and William reading a book while holding a hand of her and there is baby in her womb. I figured that scene and that moment in the movie as one of the most beautiful and charming scene. I really felt so much in that scene and learnt many of things that i can enhance in myself<br/><br/>After a week, i searched for this film and download it so i can see it from the very beginning. So, here i am, finished the movie just now and reviewing it at last. The whole movie is mixed with the Drama, Romance, Family typed, and hilarious. The acting of Hugh Grant, Oh, my goodness, he is such a brilliant actor. He has beautiful face, acting skills and really good acting behavior. I have now just considered this movie as my favourite one. It has such a great plot, characters, sets and beautiful alleys of London. I found Hugh Grant so much talented actor as for his authentic acting skills. He's really great hairstyle. The character of William Wacker is so naive and respectable to me.<br/><br/>Movie has very logically and sensing making scenes that i have adored the most. Love Notting Hill forever."

","After the huge success of Four Weddings, Richard Curtis struck gold again with Nothing Hill. I think I actually prefer this to Four Weddings. The characters aren't quite as OTT quirky as Four Weddings and seem far more grounded and realistic. The warmth of William's friends who surround him is lovely and you can see why someone like Anna would find his life appealing. I like the little nods to Julia Roberts previous films (""we'll have you spick and span and back on the street in no time... In a non prostitute way of course""). I like how she shows she's just a vulnerable person under the sheen of being Hollywood's biggest filmstar.<br/><br/>Notting Hill of course is a gorgeous setting before it got ridiculously gentrified, and humble book shop owners could afford to rent with a jobless Welshman in a flat in Portobello Road.

","Notting Hill is a neighborhood in London and it's the title of a romantic comedy
starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Two of the most unlikely lovers you could
ever imagine get together here.<br/><br/>Grant is the respectable, but somewhat dull proprietor of a bookstore in Notting
Hill which specializes in travel books. It looks like he's getting by, but truth be
told Grant's perfectly happy with just making enough to pay the bills and a little
extra.<br/><br/>Back in the day after she retired from the screen for almost 50 years it was one
of those urban legends in New York City to spot Greta Garbo out and about and you'd never know but when she might get a notion to stop into a bookstore like Grant's. In this case Julia Roberts plays a movie star not unlike
the real Julia Roberts. Garbo mysterious she's not.<br/><br/>For if she was I doubt Hugh Grant would have considered approaching her. As
for Roberts she's looking at Grant as a bit of respite from her life in the media
goldfish bowl. When she's discovered it's disaster for both of them.<br/><br/>Notting Hill is a nice romantic comedy with very believable leads in a fairy tale
fantasy. I mean who doesn't have a fantasy of wooing and winning some
celebrity you might admire or be crushing out on. In that sense Notting Hill
has a universal appeal.<br/><br/>In an unbilled part Alec Baldwin plays her boyfriend whom we learn little about factually. But he comes across as an egotistical fathead. One thing
you're certain of, no matter what happens with Grant, Roberts and Baldwin
won't be an item much longer.<br/><br/>Notting Hill, a nice romantic comedy/fantasy. May you win the celebrity of
your desires."

","Ok, so it's not a shootem-up bang,action adventure; and yes maybe it's a little unrealistic. what's wrong with a little happily ever after???  in this day and age of uni-bombers and serial killers; we need a little bit of happily-ever-after, from time to time. Notting Hill has filled the bill.  this movie is truly delightful. If you have become a bit of a bah-humbug person, this movie will surely restore your faith in mankind, at least for a little while. Personally, I left the theater feeling good. The script was well written, and character development quick, and interesting; as was the cinematography. Julia was radiant, as always; Hugh was charmingly humble, delivering every line with his usual perfect timing; the supporting cast was well chosen, each one adding their own special little touch to the film, especially Rhys Ifam, ""Spike"", who somehow managed to steal every scene he was in. My thanks and appreciation to the cast, the crew, and the powers that be, who made this film possible. If you haven't already seen this movie, I highly recommend that you do. I have seen it more than once, and each time it gets better. I'm ready to move to Notting Hill, and hopefully bump into William Thacker."

","I had the chance to see this movie last year at the test screening. I went in only knowing that Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant were in it. That's all. I walked out loving it. Now that it is being advertised, I can say that the commercials don't even begin to scrape the surface of this film. There have been so few genuine love stories lately that this is sure to take its rightful place among the great romantic comedies. It does answer a question sometimes wondered by non-celebrity and celebrity alike: How do you find someone out there who wants you for you? How do know when someone wants you simply because you're famous instead of for the person underneath? And how do keep the media away? It's a funny movie, with that dry British wit and the American savviness. It's a wonderful look at love and the battle to make a relationship work under extraordinary circumstances. There's nothing I would change about this movie. In particular, I loved the roommate, Spike. But this movie will endear its way into your heart if you've ever fallen in love, with someone who knew or someone who never knew."

","I was actually surprised by how bad this film was. First and foremost there is absolutely no chemistry between Grant and Roberts whatsoever. If there had been it just might have carried the absurdly thin plot line. But I don't know how far as the characters lacked emotional depth, they could not make the attraction look believable, they looked like actors playing parts instead of people falling in love and half the time I felt Roberts was just there to provide the grist for Grant's one liners (humourous though they may be). Roberts' character is an actress hounded by the media, desperately needing some privacy, an escape, some normality. She bumps into William Thacker and really, it should have ended there."

","I had no preconceptions before watching this-- i just wanted a bit of fun diversion for the evening. Instead, what i ended up with was a nearly-unwatchable steaming pile of scenes that failed to achieve the basic requirements of story or characterisation. <br/><br/>It occurred to me early on that perhaps the goal of the film was to take the highest-paid, biggest-name actors the producers could find & make the worst movie possible out of their contributions. <br/><br/>What made the subject/story/believability of characters even harder to choke down were two additional crimes: 1) the underlying theme of ""ooh celebrities have it so rough here's a feature-length PSA examining their plight""; 2) the under-use of at least 2 truly brilliant comedic actors (the picaresque Dylan Moran & the luminous Julian Rhind-Tutt), who put art before ego & therefore do the job of acting better.<br/><br/>I still could not figure out, at the end of the film, what drew the 2 main characters together. If their feelings were so compelling, the audience should at least have the remotest inkling as to _why_, surely.<br/><br/>The constant fawning over the fictional starlet was nauseating and demeaning-- surely, a single celebrity can not be held in the same degree of spluttering fascination by all who encounter her-- not every ""famous"" person resonates in the same way by all those little people who behold their greatness... and, amazingly enough, some people even don't even care about celebrities!<br/><br/>There was a great deal of discontinuity between threads which started & then disappeared with no resolution, the uncomfortable clash of comic with tragic (even in the same scene), and the mix of UK & US slang.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was also way off base... not sure whether there was a single UK cover/artist in the lineup. Considering the whole film was set in the UK, the usage of so many United Statesian artists felt confused & displacing.<br/><br/>With plot twists you can spot a mile away, unconvincing ""romance"", an ill-fitting jumble of predictably kooky characters, and an intolerable repetition of self-effacing British stereotype ""sorry's"" & other self-deprecations, this movie is entirely missable."

Gormless main lead bumbles through life.  Standard storyline of ""boy/girl meet, fall in love, split, then finally reunite"".<br/><br/>The difference from ""Four Weddings"" is more romance, less comedy.  Hugh Grant plays standard Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts appears to play, well... probably Julia Roberts.  The overall acting standard is uninspiring, the best moments come from the zany supporting cast.<br/><br/>So what does all that leave us?

","This started off promising with a very good first 40 minutes, then slid downhill fast with all the typical modern-day film clichés you hear in a romance-comedy. You get the customary excused promiscuous behavior and overdone sex jokes, excessive profanity and wrong intentions with the male always at fault. (It's never the female in the ""politically correct"" world of entertainment.)<br/><br/>Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts obviously make an attractive couple. Grant is a likable guy in most of his movies, not just some ""pretty boy"" because guys like him, too. The only complaint I have with his characters - as he does in this film, too - is his overly self-effacing attitude where he's always apologizing for living, practically, to his female counterpart. Hugh - speak up and be a man! Stop sounding like a stuttering wimp!<br/><br/>I'm a romantic guy, but romantic comedies are so lame most of the time. How two people get together usually is so ludicrous, so unrealistic it gets downright insulting. Modern-day films like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" make me puke, as do classic films labeled ""screwball comedies."" I actually thought - for the first 40 minutes - this film might be different. It wasn't. You get the normal ""formula"" and ""contrived"" story, even though it reeks of charm. However, enough is enough. <br/><br/>Grant (""William Thacker"") and Roberts (""Anna Scott"") got all the acting publicity for this film but the colorful supporting characters were more fun to watch than the two stars. <br/><br/>Do you think it is possible for some filmmaker to make an intelligent romantic comedy, and one that isn't rated PG-13? I hope so."

","It really doesn't matter if ""Notting Hill"" is taken too seriously or not. It is an okay romantic comedy. I mean, without being a great movie, at least this is entertaining enough and something that can be watched without much bad surprises. Although it contains some vocabulary of discussable taste, it isn't profane at all and doesn't contain dirty humor, unlike ""Frankie and Johnny"" and ""There's Something About Mary"", which makes this a much more intelligent movie.<br/><br/>""Notting Hill"" is one of those movies for people who appreciate the particular British sense of humor. British humor is a full plate, let's face it. This movie, when it comes to humor, romance and simplicity, is at the same level of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Bridget Jones Diary"", which makes it a good alternative to these movies.<br/><br/>The characters here are interesting and humorous, without being great. Hugh Grant does a great job as William Thacker, as well as the guy who plays Max. However, the actor who portrays Spike is who makes this movie so hilarious. Spike is so goofy, so silly and so humorous - congratulations for the actor who played him, 'cause he did a perfect job for this kind of role.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts, on the other, is okay as Anna Scott but not exactly great. I don't sympathize very much with the character she plays here. I mean, she only goes to William when is convenient for her, she uses him, leaves him and does other things that break his heart. They shouldn't have stayed together at the end, because she doesn't deserve him. I know, it's just a movie, but I feel bad for William, he deserves someone much better than Anna Scott.<br/><br/>Overall, a movie which is nothing spectacular or to be taken very seriously, but made just for fun. And it has a nice soundtrack too."

There's nothing wrong with these fantasies, but there's cleverer ways of exploring them. Dialogues were dreadful, the plot absurd, the acting appalling and the directing very poor.

","I'm sorry but I absolutely hated this sickly-sweet romantic comedy from the too-prolific pen of screenwriter Richard Curtis. It boasts, if that's the right word a wholly unbelievable plot about a mega-famous Hollywood actress (Anna Scott, played by Julia Roberts) escaping the trappings of stardom to naturally stumble into a London bookshop and promptly falling in love with its down-at-heel but of course down-to-earth and available mop-haired owner (played by who-else? Hugh Grant) and the ups and downs of their subsequent affair. Along for the ride are a motley crew of Grant's supposedly ""normal"" friends including Gina McKee and Hugh Bonneville and kooky characters like Grant's fated-to-be-mated hippy-chick sister, played by Emma Chambers and his painfully unfunny gauche flatmate played by Rhys Ifans.<br/><br/>By-passing the ridiculous plot, the film's dialogue is excruciatingly awkward and strives so hard to be everyday and natural but instead comes off as stilted and cringe-worthy. The humour is as thin as ribbon-pasta and the acting painful to watch, almost as if the cast was embarrassed speaking this forced, supposedly feel-good nonsense. The worst example is when Grant profanes the phrase ""Shittety Wicketty"" at an exasperating moment, but there's plenty more dross where that came from.<br/><br/>As for the playing, you can see everyone acting and a painful experience it is to witness. Mind you, you'd have to be Mary Berry to make writing as flat as this rise up. For good measure throw in a sappy soundtrack with Elvis Costello vacuously crooning the old Charles Aznavour hit ""She"" and a song by the even worse Ronan Keating, to make my movie-hell complete, while the only happy thing for me about the so-predictable happy-ending is that it was the actual ending of the film.<br/><br/>For a so-called romantic-comedy, I found it uninvolving, unamusing and ultimately unwatchable.

","Those who look for a story about bittersweet romance need look no further than 'Notting Hill', starring the ever-handsome English Hugh Grant and American star, Julia Roberts.

She then leads him on a wild chase and ultimately breaks his heart while he is trying to win her over. But, like other films in this formula, there is a happy ending.<br/><br/>'Notting Hill' is very British in style, and it has that sense of Hugh Grant-esquire humour. Then, there is his Welsh flatmate, the odd sister and odd dates, and the embarrassingly-funny and confessional press conference. It is easy to feel sorry for Hugh Grant's character, and this film does play on the tenderness. It also does not take itself too seriously by offering the humour, mainly at shy Grant's expense. There's also some fast-paced action at the end, and it is feel-good because it brings all of the characters together. Talk about team-work.

"MetaLark","1","12","32","19 November 2001"," One amusing quip in two hours
","It is not enough to populate a film with beautiful and talented actors; a good script is wanted above all. ""Notting Hill"" fails the script test.<br/><br/>I had tried once before to watch this movie, but had abandoned the attempt early on, when it became apparent that the female lead possessed neither cleverness nor goodness, nor indeed any virtue to speak of. I could see no basis for the hero's infatuation with a woman who did nothing but occupy space on the screen. But I forced myself to persevere in a second viewing for two reasons: 1) I'd recently heard an amusing quote (concerning actor Mel Gibson) from a later scene, so figured I might have given up on it before the good part started; and 2) I had not been much impressed with another Richard Curtis screenplay--""Bridget Jones's Diary""--on the first viewing, but had completely reversed my estimate after seeing it a second time--so perhaps ""Notting Hill"" was another such one.<br/><br/>Alas, the Mel Gibson crack was the only funny line in the entire flick. And aside from pretty faces and physiques, was there anything to be found in the protagonists to justify their interest in each other? The Julia Roberts character displayed nothing but beauty, stardom, and wealth, and appeared to exist in a gently-smiling vacuous state most of the time; in the one scene where she came alive, it was only to display an ungracious temper--quite a nasty piece of business really. The Hugh Grant character was marginally more sympathetic, but basically insipid.<br/><br/>The plot movement was slow and unconnected, with little sense of development.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant is of course past master at portraying the awkwardly shy Brit twit--give him credit there--but the writing was so shallow that no mere actor could have rescued it.<br/><br/>Don't bother with this one unless you're an MTV fan, i.e., you just like to pass time in front of a screen.<br/><br/>1/10"

Humble Brit bookstore owner Hugh Grant meets big American movie star Julia Roberts. They cute meet, they get together, they break up, they get together, they break up, they get together. Lots of loud music. This is a film almost breathtaking in it's lack of any new take on anything.<br/><br/>For example; in this movie you will run across: 1. Hugh Grant 'struggling' as bookstore/house owner in boho-posh Notting Hill. His assistant is wonky and lovable, and so are all his customers, his sister and his improbable friends. He is surrounded by eccentrics. Oh yes, he also has a wonky, lovable roommate. This roommate who isn't near as WL as Bill Nighy in Love Actually.<br/><br/>2. He invites out said movie star and then giggle tee hee he sort of forgot that his sister's birthday was being celebrated. Movie star doesn't mind slumming, so you get to see her admire how he glows in the admiration of his WL friends. If you haven't seen Bridget Jones for a while, you might appreciate this.<br/><br/>3. There is a hectic chase across town to last-minute get the girl with lots of doing things that would get you killed in real life. Oh, by the way, all Pretty Woman fans will appreciate the crusty, posh hotel clerk with the heart of gold.<br/><br/>These are only some of the low points in this terrible film. Hugh and Julia sleepwalk through their parts, and even the wonky and lovable supporting cast isn't entirely wonky and lovable.<br/><br/>In short, there is absolutely nothing in this film that hasn't been done or said before. Actually, I've seen quite a few films that fit that bill, but non of them are as charmless and unbelievable is this one. I am getting really tired of seeing films that cost millions to make and yet have really primitive scripts.

I do have my sensitive side and I do like to indulge it occasionally.  Besides I do see a niche for films to take women I fancy to.  This all might explain how I've come to see this film on three separate occasions.<br/><br/>And lovely it is.  Julia Roberts has fun playing herself.  Hugh Grant has fun playing Hugh Grant again.  Richard Curtis has fun writing for Hugh Grant again.  The plot meanders its gentle way to the conclusion you paid for when you bought the ticket.  Everyone smiles and thinks how wonderful true love is as the credits roll.  Warm feelings inside all round.<br/><br/>That's just it though.  This film sticks to an established formula and rakes in the cash.  It does so in a stylish manner with well-rounded corners and lots of polish.  It's the rom-com equivalent of Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven. It does exactly what it says on the tin, no more, no less.  Maybe I'm being picky for pickiness sake.  If I am, so be it.<br/><br/>I'm glad to see that Hugh Grant is moving on to less Hugh-Granty roles.  I'm really looking forward to seeing him in About A Boy soon.  I hope Richard Curtis can move on to, he can be brilliant (cf Blackadder) and I would hate to see him stuck in a rut.<br/><br/>Go and see for smiles, romance and Rhys Ifans in his pants."

","I love this movie so. I'm still not sure which is my favorite part of this movie... The soundtrack, the insanely quirky roommate-Rhys Ifans, Hugh Grant's amazingly funny friends, Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant himself. I'm gonna go with all of the above because I don't have to choose!! One thing I didn't love was how Julia Robert's character was kind of mean to Hugh Grant's character too many times. I wouldn't have stuck around for all of that crapshoot behavior but I guess she was guarded and cautious? I'll give her the benefit of the doubt because she's got trust issues from the paparazzi and the Hollywood life."

","I would love to give this rom-com an 8 because I actually liked this kinda sweet and predictable romance. But what was missing for me? Well, I can say the humor was great, that group of William's friends was a pretty cool idea too and the acting game was on a decent level. But I wanted something more from the love story. More scenes together, more memories together, just more of them together. Because if you think about it, they only spent William's sister birthday party together and they were one night at his home. So, yeah, I needed more of their relationship but overall, the movie is pretty good and easy to watch."
"Silverzero","6","1","1","3 May 2003"," Sharp clever brit-flick with a verbal wit like no other.
","A welcome change from your average `chick flick of the week', `Notting Hill' leaves a satisfying taste in the mouth. But there are a few nagging flaws. While the film opens brilliantly and maintains that pace up until about half way through the duration, after that the comedy becomes more sporadic, unsuccessfully mixing dry wit with needless sentimentality.<br/><br/>
But the presence of Hugh Grant really lifts this one off the ground. His bumbling act never fails to amuse and is always right on the mark. On the other hand, Julia Roberts does little to outdo her reputation for being shallow and the love at first sight aspect of her character isn't all that believable. Rhys Ifans more erratic style of humour is equally welcome and the one-liners he uses are classic. <br/><br/>The film loses a lot of momentum near the end but what has gone before erases a good amount of the minor drivel that followed. So, with a nice cast, a great script and a pleasant overall effect, `Notting Hill' is a success. 6.8/10."
"jonw","Null","1","1","1 September 2002"," not too bad
","You know what this film is about?<br/><br/>It's about £30k onto the value of my parents flat!<br/><br/>Seriously, besides the noticeable effect on west London house prices (resident one R. Curtis), and the fun to be had baiting Japanese tourists in the Portobello (everyone has painted their door blue now!), this isn't a bad movie.<br/><br/>The obvious comparison is with Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994). But the essential difference for me is that the female lead in this is sympathetic. Roberts brings to the role a charm and a beauty beyond mere physical appearance. What I find wrong about MacDowell's similar efforts (Four Weddings, Green Card (1990), Groundhog Day (1993)), is that I can't understand why the male lead actually likes her. Given that the film makers wouldn't tell MacDowell ""play it so that nobody likes your character"", I can only attribute this difference to the relative abilities of the actresses. Which surprised me, as I wasn't previously a huge fan of old fat-lips (the band Bongwater described the execrable Pretty Woman (1990) as ""It's fun to be a prostitute!"").<br/><br/>This is a fairly mindless, but very warm and fuzzy movie. Don't expect to be intellectually challenged, or get a real picture of what life in West London is like. But if you are in the right mood, and/or with the right person, it will be a pleasantly spent evening."

","First of all, I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies. Sure, I adore ""The Wedding Singer"" and a few other films, but I'm not exactly interested in the next ""big"" romantic comedy. However, there are a few movies belonging to this genre that are so charming that I can't resist them. ""The Wedding Singer"" is one of those, as is this film -- ""Notting Hill"". It's very funny and it's very romantic. I saw it for the second time tonight and I liked it even better than I did the first time. Hugh Grant is absolutely adorable, Julia Robert's character is charming. Some of the scenes (e.g. ""The Horse & Hound""-scene) are absolutely hilarious. This is a much better film than Richard Curtis's ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", and it's a masterpiece compared with the other Roberts-film ""Runaway Bride"".<br/><br/>In short, ""Notting Hill"" is a fine romantic comedy with appealing performances by the two leads.

I loved Hugh Grant's lines, every single word was perfectly chosen to add to the wit and attractiveness of his character. I didn't like the plethora of close-ups of the two leads, they made the film look like a photo shoot of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. Okay we know they're good looking but please!

Not only is the plot, the actors, and the music all great, but the cinematography was superb. When Will walks downtown and the time passes around him, I was amazed.

The same indignant stare and the same hurt-about-to-cry gulp, for example. Her revelatory, heartwrenching speeches all strike the same chord in my mind.  But that's okay, because I like her style for some reason, and I almost always enjoy watching her films, at least while they are taking place.  Notting Hill was no different.  I laughed hard, I enjoyed the plot for the most part, and the eccentric characters.  But I left thinking, ""mediocre.""  Why?  Well, the cheese factor, for one.  I know this is a love story, but PLEASE.  They concentrated WAY too much on that, and way too little on what I thought would be the interesting part.  They should have put more media hassle in there.  There was this one cool artistic scene with Hugh Grant walking through the streets and the seasons.  That was neat. Also, I mean, the characters were pretty good.  It may have been more effective NOT to use a real high name actress to play the part, but then again, it was easy to relate.

I don't know what Roberts is going to do now that she's getting too over-the-hill to play the ""All-American Ingenue"" character she's beaten into the ground like a dead horse (no pun intended). She has no range or depth to advance into more meaty, mature characters. Early retirement for motherhood would be a welcomed relief for many."

The beginning was not bad but the story did not really work. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant did their very best but I believe that they were miscast as a couple in love. They were unable to get into the plot. The movie is much too long, especially the last thirty minutes extends the movie in an unnecessary way. While watching the movie we hoped it would work up to a climax but we were disappointed. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant have both starred in other romantic movies with a much stronger story. Altogether I cannot recommend this movie."

If you see such a person, please smack them, and if you are such a person, what on earth is wrong with you?<br/><br/>There are about three genuinely funny moments in ""Notting Hill,"" and the rest of the film features various Brits making asses of themselves.

(Well, maybe he is, but guys don't usually impress girls by insulting people, do they?).  Anna Scott is remarkably shallow and is given about 3 lines of character development in the whole film, all of which occur during the birthday party scene.  Why is Thacker interested in her, other than because she's famous?  Why is Anna interested in Thacker, other than he looks like Hugh Grant?  These questions are ones we loud Americans are apparently not allowed to ask, we're just supposed to point and laugh and actually believe this couple actually has a shot at a real life.  The characters barely talk after they meet; character development is replaced with pop songs.  Note to director: it's NOT THE SAME THING!!<br/><br/>Shallow characters, shallow writing, and it seems to be shallow directing, too, as the actors really do their best with the material given, which is really just Generic Sitcom Plot #7 stretched to feature-length, with better cinematography.  5/10."

It is disappointingly non-experimental and plays the genre strict by the rules, but these rules work fairly well and here we have the good cast that is needed to pull it off.<br/><br/>There are quite a few details in the script that are rather questionable. For example, if Anna is this big Hollywood star, then - how does she manage to walk unnoticed through the streets of London, with not one paparazzo in sight?  And why do we have (in contrast) an army of photographers at William's house when the source of their information was merely a rumour spread by his flatmate Spike down the local pub?<br/><br/>One of the big pluses of this movie is its largely British supporting cast, especially Rhys Ifans is a treat.  As so often in this genre the supporting cast is not given enough to do.  The film hardly touches the stories of these characters, we only get the odd bit of inconsequential information.

If you want a truly admirable performance from either Julia or Hugh, search elsewhere. I'm glad this movie did work, because of all the tourists it now brings to Notting Hill, but I'm sure the residents would maybe think otherwise. The girl in the wheelchair and Ifans (Hugh's flatmate) give the best performances of the movie in my opinion and they have minimal roles.

"will-75","1","5","14","11 December 1999"," Tedium.
","It is quite possible for this film to wash over you and leave absolutely no trace of passing.<br/><br/>There are about three or four lines in this effort which are funny however the tedium in-between does not make them worth the wait. If you take a few of the scenes from Four weddings and also Pretty woman add a quaint little London bookshop you basically have it. Also make sure you have a wacky girl with daft hair, the disabled ex-girlfriend, the failing stockbroker, a dreadful cook and a smelly flat mate with a Welsh accent and you have the total depth of the characters. All committed to each other as lifelong friends who share each other's highs and lows in life.<br/><br/>Attention to detail is important in a film. Hugh Grant`s character lives in a flat with hundreds of LPs on the shelves, suggesting that he is a music enthusiast. However, the record player in his flat is a piece of junk with it's equalisation settings set to screaming treble. Obviously nobody in the production team has the first idea about audio, or perhaps they were all too bored to care.<br/><br/>In order to prevent this getting the U certificate it richly deserves a few carefully crafted swear words were added to the script. A ploy often used to suggest that a film actually has something in it worth sitting through.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is the type of film Hollywood loves and will continue to fund. A dreadful sure fire box office success with multimillion dollar marketing opportunities for years to come."
"Typonaut2000","4","3","7","28 January 2001"," Rent it if you subscribe to the National Enquirer.
","I kept thinking it seemed odd at the beginning of the movie that Hugh Grant should be surprised by the attentions of this famous movie starlet. After all, he is surely one of the leading heart-throbs on the screen these days. Oh yeah, I remembered, he is pretending to be a nobody, not an actor. But even as a nobody, I had trouble believing he would be shy and unable to get a date. And I had a heck of a time identifying with him.<br/><br/>And then there is Julia Roberts, famous actress, pretending she can't find true love, except in a book shopkeeper. Huh??? OK, accepting that stretch, lets say she was not a famous actress and just a girl who comes on to Grant. I doubt someone looking like Hugh Grant would pay much attention to such a mousy chick. So the logic that there is true love in Grant's heart for the person, not the actress is hard to accept.<br/><br/>If only there had been a climatic love scene - no not sex, but an intelligent conversation. I mean here are two people who decide not just to marry, but to make radical changes in their lives and they have done nothing deeper than take a walk in a park at night. I mean, she comes in to his book store to buy a book about travel; he owns a book store with nothing but books about travel. I am sitting there just waiting for a conversation about how they love to travel and would like to run away to some tropical isle together, or something. Not just a few quick name droppings of authors and painters.<br/><br/>The weird collection of people in Grant's family resembles the Addams Family, with Grant the only normal one. But then it began to make sense: this movie is not aimed at intellectuals, but at air heads who read People magazine and the tabloids, and whose very being hangs vicariously on reading about the lives of celebrities. The family represents the demographics of the tabloid readers, providing one of each type so they can identify with someone in the movie.<br/><br/>This could have been a profound movie about love transcending all, etc. Instead it is a superficial romance aimed at people whose idea of romance consists of a famous person taking one look at them and then falling madly in love with them. If you read People magazine, you will probably enjoy it. If you read Scientific American, forget it.<br/><br/>One other thing, this is another one of those videos where the box bears no resemblance to the movie. Why is Julia Roberts in pearls with a goofy grin? I mean she spends most of the movie in T-shirt. It makes it look like she is some rich person who lives in a mansion in Notting Hill. When the package doesn't match the contents you know something's wrong."
"Ked-2","1","5","15","31 May 1999"," Comedy of the year? No!
","I've always had a problem with 'Romantic Comedies'. What this term usually means is that there is no plot, no jokes and that you will leave the cinema feeling nauseous. If that didn't scare me away then the names at the top of the poster definitely should have, Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. But for some reason I saw it anyway, partly because of Rhys Ifans who was brilliant in Twin Town and secondly because it was free. My worst fears were confirmed, weak plot, predictable jokes and Hugh Grant playing his one character (bumbling, annoying, pathetic.)Rhys Ifans' character seemed to be tagged on as the comic relief (why does a 'comedy' need a comic relief?) and was underused. Julia Roberts was just dull and unconvincing. Also when will comedy writers learn that Middle Class people aren't interesting. They have responsible jobs, live in nice houses, drive 'reliable' cars, have dinner parties, go ski-ing, listen to Phil Collins & Celine Dion, drink wine and have children that are good at science. They are not good subjects for comedy. All the best sitcoms and films have been born out of squalor. Steptoe & Son, The Young Ones, Only Fools & Horses and even Father Ted are all based around the fact that the charcters haven't got two pound notes to rub together. Richard Curtis seems to have been seduced by the dark side of the comedy force, that of the affluent American sitcom. Where everyone is rich, clever and pretty and get into a series of ""hilarious mishaps and misunderstandings"". An air of pomposity can sometimes overcome the affluence problems sometimes (Basil Fawlty, Captain Mainwaring etc.) but Notting Hill doesn't have this either. All the characters seem apologetic for their own existence which just leads to more tedium. Overall a thoroughly over-rated and boring film. Little Voice was more touching and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells was funnier. After watching this film I think you will be able to tell that it was Ben Elton who wrote the funny bits in Blackadder."
"JasonS","1","5","15","29 May 1999"," Cynical slush
","Why? Because this was sheer stale US packaging and nothing else. Not only the ending was predictable (which is allowed in a romance) but every twist and turn. Yawningly too long. Lots of plain 'gags' that were the product of neither character nor plot (man who tries to buy novels, interviews with her co-stars in the hotel). Trite humour (grungy, eclectic flatmate; big feet/shoes). No insight, no questions, no credibility (why did she kiss him?) Huge plot holes - where did the fantastic Mr Ifans go during most of her stay? Why did he take the call from his mother? And yet another group of charming chums who are all SO supportive with not a twang of angst in sight despite disability/redundancy/business failure. By the second hour I was urging Hugh to hurry every one of those oh, so, faltering, foppish syllables. The plot was an obstacle course of devices which served only to titillate (goggles/guinea fowl/her from accounts and so many others). But what angers me most is that Curtis IS capable of producing delightful, fresh beguiling stuff but this was clearly straight from the pocket(book)."

Not even as good as Four Weddings, which at least had some funny lines about relationships and marriage in the modern world and had the neat device of dividing the film into: four weddings and a funeral. No neat devices here - though there is a nice tracking shot showing Grant walking through Portobello Road as the seasons pass. Still no sign of any black people though (though last time I went there they made up about 40% of the population).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts plays Julia Roberts, some Welsh guy plays Grant's Welsh flatmate who is only funny if you think that one-dimensional caricatures who are unfeasibly idiotic are deeply witty."

"revoltrightnow","6","2","4","2 November 2018"," Underneath this saccharine romantic-comedy-by-the-numbers lies an intriguing reflection of our celebrity culture.
","On the surface Notting Hill may present itself as fast food for the broken heart: a harmless piece of feel-good cinema fluff that might double down a night with the Ben & Jerry's in pajama bottoms. However there's much more to this nineties formulaic screwball comedy than meets the eye.<br/><br/>The far-fetched plot of Notting Hill draws its inspiration from previous fantasy driven screwball comedies such as Frank Capra's It Happened One Night (1934) and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936). These pioneering films in screwball comedy capitalized on the glamorized fantasy of the average Joe (or average Jane) living the unthinkable: an actual romantic, meaningful relationship with a bona fide world-famous celebrity.<br/><br/>Capra's timeless classics however, were developed in the shadow of the Great Depression, addressing the social issues of inequality amidst the fairytale-like courtship of its protagonists. This was a crucial element to those films; it gave context and grounding for a romance that would otherwise feel completely unreal to the audience. Notting Hill seems to allude to this fictionalized awareness, with both Grant and Roberts repeating the line ""it was surreal, but nice."" This line in particular felt like a wink to us in the audience, since the filmmakers of Notting Hill are unable to make their picture entirely believable. It's as if they are telling us that we should just go along for the ride.<br/><br/>Capra's films on the other hand, fully immerse us in their world because the celebrity and ""everyman"" meeting scenarios are not entirely serendipitous. Quite the opposite, in fact, they meet through carefully developed character motivations and fully established locations. Notting Hill has us take an almost religious leap of faith into believing that one of the worlds largest superstars casually buys books without a chaperone or bodyguard in a working-class district of London. When Hugh Grant spills juice on her shirt it requires a second major leap of faith to believe that she would enter a strangers apartment, again without any sort of bodyguard or chaperone, to clean up. To that effect, Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston present a far more believable couple in the action romantic drama The Bodyguard (1992).<br/><br/>However, I have no problem turning off my inner critic and push myself to enter the world of the film which isn't drawing me in on its own. I enjoy many cheesy romantic comedies and have no problem defending less believable plot lines like 2001's Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale. Notting Hill however, has far worse writing and a weaker supporting cast. Its comic timing is always a bit off, and even has Hugh Grant saying outlandish lines like ""Ill stabbed him to death later"", meant as a joke early in the film when his roommate doesn't pass along a message left by Julia Roberts (Anna Scott).<br/><br/>The supporting cast in this film fulfill the role of a cliché group of British pub crawlers and middle-class domesticity. The one twist in this, which could have been a very interesting character, was a paraplegic woman named Bella played by Gina McKee. However, instead of fleshing out her dialogue she is left as the inspiration p**n for Grant and Roberts' hardships. What's worse, the director actually has her leveraging her disability in order to grant Grant (no pun interned) access to a press conference with Roberts. It seems that Gina McKee's character exists in the film only for this, which is a tragedy of filmmaking in and of itself.<br/><br/>The worst aspects of Notting Hill lay in it's character development and completely unhealthy relationship dynamics. Julia Roberts plays an almost pathological narcissist: someone who lies and cheats on Hugh Grant and is completely incapable of any heartfelt apology. It's interesting to note that she never says once in the film that she loves Grant's character, William Thacker. Instead, after breaking his heart twice and lying to him, she asks for him to love her (after a little time has passed, of course).<br/><br/>The film sells the relationship on the chemistry of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts and the celebrity fanaticism that it expects from its viewers. In fact, almost every character is enamored with movie stars (even if they don't know which film Anna Scott is in) and plays the everyman role as some sort of stupefied stooge drunk at the alter of celebrity worship. I couldn't help but feel somewhat offended, as if the filmmakers see the public as dribbling idiots who want nothing more than autographs. Even Grant's character, who perpetually ""plays it cool"" is shown in movie theaters gazing upon Roberts in a bizarre peeping-tom like obsession. Six months after she cheats on him he is still lost in his daydream of Roberts, replaying her films. Some of the scenes are a little reminiscent of Stockholm syndrome in the way that Hugh Grant is portrayed as the non-functioning sad sop who can't get over this femme fatal.<br/><br/>Perhaps to combat this state of events, the producers of the film have laced every montage and establishing shot with the most unbelievably saccharine soundtrack I've heard in years. Once again, it's as if the filmmakers don't have confidence in the script they've made to draw us into a world of actual romanticism. They need to create that romanticism artificially with a score of Al Greene and other musicians that created songs which far surpass the material they are being used for.<br/><br/>The most painful part of the ""Notting Hill experience"" has to be the way Hugh Grant's character is written. Obviously aimed at an unintelligent and emotionally stunted audience of People magazine readers, William Thatcher is portrayed as the ultimate non-believable hunk: He's handsome, charming, unassuming, self-effacing, and yet always has the first two buttons of his shirt open and just enough confidence to say the right thing. In addition to this, he's inexplicably lonely and unattractive to the outside world, despite his undeniable good looks and charm. As a character he has no depth, his past marriage is explained away in one sentence we can see no reason for him to be the suffering hunk that he is, aside from the necessary role that he plays in his ""accidental"" meeting with Anna Scott (Julia Roberts). The script reminds us that he was put on this earth to please her narcissism and ""treat her right"" while she is there to reap the rewards of an undiscovered handsome ball of charm.<br/><br/>Ultimately this film was a commercial slam dunk and for somewhat obvious reasons. It gave a somewhat interesting peek into the life celebrities and lets us bask in the glow of our adoration for Julia Roberts, not unlike Busby Berkeley did for Ruby Keeler in his 1930's musicals. Julia Roberts was at the zenith of her career in the 1990's. She has always been a magnificent actor and a terrific beauty, so I was not spared from the spell myself. However, I cannot be sold entirely on a film based on respect and attraction to a single celebrity. The characters need more substance and definition, as well as motivations that extend beyond the codependent and unhealthy dynamic presented to us.<br/><br/>While the film has an admirable switch in gender roles, it takes this too far in certain respects as well, with Julia Roberts trying to buy off Grant's character with an expensive painting. It hits all the right notes for the lonely middle America working woman. It has moments of defiance, gender reversal, and a completely submissive and buttery hunk, mastering in the art of spinelessness. The film ends with an ultimate montage of wish fulfillment, overlaid with sappy music to show the good life of marriage, pregnancy, and happily ever after. A final reminder that the script itself is void of any real identity.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie as a good piece of screwball comedy fluff. However, it is a pretty fascinating look at our culture's fanaticism over celebrities, the way the movie industry views us within that fanaticism, and our skewed complexes for dating fantasies. it seems that we can find any romantic comedy decent enough when codependence and narcissism are normalized by attractive actors and a half-baked script. A forgettable, yet not wholly purposeless movie."
"ElMaruecan82","8","2","4","28 July 2013"," 1999: the 'Year that Changed Movies' ... except maybe for romantic comedies ...
","From Richard Curtis, the screenwriter of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"" wandered through a labyrinth of cinematic conventions with such confidence I felt myself immediately absorbed by the story. Romantic comedies might not be my cup of tea, but not in Britain where tea is elevated to an institutional rank. <br/><br/>And romantic comedy is not the easiest genre to handle; it has an obligation to reinvent new comedic and entertaining situations out of hackneyed material. For instance, as soon as the eyes of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts meet in the titular area, we know they're meant for each other and that they'll end up together. But we also know it won't happen before the last five minutes, so the reason-to-be of ""Notting Hill"" relies on the way it will delay each time the predictable resolution. And when it comes to rom-coms, it's on the 'how' factor that relies the effectiveness of all the 'aww' and 'wow'-feelings, they're meant to provoke.<br/><br/>Like most romantic comedies, ""Notting Hill"" starts with two lonely hearts filled with good excuses for having lost faith in true love: an indispensable attitude to postpone the romantic epiphany. Julia Roberts is Anna Scott, a movie star, an object of admiration for women, of fantasies for men, and harassment from the Press and Tabloids.(and Britain is certainly not the safest place to visit when you're a celebrity of her caliber). And in the love department, Anna Scott had the kind of romances that would have made lousy Curtis' screenplays, when we meet her, she has 'naturally' a boyfriend, but 'naturally', it's not official. Nothing is.<br/><br/>And Anna Scott is such an obvious alter-ego of Julia Roberts that her name doesn't fool us, there's no doubt about her autobiographical inspiration, if it wasn't intended in the beginning, at the end, no one can ever dissociate the fictional from the real actress, but this is definitely not a flaw. At one point, Anna even mentions the disillusion of her stardom and the artifices she had to undergo to earn her 15 millions for a role, and then there's this little sparkle that disappear in Julia Roberts' eyes, as if Anna became the vehicle of Julia's truth. And in the process, Julia Roberts brings so much sincerity to her role that our empathy is granted for her, as it's impossible not to forgive the attitude she displays with the poor, well- meaning William, played by Hugh Grant.<br/><br/>Grant is a divorced man, running a modest travel bookstore, sharing a house with an eccentric and nonchalant roommate (Rhys Ifans) who keeps exposing his dirty soles on the table, something that would immediately cure from the most hardcore foot fetishism. By the way, I suspect the director Roger Mitchell for having quite an obsession with feet and after Rhys Ifans and Hugh Grant, I was glad we could have some glimpse on Julia Roberts'. Anyway, there is Grant as William, who despite all his misadventures, is still in love with Anna Scott. Nothing happens at their first encounter but a few minutes later, through one of the gutsiest plot devices ever written, he collides with her, spilling orange juice on her shirt, and a perfect excuse to invite her to his house, and when she kisses him, it's  well, didn't I use the word 'obviousness'?<br/><br/>Yet, there's one obvious element that is handled perfectly: the supporting cast. If you believe that nothing could beat the joyful bunch from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", wait till you see ""Notting Hill"". Now, that is a group that could have inspired a less insipid sitcom than ""How I Met With Your Mother'. We meet them during the first date between Anna and William coinciding with his sister's birthday: a lovable couple with a woman on a wheelchair, William's goofy airhead sister, a buffoonish stockbroker, they all make lovable losers (in the positive meaning of the term) genuinely supporting William and blessing his actions and decisions with the most cheerful approvals, with such friends, who'd even need a girlfriend? Except one like Julia  I mean, Anna Scott.<br/><br/>William's friends contribute to one of the best written dinner scenes featuring a game in which the last piece of cake would be earned by the saddest story teller (not a piece of cake exercise).. And the scene provides some serious and tender moments proving that ""Notting Hill"" is more than your average romantic comedy. Indeed, while the two stars in the posters might be invitation for the most cynical expectations, ""Notting Hill"" tactfully and elegantly walks on the tightrope of its screenplay and never falls into the stereotypical schmaltz that could have destroyed it, even the so-called cringe-worthy line supposed to be the ""is it still raining"" of the film, suited the story. However, I noticed that the choice of songs seemed kind of out-of-place sometimes and. I was glad, after reading Roger Ebert's review that he also was annoyed by the 'Ain't no Sunshine' montage after the break-up. Who needs a song with 'when she's gone"" when we know what's going on? (By the way, I hope you won't take this as a spoiler, wouldn't you expect one break-up in a romantic comedy?)<br/><br/>Perhaps regret on the redundancy of some situations, and the fact that Grant remains all stoical, never abandoning his British phlegm  seriously, when you know you love one person, would you take that much time before taking the big dive? Sometimes, one delay is one too much, or it betters leads up to a better conclusion. And I wouldn't have been that enthusiastic if the film didn't fulfill this premise, when it ends, it's a cheerful celebration, not overdone like ""Love Actually"", but with the right amount of positivity and tenderness, and the last shot is probably some of the best that ever concluded a romantic film.<br/><br/>And thank God, they didn't think of putting ""Here Comes the Sun""."
"olavelg","10","2","4","27 January 2013"," Wonderful comedy about love and belonging
","This is a movie I never expected to like, being a romantic comedy and all. But now I've seen the movie four times, and it is still growing on me. Every time I see it I begin to cry (which I seldom do). This is one of the very few movies that has stuck with me. I have it with me, in the back of my head, whenever I try to work out love, when I'm thinking about life, etc. It's one of the very few movies that has had this effect on me (to name some of the others: The Iron Giant, Hannah and her Sisters, Fanny and Alexander, We all loved each other so much, My night at Maud's...). I know I am not the only one who feels this way about this movie. Some of my closest friends absolutely adore it, like me, and have seen it ten times or more. Others, however, think that is merely a nice romantic comedy, that's pacing along sometimes too slow. Why do people react so differently? I'll try to explain what I think is so amazing about it.<br/><br/>The love story: First thing, of course, is the love story. It's based on the very old story about people who can 't have each other because of difficult circumstances (think Romeo and Juliet). Here it is about social class - a normal bloke from London and a Hollywood film star. But it is also about much more. What made me see this movie in the first place was that it was mentioned in a book about introversion that I was reading (myself being a kind of sociable introvert that has experienced difficulties in relationships because girls didn't give me enough space). Both Anna (Julia Roberts) and William (Hugh Grant) are introverts. Both have a hard time just expressing their feelings or immediately doing what they feel like. But still, from the first moment there is a spark between them that they can't deny. I guess that people who love this movie identify with either Anna, William or both. It's a major part of the movie: Seeing their faces, their expressions, their conversation... if you identify with them and intensely hope them to find love, you get drawn in. If not, you will find it boring. <br/><br/>For me, I have found that I identify with both Anna and William. Anna, of course, is every man's dream: The star and beauty that shows up from nowhere and becomes a part of your life. So far, as a guy, I'm all with William. But in terms of how they interact... I know that I'm more like Anna. She is afraid of getting hurt, she's afraid of giving away her heart, she has a temper. She is difficult. William, on the other hand, is the good guy. He knows that he loves her all from the start, and he never shies away from saying it. Some lines are especially poignant. Once, when she comes to his house in a state of confusion, he just says: ""This is the place"". This line always gives me the shivers. So simple. So moving. And it says so much: No matter how difficult circumstances are, his place is the right place for her. I know that I, unfortunately being a bit Anna-like when it comes to being afraid of letting go and giving away my heart, long to meet a girl who will be like William: Who will just love me, in spite of my quirks and fears, and just be there, and not give up on me. <br/><br/>The humor: This movie is not just about love, it is also very funny. Spike, the outspoken and vulgar roomie of William, provides constant comic relief. The humor is very British - dry, self- depreciating, semi-intellectual, at times surreal (but nice). The dialogue is sparkling all through the movie. love it. But I suspect that this is also a part of the film that some people will love, and others not so much.<br/><br/>Place, friendship and belonging: Ultimately, however, i believe that the reason I and so many others see this movie time and time again is because it is about more than romantic love. It is about friendship, and ultimately about belonging. About finding a place in the world that is YOUR place, and then staying there. William's friends are always around, supporting him (and making fun of each other). The love between William's best friend Max and his wheel-chair bound wife Bella is very moving. And not to forget: The whole movie is called Notting Hill (an area in London). It 's not called ""William and Anna"", or something like that. Simply: Notting Hill. The area. The opening scene is about this area: William goes around explains that this is where he lives, and will continue to spend ""his hours and years"", and why he loves it so much. This is where William and his friends are grounded. It is their life, their area, their place in the world. And, the whole movie is about Anna coming to this place, and seeing the beauty in it, compared to the superficial world of Hollywood. Notting Hill/Williams's circle vs. Holllywood: 1-0. <br/><br/>Summing it up, I guess this is why I keep coming back to this movie. If I feel lost, not sure about my place in the world, or wondering if I will ever find a girl to love who will love me back and that we'll be able to make it work - then I see this movie. It reminds me that life is ultimately about belonging somewhere, about having friends and family, and to dare to love. Not bad for a romantic comedy, eh? (and, of course - the acting of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts is superb. The filming is beautiful. The only annoying and dated thing is the music. But even that can't ruin a perfect movie)<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","This little film is one of my all-time favorites. I never get tired of watching it. Everything about it is A-One: the script, the performances, the settings -- all of it.<br/><br/>Screenplay writer Richard Curtis (also one of my favorites) makes this look easy. His dialogue is authentic, witty, charming, and brisk. His writing is deceptively brilliant. Read through the screenplay and you will see what I'm talking about. This is British comedy and romance at its best. Curtis' other films are among my favorites, too, including ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" and ""Love Actually.""<br/><br/>How else do you explain a little British film that makes you understand, love, and want to be among the Brits? This film has a lot of heart.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant is at his charming best, and Julia Roberts is simply divine. The entire support cast, from Rhys Ifans to Gina McKee, are off-the-charts endearing."
"Desertman84","9","2","4","15 October 2012"," Romance Between An Actress And A Bookseller
","Can a beautiful and internationally famous American actress find happiness with a frumpy British bookstore clerk? She can it seems at Notting Hill. Notting Hill is a romantic comedy set in London.The film stars Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Rhys Ifans, Emma Chambers, Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee and Hugh Bonneville.The screenplay was by Richard Curtis;it was produced by Duncan Kenworthy; and directed by Roger Michell. <br/><br/>William Thacker is a bookseller at a shop in the Notting Hill district in West London, who shares a house with an eccentric Welsh friend,Spike. One day, William is minding the store when in strolls Anna Scott, a lovely and well-known actress from the United States who is in London working on a film. She buys a book from William, and she is polite and charming in the way a famous actress would be with a star-struck sales clerk. Their relationship would logically end there, if William didn't run out a few minutes later to buy some juice. While dashing back to the shop, he bumps into Anna on the street, spilling juice all over her blouse. Since he lives nearby, William politely offers to let her stop by his house to clean up; since William seems harmless enough, Anna agrees. When Anna has to stop back to pick up a bag she left at William's house, they kiss just in time for Spike to show up. A romance slowly blooms as his friends and family wonder out loud what he's doing dating a movie star.<br/><br/>This movie is funny, sympathetic, mostly smart, and it boasts a likable cast of characters led by two performers - Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant - who have star power and know how to use it.While we never doubt the outcome of how the film will end,it offers an enjoyable narrative journey that endears and entertains, with genuine warmth and grace.In short,Notting Hill can be described to be a thoroughly pleasurable emotional thrill ride."

","This movie basically just connects the dots between all the romantic comedy clichés, but at least it does so competently. The standard boy-meets-girl thing is as formulaic as ever, but this time around the actors make it work really well. I also like how the obligatory comic relief character is actually funny here, that's a luxury the average Hugh Grant film rarely has. Hail Spike and all his disgusting ways. Obviously the script is very predictable, and there are some scenes in here that are downright painfully corny (""I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy"" definitely comes to mind), but if you have to watch one thing that features Hugh Grant, there are plenty of worse picks that this."

Sign me up as Mr. Negativity, but Christ how more cliché and unbelievable can you get? There was no chemistry between Grant and Roberts, and absolutely no depth to their characters outside of the ""bumbling cutesy guy"" act of Grant and Roberts' terminal bitchmode. There is a reason films like this are defined as ""romantic comedy""- because they are an absolute joke!

"Zalman666","Null","2","4","16 July 2003"," Remake of Four Weddings and Funeral?
","During the summer of 1999, this movie was so over-rated that it was almost scary. When I sat down to watch it, all I got was drama and romance that was sappier than a pine tree. I hated it and it wasn't until years after I saw Four Weddings and a Funeral that I finally figured out why. Both screenplays were penned by the same man. Could Notting Hill have had anything more in common with Four Weddings? Lonely Englishman meets a lovely American woman and just when he thinks that things couldn't be better between them they only get worse a few times before she finally isn't too busy to spend more time with him. With these and recent movies that bare the names Sandra Bullock and Jennifer Lopez, I'm convinced that romantic comedies are nothing shy of crap."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","2","4","2 April 2001"," The most shocking film in years.
","By shocking, of course, I mean shockingly GOOD. Hugh Grant is one of those actors that I have never been able to tolerate, and I have never been a huge Julia Roberts fan either (although I was truly impressed with Runaway Bride), but Notting Hill is one of the best romantic comedies that I have seen in years, easily surpassing Runaway Bride, one of my current favorites.<br/><br/>
Hugh Grant plays a normal guy who owns a travel bookstore in a tiny town called Notting Hill in London. He gives a surprisingly convincing performance in this role, and Julia Roberts is also excellent as the hugely popular Hollywood movie star because, whether you like it or not, she is a hugely popular Hollywood movie star. She plays the part of Anna Scott, the film star who happens to wander into William's (Grant) bookstore while in London shooting a film. One of the things that distinguishes this movie from other romantic comedies is the hesitant way that William and Anna grow to know each other. It's true that the whole oops-I'm-sorry-for-spilling-my-drink-on-you bit is not entirely original, but the good acting and directing made over-used material interesting again. <br/><br/>By far the funniest character in the film, of course, is Spike, William's nut-case of a roommate (or `flatmate,' as William calls him). Some of the things that he did in the film are funnier than anything I've seen in years. For example, the way that he blows smoke through his nose into the snorkeling goggles, the way he mistakes mayonnaise for yogurt, or the scene where he finds out that William turned down Anna Scott (`You daft prick').<br/><br/>
While the movie may be a little bit long for some people, and as a whole, it doesn't really present anything really new in the genre of the romantic comedy, it moves along so smoothly and is so entertaining and funny that it is more than worth the extra time. I think that the fact that I am personally not a fan of either of the main stars, and yet I thoroughly enjoyed the film, says something about the quality of the movie. An excellent date movie, for everyone from first dates to happily married couples, so don't miss it. Just be prepared to be sore from laughing so much."

Even the supporting ones get their chance to shine and don't disappoint. The relationships between them is very good. The diner scene in Thacker's sisters' birthday was particularly tender and endearing. The main conflict of the movie is driven by the on/off relationship between the protagonists, as well as some external situations like the arrival of Anna Scott's bf, her leaked photos or the paparazzis. Aside from the natural dialogue scenes where the romance is built, the story keeps moving forward. And even then, the dialogue felt inspired. The third act was exciting and thrilling. We've seen car chases scenes before, but this one was filled with tense, perhaps product of the great connection the movie made us built with the protagonist. I could feel the urge and tension, which is what it's all about.

It is a fairytale. Classical Hollywood movie. It's very romantic and unreal in-fact. JR is very elegant. Hugh Grant was quite famous in that days. They were perfectly fits for a romantic comedy. The movie reflects lots of relationships and their results. William Thacker's (Hugh Grand) ex-girlfriend and his best friend got married. His sister and his eccentric room-mate be lovers. So the message is; its not important how beautiful or handsome you are perfect mate finds you and you be loved. Also there are some good quotes; ""Immortals not involved with goddes."" Or ""I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. "" I have to mention, further years good for Rhys Ifans (Room-mate) he proves he is really good actor. My favorite act is Mycroft Holmes in Elementary. At last but the best the soundtrack is marvellous and even stunning today."

","11 January 2010. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant have a chemistry on screen that is layered with a smart script and for the most part underplayed plot outline (except for the rushing car scene in the movie). There are numerous tender moments that have a timelessness element, allowing the audience to immerse itself in the emotions and feelings while at the same time the script captures the dry humor Hugh Grant very well. Julia Robert's character gets to play a role within a role with authentic overtones without exploiting the whole tabloid scene. This romantic comedy focuses more on the common, inner truth of super stardom and avoids the more simplistic approach to slapstick and overly dramatic comedic acting. The ending of this movie is a soft-landing approach that is atypical for most movies of this genre but offers more of a richer heart-felt honesty in its delivery that seems to permeate most of this movie. 8/10."

The emotional scenes are really touchy which are introduced at the prefect timing. The romantic scenes are breathtaking while the comedy scenes are hilarious. Bella does good on the modest part and spike on the comic part.
The chemistry of a popular actress and a simple boy is really amazing. The deeper intricacies of such mismatched relations are well discussed here and there.

","An entertaining and touching film about relationships by master writer Richard Curtis. In particular, the film explores how regular people relate to big celebrities, poorly for the most part, and the isolation and even alienation which a celebrity might feel as a result.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts is superb, bringing bucketloads of emotion and vulnerability to her portrayal of the movie star, Anna. The supporting cast are wonderful too. Rhys Ifans is so funny and so perfect in his role of William's flatmate, Spike, that he almost steals the show. But the scenes with William's family are the true heart of the movie, full of quirkiness, honesty, tragedy and unconditional love.<br/><br/>And yet, there is something missing. This film doesn't approach perfection, as Four Weddings and Love Actually do. What is wrong? What holds this film back? Is Hugh Grant too reserved in the role of William? Is he in fact playing William, or just being Hugh Grant? I understand why he was cast in that role, but I'm not sure he was the right choice. Are we fully convinced that a big star could be as down-to-earth as Anna? But my main gripe is that the climax and conclusion of the film are too contrived (the press conference at the Savoy) and too rushed. William never properly declares his love for Anna. All he says is ""I made a mistake"" turning you down, she smiles and says she'll stay indefinitely, then we get visuals of a wedding and sitting together on a park bench with a baby bump. The resolution of their relationship deserved more attention.<br/><br/>I generally prefer British movies over Hollywood ones, but in this case I prefer the book store romance You've Got Mail from the previous year, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan."

","This is a movie you will think that you can guess the next scene but the writer has written it in very different way. This love story between a famous person with a normal person is like a fantasy of every normal or might be some famous people. important scenes appear when she comes back after her every departure in the movie with some emotional drama and when she comes back the situation is turned into a positive way every time while the watcher is thinking of a negative response & there is a positive response from each of them. At many scenes you think that this is not going to work between them and it works out again. 
The situation showed in this motion picture has hardly happened with any famous person i think. If happened, could turn out this way , that is what this story is about. 
Julia Roberts has played her role very well actually and showed a mean and self conscious side of a rich and famous person who is afraid of loosing his fame. The other side of a successful side of an actress is also described by her.
Hugh Grant has played a very attractive but emotional guy who is always good to every person in this movie. She broke his heart and every time she comes back he comforts her. 
A good movie for emotional drama and unexpected thing lovers."

","The simplicity and the earnestness make up for the occasional finger in mouth moments. Richard Curtis just likes it light, but the film stands up above other love movies because it has genuine heart rather than manufactured sap. You just feel the difference while watching. Gets high marks for making Anna Scott an indecisive and confused person trying her best rather than a perfect manic pixie dream girl. This is also Hugh Grant's best performance, while many would rather say about a boy I think he just gets every beat and moment right here, we just like him from the get go because he's just some bloke who wants love, with obstacles both big and small getting in the way. It manages to make us care about these two, which was the only goal it really needed to accomplish. It also supplies us with really likable and witty supporting characters who make the film even funnier than it needs to be, although Notting Hill isn't as whimsical a neighbourhood as portrayed here it's a charming name so why not set it there?

","Two years ago when I first had access to watch Casablanca, I was obsessed with Romantic film series. In contrast to the contemporary Chinese works, the charm of the pure feeling flowing across the protagonists' dialogues far exceeds to the aforementioned domestic movies, as a result of which I follow the tide to find the old and classic.<br/><br/>To be called favorite does have a reason. Casablanca, indeed, owns continuous emotional scenes and conversations but I am fond of the eventual saying of William to beg Anna to reconsider. It involves a humorous sense but it doesn't cover the true flame burning and jumping in their hearts. It is more acceptable for the nowadays audience owing to its mature recording techniques and equipment which made it look better compared to Gone with the Wind. It doesn't mix any supernatural elements like About time and Passengers or the War stuffs as Allied since it is a real Romantic work.<br/><br/>I remembered each time when the plot developed at the climax; the performers always behaved such distinctive. You maybe regard those words like the legacy of the last century. But you would discover it is a silent way to express the deepest feeling shortly afterwards when you watch it again and again. When Anna's American boyfriend came to her hotel and kissed her in front of William, he didn't behave angrily or sadly. He said I think goodbye is traditional. When William came to Anna's press conference and begged her to reconsider, Anna used another journalist to throw out a question that is how much you are going to stay in Notting hill.

","Everyone I've talked to seems to absolutely adore this Julia Roberts-Hugh Grant romantic comedy. I don't really know why, I mean yes it has a few funny parts and no it's not terrible, but I don't really see anything that makes it stand out from the plethora of other romantic comedies. With romantic comedies, I don't usually require originality because I know you can't be too original with those films, but this one just wasn't interesting or entertaining enough to me. The acting isn't bad, in fact Roberts and Grant are pretty good in the movie, it's just other factors in the film that I wasn't so crazy about. The script is alright, to me there was nothing in the script that jumped out at me and really grabbed me, it was just okay, but the writing didn't inspire me to come back and watch this movie over again. Yes some of the humor was done well and there were several times where I laughed, unfortunately that alone was not enough to save the movie and make me recommend seeing it. I'll finish up by saying this. It's not a bad movie, you won't reach the end and say wow that was bad, but if you're like me then you'll come to the end and feel like you could've watched a better movie of that genre and been more satisfied. Notting Hill is just okay when it's all said and done. 6/10."
"SimonJack","5","0","0","28 January 2017"," Fairy tale romance is just so-so
","""Notting Hill"" is sort of a fairy tale romance. Of course, the initial appeal would be the two stars, Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Grant plays William Thacker who owns a travel bookshop and lives nearby in the Notting Hill district of London. Roberts plays Anna Scott, the world's most famous actress for this story. They happen to meet when Anna just happens into his bookshop one day. The screen idol is trying to get away, to duck out of her life for a while. This eventually blossoms into a romance, and that leads to a fairy tale ending. <br/><br/>Grant is the main star of this movie, and the main reason to see it. He wrestles with the unlikelihood of his encounter. He's attracted to Scott, and the thought of anything serious is too unbelievable. But, it's happening and he's there, and he needs to pursue it. That sums up the good and interesting parts of this movie. Roberts doesn't have many lines in this film. At times, Anna just seems to be a pretty face or fixture. Some of the film surrounds the actress and her entourage – a secretary, manager, publicist and reporters and photographers. Her life seems tightly regulated and scheduled. I think the audience is meant to sympathize with the heroine who can't have any time of her own, away from the spotlight, news cameras, and public. <br/><br/>It's hard to empathize, though, when Anna makes $15 million just for one movie. She tells Bernie (played by Hugh Bonneville) that's what she is paid. So, make three or four films in a year, and that's $45 to $60 million a year. It's hard to sympathize with that. Of course, money isn't everything – and really not that much, when it comes down to happiness in life. But, what this film shows, probably not intentionally, is that those who make a fortune in the limelight (obviously, not all super wealthy folks), aren't very happy. Or, they have a hard time finding happiness. That's because the money, the limelight, the notoriety get in the way. Imparting that message, however subliminally, may be a quality of this film that most won't see or realize. It may get lost in the dream romance.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film are when William takes Anna to a family dinner with his two sisters, brother-in-law and family friend. The family add the most zest and some good comedy to the film. Gina McKee is Bella, William's older sister. Richard McCabe is Tony, her devoted husband, gourmet cook and witty humorist. Emma Chambers is the youngest sister, Honey. Family friend, Bernie, rounds out the group. Toward the end, this group comes together to help William get to the depot on time.<br/><br/>This group had been trying to find a match for William. So, they repeatedly had dinners at Bella and Tony's with a date they would line up for William. Naturally, none worked out, and most were far out. One of the strangest was a funny but somber match. Tony had just fixed a gourmet meal that they are about to eat and she announces that she is a fruitarian. She says, ""We believe fruits and vegetable have feelings, so we think cooking is cruel. We only eat things that have already fallen from the tree or bush that are, in fact, dead already."" William, ""Oh, all right. So, these carrots?"" Date, ""Have been murdered, yes.""<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans who plays Spike, an out-of-work roommate of William, adds very little to this film. His character seems to be intended for the humor, but there's not much. Mostly he's a coarse slob who sponges off William. He lounges around the flat most of the day in his skivvies. <br/><br/>The film was shot in the Notting Hill district. I'm not familiar with London, but this seems like a nice residential area not far from the heart of London, to the Northwest. Of course, residential areas in such places are mixed with, or adjacent to, stretches of commerce and government. It's not far from Kensington Palace (museum) and Hyde Park. The little that the film has on the streets is a nice peek at life in London neighborhoods. It's hard to imagine though, that a bloke could make a go of it in a neighborhood bookshop that just handled travel books. <br/><br/>This film will probably be enjoyed most by the lovelorn and those who like to fantasize about romance or the perfect match. But for the most part, it's just so-so. Hugh Grant's part is good, and his family members and scenes are the most fun. Julia Roberts is mostly a pretty face. The trivia section of the IMDb Web site says that she wanted terribly to play this part, it was such a wonderful love story. Well, she forgot to bring her pep pills to put some life into her character. Another interesting bit of trivia is that Roberts made $15 million for this film. So, she accounted for 36% of the $42 million budget. <br/><br/>Incidentally, a number of Hollywood stars have been paid $20 to $35 million or more for single films. Sandra Bullock, Keanu Reeves, Johnny Depp, Bruce Williams, Tom Cruise, Angelina Jolie, Sara Jessica Parker, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and a host of others get many millions for a single film. Some also take smaller salaries but get percentages of the profits. In some instances, that has made them more than $100 million – for a single film."
"Rickting","6","0","0","27 April 2015"," Not Richard Curtis' best movie but quite sweet
","Hugh Grant, a man who has a fairly rubbish love life and owns one of the worst bookstores ever has a romance with a hugely famous film actress. Richard Curtis, ever the feel good rom com maestro, launches another sugar covered love story at us with this irresistible premise. Sure, it's ludicrous, but for many this will be just escapist as many of today's blockbusters. A perfectly cast Hugh Grant plays the bookstore owner, and an even more perfectly cast Julia Roberts plays the actress superstar. Together, they're a dynamite romantic couple, although the film around them lacks a bit. In stark contrast to the giddy laughs of Love Actually, the loopiness of About Time and smart, razor sharp wit of Curtis' crowning achievement Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill is a bit dead. It's not particularly funny with Curtis' jokes falling flatter than usual and the film drags itself out over 2 hours, which really wasn't necessary. It's more dull than other Working Title films and populated with many offensive British caricatures. Normally Curtis' eccentric, bumbling British middle class citizens are entertaining but here it's just a bit offensive and also not very funny.<br/><br/>NH has its many dips, but is made more enjoyable by its leads. Hugh Grant is very likable as the main character and while he's pretty much playing the same character he did in Four Weddings, he does it very well. In fact, possibly even better. Julia Roberts is the complete star of the show and she's aggressively likable as the Hollywood superstar actress, but more importantly she brings a vulnerable, insecure side of her character out too. Despite the lack of effective humour, the film is undeniably charming and the film is very uplifting and is also an original rom com. Emotionally, it more or less delivers for all of its characters and thankfully this time Curtis actually includes a bit of conflict in the story, something which is mostly absent from his other movies. It's not a great film and can be fairly dull at times, although to be fair it's possible Richard Curtis was aiming for a different tone. A decent rom com; not as fun as other Working Title films, lowered by a lack of laughs, irritating secondary characters and overlength, raised by a decent amount of emotion, good acting and decent direction.<br/><br/>6/10"

Hugh Grant was good, he still played 'Hugh Grant', but as a shy person rather than suave. I however hated Anna's character. I found her to be self centred and bitchy. She walked all over people and expected people to swoon over her. I found it interesting the idea of the press taking so much interest in one person and the fact that Anna said gossip wouldn't die down. I'm not sure if it's just film talk, or it shows that famous people tended to be famous longer then, rather than famous 5 minutes and then has beens the next minute. Most celebrities nowadays would just brush the incident that Anna had under the carpet, or not even care. I enjoyed the party scenes too. They had a vary stereotypical British film feel about them.

","Notting Hill is in the rather familiar genre where a royal personage (in this case, an American movie star which is much the same thing!) meets a commoner (Hugh runs a travel bookstore in the Notting Hill section of London.). In most other cases, (the Student Prince or Roman Holiday for example), the protagonists are forced by class differences, to separate, but not here. (Perhaps because the real Hugh is famous in his own right.:-)) As a romantic comedy it is quite standard. Boy meets, boy loses, boy gets-repeat ad infinitum. Famous girl meets your obligatory supporting cast of ""unforgettable characters"" who are friends of the hero and they interact warmly with the famous girl in a not entirely predictable manner.<br/><br/>But Hugh bumbles charmingly, Julia smiles winningly; they are both experts on what they do best. The supporting cast is charming, especially Rhys Ifans as Hugh's roommate Spike, and the lines, often consisting of the usual 4 letter words (a deleted scene included on the DVD shows Julia using the compound word most often used to describe Oedipus Rex. If you don't know what I mean, see the Oedipus scene in Mel Brooks' ""History of the World Part 1"" are sharp and funny for the most part. And I can appreciate the honesty with which the movie-star personality is treated.<br/><br/>Though the contrived happy ending is pure moonshine, car stunts and all, I think this film has taken its place among the classics of the genre, Sleepless, Harry-Sally etc. all of which have an equally tenuous relationship with reality. Like those other films, this one overcomes reality quite successfully!"

"paul2001sw-1","7","0","0","23 November 2005"," Quality trowelmanship
","I didn't want to like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', but in the end, I just couldn't help it. Writer Richard Curtis is a master of situation comedy, and although manipulative and sentimental, the film was constructed with sufficient skill to force one to care for the characters, even when one's head might have been telling one to vomit. 'Notting Hill' is virtually a retread of the same film: there's another Curtis script, Hugh Grant plays an Englishman falling for an unavailable American, lashings of soppy music and moments of poignancy. Unfortunately, it's obviously not as fresh as its predecessor, and moreover the essence of the earlier film has been not so much replicated, as distilled into something almost unbearably trite and false. Grant's character Thacker, for example, is almost a parody of the one he played previously; he lives in a Notting Hill that can be considered (depending on your perspective) either stylised or racially cleansed; and although (unlike in 'Four Weddings') we do actually see how he earns his living (as a cute, inefficient bookseller) this in no way accounts for the quality of his life (for example, he owns a main door flat in central Notting Hill, which is not the average abode of an impecunious shop owner). Indeed, whereas in the funeral scene of the earlier movie, we at least saw that not all of the characters necessarily lived in the manner their fancy wedding attire might have suggested, in 'Notting Hill' all the heroes are sympathetically unmaterialistic and yet none seem to in any way be strapped for cash; even when one loses their job, and another's business fails, there seem to be no negative consequences, and no-one envies anybody else's success, either. It's as if each character has to be given problems to make them seem human, vulnerable and sympathetic, but these problems are not in turn allowed to puncture the essentially idyllic set-up. The scene where one of Thacker's friends, who is beautiful but paralysed, half-laughs off her disability (able to do this because of the depth of her husband's love for her), really does make one reach for the sick bucket in its mawkish conceit.<br/><br/>Yet Curtis is just so good as writing this rubbish that I find I can't hate this film either, even though I should. There are some very funny jokes (although some lines seem virtual copies of those in 'Four Weddings'), and the romance is played by all with infinitely more skill than in, say, 'Bridget Jones Diary' (which also had a Curtis script, but which was infinitely cruder in its execution). It may all be laid on with a trowel, but the trowelmanship is the best in its class. So I find I have to give this film seven out of ten. Oh, well. Maybe I'll manage to hate 'Love, actually'."

","First of all, I must say that Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant dazzle as a simple bookstore owner and a glamorous movie queen! They made great chemistry as a couple! In my opinion, Anna (Julia Roberts) was a very charming and beautiful lady, and, William (Hugh Grant) was the same way. The only difference was the fact that he wasn't famous. When the loud men (Dorian Lough, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Paul Chahidi, Matthew Whittle) made fun of Anna in the restaurant, I wanted to kick their a****! This was because they were saying offensive and untrue things about her. I thought that Honey (Emma Chambers) looked very beautiful in the dress she wore when she first appeared. If you ask me, the funniest quote of this movie is, ""There's something wrong with this yogurt."" To me, Spike (Rhys Ifans) was really offbeat, especially when he told William that he didn't know where his glasses were, that is, until he realized he was sitting on them. That was pretty hilarious! In conclusion, I think NOTTING HILL is a great romance with beautiful music. You should see it if you are a fan or Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant. When you see it, prepare to laugh and be touched."
"montysmith-slp","7","0","0","7 November 2005"," Frothy fairy tale romance
","Impecunious London bookstore owner Hugh Grant lost for words when incognito film star Julia Roberts pops into his shop for a browse. This is the movies, so  despite the chasm between them  they fall in love. It's a path fraught with obstacles and misunderstandings, most of them comic. Richard Curtis' canny follow up to Four Weddings is in no way a sequel though it is very similar  a sentimental fairy-tale romance that's all froth and no body. Nonetheless, it's diverting entertainment and the sheer class of the stars seems to lend it substance, certainly as the story unfolds (which is basically Roman Holiday for the 1990s, with better jokes and a happier ending). Grant's patented stuttering diffidence is thrown into sharp relief by Roberts' easy radiance. She's already proved a dab hand at self-effacing comedy and she brings a scary conviction to her tantrum scenes here. Grant's gaggle of friends are a less impressive bunch, though Rhys Ifans has fun as his disgusting flatmate Spike."

","Notting Hill is, first and foremost, not a love story, but a story about the innate innocence of humanity. It shows a group of friends, who, with all their quirks and improbabilities, are accepted by each other and us as family. It gains its greatest insight by contrasting Hugh Grant's world with that of Julia Roberts, and states that unabashedly. It draws your heart to Hugh Grant's world, and demonstrates that in his innocence and naivete he somehow believes (until he thinks proven otherwise) that she should be in it. The denouement is so convincing and his pain so great that we believe that he can't possibly recover. Since he is the most empathetic character, he attracts our sympathy, and yet he has already convinced us that Julia is worthy of his world (regardless of her apparent heartlessness) -- so we continue to think that this relationship might actually happen. When he drops the ball at the end of the touching scene about her just being a girl, asking a boy to love her, we completely empathize with his pain when he comes to the realization that he may have let the greatest good fortune of his life slip right through his fingers.<br/><br/>Unique to the movies nowadays, each of the main participating characters is given significant development, and we are able to, at least in part, relate to each of them, even Rys Ifens crazy portrayal. Oddly enough, he probably personifies the innocence with which life can be lived.<br/><br/>Roger Mitchell is a genius who obviously took as much time as necessary to carefully craft this perfect, wonderfully believable fantasy. <br/><br/>I own more than 400 DVD's, and yet I still manage to watch this one at least 3 times a year. I am sure that I have seen it at least 15 times, and it never gets old for me."

You watch the whole film in one mood so it seems rather monotonous yet you would like it as there has got an appeal in simplicity too which makes this movie click. But the problem in this film is that it does'nt have anything unusual. You can give this movie a miss like any other simple movie.Nothing to watch for. The role of William and Anna could have been done by any other actor, so can say that actors of such caliber have been not used upto the mark. The story is predictable and ending is rather too flat.It could have been better had it not taken the usual path as to strive you got to be different.

","'Notting Hill' pretty much the norm in this genre, following the classic boy-and-girl-meet, boy-and-girl-lose-each-other, and boy-and-girl-meet-again pattern that most films have.  The humor used is very funny, typically British and well-hidden at times; if you don't pay attention you may miss some parts, and the emotions seem, for the most part, genuine.  (Although the title characters of William Thacker and Anna Scott [played by Grant and Roberts, respectively] can be somewhat cliche at times, and their actions may leave you cold at others.)  The supporting characters and actors, though, are absolutely wonderful.  Bella's (McKee) self-effacing disabled-person's humor is right on and the rest of the actors are equally 'real' in their character roles.  While Roberts and Grant are, as always, wonderful in their roles, it is definitely, in my opinion, the supporting cast and the characters they play, that sets 'Notting Hill' apart from others in the genre."

","In this audience-pleasing charmer, William Thacker (Hugh Grant) is the divorced owner of a travel book store who lives in London's Notting Hill suburb with scruffy roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans). A chance meeting with customer Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a superstar film actress, leads to romantic.Notting Hill is an excellent film which shows the true life of many celebrities nowadays without hiding anything no matter how hard it is. All the actors give a great performance and the plot is really interesting. It is one of the best films in its genre, the so called ""troubled superstar"" films and it will be loved by the supporters of this genre. Even the story, of course it is not extraordinary, is really close to wacky but ordinary life, with some exaggeration inevitably. Although it contains some extremely odd scenes it is really worth seeing. As a result, I think it is a great film and I have no hesitation in recommending it to people. Hilary Duff is cute, so naturally her movie is cute too, although there are far too many shots of her merely reacting instead of acting. ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"" will not disappoint fans of the TV series. Unlike kids' movies produced by other studios, this film has the humor we expect from Hugh Grant, namely, clean and good-spirited. Therefore, feeling sympathetic to Anna and William comes naturally, and identifying with the lead character is the first requirement for a good movie. The climactic scene involving Anna and William includes a couple very clever twists that I didn't anticipate, and I truly felt happy for Julia's character. The music is fun too. My vote, for whatever it's worth, is a 7 out of 10. I especially liked the scene with the child star, played decently by Mischa Barton. Especially the line of dialog<br/><br/>William: Is this your first film? American Starlet: Well... actually it's my 22nd! William: Any favorites among the 22? American Starlet: Working with Leonardo.

"selva2003","Null","0","0","31 March 2004"," A charming London romance
","Notting Hill  is a romantic film by Roger Michell. It was written by Richard Curtis (one of the top screenwriters in the UK) in 1999. As regards the plot, if we summarize it, we can say that a very famous Hollywood movie star, Anna Scott, falls in love with the owner of a bookshop, a normal fellow, in the charming London district Notting Hill. Apart from the fact that I like the actors very much, Julia Roberts (Anna Scott), and overall Hugh Grant (William Thacker), I think that this is a good film, because I also like comedies, and Notting Hill has, in particular, an original plot, and it's a very entertaining film. There are quite humourous notes, among them the way in which Anna and William meet, because he spills orange juice on her T-shirt. William's flatmate, Spike (Rhys Ifans), provides comic gags for the film. He's absurd, funny and indiscreet, but he also tries to help his friend. Even though the love at first sight between Anna and William is immediate, when the ending is close, he rejects her because he heard her speaking dismissively of him to her co-star. So, the excitement is kept until the end, when he realises his mistake and runs after her. The leading role in the film is shared between the main actors and the Notting Hill district itself. It is the centre where a lot of cultures and people from different worlds come together. This film poses a very current problem: the relentless pursuit that famous people suffer from the paparazzi. Moreover, Anna Scott sees how some suggestive photos of her that were taken some years ago are publicized. Finally, if you want, you can enjoy its soundtrack, which is wonderful. In particular, it has a nice song by Ronan Keating titled `When You Say Nothing At All'."

","Notting Hill is such an obvious warm, lovely airy romantic movie you almost don't want to say anything bad about it because of just how sweet it is. And actually, I don't have anything bad to say because I quite enjoyed Notting Hill. It was sweet, mildly funny, touching. However, the one of the best things about it was the scenery. This movie is so beautiful visually it's almost worth it, even if one doesn't get into the plot, to see it for the Gorgeus rolling hills and scenery in general. It was lovely. Lovely is definitely the word that comes to mind when viewing Notting Hill. It was pretty much almost exactly what I thought it would be going into it.<br/><br/>As enjoyable a movie as this is, I wouldn't say it bowled me over. I liked, not loved it and have enjoyed other romantic comedies more although as mentioned, as far as cinematography goes it gets 10 of 10.The SECOND observation I wanted to make and something that I've noticed is lacking in other romantic comedies is -ENDING SPOILER 2)The end was UNUSALLY touching. Rather then, when the guy and girl eventually get together and the audience gets to see that 1 scene where MAYBE they kiss-this ending went on a minute or two and showed the couple's wedding, kids, walking the red carpet. I liked that. It was a nice change. To many other romantic comedies including Truly great ones don't do that-they end to abruptly-I liked, tremendously the scene where they get together at the end,at the press conference, it was very touching and the fact that they stretched the end a bit was particularly nice.Notting Hill, in my opinion has more pure romance in it then comedy but it's an excellent choice and a must see for any fan of romances in general."

But, despite me always telling that films should be about images and only books should involve stories, I have no problem completely ignoring any of my own gibberish and cry out that this is, and you bl***y well believe it, one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>Never have the seemingly superficial emotions that well up from the Deep Good been so efficiently shoved down our throats. I saw it only fairly recently for the first time and was immediately hooked, by the lines, the story, the flow, and the absolutely nuclear power that flows from the faces of the Grant and Roberts. I wasn't really pro-Roberts and still think she invariably stars in the wrong pictures, but here she's nothing less than grand. I won't comment on Hugh Grant since, probably to balance out my love for Werner Herzog films, my brain has decided to like him to bits as an actor. My girlfriend keeps suggesting I might have a queer spark there, but she shouldn't complain, since I've been with her for 11 years.<br/><br/>The fact that they can shine though, is, apart from their dialogue, entirely due to the exquisite cast surrounding them. I like Tim McInnerny a lot, but Gina McKee is a real treat here. Not only does she beam the love that Grant lacks, but she's a stunningly gorgeous woman as well.<br/><br/>Romance, love, sunny London, it all smells of the profoundly bizarre or utterly impossible, but it all works.

Now they part. Seasons change, but William still can't forget Anna. In the end, Anna returns, and asks William to give her a second chance...<br/><br/>This is a gentle-paced romantic comedy which is full of tender love and sweet surprises. There are more than one love story in this flick- the love of Max (Tim McInnerny) and Bella (Gina McKee), the love of Spike ( William's flat mate, played by Rhys Ifans) and Honey (William's kid sister, played by Emma Chambers)...Rhys Ifans is impressive as the eccentric and yet creative and hilarious Spike, unlike the roles he usually plays, which is a delight. Sit back and relax, enjoy these tender love stories.

","Just about any Romantic film that comes out of Hollywood is practically pure fantasy.  Knowing that doesn't deter us from watching films like Casablanca and wishing we could be either Bogart or Bergman, seeing Gone With The Wind for the millionth time and viewing ourselves as Gable or Leigh or sailed on the Titanic as DiCaprio or Winslet.  Who hasn't gone through adolescence and at some point daydreamed about the possibilities of meeting and falling in love with your favorite film star?  It is this fantasy that Notting Hill fulfills for us in a wonderful romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>As William Thacker, Hugh Grant plays the average everyday sort of guy who owns and operates a travel book store in the Notting Hill section of London. On a day that starts out as any other, famous film star Anna Scott(Roberts) wanders into his book shop.  After Anna has some juice spilled on her, William offers to let her use her flat to clean up.  She seems to be appreciative of William's help, even if he is quite the bungler who hardly knows what to say in her presence.  When she leaves his apartment, William is sure his brief brush with a star has come and gone, but surprisingly Anna calls and invites him to a press junket at her hotel.  From here, the romance begins but it is not going to be an easy path to love.  There are plenty of pitfalls and hurdles on the path to true love in any romance, but they are magnified ten times over in a relationship such as this.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant may not be every person's cup of tea but in Notting Hill he truly shines.  He plays William as an ordinary everyday kind of guy, who loves has family no matter how strange and quirky they may be, is willing to put up with his very strange roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans), and though well aware of Anna's stardom is still able to see she is  a person who has emotions just as you or I or he does.  He enables us to believe that he is falling in love with the person and not the name.  As for Julia Roberts, I have no idea how much of her character is based on her own real personality, but it wouldn't be a stretch to say she has included at least some of her own self into her role as Anna.  There are times when she seems truly vulnerable, and at other times she seems unable to let the real person of Anna show for fear of being compromised in some manner.  In one of the film's best moments, at a dinner with Williams family, Anna gives a speech about stardom and how sometimes it's not what it's cracked up to be.  It's a revealing moment, and there is no doubt that she could easily be talking about Julia Roberts and not just Anna Scott.<br/><br/>The supporting cast in this film is also remarkable.  Rhys Ifan's Spike is about as dingy a character as one would ever want to meet and simply hilarious.  There is also a touching sub-story beautifully played out about William's friend Max (Tim McInnery)and his wheelchair bound wife Bell(Gina Mckee).  They have several moments together in this film that will easily touch your heart.  As William's sister Honey(Emma Chambers)is almost as quirky as Spike, but shows a bit more emotional depth.  Alec Baldwin makes a brief appearance as Anna's boyfriend, and handles the part of your basic ""too big of a star jerk"" quite well.  <br/><br/>Director Roger Michell gives us some wonderfully staged scenes in this film and each one is played out with perfection.  When William goes to meet Anna for the first time at her hotel, he is mistaken for a writer and is made to interview the other stars from Anna's film.  Later, when he takes Anna to meet his family and friends, it is a birthday party you won't soon forget.<br/><br/>Yes, like all romantic comedies, Notting Hill is a fantasy film, but it shares and fulfills a certain kind of romantic fantasy we have all wished for at some time in our life.

This is perfect casting, because if you want someone to pull off acting and getting treated like a celebrity, cast a celebrity. It really makes the movie seem believable. She meets a funny Englishman named Will Thacker (Hugh Grant) and the two spark a romance. The scenes where they are supossed to be in love with each other are very convincing (at least on Roberts' end). And it didn't fall into the stereotype of a movie about a celebrity. Sure, we see the papparazzi chase her and stress her out. But the movie isn't about that. It's about the way an average ordinary man who can get the pretty popular girl, which in turn shows the audience that social status means nothing. And if you let it, love can help you find your perfect mate. At least that's what I got out of it. Writer Richard Curtis is a gift from the movie gods. His writing is so fresh and funny.

The performances of Roberts and Grant are great, and they have a good chemistry on camera that shows and adds to the movie.  But they aren't what makes this movie great.  As good as those two are, I feel like the supporting cast, score, and direction is the icing on the cake.  The supporting cast is hilarious, the music is hip and uplifting, and the uniquely shot scenes (for example to pass time showing him walking through the seasons) are great.

The London neighborhood and the characters entertained (although hearing the starring flat originally went for $500K was a bit much.). Especially entertaining was Rhys Ifans as the flatmate ""Spike"". I had to resist feeling insulted at such a portrayal of a Welshman in order to admire the performance though. He was very good, even down to the recent cultural shift among some Celts to revert to the pre-British spellings of their names; that I applaud.<br/><br/>The sets and locations lent an air of realism, too; lots of small details. The Camera work took great advantage of these and gave us a visually rich film without it being ""in-your-face"" - it caressed.<br/><br/>The remaining performances surprised too. This was the best I had Seen Hugh Grant. He was perfect in the role. Just enough modest loveability for the ladies in the party. Then there was Julia Roberts. I do not know when I have enjoyed her more in a film. It wasn't the part, the script or her character. She just seemed ""on"" for this in a very engaging way. It was a delight to drink in the different looks and degrees of costume. She looked very fetching in the scenes where it appeared as though she were sans makeup; just basic glowing beauty.<br/><br/>The only negative aspect of the film for me was the multiple breakups. I would have preferred seeing a slow maturation of their relationship. Still, that wasn't enough to spoil the overall effect. It was refreshing and entertaining to feel good at the end of a movie after some recent things I've seen. Oh, there's room for all those dastardly realistic, rend-your-heart-to-shreds kind of things, but sometimes I just want to go to a movie to feel good.

","This is possibly Julia Roberts' best romantic movie so far. She does best when she plays what's been cut out for her - can-do-no-wrong sweetie pie. Assisted by a wonderful cast and witty script, this movie proves she does best at this than attempt something like Mary Reilly or Erin Brockovich. She should just stick to roles like these and stop pretending she can do anything else. Hugh Grant, as usual, plays the bungling messy commitment-confused single who doesn't really know what he wants; sounds too familiar. He did well but I'm glad he did 'About A Boy' and 'Bridget Jones' Diary'. I was beginning to get sick of his goody two shoes onscreen persona.<br/><br/>The one who really stole the whole show from the two of them was Rhys Ifans, who was hilarious as Hugh Grant's housemate who gets caught outside the house in his underwear and takes advantage of his 15 mins. The other supporting cast members, though unknowns in US, are actors and actresses in their own right in UK. They made their friendship with Hugh Grant's character rather real, especially when it is discovered *SPOILER* that two of his closest friends were previously his former girlfriend who had chosen to marry his good friend instead. I particularly liked Emma Chambers who was adorable and funny in his younger sister role. They don't seem to share any resemblance though so casting should have watched out.<br/><br/>The dialogue is sweet but unnauseating, believable and quite possibly real. The story line itself does touch a nerve, especially in an era where celebrities are vulnerable to daily life's activities and don't seem so god-like like the stars of yesteryears.

At any rate, a first rate little comedy.<br/><br/>When you listen to the DVD commentary you find out that most of the exposition on the other characters (the friends) has been cut out - I wish the filmmakers would rerelease a version with this put back in (assuming it was shot and not cut from the script itself).

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** BUT there are some things that makes this ""romantic comedy""unrealistic and at times almost laughable.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant plays a character called William Thacker, who's an average lower-middle class british bloke who lives in Notting Hill in a house with a blue door that he and his wife bought, before she left him for a guy that looked exactly like Harrison Ford.<br/><br/>One day, movie star Anna Scott(Julia Roberts) walks into his travel-book shop, expecting to buy a [boring] book about Turkey but instead finds true love(awwww...), or so they want us to believe.<br/><br/>[Beyond here there be spoilers]<br/><br/>
After a few dates Anna invites William to her hotel room for a little rumble in the hay which Will reluctantly agrees to. But when he arrives at her hotel room he is quickly snubbed for her asshole movie star (ex) boyfriend from america who just recently showed up at her hotel room.<br/><br/>unrealistically(after a few dates) William is heartbroken.<br/><br/>Now, it is quite clear that William was head over heals the secound she walked into his store and when he invites her into his apartment, so she can change clothes, he cleans his kitchen before letting her in and continuously rambles on. It always seemed like he was more starstruck than in love.<br/><br/>And Roberts' character rejects him on more than one occasion for childish reasons, but he takes her back time and time again. I guess he wants to cling to his only chance of fame. And she disgustingly takes advantage of him by coming back to him only when she's in trouble and has no where else to go. Not to mention her little sob story at Will's sister's birthday party, poor little, rich girl!<br/><br/>I can't believe the writer saw it fit for her character to try to ""out do"" Will's former love and his bestfriend's wife's crippleness and inability to have children by her whining about that she wont be famous forever, saying that ""one day, not long from now, my looks will fade and they will discover I can't act. And I will become some sad, middle aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while."". How on earth could that possibly be worse or even anywhere near not being able to walk and have children? As the group pities her in silence I can't help but begin to hate Roberts' spoiled character.<br/><br/><br/><br/>[END OF SPOILERS]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this IS a good movie. All the small jokes(mostly by Grant) are excellent, but all through the movie I kept feeling that Grant's sweet, smart, funny character deserved better than Roberts' character.<br/><br/>And the seasons changing as Grant walks through Notting Hill is VERY, nicely done.<br/><br/>I have never found Roberts' acting appealing but Grant is an excellent actor and apart from most of what Julia Roberts spewed out, it is actually a good and memorable script.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Many tried to tout this off as another Roberts' movie, but I found it to be more of Grant's. It's mostly told from his point of view and we sympathize with him more. He's was a babbling buffoon most of the movie, but that's his charm. Julia was able to be detached as the world-renowned actress who falls for a Joe-Schmoe type character with a Brit accent. It seemed as if the part was very simple to slip into because she had to behave as if she was herself, afraid to trust anyone outside her readily known circle. The humor of this movie lies within Grant's roommate. He was absolutely adorable and silly which made the movie softer. A lot of these British acted movies have the main person being surrounded by a large friend circle that's very close. Seems like a cultural thing because I've picked up on it with Brit tv shows. The chemistry was lacking with Julia and Hugh, but the movie was ok. A little slow at times, but not too shabby. *SPOILER* I liked the one part where they were in bed together and she tells William that men like to sleep witht he fantasy and not the real thing. They can't handle it. I would imagine that's true.

","Part of what defines Julia Roberts as a star, is that her presence in a deeply flawed movie can make it worth watching. This is true of Erin Brockovich, of Conspiracy Theory, and most especially of Notting Hill.<br/><br/>
The director of Notting Hill hopes we will buy the transformation of his supporting players from two-dimensional slapstick loser-clowns to real people, but this lazy device can never work, at least not for me (this same flaw weakens Clint Eastwood's 'Heartbreak Ridge'). Let the characters be 'real' from the beginning. We will get their flaws, and their inner strength, without being whacked over the head. <br/><br/>If Notting Hill were to have been made with the same two stars (Roberts & Grant), but with the realistic supporting characters and London atmosphere of 'Wonderland' (1999, a weak movie with only supporting roles, but no center), along with the skillful romantic direction that Sidney Lumet brought to 'Running on Empty' (1988, an infinitely better movie, with a similar romantic plot to Notting Hill), this could have been a great film.<br/><br/>
As made, Notting Hill is still worth watching, although the flaws severely weaken the romantic effect -- like sardine frosting on a chocolate cake. 7.4/10"

","I've seen Notting Hill a few times now and tried to like it more. But despite the fact I admire Roger Mitchell's work and the supporting cast, I keep tripping over the fact the heroine is, for the most part, unlikable. This ruins the movie for me.<br/><br/>
The film's premise is a good one. Likable, shy Hugh Grant plays William Thacker, owner of a Notting Hill travel bookstore. Like many people, he lives a quiet life that includes good friends and family. Not to mention a nutty flatmate (hilariously done by Rhys Ifins). But when Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) walks into his store, his world turns upside down.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>I truly wanted to like this couple. And I liked Hugh Grant's character. But I could not understand WHY a man would keep going back to a woman who treats him so poorly. Despite the fact she has a boyfriend (which she neglects to tell William), she doesn't seem to mind kissing him minutes after they've met. <br/><br/>We're supposed to feel sorry for this character who ""has been on a diet for 10 years"" and gets talked about by strangers in restaurants. We're supposed to feel sorry for her when nude photos of her end up in the news (""I was poor.""). We're supposed to feel badly for her when hordes of photographers show up at William's flat when they find out she's there. We're supposed to forgive her when she gives him a verbal tongue lashing for ""not understanding what it's like to be famous."" Gimme a break, lady. You chose to be a star, take the good with the bad. <br/><br/>Then to overhear her tell a co-star on a movie set, ""oh that was nobody"" when Grant is invited to watch filming. I'm sorry, that's just too much. Roberts tries to pull at your heart strings with her ""I'm just a girl"" garbage but after almost two hours of hearing her whine about how ""I'm special and nobody understands me"", it simply doesn't wash. I give Robert credit for trying but the character is just too self-centered for me to like.<br/><br/>The bright spot of this film is the supporting cast. William's nutty sister who gushes over Anna at her birthday party is hilarious. Not to mention the stockbroker who is lousy at his job. I enjoyed watching this group interact with William much more than Anna. They were more real and more fun. Mitchell always seems to pick actors with great sparkle and humanity and he's done it again here. I just wish he could have chucked Anna and spent the movie on them instead."

Surprisingly fast paced for romantic comedy, with concentration on being humorous, while allowing the lead characters to build up the romance through pure chemistry.  Though it is not a downside, we have both Hugh Grant and Julie Roberts in well known parts, not displaying anything new.  What makes this film special are the extras, mostly British diamonds, similarly cast to add flavor to the story as in `Four Weddings and a Funeral'.  I especially enjoyed Rhys Ifans in the part of Spike, leaving me in stitches every time he was on screen.  If it wouldn't have been for the out of character, over sentimentally, over dramatized line from Julie Roberts close to the end of the movie, I would have considered this film worth 9/10.

","It is, I'm afraid, impossible not to compare this film to 'Four Weddings', since the plot and characters are so similar. Tongue-tied middle class Englishman with group of assorted friends meets American woman, falls in love and spends the whole film in an on-off relationship with her, leading to an all too predictable conclusion. But it is not as good as 'Four Weddings'. There are fewer funny lines and there is none of the pathos added by the funeral in the earlier film. And the friends, who made 'Four Weddings', are nowhere near as good. The lack of such talented comedians as Simon Callow and James Fleet is sorely felt on the comedy front, and Honey is a poor copy of Scarlett. Spike is amusing, but too blatant at times.<br/><br/>Having said that, 'Notting Hill' is a good film and is worth seeing. Julia Roberts, although not one of my favourite actresses, is certainly more appealing than Andie McDowell. I spent most of 'Four Weddings' wondering why the hell Charles didn't go off with Fiona (the beautiful Kristin Scott Thomas), who blatantly adored him, instead of moping around after the vacuous McDowell. In 'Notting Hill' I could actually see why William would go for Anna. There are some very good lines (and some excruciatingly embarrassing moments). The ending is rather overdone. I don't object to the predictable happy ending - this is a romantic comedy after all - but the postscript was unnecessary. And it's actually not true that Notting Hill has been cleansed of its large ethnic minority population for the film - there are plenty of black and Asian people in the street scenes."

The makers very obviously wanted to reenact the winning box office formula of the former and they did so quite effectively. I preferred Notting hill, but not because it's a better film, but  because I got more laughs from it. Four weddings possessed a depth and character development that Notting hill lacks.

","The worst thing about Notting Hill is its relentless predictability. Virtually every plot move can be seen a mile off, though that clearly is meant to be part of the fun.  Oh, good, we think, here comes the scene in which William rejects Anna, followed inevitably by the scene in which his friends wise him up, followed by the pell-mell race across London to catch up with her . . . . And sure enough, there they all come.  Of course, that is the way wish-fulfillment is supposed to work, and Anna Scott is that rare thing, a convincingly nice person, the detailing of whose character is the best thing in the script.<br/><br/>She is also, it occurred to me, systematically constructed as the opposite of British stereotypes of Americans, being reserved, self-deprecating, quiet, observant and cultured.  That's important since Anglo-American relations are the film's most obvious subtext.  He falls for her transatlantic wealth and glamour, she falls for a sense of community that is perhaps wishfully attributed to the English, along with an adoration of things American that has been largely scrubbed of the resentment which accompanies it in real life.  While this is, no doubt, calculated to flatter the US market, it is nevertheless a relief to see a British film in which the Yanks are not bellowing boors.  Anna actually owns the Chagall painting that plays an important part in the plot and can explain its significance; William only owns the poster."

","Not nearly as great as its hype, but not too bad.  It takes Hugh Grant an agonizingly long time to complete a sentence -- and those fluttering eyelashes of his CAN get annoying.  Julia Roberts spent too much of the movie smiling waiting for Hugh to complete his thoughts (which explains the slowness of the film).  But the movie is worth seeing just to observe Grant's roommate-from-hell, Spike; he steals many a scene.  Best scene: Hugh Grant walking through a British open market thinking of his lost love as the seasons change from fall to winter to spring.  Great scene, so don't let your date fall asleep."

There is little point in looking for deep meanings in the movie - it is simply but effectively, a light hearted acting out of the archetypal situation in which a member of the public falls in love with a celebrity. The lines ""This fame thing isn't real..."" ""I'm just a girl looking at a boy and asking him to love her"", as spoken by Julia Roberts did seem to come from the heart though.

"Brian-75","Null","0","0","30 May 1999"," Notting Hill (US v. UK)
","I guess I had better comment on the movie, so that I actually get posted:<br/><br/>I saw Notting Hill when I screened it for the movie theatre I work at. Though I am not a Hugh Grant fan (don't ask me why) I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  The romance didn't annoy me, and the humor is exactly how I like it: Dry.  I think the subplot involving Spike and the Sister could have been left out completely, but otherwise have no complaints.  It was refreshing to see interesting supporting actors for once.<br/><br/>Okay, on to the -real- reason I am writing this review.  Just about every comment I've read has been about the ""Americanization"" of this movie... I was not aware that there was such strong animosity coming from the UK regarding this issue.  One of the comments said something to the effect of, Notting Hill was cleaned up to match the American view of London.  First off, I don't -have- a view of London.  I've never been there.  Also, I can't ever recall seeing a US based advertisement that stated: ""London: It's Clean... Stop by some time.""  I guess I don't understand.     I find it odd that my taste in movies has been grouped together with the rest of America's.  We are, after all, a country of individuals.<br/><br/>Please, if you have any insight into this controversy, send me an email with a detailed explanation.  It just never crossed my mind to open up any of -my- reviews with something like... ""UK film-makers incorrectly view America as the land of opportunity, where the streets are paved in Gold.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.""  I guess I just assume that there are people with differing outlooks in the UK.  Or am I generalizing too much, yet again?"

","It works for me.  I doubted that this scenario would get me into the movie, but the characters were quickly in place allowing for an enjoyable visit. It works better than Four Weddings because the Julia is much better written than Andie. I've read elsewhere that Hugh Grant reminds people of Cary Grant and I heartily agree with that.  Hugh shows himself to be a victim, commentator and survivor of the situation without falling out of his character. Julia Roberts is a wonderfully complex person complete with flaws that humanize the role. The supporting cast contributed greatly to elevating the whole piece.  They may look a bit familiar, but then its always nice to see old friends. On a personal note, I wish that the opening credits were on top of the screen because the guy in front of me was really big. Go see it."

","Julia Roberts' best film since Pretty Woman.  This was a romance that felt like it was real, like it could happen to you, one of those one in a million films that completely engrosses you.  Julia Roberts plays a famous movie star who falls for an English shopkeeper (Hugh Grant), and the complicated, up-and-down romance that ensues.  This is the first film I ever saw in which the audience clapped through the end credits.  Roberts is stunning as the vulnerable and open actress, and Grant is superb as the reserved, bookish man confronted with the love of his dreams.  There is just enough English humor to keep the pathos from crushing you, and an ending that leaves everyone satisfied.  The direction is great, the Notting Hill / Portabello Road setting is quaintly beautiful.  This is _the_ great romance of 1999."

"Ebo","8","0","0","28 May 1999"," A romantic comedy that really works
","This movie is a kind of scrambled clone of Richard Curtis's other great romantic comedy, Four Weddings and a Funeral.  The nice thing is that for Curtis this is apparently one of his specialties, like Robert B. Parker writing a detective book, rather than something he did because his last comedy-romance fared so well at the box office.  He is not feeding off his last work; he is simply doing a variation on a favorite theme.  Which is to say that while Notting Hill shares many elements with Four Weddings and a Funeral, this in no way diminishes either movie, and both are quite good.<br/><br/>In fact, of the two, I think I might prefer this one.  Julia Roberts's star power exceeds Andie MacDowell's, and Roberts is given more time to develop her character, so the romance works better here than in Four Weddings.<br/><br/>The one rehash of the Four Weddings format that didn't work on any level was the attempt to find another rock and roll oldie to revamp for the soundtrack and turn into a big hit.  In the attempt to find what would be for Notting Hill what Wet Wet Wet's version of ""Love is All Around"" was for Four Weddings, we are taken through a tiresome and intrusive series of oldies and covers of oldies, the best of which (though that's not saying much) is Elvis Costello's far too faithful cover of ""She."""

"Aidan McGuinness","Null","0","0","7 March 2002"," Slick 'n' disposable - exactly what I expected
","""Notting Hill"" is romantic fluff. Like all Hollywood romantic movies, the story is kept simple. In this case the plot's about as complex as an episode of Barney. Julia Roberts plays Anna Scott, while Hugh Grant is William Thacker. Thacker owns a book shop into which Scott wanders. Stuff happens, they fall for one another but there's only one problem - Scott is the world's most famous actress: can she fall in love with a normal man? (Can you guess the answer? Can you can you?!)<br/><br/>Hugh Grant doesn't grate here too much here as, once again, he plays the stuttering, mild-mannered foppish Enlish gent. His character is reasonably amusing, making dry self-referential remarks. His flat mate, played by Rhys Ifans, provides the more obvious humour by being Stock Character #25: The crazy flat mate. Roberts doesn't do much in this flick - she certainly doesn't seem to bother acting a whole lot. Her character is, easily, the most dull. She goes from stand-off cold to vague-hint-of-warmth, with a little dash of I-can-be-crazy-sometimes.<br/><br/>The script isn't exactly overwhelming. It's well enough written, and not all that dull. Credit for the fact they don't overplay the humour but keep it mild, or that the romance doesn't descend into slush, but kept at a fairly entertaining level. There's very little in the way of twists or surprises, but that's to be expected.. The movie also looks fairly pretty, ably directed by Roger Mitchell. Nothing fancy, but the shots are framed well, the locations set right to give the relevant emotions of the moment.<br/><br/>""Notting Hill"" was obviously made-to-order, created with a set audience in mind. As such it's not exactly a wondrous movie but it's perfectly adequate at what it attempts to do. A reasonably addition to the genre - 6.5/10"

","Hugh Grant bats his eyelids too much.  Julia Roberts, well this is pretty much her most likeable performance since Pretty Woman.  Rhys Ifans as Spike steals a couple scenes out from under both.  A better than average British romantic comedy which deteriorates due to a familiar mad chase to fix the relationship ending.  The Brits own the copyright on this type of ending. But the press conference climax was completely unbelievable.  In fact, making Julia Roberts a world renowned movie star wasn't the best idea. Perhaps if she was more low key like a an Author, or an Heiress, or a Cellist, it would have made the story easier to swallow.  A big time Hollywood goddess falling for a book salesman in some seedy London district for more than a diversion is a fairy-tale at best.<br/><br/>Not the worst comedy romance you'll ever see, and not the best.

Hugh Grant in reality is a fairly boring and very type cast actor and so, unfortunately, is the plot.<br/><br/>So, the real test for this film,for me, was always going to be if it could rise above these obvious shortcomings, and in general it does seemed to do so.  The script, which has to be the main star, is brilliant.  Better than 4 Weddings and a Funeral, Richard Curtis inserts many more ""Blackadder"" moments, which will have many in stitches.  Julia Roberts is as engaging as ever and revels in the apparent auto-biographical nature of her part.<br/><br/>The support cast is universally brilliant, although stand outs include: Rhys Ifans who is hilarious as Spike, Hugh Grant's flat mate;  Tim (Darling) McInnerny and Gina McKee both excel making a touching couple, and Dylan Moran is unforgettable in his tiny part as the shop lifter.<br/><br/>I was a sceptical viewer, but I was pleasantly surprised, it is better than 4 Weddings, so worth seeing for all those, like me, who initially refused to just see a rehash of the same film."

There were also a lot of genuinely funny lines, and I particularly like Spike, the boorish Welsh roommate.<br/><br/>But the completely unrealistic portrayal of the subject matter rubbed me the wrong way. Okay, you may say this was meant to be escapist, so that I shouldn't judge it for its lack of interest in realism.  Maybe if I could believe its makers never meant it to be seen as anything but an unrealistic, escapist fantasy, I could agree with that.  But this movie seems to be trying to pass itself off as reality. At best, that's an insult to my intelligence -- to expect me to believe the events in this movie could really happen.

She isn't just a pretty face. She plays the part to its fullest - I did want to be William Thacker. I want to go buy a bookshop and have her visit. <br/><br/>Isn't that what movies are about? Showing you the world as it could be, not how it is. Sometimes that's dark and scary, sometimes it's light and happy.<br/><br/>
I want to live in the movie W8 - you can keep the real world!"
"dukemantee","Null","0","0","25 November 2000"," ""spoiler"" regarding uneven denouncement
","Here is another 1999 comedy centered around the film industry. The problem with ""The Muse"", ""Bowfinger"", and this film is the unrealistic depiction of Hollywood. The screenplay Sharon Stone inspires Albert Brooks to write, an aquarium picture for Jim Carrey, or 'Chubby Rain' from the Martin/Murphy comedy, sounded awful. In ""Notting Hill"", Roberts is an actress starring in a fictional space opera that looks a lot like ""Barbarella"". I think Roberts as an actress peripherally suggestive of herself would have been a more interesting concept. Hugh Grant is exasperating in this role, and throughout his career. His work was good in assemble pieces like ""Sense and Sensibility"" or ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", and I must acknowledge appreciating the ""Coma""-like medical thriller ""Extreme Measures"", but the majority of his performances are variations of himself. I think Tim Roth or Julian Sands would have brought complexity to this character, sadly neither possess Grant's boyish splendor. Something the producers felt would appeal more toward women. It is the same feminine friendly bottling that robs this film of a potentially thought-provoking ending. After having been twice scorned by Roberts, Grant rebuffs her proposal to resume dating. Instead of ending on this note, the film has Grant, with friends and family in tow, driving wildly around London in a feverish attempt at reconciliation. If only he had cast her off and started anew, instead of a rehash of Roberts' insipid ""My Best Friend Wedding"". I liked Gina McKee and Emma Chambers as his younger sister and wheelchair bound friend. An interesting illustration of the passage of time as Grant walks down the street while 'Ain't no Sunshine when she's Gone' plays on the soundtrack, is impressive. Also, Grant impersonating a journalist from 'Horse & Hound' magazine (does this publication actually exist?) is quite humorous. 2.5 out of 4 stars."

","(MILD SPOILER ALERT - SPOILERS AT END OF COMMENTS)...... The big problem that my wife and I both had with this movie was that we just couldn't muster a lot of sympathy for Julia Robert's character - she never seemed to earn the trust and love of William, the bookkeeper (and is it me, or does Hugh Grant have a patent on this type of character?).<br/><br/>The supporting cast is superb, however (particularly Rhys Ifans), and there was enough witty dialog to redeem the film somewhat.   All in all, a somewhat enjoyable if ultimately lightweight movie.<br/><br/>
<SPOILERS><br/><br/>P.S. The plot is pretty predictable - you just know that when William opens the door in his pajamas he'll be faced with a sea of photographers; you know that at some point towards the end of the movie that Will will have to go through a bunch of cartoon names to try to hook up with Anna - sheesh, my wife and I even said ""I'll bet Will's wearing the scuba goggles at the movie""...and sure enough, he was.

"Dodger-9","9","0","0","14 October 2000"," A sublime carnival
","Richard Curtis penned one of the most successful British comedies ever to grace the silver screen, and in 1999, that really nice bloke who brought the world Black Adder, The Vicar of Dibley and probably saved millions through Comic Relief went and did it again.<br/><br/>  Against all odds, Curtis reworked the Four Weddings formula, re-teamed with producer Duncan Kenworthy and star Hugh Grant to deliver one of the most likeable comedies since, well, Four Weddings. <br/><br/>     Many of the press picked up on the Curtis formula for making hit movies and you can see their point - to a degree. Admittedly, as with Four Weddings, there is Hugh Grant (playing bookshop owner William Thacker), likeable, unsure of himself, stumbling through life without a steady partner, blessed by a close circle of friends who are all very loveable; yes there is a character with a disability, this time around it's Gina McKee in a wheelchair.<br/><br/>    Emma Chambers - a very good, intelligent actress if you're ever lucky enough to spend half an hour in her company - plays Thacker's colurful sister; a role which in a previous incarnation would have been played by Charlotte Coleman (Scarlett from that Weddings movie). Thacker has a scummy Welsh flatmate in the form of Spike (Rhys Ifans from Twin Towns) who wears really dirty pants and even dirtier T shirts - but has a heart of gold, which comes as no surprise to anyone.<br/><br/> So, into this happy throng comes the most famous actress on the planet - Anna (Julia Roberts). In probably her best role to date, Roberts gets a rare chance to prove that yes, she really is quite good at this thesping lark. Never for a minute do you think that, no - wait a minute - she could never be the most successful actress in the world. It's for this reason that a dinner party in honour of Thacker and his sister reveals Roberts to be really rather more than the sum of her extraordinary lips and eyes that make most normal blokes feel like they've just lost a couple of weeks in a darkened theatre - when in fact it's been about 10 seconds.<br/><br/> Budding screenwriters should take note of Curtis' script. Six years ago he wrote an article in The Observer which was a definitive guide for any poor hack trying to make his screenplay real and come alive both on the page and on screen. It was reprinted in the really rather good Four Weddings script book (available for about a quid from all good discount book shops). <br/><br/>  Now Curtis is quite lucky to have, as his wife, Emma Freud (also a very nice sort if you're lucky enough to chat to her for a bit). Her name pops up as script editor and you get the feeling it should have been in the main credits for if a gag works in Notting Hill, it's probably because Freud sat there till the early hours telling Curtis why he should plump for that one and not the inferior one which ended up in one of his waste paper baskets.<br/><br/>   There are some occasionally moving scenes too. Tim McInnery helping his disabled wife into the car for that inevitable, race against time finale is something rarely seen - nor played with such throwaway conviction.<br/><br/> Good support comes from James Dreyfus from Gimme, Gimme Gimme and The Thin Blue Line; Henry Goodman (from not bad Beeb sitcom Unfinished Business and the London stage production of Chicago), while John Shrapnel (101 Dalmatians; Gladiator) is superb as Roberts' press officer.<br/><br/> The soundtrack is a little dubious but Elvis Costello's version of the old Charles Aznavour hit, She, works well and the score keeps things ticking over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the best films of 1999 which ensures you could do far worse than spend a couple of hours at this Notting Hill carnival."

","Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts compliment each other so well in this film. Hugh Grant plays the bumbling travel-book store owner who leads a simple life well, while Julia Roberts plays a celebrity with character in an almost self-analytical role. Considering she already is a celebrity with character, she certainly makes Anna Scott extremely appealing.<br/><br/>(WARNING: mild spoilers) What I liked about this film the most is that it is totally from William Thacker's (Hugh Grant) perspective. The audience never gets to see Anna Scott's glamourised world unless William is present. Essentially we're all stuck in Notting Hill with him, but on the other hand, in reality, would we ever see how celebrities live unless it is through the media. Thacker's perspective relates to the audience very well because we could all wonder about what it would be like for a normal person to become involved with a celebrity. This factor plays well in the film for comic value without being slapstick such as when William takes Anna to his sister's birthday celebrations, the humour revolves around the friends and family's behaviour towards Anna! <br/><br/>Great performances from Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, and the supporting cast. Predictable but fun, and a great balance of analysis of celebrity hype and normal everyday life and romantic comedy. ***1/2 out of *****!"

As far as casting goes its obvious noone else could have played Ms. Roberts role, but the Hugh Grant part probably exists in many male fanatasies, including this one...the only other minor change I would've made would have been to have her use her real name in the film;  I'll bet like me everyone replaced ""Anna"" with ""Julia"" anyways!

"janetkchang","Null","0","0","26 April 2000"," Great acting, art direction. Strong script.
","Notting Hill is what we might call the epitome of Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts piloted by a strong script and great art direction. Roberts does a great job of staying impartial and using what she knows as the world's best paid actress to put forth a fresh concept of a loveable but headstrong young woman who does not think it weird to fall in love with a common man. Grant plays the fumbling Englishman, who is incredulous that this star would fall in love with him, quite perfectly.  We mostly watch the film from his point of view, and since he is a likeable character, it is an enjoyable few hours. The supporting cast makes for one of the best film ensembles ever to be seen.  Rhys Ifans plays a flatmate to Will and offers many of the films gags and comic relief, while Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee, Emma Chambers and Hugh Bonneville are supportive friends of Will's.  The believability of this group is amazing. The cinematography is fabulous and imaginative, and one particularly involving shot when Will Thacker walks through the Portobello Road Market makes the film worthwhile if you are simply a cinematography buff.  Shuna Harwood's costumes are absolutely fitting and add to the film, but are still subtle.  Roberts' costumes are beautiful, and Grant makes his oxfords represent the epitome of casualness. The soundtrack is definitely one of the best for a romantic film.  Al Green's ""How Can You Mend A Broken Heart"" sets Will's sorrow without words, and Trevor Jones' original score adds a classic feel to the film. Since the film was filmed primarily on location in Notting Hill in West London, the backgrounds and sites are rich in content, and each part of the film lets us visit Will's neighborhood extensively. All in all the film is worth viewing for its eye candy and superb acting.  Definitively five stars."

The lighting is always optimal on her, her outfits are flattering and perfect. Makeup, hairstyle, yaddah yaddah yaddah. Well, I found it distracting to the story. Was all this lookism so absolutely crucial to the film? It seems like the film depends on Roberts looking like Helen of Troy to make the viewer care about her and Grant's character.<br/><br/>It was a funny film though, Thacker's flatmate Spike, is wonderful comic relief, in an otherwise predictable film. <br/><br/>Yes, I said predictable. *SPOILER* (not really though) Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy marries girl. As if there was any doubt. The lesson? Don't ignore true love. Ho-hum. I would have preferred it that Thacker goes with his decision to not stay with the movie star, that their lives are just too different, rather than drive willy-nilly all over town to get her back. Again, how many times have we seen that before? I will say that Robert's and Grant's chemistry is great.

What I think gets this working is the performance by Julia Roberts, the one liners, London itself(the terraced houses with the square gardens), the speed with which the lovers get to meet and progress(unlike the American, Wham-Bam-Thank You Mam style!!). I will see it again just to see the sparkle in Roberts`s eyes and *that* smile!!!<br/><br/>Many have complained about the music but I honestly think the song ""When You Say Nothing At All"" was just perfect for *that* moment.<br/><br/>One thing this movie does though, like all the great romantic comedies do is make you believe in *Love* in Love at first sight and you come out thinking that there is still hope in this world.

She's very successful in those. ""The Runaway Bride"" is another evidence of my assertion.

","The romantic comedy genre has been going downhill since the days of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. For years they have been romantic and, in some cases, comic. But not intelligent. Richard Curtis seems to be the remedy. Four Weddings and a Funeral was his first shot at the title as Champion of Intelligent Romantic Comedy Screenwriting. Now Notting Hill proves that ""...Weddings..."" wasn't just a coincidence. God direction from Roger Michell helps as well, but what makes it really great (apart from the script) is the acting. Everybody, and that means everybody, are great. But the one who really stands out is Tim McInnerny as Max. Just looking at his eyes moving about, suggesting all kinds of things, is really an example of great acting with very small means. He has a tendency too steal all the scenes in witch he participates. The British romantic comedy is here to stay. Only two things can prevent that. 1; American film companies swallowing the British and letting the American scriptwriters rule again. 2; The British try to make them too fast (and too many).

","I haven`t seen such a movie in a years (hey, I`m not that old, but still). Julia and Hugh have managed to catch the magic of .. I don`t know..of the thing we should someday experience. You know, I saw this film after it had been translated into my native language (Macedonian) and the title it had been given was ""I Believe In Love"". Maybe that was the smarter solution. This movie is about the profound belief in love each of us has it. I was almost persuaded that the noun LOVE was too..abstract and rare when all of a sudden this film appeared. And you know what? I finally started believing that it may be true, that love actually exists. That we are just a tiny part of the world Anna Scott and William Thacker created.

","No one can match the British comedy. Take ""Notting Hill"", and compare it with any American counterpart, like ""You've Got Mail"". That is a great movie, and I loved it. But ""Notting Hill"" is just over-the-top.<br/><br/>British comedy has a special ingredient that Hollywood has yet to appreciate: tragedy. There is often a tragic background to the funny events and characters - just have a look at ""The Full Monty"", one of the best films of the 90's. It's basically tragic. The seriousness of the situation and the grief involved makes it sting - and that's what makes it so good. I really can't see any tragedy in ""You've Got Mail""...<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Notting Hill"" is not very tragic. The situation between Thacker and Scott, however, seems to be doomed. Also, the woman in the wheelchair adds a sad note to the music. But the characters lift themselves up from the mess of their lives and make something funny and worthwhile from it. It's uplifting not only to see the harmless behavior of Thacker or the incredibly dumb-ass Spike - but the entire set of people that Thacker trust and love provides additions to the story that are just as valuable.<br/><br/>This film was probably the best one, bar ""The Matrix"" to appear in 1999. And I just want to say that I'd like a T-shirt like the one Spike wears to his date."

","One of the purest examples of cinematic escapism, and no criticism meant; a romantic comedy for the Everyman and all of it quite plausible.<br/><br/>The role of super-actress Anna Scott is Julia Roberts' best performance since ""The Pelican Brief,"" perhaps her best, period. We see Anna as William Thacker sees her (Hugh Grant), a luminous and fantastic interloper into the day-to-day humdrum, her every close-up a blaze of unreal beauty and we almost feel sorry for the guy--could even a real-life Hugh Grant deal with her?  (Nevermind the rest of us, poor losers of the genetic lottery.)  But sometimes goddesses *do* descend from Olympus (it isn't all paradise up their, either), and if Anna can find salvation in the ordinary and average, so can we.  Even the below-mediocre will have their day; would that all slackers and derelicts had the charm of the out-to-lunch Spike, Thacker's roomie (an impeccable Rhys Ifans).  Spike is a scene-stealer and never before has a funnier low-life ever graced the screen, so-to-speak.<br/><br/>But such stories can never be ours.  So we buy tickets to the nearest thing possible, and sometimes it is worth it and other times not, but ""Notting Hill"" very much so.<br/><br/>And Julia, if you are reading this--would you care to have dinner with me sometime?  ;)"

"cemk-2","8","0","0","6 January 2000"," Usual romantic comedy, but great screenplay.
","""Notting Hill"" is an interesting romantic comedy, with two nice differences: Firstly, it is very well written, nearly as cleverly and as good as ""Analyze This"" and ""As Good As It Gets."" The relationships in the film are usual (half-witted but nice young man, beautiful and rich and clever but down-to-earth young woman, interesting but clueless bunch of friends, odd flatmate, close bond among a group of losers, funny helper at the shop...) to see in a romantic comedy (e.g., Pillow Talk had such interesting and actually non-existing but believable people), and the formula is pretty straightforward: Impossible love becomes possible after a series of strange events. Yet, the relationship between the people in the film and the lines they are delivering (Hugh Grant's ""Surreal but nice"" was a gem, so was the story about honey-soaked apricots and every word off of the mouth of Spike the subtenant) are wonderfully planned. The texture of the story is really wonderfully woven and fits together enormously well. You believe the story the screenwriter tells you, because it is easy to believe that such a story might actually have taken place. Secondly, the acting is brilliant. Hugh Grant is really believable as the half-witted holiday-bookshop owner and Julia Roberts shines in this performance (well, she sort of plays her real self, the international superstar, does she not?), yet the supporting cast, most from favourite TV series of Britain (from ""Thin Blue Line"" to ""the Vicar of Dibley"") are excellent. At the end, because of these two reasons, a film which tells you a run-of-the-mill fairytale becomes a real gem of a story to watch. It is easy and fun to watch, it is believable, and it is really funny nearly all the time. ""Notting Hill"" is a must see and I really mean it."

I cannot recall one memorable line that was uttered from Julia's large mouth (probably one of the reasons that she's so popular with men) in this film.  <br/><br/>I also found the relationship between Grant and Roberts totally unbelievable in both the sense that an actress with Roberts IQ would never go for a poor bookstore owner, and that there was just no reason for Roberts to have ever went for Grant in the first place.

(Macho Alec Baldwin briefly shows up and frankly he would usually get Julia.) And Julia Roberts' character, half of the time I understood her problems and the rest of the time I thought she was a jerk. A difference from recent romantic comedies is that ending a relationship isn't just shaking hands and wishing each other luck. <br/><br/>Part of the reason why it all works is because this is set in England. Politeness is more common there. Also the odd ball supporting characters are different just because they are English. Sometimes they didn't feel that natural but then again I don't live in London. <br/><br/>There is some attempt to talk about our problems not being so important in the big scheme of things. I liked this but I got tired of Hugh Grant's character becoming a door mat after awhile. But then that gets straightened out too. My only complaint was that the ending (with too many close ups and songs) and its prediction of the future of our lovers, went on and on showing too much. A perfect ending is like As Good As It Gets where the couple finally kiss and go eat a pastry, leaving the rest to our imagination. <br/><br/>Despite that complaint, I really enjoyed this film. I rooted for the nice guy, Hugh Grant, and he finished first."

","It is not always possible to sit down to a film without any expectations, ones which were not already predetermined by the summer hype, the big star, and the guarantee of at least $8's worth of entertainment. I spent my summer buying into the movies (I do not classify them as films) which created these illusions of genuine pleasure, entertainment which does not necessarily attempt to indulge into the true emotions which one can conceivably experience at the cinema. I saw The Phantom Menace, Austin Powers, Big Daddy, The Blair Witch Project, and others I cannot even remember. Yes, I contributed to their $100,000,000.00+ grosses, and for the most, came out satisfied to the extent at which I expected.<br/><br/>It might seem rather unorthodox, or even hypocritical, that I am beginning a review of a box-office blockbuster by seemingly distinguishing it from the other summer blockbusters, yet there is a method to my madness. I, in fact, did not pay $8 to see ""Notting Hill"" in the theatre; I had no desire to. In mid-November I discovered that it was now available for rent and I had 2 hours to kill and $4 to burn.<br/><br/>At present, as I type my perception of the film, I am watching it for the second consecutive time. At this moment, Anna Scott (Julia's character) has just leaned in to give William their first kiss. When I saw this for the first time two hours ago, I was taken by her action. It was completely unexpected, it was a defining movement for both their characters, it communicated to me that I am going to love this film.<br/><br/>I have never been a particular fan of Julia Roberts nor Hugh Grant, never making the effort to see any of their movies for the express purpose of witnessing their performances or staring at their manufactured images of beauty. Yet, in ""Notting Hill"", Julia had the ability to captivate me with her smile; it complimented every feature of her face and displayed a charm which I do not usually affiliate with the silent expression of a perfect smile. Her entire performance as the misunderstood Hollywood dreamgirl, which one would believe to be quite nature for her, was strikely original and unexpected moving. I was mesmerized by her gestures, her quite stares as looks in upon the lives of those she envies most. It is not her character that is original: the Hollywood actor wanting to return to a mundane and simplistic lifestyle has, of course, been done before. Although, it was not her identification with the character which appealled to me, it was her ability to express the competing lifestyles within a single individual trapped in the limelight: image vs desire, body vs heart, false aura vs true love. Her dialogue did not seem to come from a script. This is also a sign of great writing, creating the natural instead of the contrived. Yet, it was the method by which Julia allowed herself to live through her character, using that experience as a famous Hollywood actress to deliver a truly wonderful, sweet and loving performance.<br/><br/>""Notting Hill"" is a romantic comedy but it is not structured around conventions. Its comedy is not designed to created side-splitting humour, its story does not circulate entirely around an unattainable love, although one may perceive that. It is a character-driven film, but not to any exaggerated extent. They are not put into situations which seems completely unlikely and ultimately results in a larger than life scenario which thrives on the audience's desire to experience the escapist's side of a situation, one that they would never be able to contend with. ""Notting Hill"" is structured by simple situations, believeable circumstances that would conflict a relationship between a Hollywood megastar and an everyday Romeo. As the events culiminate, my emotions grew and I was in tears by the time the film ended, with my complete emotional expression coming as the last frame faded to black.<br/><br/>I loved the premise of the film; the music was choice and perfectly paced and timed; the direction was subtle and very comprehensive. My favourite films are those which make an emotional connection with me, those which cause me to evaluate myself and ultimately determine that I long for certain elements in that film. I may learn that I really want to fall in love with someone who will rest her head on my side, using one hand to gently stroke my fingers and her other to rub our unborn child. The context of the film may not create ideal circumstance for me, I may not want to necessarily surrender my heart to a misunderstood Hollywood actress seeking a love which cannot exist within her current lifestyle, but great films work to stretch beyond their structured boundaries, and express desires that are in fact transferable and can exist, to a certain, simplistic extent, outside of the presented narrative. Films, although for the most part are fictional stories, work as both mirrors and windows to our own reality, exaggerating certain themes to provide a greater and clearer examination of the world around us. It is a highly critical art form, and can be a truly wonderful, moving, and enlightening experience. ""Notting Hill"" does not attempt to distort reality for the purpose of increasing its entertainment value, but rather presents a story which examines an evolutionary process of love, and the circumstances which may accompany such an endeavor. The characters may be creations of a screenwriter, but the basic experiences and emotions of those two characters are not restricted to them. We all can find our true love, and it may come from a situation as unexpected as that presented in ""Notting Hill""."

","It was the supporting cast of this movie that made it worth while seeing.  Julia Roberts & Hugh Grant were entertaining, but the rest of the cast carried the picture. When is Hollywood going to learn that ALL pictures do not have to be 2 hours +.  This one was 20 minutes too long."
"snaunton","7","0","0","7 November 1999"," Predictable, witty, charming, super cast - Oh... and English!
","I enjoyed this film from first to last.  But then, I would.  An English expatriate watching his city, watching all those amusing, articulate, silly ass, Brits, that give Americans such a strange notion of us.  And that one stunning American, Julia Roberts, liking our city and its people, too.  How could I not enjoy it.  Hmmm....<br/><br/>Well, from the moment Anna Scott walks into the bookshop, the plot is predictable.  We are given very little data to explain why the two leading characters are as they are, and not much to explain their attraction to each other.  Indeed, there is not much explanation of anything; part of its English charm are the long silences, the pauses in the rhythm of the action, as in Grant's manner of speech.  Perhaps with such an obvious plot, explanation or any attempt at elaboration would have been banal.  Perhaps that is why the real glory of the film (after, that is, Miss Roberts' radiant smile) is the eccentric collection of supporting roles, each perfectly played, although Rhys Evans's Spike deserves to be singled out as impeccably offbeat.  Miss Roberts, too, deserves appreciation for a precision in phrasing that turns the rather stock character she plays into something more interesting.  Grant, though, really does need to lift himself from that English middle class bemusement that seems his only manner, whether he is in contemporary London, in Jane Austen's West Country, or Norman Lindsay's early 20th century Australia.<br/><br/>Certainly a well-made and enjoyable film, but the principal protagonists should go on and do more and better things, as I sense they can."

","""Notting Hill"" was probably intended to try to appease Julia Roberts hungry moviegoers until ""Runaway Bride"" hit the screens. Too bad its not a very good movie.<br/><br/>Plot is this:  a divorced unlucky at love bookstore owner meets a famous American actress and they share an instant mutual attraction.  It then follows their romance through his discovery of her boyfriend, then his roommates' deception of her ""hiding place"" when nude photos of her are printed in the British tabloids, and finally his decision that he didn't want to see her again.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts puts forth a less than stellar effort on this one. Her character (Anna Scott) isnt very well executed and she seems to be trying to save her best work for the superior ""Runaway Bride"".  She has some good moments and her charm shines through often enough that you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant is lively as William Thacker, the owner of the small travel book store.   He has some pretty decent moments, and is not as dull as he has been in previous movies.  <br/><br/>The supporting cast really shines though.  Ryhs Ifans is Spike, William's slightly less than hygenic roommate.  He is both offensive and hysterical all in the same scene.  The rest of the cast is solid and well done.  Very believable characters.<br/><br/>""Notting Hill"" was just good enough to hold over die hard Julia fans till ""Runaway"" hit, but it was quite plain thats all this movie was meant to be.

"Erica-19","Null","0","0","7 October 1999"," Notting Hill rises above its romantic comedy rep
","I like a good, independent, totally artsy, unintelligible film as much as the next reviewer does., so I can talk about `twin brands of manipulation' and `autoerotic narcissism' with ease, researching the history of `Boxing Helena' with one hand and whipping off two hundred words about `The Blair Witch Project' with the other.  That aside, I am willing to run the risk of corniness by stating my opinion that `Notting Hill' is a brilliant jewel among movies, despite its reputation as a sappy love story.<br/><br/>The movie's plot is formulaic, (boy meets girl, etc.), but with an original twist: the girl is the most famous movie star in the world, Anna Scott (Julia Roberts).  The boy she meets is William Thacker (Hugh Grant), a British entrepreneur, who lives in the small London neighbourhood of Notting Hill.  So what happens when their two worlds collide?  They fall in love, of course.  They have minor problems along the way, of course.  And, of course,in the end, they live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Regardless, there are plenty of things to set `Notting Hill' aside from the `Pretty Woman'/`Sleepless in Seattle'/`You've Got Mail' romantic movie stereotype.  It isn't often that I walk away from a movie completely enthralled with the characters, especially Bella, Max's wife.  She is confined to a wheelchair but still an exceptional and elegant woman.  Her husband shows such obvious adoration in his gentle lifting her off to bed.<br/><br/>They have a quiet but deep love, and the happiness they share gives Anna and William's budding relationship a kind of framework-an idea of what true love should be.  Max and Bella don't steal the spotlight, but instead reflect it onto the main characters.<br/><br/>Each member of the ensemble cast reveals a distinct personality, instead of portraying the stock characters of `the best friend,'  `the wacky sister,' or `a disabled wife.'  Bernie is not just the loveable loser, but demonstrates great comedic talent.  Upon meeting Anna at Honey's birthday dinner, he asks her occupation, and proceeds to tell the story of a friend from school who tried to be an actor but who ended up making his living as a waiter.  One of the funniest things in this movie is the look on his face when, after several minutes of conversation, he realizes who he's talking to.  People in the theater were laughing out loud.  These are the sort of characters I love.  If they were real people, they'd be invited to my next dinner party.<br/><br/>The dinner party scene is a great example of how this movie blurs the lines of casting, until the actors play off each other and have all the chemistry of a close-knit ensemble.  All the `supporting' characters are developed as much as William and Anna.  The closing of Tony's cafe is the setting of several poignant moments in the story, and I feel a sort of distant sympathy that could be more realized with more plot details.  Ah, such are the perils of the editing process.<br/><br/>The typical romantic comedy has typically bland camerawork, but the cinematography gets creative in `Notting Hill.'  There's a spectacular aerial shot of the two lovers in a park, like sparkling stars in the sky. Another innovative shot comes after Anna has left William to make another movie.  To portray the passing of time, William is shown walking through the market in his neighborhood, and as he walks, time is marked by the change in seasonal weather from rainy to snowy to warn breezes and sunshine.<br/><br/>As per any Hugh Grant movie, the dialogue is witty and delivered well; I loved the press interview scenes, with Grant posing as a writer from Horse and Hound.  Grant has considerable comic talent and we all come away saying, `Awww.'  In fact, this entire movie makes us want to just say, `Awww.' But fortunately, it's none the worse for it."

","""Notting Hill"" is one of the 10 year's best in my opinion. It is a very intelligent romantic comedy about some matters of life.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts (great and wonderful) plays Anna Scott, the most famous film star in the world, who is in England to promote her new film. Hugh Grant is William Thacker, an ordinary man, who owns a book shop in Notting Hill, London, and is not very lucky with love. One day Anna comes into William's shop and... Well, it seems to be one more romantic comedy, and just that. But it is not. As in ""As Good as it Gets"" the director uses humor to discuss some serious subjects. Here each character has his/her own problem and his/her own joy.<br/><br/>1-Anna Scott: she's the most famous woman in the world and seems to be happy. But as she says ""this thing of fame is not real"". She needs something more...<br/><br/>2-William Thacker: he doesn't have much money and is not lucky with women, although he's handsome and a nice person. He also needs something more.<br/><br/>3-Will's friend and his wife (on the wheelchair): they seem to be happy and, even with some problems, they try to live their life like everybody else.<br/><br/>4-Will's sister and his roommate: he is silly and unusual; she is quite strange and also unusual. Also need something else.<br/><br/>Well, we can see that even a comedy can be a complex film. In short, ""Notting Hill"" is a film about the celebrity life, but we have to pay attention at the supporting roles.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts shows that she can be a great actress if she wants to. She also proved this in ""Stepmom"". Hugh Grant doesn't surprise me; we've already known he is a good actor.

But besides the very good play of the main actors, there are some special highlights, which make it real worth watching this film. First of all the side characters (his friends and especially Spike) perfectly fit and give the world around William a very sympathetic note. Spike is also responsible for more than half of the best laughs in the first part of the film. Another very good point of the film is to show people with disabilities as just normal people, but without putting much emphasis on doing so.

William's friends and family are all hilairious, from his sister Honey to his friend in a wheelchair Bella (note- on the review on the front page, they say Honey is in the wheelchair. That's his sister). His roommate was beyond hilairious. I was repulsed and yet cracking up at the same time. <br/><br/>One of the best things about this movie are the wonderful performances. Julia Roberts shows us why she is the biggest money-drawer in films today. I was near tears when she told William how she is ""just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her."" Hugh Grant makes a surprising comeback from a string of really bad movies. He was charming in every way and completely believable at the same time. All of the supporting characters were well acted as well, especially Rhys Ifans, Spike, the roommate. I can not say enough about this man- he's hilairious. <br/><br/>You need to see this movie. Multiple times."

","It will not change your life, and with the amount of big laughs you will not have to change your pants, but still this is a nice film about nice people generally being nice to each other in a nice part of London. Whilst it's by no means a sequel to Four weddings it can probably only be compared to it. A formula has been found and it was obviously the intention to follow it to the letter, but don't write the film off on this alone. Some of the greatest films of our time follow a pre-determined formula and still manage to delight.<br/><br/>I'd like to say something witty and obtuse about this film but sadly I'm just going to say what everyone will say...Spike makes the film and without him it would be barren and flat."

","One of the songs I hated most in the seventies was ""She"" by Charles Aznavour. And now hearing this at the beginning of Notting Hill with the image of Anna Scott/Julia Roberts makes me nearly faint. It is incredible beautiful. It sets the mood. I knew after 20 seconds that I would love the movie. That is something that only happened once before with ""Trading places"" and there the music was by Mozart. Why did it happen again with Aznavour? I don«t know. It is magic.<br/><br/>If there is something wrong with the film it is that it is too perfect. There is not one bad scene in it. Never too slow never too fast. At first viewing I thought that the young ladies William«s friend introduce to him were a little off. But at second time I found that even these scenes worked. So it is a little bit synthetic. They tried to take everything from Four Weddings without really repeating themselves. All clichs are avoided. And that is something you feel and it made me just a little bit uncomfortable. But if it is done as brilliantly as that I do not mind at all.<br/><br/>Although I do not like Julia Roberts that much Notting Hill was in a way even better than Four Weddings. And not because of Spike but because the character Hugh plays is better developed. Playing a young man who is shy (and polite) and at the same time witty he is totally believable. This is something only Hugh Grant can do. Along with Cary he is the only actor who really gets away with the fact that he is handsome (from a male point of view). Robert Redford for example or Clint Eastwood just seem to be too much in love with themselves to be endured. If I were a woman I would probably fall in love with someone like Jimmy Stuart but if the man had to be handsome only the Grants would be eligible. Others like Paul Newman or Gregory Peck look great without being annoying but they are too much like gods. You would not really want to be with them.<br/><br/>One thing Notting Hill has adopted from Four Weddings is that the female character is not as pure, ""good"" as the male and that one can still understand why our hero loves her. And when Julia makes her ""I am just a girl"" speech I had tears in my eye. Rule of thumb: Any film that makes me cry gets a 10.<br/><br/>I had the good luck to watch the film in the original at first time. Normally a film does not loose much being dubbed. (Woody Allen is supposed to have said that the German voice fits his character better than his own and I certainly agree, same would be true for Robert deNero for example.) But Hugh«s timing is so exact that in this case the original is twice as good. But even the German version would get a 10 easily."

","Roger Michell's ""Notting Hill,"" from a screenplay by Richard (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") Curtis is a charming, engaging little movie that fortunately gets saddled with two stars with real chemistry. Julie Roberts plays, somewhat ironically, a famous American movie star who, through a series of enjoyable contrivances, keeps running into a foppish, handsome travel bookstore owner (played by Hugh Grant). The screenplay is rather stereotypical, but Curtis doesn't write these two characters off; they are intelligent, literate, and we get a sense that they truly fall for one another. My major quip towards the film was that I did not care for the ending; it's the same old thing and, frankly, I'm getting a little tired of it. Rated PG-13. 123 minutes. 7 out of 10."

","I saw this at the Leicester Odeon, London, last June. The montage pieces are striking - starting with the titles, then on with the dolly bit in the private garden, then the unexpected season-lapse tracking shot down Portobello, ending with the dolly on the now seemingly diegetically absent couple sitting on the bench. The use of found music in such passages seems pertinent because the effect is unashamedly slick and derivative. It is the world of the unattainable - the life of a screen star. And it doesn't purport to be anything 'up to date' - as it would happen with an Antonia Bird montage, for instance - because the world we are dealing in is exactly old hat (and that is the reason for the montages being there in the first place). It was courageous, in my opinion, to have such long takes. As far as Panavision comedies with Julia Roberts go, this doesn't have the same flow and exquisite close up composition of ""My best friend's wedding"", but its charm lies in the longueurs, in the intensity that the protracted shots and repeated situations eventually manage to convey."

","I enjoyed this film tremendously. Being a huge fan of Four Weddings and a Funeral, I purposely tried not to expect much from this film. In my opinion it surpassed 4 Weddings quite easily and I thought the acting from both Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts was superb.<br/><br/>This is classic Hugh Grant - playing a nervous, not so cool guy (William Thacker), who, unlike many around him isn't awestruck by the stardom of Anna Scott (Roberts). Julia Roberts portrays Scott well, showing both her business-like side, and her vulnerability. Scott immediately likes Thacker (and vice versa) but because of the worlds they live in, the chances of a relationship between them seems very surreal (a word used often in the film).<br/><br/>The audience are left wondering what Scott's true feelings for Thacker are, but we can see that Thacker has fallen for Scott. He has fallen for the real Scott, the one that is 'just a girl' and not the movie star version. This is one of the things that she finds so attractive about him - the way he treats her as a person, and not as a star.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure about the chemistry between Grant and Roberts at times, but considering the times they met, and the nature of their character's relationship in the film, it is probably spot on.<br/><br/>The story isn't all about romance - there are some good comedy moments in here, in the same vein as 4 Weddings. This is a film with some substance to it, and in my opinion, this is one of the most enjoyable film's I have seen in a while."

Especially the funny and realistic acting of the two main characters (Anna Scott, Julia Roberts and William Thacker, Hugh Grant) who played their parts, the one of a prominent actress who is besides the business life ""just a girl which stands there in front of someone to ask him to love her"" and the one of a not at all known bookshop owner with a crazy fellow occupant and a bunch of ordinary friends very convincing.

","Normally if I see a good movie in the cinema I will buy or rent it, when it becomes available on video.  Not with Notting Hill.  After the first time I watched it in the cinema, I did not have the patience to wait for the video. The impression Notting Hill made on me was so powerful, that I had to see it again.<br/><br/>Now it is two weeks later I have already seen Notting Hill three times. I am still not bored by it. Every time I watched it, I discovered new elements and things in the movie. The realistic atmosphere director Roger Mitchell has created in the movie impresses me very much. You really get the idea that you are in a neighbourhood of London where everybody knows everybody. The story itself is maybe a bit simplistic, but realistic. A normal man, a London shopkeeper falls in love with famous film star. The problems that a created by such a relationship. You can really get into the story and see it happen in reality.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts plays one of here best roles ever. She puts down an Anna Scott that on one hand has a charming and friendly character that always stays friendly against her fans. On the other hand, Anna Scott is also short-tempered when things go wrong. She acts on impulse and regrets her actions afterwards. But still you have to love Anna Scott an ordinary persons who happens to be a film star and has to live with all the fame its positive sides both also the less amusing parts of it. I had not seen any other parts of Hugh Grant, but his excellent acting impressed me. He created an ordinary English gentleman, who happens to fall in love with an American film star and does not know how to handle it exactly. Above all, he stays a gentleman. You could really imagine being him and you feel pity for him, when another problem arises. The combination Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant is one of the best actor-actress combinations I have ever seen. You get the feeling that it really works and the put down a superb performance. The rest of the cast (William Thackers friends and family) give the movie that extra ingredient to create an atmosphere in which such a story can unfold.<br/><br/>In the cinema, many other people and I where disappointed when the film ended.  We wanted to see more and did not realise that it was already two hours later. You get so involved in the movie that it seems that time stops. You become curios about how goes it further. You want more.<br/><br/>I have seen Titanic, but I found it nice but noting special. Notting Hill is one of the best (maybe even the best) romantic movies I have ever seen. The combination of story, actor, actress, supporting cast, etc. give it something Titanic lacked. I think its combination of all.<br/><br/>I can advise you to see Notting Hill. It is on the top of my personal list of good movies.  Sit back and enjoy it."
"Taz-49","10","0","0","15 July 1999"," Clever, witty, funny, a feel-good romantic comedy
","The very concept behind Notting Hill is one that most of us have thought of once or twice; just what would it be like to bump into (insert favourite actor/celebrity)?  In that sense, it gets the audience on-side from the outset, and draws us deeper, from the initial meeting in the bookshop to its heartfelt and satisfying conclusion.  In between those two extremes however, the film takes us on a journey, one of discovery, comedy, sadness and joy. It is an emotional roller-coaster ride, cleverly manipulating the audience as we sit and ask the $64,000 question: ""Will they or won't they?"".<br/><br/>Deep down we all know how it going to end, but what makes a lasting impression is not the conclusion, but how we get there. Roberts and Grant have a great on-screen chemistry; both were brilliantly cast as the 'star of stars' and the bumbling, ordinary guy off the street.  The second-tier characters were also great, adding depth and variety to the film.  Some of the lines are great, funny as, whilst others pull at your heart strings.<br/><br/>A great feel-good movie - take your girl to this movie, sit back, and enjoy Notting Hill.  You'll leave with a smile."

","When this movie first came out I wasn't sure if I was interested in seeing it, hence I stayed away from it for quite a while. Having nothing to do last night, I decided to go see it and I have to say that I found this movie to be incredibly charming.<br/><br/>The story is about how a major movie star (Roberts) wanders into an obscure little travel book shop in Notting Hill one day and becomes somewhat intrigued by the shop owner (Grant) and vice versa. Through some intelligent writing, the two meet again the same day by chance and the story takes off from there. <br/><br/>The relationship does not develop instantly as Roberts' character has to deal with her status as a major celebrity and keeps her guard up but little by little she opens up to Grant. The story continues throughout the movie showing the on again off again relationship and the awkwardness that exists as Grant tries to deal with this situation. The ending is predictable, as it is with most romantic comedies, but the journey that the audience goes through is amazingly more entertaining than the other romantic comedies that I've seen. As with other movies of this genre, it is endearing and humorous, but what separates this movie from the others, is the incredible witt of the writing. The humor is laced throughout very frequently and when you're not laughing, you're truely caught up in the emotions that the characters feel as they try to work out the awkward situation that they feel. The only criticism that I can state is that the ending seems to be wrapped up a little too neatly and hastily but that may more to do with time constraints than anything.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this movie to be a pleasant surprise that women will definately like but men will also enjoy very much....8/10."

","Julia Roberts smile lights up the screen as she portrays an actress not unlike herself. She drops into Hugh Grant's Travel Book-only book store and the sparks begin to fly. Grant's family and friends are there for comedic and moral support. The story moves right along, and just when you might be getting bored, Roberts smiles, or Grant gets that hurt puppy dog look in his eyes. That's the kind of film this is. A pleasant romance like they used to make will be a fine alternative to the action/adventures filling up the summer screens. You could do a lot worse."

","The first review on this page put me off seeing Notting Hill, but also made me flick through the published screenplay for the reportedly distracting Americanisms. I still can't comment on the film per se, but I ended up laughing in a bookshop over the first fifty pages of the script. If an assistant hadn't begun staring I'd have finished it there and lost Richard Curtis a sale.<br/><br/>I do agree that there are jarring Americanisms - I'm not concerned about that generally but while most seemed picked to work for both US and UK audiences, a couple were really obscure. That aside, it's a warmly smart and at times extremely funny script.<br/><br/>There are parallels to Four Weddings and a Funeral but they're style rather than content: if you've seen Four Weddings you will hear Hugh Grant's voice as you read his dialogue, for instance.<br/><br/>I'd like to see Richard Curtis trying something other than romantic comedy on the big screen (he's already done much on television) but refreshingly so would he: right at the end of the published screenplay he mentions that he hopes this is the last one he writes.<br/><br/>PS.

Hugh Grant with his bewildered blue eyes and Julia Roberts with her smile etc etc (and Rhys ""Spike"" with his utter lack of hygiene). Anyway, there was too much of the staring thing and not enough acceleration although I guess they had to hide the fact that it was really just ""together apart together apart together"" the whole time.

","There is something almost surreal about a good movie.  If you like it, it can make your day, put you in a good mood or perhaps brighten your spirits for a time being.  But if it's really good, not only does it become a part of your life, but it almost becomes folk lore between you and your friends. Raiders of the Lost Ark was like that and although I'm not saying that Notting Hill will have legs the same way that Raiders does, it certainly is a movie that I and one of my very good friends named Nadia, won't soon forget.  Because I think in a way, although we were good friends before this film came out, Notting Hill added another level to it.  It gave us something that we could both quote, and then subsequently laugh at the same memories from the film.  And that is what makes film the great medium that it is. It can bring people together with a simple laugh or a tear that one shared together.  Notting Hill is definitely in the laughter category.  And for that we can completely thank the little known Welsh actor named Ryhes Ifans, who plays Spike.  Back to him in a few minutes.<br/><br/>Notting Hill is the story of a simple man that leads an unspectacular life. Suddenly one day Anna Scott, the biggest film star in the world walks into his bookstore and changes his life forever.  They develop a relationship and from there we explore how they work together as a couple and the complexities that a major star must face if they choose to lead a normal life.<br/><br/>The romance in this film is really one of its great strengths.  Hugh Grant comes off wonderfully as the man who can't get Anna Scott out of his head. He is the perfect mumbling man and that adds to his authenticity as a human. Think of Paul Reiser and even Woody Allen.  They often play similar characters and their believability is also one of their strengths.  And in here it is Grant's normalacy that gets some of the bigger laughs ( not the biggest though, that is reserved for Spike ).  Take for instance his scene in Anna's hotel when he is interviewing the cast and crew for her lastest film.  He does not realize at first that he is supposed to be a journalist and his questions reflect his ignorance towards the whole Hollywood scene.  It plays beautifully and it does a great job of playing with our funny bone. The assorted cast of friends that he interacts with also make for some great laughs.  But having said all that, let me just say that if Notting Hill was a story about a guy who falls for the most famous actress in the world and it stuck to that story line with no real attempt at humour in it, it would be a fine film.  But Notting Hill has one ace up it's sleeve and that is the character named Spike, which incidentally has kept Nadia and me laughing our butts off for months ( right Nads, not bad not bad! )<br/><br/>Spike, as played by  Ryhes Ifans is electric.  Every scene he is in is a scene steeler.  He upstages everyone including Roberts.  By now I'm sure we have all seen the commercial when Spike goes out to greet the media and he flexes for the cameras.  That is funny in itself.  But what we don't see is his reaction to his stupidity when he comes inside.  He doesn't realize that he just made a fool of himself and frankly he doesn't care.  He looks in the mirror and admires his ""tight firm buttocks, nice choice of briefs because chicks dig the grey,""and he thinks his stomach is nice and toned.  If you really haven't seen this film you have to do so just to appreciate this scene and the rest of Spike's antics.  He really is hilarious.<br/><br/>As I've said, this film is one of those films that you can stand around and quote with your friends from work, but it is also a great love story and the final scenes are happy ones.  And for all those reasons I say this film is great entertainment and it is worth seeing at least twice.<br/><br/>And don't forget about Spike.  If he can start a friendship, think of what he can do to people that just want to laugh.<br/><br/>"" It's a vicious circle. """

","The story is timeless: Boy meets girl and falls in love. They come from different parts of society, and this difference poses some serious problems that they must overcome if their romance is to be, for lack of a more romantic word, successful.<br/><br/>I am somewhat tired of Hugh Grant with his stuttering and nervous/clumsy sense of humor, but in this movie he gives an amusing performance as William Thacker, an as-common-as-they-get bookstore keeper in Notting Hill in London. One day he has a very special customer: Anna Scott, the most famous actress in the world, played by Julia Roberts. She buys a few books and leaves. An overwhelmed William goes to buy a drink, which he manages to spill all over Anna when they collide in the street. To soothe the now enraged movie star, he invites her home to his apartment to wash and change her clothes.<br/><br/>And the rest you will have to see for yourselves.<br/><br/>This is a very standard love story, but it was very cute and quite touching. I don't know any actress that can look so close to tears like Julia Roberts, and Grant's verbal mistakes made the entire audience laugh. The comic side-kicks could easily fit in a Disney movie, and the movie had just the right combination of romance and humor.

","So many romantic comedies today are big box office draws with well known casts and do very well, unfortunately they often tend to be horribly written, unrealistic, and appeal large audiences. Notting Hill did away with this generalization of mine. Though not entirely realistic, it works its way around that by adding the realism by the characters reactions and development. The acting was well done all around and every character had depth and intrigue. And, above all else, it made for a simply great romantic comedy. This movie had the chance of being horribly done. Thank God that it wasn't."

","As I type, there are already 161 reviews of this film at the IMDb, with pronouncements running the gamut from ""derivative drivel"" to ""restored my faith in life."" Can any more be said? Well, I liked this film enough to try, so here goes. But first, my prejudices, so you can measure your grain of salt: (1) I like Hugh Grant. A lot. As in, I am enough of a fan to have felt ""let down"" by the, er, scandalous event of a few years back that (only temporarily, one hopes) put the kabosh on his career's momentum. (2) I tend to like British movies and/or movies about Britain.  (3) I can take or leave Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>All right, then.  What about this movie? Well, it won't make your Top Ten list if you're someone for whom any good film must be stunningly original, grittily realistic, profoundly insightful, cruelly funny, and untainted by Hollywood. But if you like **very** clever, gentle romantic comedy and don't mind suspending a little disbelief--if, say, you liked ""Shakespeare in Love""--then this one's for you.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: You might have seen ""Notting Hill""'s premise described as a ""kinder, gentler"" version of that of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" but its real prototype is ""Cinderella.""  That is, a contrived set of circumstances give awkward nobody William Thacker (Grant) his night at the ball with glamorous movie star Anna Scott (Roberts), and the rest of the story is about whether or not there'll be a Happily Ever After.  As was Grant's character in ""Four Weddings,"" Thacker is supported by a quirky (if less demanding) group of friends, but I think the film's funniest moments occur when he's apart from this cozy circle, a fish out of water in the world of the woman he longs for. For example, one hilarious extended sequence has the bashful bookseller, who has showed up at Ms. Scott's hotel suite hoping for a moment alone with her, forced to blend in among a throng of reporters interviewing the star about her latest picture (and in a candidate for the movie's Best Line, one pseud is overheard praising the Scott film-within-the-film as ""Jean de Florette meets Close Encounters""). Much later, Thacker helps his lady run lines for one of her upcoming projects, and, though he can't help mentioning Henry James, he sweetly manages to avoid laughing at the script's banality. And so on.<br/><br/>Since we're never allowed inside the head of Roberts' Anna Scott, the movie is really Grant's to carry, and he does it brilliantly. Alas, though, this role won't help the actor shake his quite undeserved reputation for always playing the same character: Thacker is a variation on Grant's trademark ""charming bumbler."" But in this film he surely proves (for those who still had doubts) that nobody bumbles better. And Roberts, for her part, provides the perfect romantic foil with her dazzling, high-strung-but-superficially-breezy Anna Scott. There's a real chemistry between the two leads. Grant also plays well off Rhys Ifans, a Welsh actor who jump-starts his career here with a turn as Thacker's strangely endearing flatmate from Hell. And, oh, yes--Alec Baldwin appears briefly as Roberts' horrible Hollywood boyfriend, a one-man answer to the question ""Why would a girl like her turn to a regular guy like Grant's character?""<br/><br/>More interesting to me than the moot question of whether two ""real people"" from such different worlds could ever meet and connect, though, is the question of whether the audience-pleasing ""Notting Hill"" is ultimately an example of the very sort of slick cinematic product it mocks. For, though it satirizes, it also panders, concluding with a Hollywood-style happy ending which is strangely un-integral to the film as a whole. Are writer and director being cleverly post-modern, or just ironically clueless? To be honest, I don't think it matters. Even without the bittersweet ending that I think would've been more appropriate, this movie delivers many, many pleasures."

","Notting Hill packs some surprises. The lead (Hugh Grant) goes through a lot of turmoil to finally, get the girl (Julia Roberts).

But, when he finally realises that she likes to be with him, he doesn't go out of his way to keep her.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot of chemistry going on between the two of them either. It's like ""Okay, let's have dinner. Or Okay let's jump this fence."" Not much passion there.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great, I especially like Bella, William's wheelchair bound ex-lover.

Julia Roberts is tolerable and the situation passingly interesting (every man's fantasy really) but just didn't do much for me.

One would think he'd have the entire city banging at his door.<br/><br/>The dialog between the two never gets down to a lot of the ""real"" nitty-gritty"" things one would normally hear in a developing relationship (we never hear him ask HER if she is married or has a boyfriend), and they spend little time talking about things they have in common.<br/><br/>All of the characters, including the supporting cast, are imperfect, which I believe is a plus.

","I must say that like most guys with a wife or girlfriend, I live in the fear of the dreaded chick flick. Some women find this distinction of a film insulting, but it's actually something they should be proud of. Some filmmakers have gone to the trouble to make films just for women that will be of no interest whatsoever to men, and therefore providing an appropriate penance to subject their man to if he is in need of discipline or punishment.<br/><br/>How does one identify a chick flick on sight? It's very simple for a man to peg one. Perhaps it's an innate ability given to most men at birth. Not unlike the kind that bestows the sole responsibility of killing small insects in the home and lighting the barbecue. A man doesn't need to have it classified for him, and he knows to avoid it at all costs. But a man must also learn to develop something of an immunity to tolerate them in small dosages. One day he may be required to view one, being unable to summon the veto power required to get him out of it. Or perhaps it's simply to negate any comment such as ""We NEVER pick what I want to watch!""<br/><br/>Some women gravitate to the chick flick like a boat to a lighthouse beacon in a tempest. ""Oh, that looks good,"" she might exclaim. While the man thinks, ""That bloody well sounds like a chick flick, better make myself scarce."" Case in point, a preview for ""Step Mom"" manages to pass one minute and thirty seconds without uttering a single word as to what the story is about, and still women flock to it on the strength of the title and actresses alone. Now that's a chick flick if I ever avoided one.<br/><br/>The main reason guys avoid chick flicks is it seems that the melodrama is specifically intended to make people cry, which ten times out of ten doesn't work on the fellas. At the very start of the melodrama, we are alerted to a high level reading on the sob-o-meter and tune out immediately. We are wise to their transparent little ploy and none too impressed at their pathetic attempt to win us over.<br/><br/>Now why all this grandstanding about chick flicks? Is ""Notting Hill"" a chick flick? Sort of. Is it like most films starring Julia Roberts? No, not really. Do we have a full fledged ""Beaches-Alert"" warning in effect? Certainly not. The fact is, if you're a man and looking for a date movie with some male appeal, you'll be hard pressed to find a better one that this. It has strong writing, good acting and was executed quite well. The film's female star, Julia Roberts, didn't really have much acting to do as I recall, and now that I think of it, there was absolutely no female nudity or 'splosions of any kind. Can't figure out why I liked it, on second thought."

I think this is probably due to the fact that she is a movie star so how hard can it be to act as one as opposed to playing a prostitute.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that the support staff, namely Thacker's Londoner family are a hillarious and a lovable combination of people.

"gueser","Null","0","0","15 June 1999"," Parody of some good fairy tale
","I tried very hard not to dislike this movie but found it almost impossible to do so. From the very start I couldn't believe in the story that it was trying to sell us. And by the end, when Anna Scott asked William to love her like an ordinary girl, it just became too tough a lump to swallow because the whole movie had been built around the fact that she is NOT an ordinary girl. As a fairy tale the movie doesn't click for me because there were such a lot of mismatched elements; elements that do not belong in a fairy tale. Starting from the very notion that a temperamental international movie star will find lifelong marital bliss with a rather befuddled London storekeeper.<br/><br/>This movie can't run away from being compared to Four Weddings and A Funeral and maybe it should be. I really liked Four Weddings and A Funeral for its comic energy and its zany but likeable characters who were all really good folks at heart. And I liked Hugh Grant there as a fumbling charmer who follows his heart in the end after a few misfires. The story of boy meets extraordinary girl but is afraid to commit reminds us of our own choices. We know what we want, sometimes we even know what is good for us but we are afraid to try and get it.<br/><br/>Notting Hill is the story of boy meets movie star but is afraid to commit. This time around I think he has very valid reasons not to commit but all that is lost in the frenetic and overdramatic last 15 minutes. From the very beginning, it seemed highly improbable that a worldly seen-it-all woman like Anna Scott would kiss a stranger who has just spilt juice on her. Taking that huge leap required me to hoist my disbelief up to dizzying heights for the rest of the movie. Before that, there was also the nagging thought that a movie star like Anna would actually agree to follow a strange man into his house and change her clothes there.<br/><br/>While the supporting cast in Four Weddings was endearingly quirky, the bunch here seemed a pale shadow of their predecessors. In Notting Hill, they are weird for the sake of being weird. The roommate Spike was all too predictable, a one dimensional comic relief who had no depth, no redeeming qualities that would help us understand why the younger sister would fall in love with him. And the pain of watching Honey make a fool of herself the first time she meets Anna only substantiated the fact that this story never intended for us to see Anna as a mere mortal.<br/><br/>And because of the movie star aura obstructing our vision, we never really find out whether Anna is a nice suitable match for William, assuming that all he wants is a nice suitable soulmate for himself as he did in Four Weddings. The writer tries to convince us that Anna is a nice person by throwing at us really deviant blind date types like the woman who wouldn't eat a cooked vegetable. William never gets a chance to develop a normal relationship with any of these dates before Anna started imposing herself on him again.<br/><br/>What do we know about Anna? She is a movie star, she is gorgeous, she doesn't have any bad habits, she can talk nicely to a bunch of people around a dinner table and she inexplicably likes William enough to sleep with him. What do we know about Anna when she tries to be an ordinary girl? She can't stand people criticizing her even though she's been in show biz for the last ten years, she is a very career minded professional who doesn't stay in one place a whole lot, she doesn't stand up for William when her boyfriend mistreats him, she throws a tantrum when her public life interferes with her romance and starts blaming everyone else, she leaves William in limbo without even calling him to try and clear things up after that episode. To cap it all off, she comes back and asks William to accept her.<br/><br/>The last decision was of course William's to make. And what about William? He is portrayed as being very ordinary. He is supposed to be an average man with no bad habits, a handsome face and no girlfriend although he owns a store in one of the busiest parts of London where people from all over the world traipse through daily. He is apparently no overachiever and is satisfied with his routine life, traveling no more than a few hundred  yards a day from his home to his shop and back. Then he has the world's most famous movie star falling in love with him. He gets to know her personally for a total of not more than 48 hours.<br/><br/>Last of all, I pity Hugh Grant for getting stuck in stuttering roles for the rest of his career."

As usual with most romantic comedies, the outcome is predictable, but getting there is enjoyable, and there are plenty of neat directorial tricks to keep you interested. The scene conveying the passing of time as Grant walks through a market is a gem. The story is highly implausible, but at the same time believable enough, and this is much to do with the genuine chemistry between Grant and Julia Roberts.

The script sparkles, the actors act like they are enjoying it, and I laughed out loud a good deal. I didn't look at my watch, which is pretty well the ultimate test for any movie, and this one is two hours long. I even came out of the theatre feeling vaguely good about life. Cheaper than a bottle of wine and no hangover. Yes, I know Julia Roberts has a mouth like a postbox but she has a winsome look and beautiful dark brown eyes filled with melancholy and longing. (Probably for another 15 million dollar role.) Hugh Grant makes you believe he deserves some emotional happiness though his chances of achieving it with a Hollywood megastar are pretty remote. Spike probably gave the other Spike (Milligan - or maybe the Welsh nation) grounds for a defamation action but at worst was a minor irritant. As for the failure friends, so what? They're nice people and they help out. I enjoyed Alex Baldwin's cameo as the boorish boyfriend. He got us to hate him in about 30 seconds. Now that's acting."

","While this movie is decent overall, there were two scenes that make it particularly interesting for movie buffs.<br/><br/>As a movie buff, there are some scenes in movies which I'll probably never forget.  Some of them are the opening scene in _Touch of Evil_, and Glen Close crying in the shower in _The Big Chill_.<br/><br/>The ""passage of time / change of seasons"" scene in _Notting Hill_ is now among those.  I was amazed with this scene, and the choice of music (""Ain't no sunshine"" by Bill Withers) was perfect.  The cuts blend perfectly together -- at least I'm assuming they were filmed separately, since it required clothing changes for some of the participants.  Aside from the obvious change of seasons, the passage of time is shown to have an effect on other characters, such as the pregnancy/baby of one woman and the sister's meeting/breaking up with a man.<br/><br/>There is a second scene, that while not as awe-inspiring, it was certainly technically well-done, and again reminds me of a similar technical feat in _Touch of Evil_.  In the park scene, the camera pulls up and angles down. At first, I thought that was a sweet touch, showing how they are just two people in their own little world.  But as the camera continued to pull up to somewhere around 75 feet above the ground, I recognized the engineering that went behind it.  My guess is that they mounted a camera via wires and remotely controlled the angles and focus.  I think putting a person up there would have been a bit too much.  Does anyone actually know how it was done?<br/><br/>So while this movie is sweet enough to see, I feel it's a must-see for anyone who likes well-constructed cinematography."

"JimC-6","Null","0","0","10 June 1999"," Richard Curtis dips, but will rise again
","I am fresh from Notting Hill, hence my stodgy English diction, which is the source of so much of Richard Curtis's wonderful humor.<br/><br/>Notting Hill, as someone else has pointed out, relies heavily on the charm of its stars, and fortunately -- in my opinion -- they are both quite charming. The Hugh Grant scandal a few years back was a real tragedy, because Grant was poised to be the Cary Grant of the 1990s -- the star every romantic comedy writer or director wanted.<br/><br/>The scandal happened, though, and so Grant returned to Richard Curtis (or vice versa), and the result, while charming and pretty funny, has been rather accurately referred to as Four Weddings and Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>Not that that's a bad thing by any means ... and the sight of Julia Roberts reducing foppish Brits to fits and stammers is inherantly funny.<br/><br/>Once again, an odd assemblage of friends watches and ultimately helps Hugh Grant win the wayward, forever-leaving American beauty.  If this is the formula, I hope they stop at a trilogy.  Then again, if there can be six Star Wars movies, there can certainly be at least six Curtis/Grant collaborations.  (Come to think of it, aren't there six Leprechaun movies?)<br/><br/>Curtis's script is strongest during the ensemble scenes, with the exception of one dinner scene where Anna (Roberts) has to prove she's more unhappy than anyone else at the table. She convinces the characters, but I doubt many of the real people in the audience were convinced.<br/><br/>Notting Hill has some brilliant exchanges.  After William (Grant) helps Anna rehearse her latest script, an action movie (these are paraphrases), they have this one:<br/><br/>Anna: Henry James films never have lines talking about meeting at 1900 hours.<br/><br/>William: Yes, and in my view that is to their detriment.<br/><br/>In one scene William's friends invite him to spend the night, and he accepts by saying:<br/><br/>William: Yes, I suppose.  There's nothing waiting for me at home but a masturbating Welshman.<br/><br/>It's funnier when Grant says it ... which again proves that charm is a big part of Notting Hill, and it has plenty of charm. Over all, it's inferior to Four Weddings, but it has two major improvements over the prior film:<br/><br/>1) Julia Roberts, at least in a Richard Curtis script, can act circles around Andie MacDowell.<br/><br/>2) Not every character has a happy ending.<br/><br/>Notting Hill is raking in big bucks as it emerges as the non-Phantom Menace movie of the summer. This should encourage more people to hire Richard Curtis, which is good. It should also encourage more people to hire Hugh Grant, which is also good.<br/><br/>And of course nobody needs encouragement to hire Julia Roberts, but if Notting Hill and My Best Friend's Wedding indicate she's seeking a great romantic comedy, I for one applaud her efforts so far and hope she keeps trying."

","Call me a sensitive sap, but I really enjoyed NOTTING HILL, the new wonderful comedy staring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.  The one thing I enjoyed about the movie is the premise.  A struggling travel book-store owner (Grant) falls in love with a world famous superstar/actress (Roberts). During the romance the couple face with many difficulties, tabloids, cruel gossip, and another relationship. The movie takes a nice approach with the Roberts and Grant characters. Roberts is a celebrity who's more concerned with her reputation than her feelings.  While Grant is just in love with a girl, a very famous girl in that point.  The romanitc dialogue is fantastic, Grant has never done a better job in his carrer.  Instead of playing his usual mumbling self, Grant plays a man who is suffering since he's in love with a woman who has much more power and popularity than him. Why I like this movie a lot is because I can relate to the Grant character.  I know what it feels like to fall in love with someone who is a million miles away and more famous than you. It is quite painful, and Grant does a wonderful job expressing his pain and suffering. Roberts is good as usual, however, she's pretty much playing herself.  A world famous actress who is a first more concerned about her carrer than for her own feelings. The supporting cast is also fun, especially Rhys Ifans, who plays Grant's sex obsessed and filthy roommate (and I mean filthy physically, as well as mentally). Like other recent romance movies such as ""YOU'VE GOT MAIL,"" ""CHASING AMY,"" and ""JERRY MAGUIRE"" NOTTING HILL is a fun and very pleasant romantic film. And with PHANTOM MENACE coming out a week before it, I'm sure it will draw the people who already seen or don't want to see STAR WARS.  But this is a fun movie, I'm not sure if the guys will like it, but I know the ladies will.  A delightful fun film!  ****1/2 (out of five)"

","Notting Hill is one of those few sequel movies that is actually BETTER than its original. Living in Britain, I remember well the hype that surrounded the launch of Four Weddings (it was labelled ""The Rebirth of British Cinema), but this movie was by far and away better. Many films nowadays are labelled ""romantic comedies"" - but most of the time, they're either not funny or they're not romantic (take ""You've Got Mail"", for example). Notting Hill was a true romantic comedy - very funny and perfectly romantic, without becoming too corny.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant fits Richard Curtis's script brilliantly - those ""uhhs"" and ""ummms"" that litter his speech make the film twice as funny - just listen to that little squeal he gives out before resorting to pretending he's a journalist from House & Hound magazine. Julia Roberts shines marvellously too - a pretty good insight into the life of a movie star. And whoever it is who plays Hugh Grant's flatmate Spike - it was an hilarious performance - my favourite line was, ""well chosen pair of briefs, if I must say"".<br/><br/>The day after seeing the film, I woke up and actually wanted there to be a real-life saga unfolding in the media about an ordinary man in the street & a movie star - and thats what I now think makes a real film. One where you actually want it to come true. This is real entertainment."

"SKG-2","7","0","0","9 June 1999"," Not as good the second time around
","Perhaps it is unfair to compare this film to FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, even though the writer and star of that film(Richard Curtis and Hugh Grant) have re-teamed for a similarly-themed romantic comedy(English man falls for American beauty who may be out of his league).  And I don't think Grant has played the same the same character over and over again(there's not much in common between his roles in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, SIRENS, and EXTREME MEASURES, for example, not to mention AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE).  But he certainly does a carbon copy of his performance in FOUR WEDDINGS here. Worse, while he was able to display a range of emotions in that film, and even get in on some of the film's funny bits(the best man speech), here, the only emotion he's allowed to display is wistfulness, and a little of that goes a long way.  You just wish that he'd get angry once.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts fares a little better, though she's underplaying as if she expected she'd have something much more raucous to play against.  She of course is playing someone who has to have a facade on at all times, but she does get to show other facets, like petulance(when the others around her are saying how miserable their lives are, and she feels left out), humor(when she shows up a group of diners talking about her as if she was a whore), and anger(when the press shows up outside Grant's door).  Still, I wish the satire on movie stars' lives had been more pronounced; what's there is good(the press junkets, the discussion of stunt bottoms), but I was left hungry for more.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the most blatant copy of FOUR WEDDINGS - the friends Grant has - is the part which worked best for me, because at least the people their had personalities to express, and they never let the sentimentality get too heavy(when one of them is in a wheelchair, you prepare for the worst, but Emma Chambers(I think she's the actress) deflects that by never playing for pathos).  Also, Rhys Ifans steals the movie, and it sorely needs him. Overall, not bad, but could have been better."

","Any movie that can make you walk out of the cinema with a megawatt smile on your face to rival Julia Roberts' has to be worth seeing. This one has it all - the story line is fascinating and easy to identify with - who hasn't wondered what would happen if a celebrity waltzed into their life? I know I have. The leads are absolutely brilliant - my faith in Hugh Grant has been restored a thousand times over -  (my faith in Julia Roberts hadn't wavered since her best career move ever, My Best Friend's Wedding. If you haven't seen it, see it.) The special thing (just one of many) about Notting Hill is that there are no weak links in the acting. With the ensemble cast it is, hmmm, a case of ""which superlative should I use?"" Gina Mckee, especially is a stand out as William's (Grant's) wheelchair bound, quietly serene friend. She adds a great deal to the already super-strong line-up. The humour had us in absolute stitches (you know, that feeling you get when you just CAN'T stop laughing and you're choking!) (especially my father!) But aside from everything else, there's something, another component to this film that I just can't put my finger on. It's the thing that will have me going back to see it again, and maybe again.....and have me recommending it to everyone I see. It's the thing that has you coming home from the film happy,  going to bed happy, and still thinking about it in the morning - and you're still happy. When it comes down to it, it may only be pure, light entertainment, but isn't that what it's meant to be? Any film that can make me feel that good gets my vote. Eleven out of ten."

","Unlike soft-focus confections like ""You've Got Mail"" (which was more about the love between a consumer and large corporations than Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan), Notting Hill has a bit of an edge to it which serves the movie well. Grant and Roberts get to zing each other with all sorts of wonderfully hilarious dialog before the inevitable happens, and the cast of supporting characters (including a wheelchair-bound first love and a sad-sack stockbroker) keep the movie grounded and the sap quotient to a minimum. Perhaps the most astonishing thing, however, is the camerawork.  The director takes some chances -- jump cuts, one exceptional scene in which four seasons swirl around Grant's character as he walks down a London street -- that pay off big time.  This is a movie that was basically presold. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are huge box-office draws, and the words 'romantic comedy' and Julia Roberts together are pure gold.  It is refreshing, therefore, to find a well-written script, great performances from all involved, and some creative risk-taking.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent romantic comedy, a great date movie, and if you're single like me, another great excuse to stare at the bottle of sleeping pills and wonder how many it would take."

","Hugh Grant as Cinderella? Notting Hill stretches the believable as much as any mainstream comedy romance.<br/><br/>""The most famous movie star in the world"" Anna Scott  (Julia Roberts) throws herself at a love lorn bookseller (Hugh Grant) and whisks him away into her life. Then, no doubt, they live happily ever after in her movie star castle.<br/><br/>Notting Hill was written and directed by the same team, Richard Curtis and Roger Michell,who created the very successful (and much more satisfying) Four Weddings And A Funeral. They have been reasonably successful at establishing the same light hearted fizz and pathos as Four Weddings, it's just that it's hard to accept that Anna Scott, would first, bother with a fellow like this book seller and secondly, that we should feel sorry for film stars.<br/><br/>Don't you just love those quotes we sometimes hear about how ""cold we were for a day while we filmed in the snow"" or ""how awful it was having to lie in bed for a sex scene for three hours."" On a million dollars a week!<br/><br/>The cult of the movie star is emphasised in Notting Hill by having Hugh Grant's family as droll and eccentric as possible. We haven't quite got the gay bachelors of Weddings but there definitely is the roughish, multicolour haired, shrieking girl. And then there's the old girlfriend in the wheelchair. And they're all strugglers and English. Anna Scott is rich and American.<br/><br/>But Notting Hill is pleasant enough if you don't mind cliches and most people don't. Roberts is in familiar territory and her strongest asset, her air of vulnerability is allowed full reign. There are enough laughs, or at least smiles, in the film to make it a reasonable buy for an audience.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant is his earnest, blinking self and is allowed more credibility than Roberts. After all it would be far more likely for the toad to accept the kiss, than for the Princess to give it."

","Consider for a moment ""Roman Holiday,"" one of  ""Notting Hill's"" obvious ancestors. On the surface, ""Roman Holiday"" is the story of two beautiful and charming people who fall head over heels for each other. But in the end it is just as much about duty, sacrifice and honor -- something we mortals could/should relate to. Now think of ""Four Weddings,"" an even more obvious antecedent: While it spends plenty of time doting on beauty and charm, ""Four Weddings"" is also about the transcendent power of love and commitment. Again, things that should concern us regular guys.<br/><br/>Whatever it may pretend to, ""Notting Hill"" is essentially about beauty, charm, and how hard it is to be Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>The slings and arrows of uber-movie-star fame. Okay, not necessarily a subject without interest. But if a movie is going to spotlight this sort of thing, it had better get the details right. So consider this: After spending a blissful night together, our beautiful and charming couple is ambushed by the press (utterly unconvincingly), ensuring that the Grant character -- as the presumed lover of the world's most famous woman -- will have his face and  boxer shorts plastered on the cover of every tabloid and Peoplish magazine in the world. And what effect does this exposure have on his life? Absolutely none, apparently. Not one detail of the impact of his fifteen minutes of fame is noted. And for an unconscionably long time he's not even recognized by any of the press vultures when he makes his startling appearance at the Roberts character's Savoy Hotel press conference. Yeah, sure.<br/><br/>The movie tries much too hard to Xerox the ""Four Weddings"" winsomeness, again providing Grant with a posse of fetchingly bright and eccentric friends. But they're nowhere nearly as appealing as the earlier crew. I guarantee you that, after spending five minutes in the company of Grant's ""zany"" flatmate, you'll want to slit his jugular. And I won't abuse you with my thoughts about the woman who plays Grant's sister.<br/><br/>Almost nothing in the film is subtle. Just about every potentially interesting plot twist is telegraphed by the Grant character's congenital inability to keep his mouth shut. One example: Roberts is asleep, chastely, in the upstairs bedroom. Grant is lying on the sofa bed, hears approaching footsteps, gets all goggle-eyed, and says ""Oh My God."" Is there any way on earth the footsteps aren't going to belong to his flatmate? And when moments later he says ""Sod off,"" is there any way it's not going to be to Julia? That sort of thing went (or should have gone) out with Clara Bow.<br/><br/>The soundtrack? Painfully, ludicrously, insultingly obvious. The producers should die of shame.<br/><br/>And yet... Julia Roberts is -- how else to put it? -- dazzling. Adorable. Flat out radiant.  And whenever Grant -- no slouch himself in the gleaming glamourpuss department -- gazes adoringly at her, the sound you hear is the South Pole melting.<br/><br/>So, yes, I'm glad I saw it. It made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I just wish I'd left my brain at home."

I thought that the script was refreshing, it was the kind of movie that had the whole audience laughing and crying and hugging at the end.  The whole cast worked so well as an ensemble, with the roomate standing out, but with all the others standing out as well.  I thought some moments were just beautiful, such as Grant's lengthy stroll down the street and the park scenes.  The way that the movie combined comedy, romance, and drama together in one film was not at all cynical, it was so believable. Okay so maybe I'm a sap, but I thought that parts of this movie could have been biographical.  I loved the soundtrack, with exception to the song that plays in the opening scenes.  The music was effective at capturing the basic tone of the film.  One more important thing- I like Hugh Grant as an actor again!  He's so good in this that I want to see him act again. This is nothing like ""Four Weddings. . .,"" which I thought was boring and hard to follow."

Julia Roberts emanates both confidence and vulnerability and Emma Chambers also does her customary mad woman.

Hugh Grant was delightful and delectable.  He plays the sad, rejected and misused man beautifully.  He can be vulnerable and funny at the same time. The chemistry between these two is touching and totally believable.<br/><br/>The moment that truly stands out in this movie, for me, is the scene in which he is walking down the street while the song ""Ain't No Sunshine When She's Gone"" is playing.

","This is a romantic comedy like they used to make. The plot is simple enough. Hugh Grant plays William Thacker, owner of a travel book shop in the Notting Hill district of London. Julia Roberts plays Anna Scott, international movie star, pulling down $15 million a picture. She stumbles into his book shop and he is dazzled. Minutes later he is out buying orange juice when he runs into her (literally) dousing her with his juice. From this accidental encounter their romance begins.<br/><br/>This a nice, clever boy meets girl, boy loses girl..... What makes this film better than most of its kind is that every time you think it's going to dump a sentimental cliche on you, it pulls back at the last second.<br/><br/>Another strong point to the movie is that it stays focused on the romance, not the issue of Anna's fame. Her stardom is used as a way to generate some very funny scenes, but never takes over the story.<br/><br/>The movie moves along at a waltz-like pace, with the couple's meetings coming only as she flies through London, shooting films, or on press tour. It is a bright and colorful film, with a decidedly light-hearted and even whimsical tone. The acting is strong all around (even from Julia Roberts) and the supporting cast of William's friends, family, and crazy Welsh roommate stand out. They all feel like real people that we just don't see much of. They have an easy comradery, a sort of group chemistry, that strikes just the right note."

","In its day (1999), the most successful British film ever. NOTTING HILL arrived in cinemas and on video in 1999 as the follow up to FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL: it featuring the same star (Hugh Grant), producers and screenwriter (Richard Curtis). The director this time is Roger Michell. It's the weakest of Curtis's trilogy of Hugh Grant/London comedies (the other being LOVE ACTUALLY).<br/><br/>Grant plays William, a modest London bookseller who falls in love with Hollywood goddess Anna (Julia Roberts, really playing a version of herself) currently working in the capital. A better movie might have been made about the relationship between Grant his scruffy lodger Spike (Rhys Ifans) - a sort of contemporary odd couple since Spike steals every scene he appears in. Instead, we get a predictably clean, summertime and glossy London that is purged of any parochial references the Americans might not understand. When the film fails to interest us, it is kept alive by a good supporting cast including Gina Mckee, Emma Chambers and Hugh Bonneville. Best moment is a coup-de-cinema where the passage of six months is evoked by a single tracking shot of William walking through a street market whilst the climate turns from sun to rain to snow to sun and a pregnant woman at the start of the shot is a mother at the end of it. It's a quite wonderful and utterly cinematic moment in a film which is never more than acceptable from a screenplay designed to appeal and charm."

","Notting Hill is easily one of the weakest, most pitiful excuses for a ""comedy"" I have ever seen.  Nothing subtle or inspired or funny about it; only schmaltz for the gullible who are led down the merry path by these cynical moviemakers.  Two actors with no chemistry and extremely limited ability attempt to wring comedy from kneeslappers like ""I bet he's got a d**k the size of a peanut"".  The question one keeps asking while watching this wretched mess is ""why does anyone care what happens to this silly unappealing movie star (Roberts) and this bland drip who is smitten with her (Grant)?"".  Roberts is so stunted when it comes to range that she doesn't even play a convincing movie superstar in a fictitious rendering of her own status.  The movie is loaded with current and recent movie references so the dimwits in the audience can feel knowing and wise while fantasizing about the trials and tribulations of fame in this day and age, which the starry-eyed in the audience are permitted to empathize, courtesy of a pandering, National Enquirer-mentality soft soap.  In essence this movie asks the drips in the audience to either identify with how hard they would have it if they were the movie star they wanted to be (like Roberts)...while trying to give them hope that even they can hook up with a movie star, despite being a poor nobody (like Grant).  It's all trussed up in a British veneer to let everybody feel they're witnessing something quirky and charming.  But it's really just mediocre, doggerel, bottom-of-the-barrel slick moviemaking for chumps."

","Notting Hill happens to be one of the surprise romantic hit comedies of 1999. When I first saw it last May I was impressed. Though many argue that Notting Hill has fairy tale written all over it they have a point based on the story of a Hollywood screen goddess(Julia Roberts) falling for an unassuming British bookstore owner(Hugh Grant) while in London to promote her latest film. Yet still Julia Roberts gives such a good performance that she makes this love story seem so real. Julia has really earned the reputation as Hollywood's leading lady. This movie gave me the message that love is based on chance and happens unexpectedly and when it happens it is generally between two opposites as in this films case fame and fortune(Julia Roberts) and the down to earth everyday average citizen(Hugh Grant). Remember the old adage opposites attract. Finally the soundtrack to this film is available on Island records and I must mention the songs (When You Say Nothing At All) by Ronan Keating as played throughout the movie and (No Matter What) by Boyzone as played at the ending during the credits, both are truly uplifting songs that will uplift anybody's spirit I highly suggest you purchase the soundtrack if you liked the movie. This film and the music on the soundtrack are both simply soul touching."

I mean, here is a movie star who is constantly on the verge of tears, always dresses down, and never wears makeup and never washes and styles her hair- there has to be a story in there somewhere, right? and we got nothing about hugh grant's character, though hugh played it as best he could with such a poor script and no real plot.<br/><br/>it's as if the writer just meandered down a path picking posies and then finally picked a predictable ending and went with it. come on, scriptwriter, don't get hung up on an earlier success! go out there and do something different, would ya!<br/><br/>I gave this a 3 because I was feeling generous and I like hugh grant. don't waste your money on it, not even on video, that's my best advice."

For example, how inevitable was it when: Roberts (Anna Scott) decided to stay with the bumbling Thacker (Grant) ""indefinately""?  Or when Grant had to wear those hideous goggles to the cinema, only for the audience to discover that Spike had them?  God. 	And how pointless can a movie be?  We all know how it's going to end from the middle if not beginning. 	My conclusion is, only very sad people over 30 with an even sadder love life would waste their time to see this.

You might well ask.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis is a New Zealand-born writer who seems to have a love affair with the duller end of the British bourgeoisie. Except that they have the ""endearingly eccentric"" habit of swearing in linguistic constructions unknown to anyone in this country (I was born and bred in London, and I don't recognise any of these people). <br/><br/>It's a bit squirm-making to think people outside the UK might imagine this is what we're like and, goodness knows, Curtis's feeble-minded films are commercially successful enough domestically, so I can only take comfort from the thought that most intelligent moviegoers will have noticed that all of his subsidiary characters are essentially the same, whatever the film, and serve only as baffle-boards for the main characters' lame one-liners, while they also oil the lurching from each dull conflict to the next insipid resolution. <br/><br/>Anyway, you can read the other reviews to get an idea of the plot  and there's a f**cking awesome twist (only kidding).

"djwdoc","10","1","2","15 June 2018"," Creating the Green World
","Romantic comedy is, at its essence, the creation of a new couple, and literally, a new community a new society, out of refugees from dysfunctional social orders. Very commonly, it is a narrative of different social orders, of high culture and low culture, rich and poor, this culture and that culture. It is the creation of a dream world of possiblilities created in opposition to a real world of limitations and cruel, casual savagery. To make a good romantic comedy, you need to show realistic worlds of experience. You need to treat them realistically, with all of their depth and pain and logic. And you need your actors and authoring principals to commit to the Green World of possibility with all of their sincere hopes and dreams, and personal experience, coupled with their professional abilities
If you can obtain all of that-which is a rare attainment in an era of irony and unearned cynicism-then a film such as this may result. The screenwriter, Richard Curtis is a little dismissive of his own efforts, and commonly people who like Curtis's films like Four WedDings and a Funeral, and dismiss Notting Hill as a simpler, more derivative film. But the focus on the romantic leads is fuller in Notting Hill, and in a comedy in which the hidden world of interior journeys is essential, I think this helps. The film is easily Julia Roberts' best. The range of vulnerability and longing her Anna Scott projects, followed by cynicism and brittleness in the next moment, amusement, pain, callousness, fear, a range of complexity from moment to moment as her character progresses through the narrative, is as fine a work as any actress in comedy ever has achieved, in my opinion. Why she did not receive more professional acclaim for this role is a mystery to me, unless it were that she seemed to be playing herself. Hugh Grant's William Thacker is more the sounding board for Roberts' Anna, though his wistful, neurotic passiveness, mixed with a depth of reticent knowledge and unexpressed feeling is precisely the alternative to the narcissistic aggressiveness and expressiveness of Anna Scott's peers. Together, they balance in a centered life is shared experience that, in the film's world, neither can find separately in their own social world. 
There are other great romantic comedies. There are other touching dramas, and films and television worth watching. But there are few great romantic comedies that sincerely present feelings, and that suggest that love means sharing the self one can never become without a partner. This is one of those few."

","This film is a sort of reverse Cinderella. He is a simple man, who fell in love with a famous actress. The central element of the film does not, therefore, nothing new. The cast, headed by Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, does a decent job. Most of them has very secondary roles, with the exception of Rhys Ifans, whose character is one of the greatest comic elements of the film.<br/><br/>The two main actors are Roberts and Grant, whose characters have features that turn them into allegories of themselves. In fact, Grant's character, a quiet bookseller, discreet to the point of erasing himself, realistic skimming defeatism, is a perfect allegorical representation of the middle-class man, who hardens with each blow that life gives. Roberts character, a famous and successful American actress, represents very well the rich and famous of the magazines and television, with her hidden weaknesses, a total inability to lead an ""normal"" life and a overwhelming desire to have a good family and love life, with several disastrous attempts. To some extent, we can even question whether the two actors were not, almost, to be themselves, since they can recognize in their characters several characteristics of themselves. The history between them is, at least, unlikely: a chance meeting followed by an (even more) unlikely romance shows us that love can overcome all barriers, at least in theory.<br/><br/>This romantic comedy, very pleasant and entertaining, is delicious in its details, deeply British and imbued with a strong spirit of self-criticism and irony. This is a very human film, who tries to show feelings, and believe in their strength."

Quite honestly I can say its my favorite Romcom of all time. <br/><br/>William is a bookstore owner from Notting Hill, London .. an area he obviously loves living at as you can see from the way he describes it at the start. <br/><br/>Although he owns a bookstore it is not doing that well when he meets Anna; a glamorous award winning actress from America who is on the way to more and more success, a contrast from the way his life is going. <br/><br/>Although in that respect they are different there is a kindness, a genuineness, and a sense of humour in William that is hard to miss, and he is the perfect gentleman to Anna.<br/><br/>Certain events bring them together and William seems to have a real connection with Anna and gives her the normalcy that her life as an actress truly misses. <br/><br/>With a few twists you get this will they or wont they feeling and you can't help but think please god get them together!<br/><br/>Being a guy who is definitely not the groopie / stalker type.. even after an intimate moment William does not get his hopes up and doesn't try to pursue her.<br/><br/>However, Anna calls his flat because she wants to meet with him. In fact if it weren't for Anna's initiative I don't think they would have ended up together at all because she's this movie star from a completely different world. <br/><br/>Eventually, you see the negative side of him being involved with an incredibly famous woman and how testing that is for him.<br/><br/>Spike is a character I must comment on.

","The best Julia Roberts film? OK, so I've only seen two others. Here, her character is a famous film star, so it shouldn't be too hard to do? But the acting is superb throughout, and the writing is clever and funny. The support cast are great. Easily a ten.<br/><br/>Anna (Roberts) is in London and goes to a street market, there, she gets clumsily bumped into by William (Grant) and he offers to try and clean the orange juice from her T-shirt. And friendship proceeds of course.<br/><br/>There is an outstanding performance by Gina McKee as the wheelchair bound wife of Williams friend and other great acting by the publicist and others. But... Rhys Ifans plays Spike, the flatmate of William. Ifans is a great actor, but here, his character is primo-jerk and this reflects badly on Ifans? I don't know why the writers have made him so unlikeable.<br/><br/>Something really different and really good is the mini-essay on the subject of why western males are so infatuated by women's breasts. Of course there are plenty of movies that flash a bit of flesh, but nobody ever discusses the matter in a serious way? Here, they do, briefly, and very cleverly. Well done!"

","""Notting Hill"" is quite pleasant and has many wonderful moments, but I resented the cookie-cutter formula which serves as the framework for the story. The two main characters played by Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts meet in his bookshop and trade some lines. The stage is set for them to meet again, which they do by bumping into each other on the street (he splashes juice on her clothes). This kind of stuff is worse than old-fashioned, it is downright creaky. Things do pick up from there as the bookseller and his movie-star girlfriend get closer to each other (the sequence where she meets his friends is enchanting, funny on different levels, and based in a surprising sort of reality wherein Roberts sends up her persona as an overpaid underachiever). But then the formula has to rear its ugly head in the climax: guy meets girl, guy loses girl...you can finish the rest. It's a 'nice' movie, lightly broad, but is it asking too much to want smarter people at the controls? **1/2 from ****"

","When it comes to romantic comedies, you just can't seem to go past something with Hugh Grant in it. Notting Hill features Grant at a high point, as his bumbling, but undoubtedly charming self opposite screen goddess Julia Roberts. The first time you watch the film, you will most likely be pre-occupied with how Julia Roberts can look so beautiful in every scene without ever looking over the top made up. Believe me, don't only watch this film once, because the second time you will discover more of its charm and be swept away by the depth of the characters. Hugh Grant is your classic nobody. The most remarkable thing about his life is the fact that he lives in a house with a blue door! His slob of a room mate will make you laugh no matter how many times you see the film, and Roberts is captivating as the beautiful movie star who knows that her looks rather than her acting talent are the key to her privileged life. The film, with its easy going sound track, captures the beauty of London's Notting Hill and actually makes you believe that you would run into these people if you were to take a stroll down its busy main street. Essentially Notting Hill is a modern day fairytale that honestly makes you believe that it is possible for a movie star to walk into your life and fall in love with you. Excellent Film"

The script seemed to have been forced out of the writer; five minutes of Hugh Grant describing the contents of the fridge?  It felt like a desperate attempt to make the whole thing longer than it should have been. Rhys Ifans had a few funny moments as William's flatmate, but his character seemed simply thrown in to give us relief from an otherwise boring and unpassionate film. I would only watch this again for three reasons:  Rhys Ifans, Julian Rhind-Tutt (playing a small but amusing part as a journalist) and Shania Twain's song ""You've got a way"".  And even those three together cannot make up for this film."

NOTTING HILL adds a little spice to the usual and has a little more flavor than the typical romance movie.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Rhys Ifans, Tim McInnery, Gina McKee, and Emily Mortimer are all pretty decent here. The film is certainly nothing special, but it is quite entertaining and has some genuine laughs in it for once, as some of them are pretty crude and will most likely strike the fancy of any crude humor fan. <br/><br/>Of course, everyone has different tastes, but NOTTING HILL is one of the more entertaining romantic comedies of the last several years.

Yes, it is a fairy tale, but the performances of stars Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are outstanding. They have great chemistry together and make you believe this romance is possible, against all odds. Roberts does an excellent job of showing how lonely life at the top can be, and Grant is charming as the shy but likeable ''ordinary man.'' This is also a very funny movie! It uses a combination of American and British humor, with great results. I found myself laughing out loud at least five times during the film. The supporting cast of British actors are superb.

For filler - it can't be all teeth and hair - round it out with a colourful cast of British extras slumming for money between BBC gigs, stage work, and pogey.

Especially entertaining was Rhys Ifans as the flatmate ""Spike"". I had to resist feeling insulted at such a portrayal of a Welshman in order to admire the performance though. He was very good, even down to the recent cultural shift among some Celts to revert to the pre-British spellings of their names; that I applaud.<br/><br/>The sets and locations lent an air of realism, too; lots of small details. The Camera work took great advantage of these and gave us a visually rich film without it being ""in-your-face"" - it caressed.<br/><br/>The remaining performances surprised too. This was the best I had Seen Hugh Grant. He was perfect in the role. Just enough modest loveability for the ladies in the party. Then there was Julia Roberts. I do not know when I have enjoyed her more in a film. It wasn't the part, the script or her character. She just seemed ""on"" for this in a very engaging way. It was a delight to drink in the different looks and degrees of costume. She looked very fetching in the scenes where it appeared as though she were sans makeup; just basic glowing beauty.<br/><br/>The only negative aspect of the film for me was the multiple breakups. I would have preferred seeing a slow maturation of their relationship. Still, that wasn't enough to spoil the overall effect. It was refreshing and entertaining to feel good at the end of a movie after some recent things I've seen. Oh, there's room for all those dastardly realistic, rend-your-heart-to-shreds kind of things, but sometimes I just want to go to a movie to feel good.

","It was a pleasant, simple and mostly implausible romantic comedy about a famous fictional actress and the man that loves her. A romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts is not normally my sort of thing but sometimes, a good girlie film such as ""Notting Hill"" can be just what the doctor ordered. ""Notting Hill"" is one of those movies for people who appreciate the particular British sense of humor. British humor is a full plate, let's face it. This movie, when it comes to humor, romance and simplicity, is at the same level of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Bridget Jones Diary"", which makes it a good alternative to these movies. Although it contains some vocabulary of discussable taste, it isn't profane at all and doesn't contain dirty humor which makes this a much more intelligent movie.<br/><br/>The characters here are interesting and humorous, without being great (in fact they deliver an ordinary performance especially Julia Roberts). The supporting characters, on the other hand, have more depth than I expected. Unfortunately, it's not their story. Nevertheless, the actor who portrays Spike is who makes this movie so hilarious. Spike is so goofy, so silly and so humorous - congratulations to the actor (Rhys Ifans) who played him, 'cause he did a perfect job for this kind of role. I really didn't like the overuse of pop music in the film, especially the overblown music used to bookend the film. It felt a little tacked on or inorganic to the soul of the film and almost seems to try to ""sell"" the scene as emotionally related to the piece of selected music. In terms of romantic comedy, this film basically gets the touchstones right. There are quirky, but fleshed out supporting characters. Silly scenarios are quite good. It's cute enough to be smile- making funny, albeit nothing laugh-out-loud. It's likable.<br/><br/>My Rating - 7/10"

Hugh Grant is a 10 and Julia Roberts is a 9 or an 8. My favorite movie of both of theirs. Way better than Two Weeks Notice and My Best Friend's Wedding. I don't know why the rating is so low on IMDb because after watching this movie a dozen times I could watch it a dozen more."

Each individual storyline added something to the film. The almost seamless transitions from scene to scene make it quite easy to follow for a film with such a complex plot. I was unbelievably touched by the interaction between Liam Neeson and his stepson. The development of their relationship could have been a movie in itself. However, blended with the them ""Love actually is all around,"" their interaction strengthens this argument. I think some of the users have read too much into Hugh Grant being Hugh Grant because it fits what Curtis wants to do. he wanted Grant to be eccentric and odd around Natalie because although he was a powerful man he was uncomfortable in the dating setting. Knightly puts forth a stellar performance in her limited roll, and Rown Atkinson and Alan Rickman both are tremendous.<br/><br/>this movie is a careful reminder that we are able to see love in our daily life as long as we look for it.

","""Notting Hill"" is the ultimate ""Chick Flick.""  This could have been a really good movie, but it wasn't.  <br/><br/>What this film lacked was a plot, a script, and good acting.  The basic premise that a movie star can fall in love with an average guy is a real stretch.  I could not believe that superstar Anna Scott would fall in love with an un-rich, un-famous man, not even a handsome Englishman with that British accent and manners that Americans love.  Even if you could buy that premise, it still didn't work.  As Don Adams used to say on ""Get Smart"" -- ""Missed it by thaaaat much!""  They almost had a story line -- ""the poor little rich girl,"" i.e. that Anna Scott is famous, but fame possesses her. They almost made the point that everything in Anna's life is controlled almost down to the minute.  She has no freedom, thanks to the demands of movie making, and no private life, thanks to the tabloids.  She can't even eat a decent meal, thanks to Hollywood's obsession with thin.<br/><br/>I'm not a particular fan of Julia Roberts, but I have seen ""Steel Magnolias,"" an excellent movie in which she proved that she can act.  And people tell me ""Erin Brockovich"" is a good movie.  However, both she and Hugh Grant slept through ""Notting Hill.""  It was really a ""star vehicle"" for Julia Roberts.  The movie was way too long, with endless close-ups of her. It was as ""heroine-worshipping"" as a Barbara Streisand star vehicle.<br/><br/>The ""characters"" in this movie add a welcome comic relief to a dull story, especially Spike, Will's Welsh roommate.  Along with Will's family, Spike is a scream. I hope we see Rhys Ifans in more films. <br/><br/>My wife rented this movie, and at least she liked it.  One out of two ain't bad."

I'm neither a) nor b), so I see through the veil of c**p.<br/><br/>Will Thacker owns and runs a bookshop. Badly. The biggest film star in the world, Anna Scott, (Roberts) drops into Will's Notting Hill bookshop, one thing leads to another and the two start a relationship.<br/><br/>Not impossible, by any means. Just highly, highly improbable. The relationship and the place they called Notting Hill. I live near Notting Hill, and it don't look like that, believe me. Where are all the different races? Where are the tramps? Where's the rubbish? All conveniently airbrushed out to feed the Hollywood view of England as full of Hugh Grants (effeminate fops) and Rhys Ifans (lovable rouge) - granted, he's Welsh, but the US aren't listening that hard.<br/><br/>Incredibly, both the US and UK's general public seemed to fall for the same character Hugh Grant has been playing since he was born - (blithering mook) - and as for Julia Roberts and the scene where people are bad-mouthing actresses: boo-hoo!!! My heart goes out to Roberts, the beautiful actress living a dream, and earning dream money to go with it.<br/><br/>I should know better - I think I'm a pretty intelligent man, yet I paid my money and sat down for my medicine.

Then, things bogged down.  The film became less of a comedy and more of a romance, and this killed the movie.  Without funny moments to keep me interested, the film crawled along, and I was very relieved when the obvious conclusion finally took place.  Don't expect too much from this movie."
"suze-4","5","1","3","17 January 2000"," Plodding direction spoils this otherwise sweet film
","This movie has realistic and cozy apartment and shop sets. A lot of care was taken with the details of the background. And some of the supporting characters are good. Those are the best things I can say about Notting Hill.<br/><br/>Overall experience: disappointing, but I blame the director most of all. With two stars of proven charm and talent, and a fairly cute storyline, there is no other explanation for the fact that this movie moves slowly and is boring nearly all the way through. <br/><br/>The slow pacing was completely wrong. It should have been a vibrant screwball comedy with touches of pathos, and  dialogue whipping by a mile a minute instead of spoken like it was War and Peace.You keep hoping for something to happen but only get a few interesting scenes and a lot of filler. Also, much of the dialogue is mumbled.<br/><br/>The premise needed to be set up properly to be believable:  a famous movie star meets an ordinary guy and they fall in love. It could have worked if it had been done right. It just seemed like no one really tried.<br/><br/>If this is the biggest star in the world she would not have that flat, dark hair dye. It's about all you can focus on during the whole movie as it stands out like a sore thumb. Actresses move heaven and earth to get a shine in their hair even if they have to dye it for a role. You don't see movie stars with fake looking, dull hair. But except for the brief scenes from her movies and the newspaper photos, ""Anna"" has the same matte, straight, lank hair you would expect in a gritty drama about prison. She also has almost no makeup on.  Therefore it is impossible to suspend disbelief and accept her as a movie star even though it's Julia Roberts! The thing about Julia is she doesn't look like a movie star. It takes a lot of makeup to make her look that way and they did not try. <br/><br/>Take Pretty Woman. It was a truly unbelievable plot, yet you could suspend disbelief, get into it and enjoy it, because it was played so intensely. They had fun making that movie and it showed. <br/><br/>Both Julia and Hugh have been hilarious and charming in other films so there is no excuse for the flatness of this movie. It all comes down to poor direction, inadequate dialogue and lack of any real character development.<br/><br/>The only fresh and funny characters were in supporting roles, but these were all too brief, just interludes and relief from the somber romance/non-romance that was supposed to be going on.<br/><br/>Over an hour of plodding, predictable events - then suddenly it comes to life like a Pink Panther movie. There's a spark of emotion and some action! But it fizzles out into a standard Hollywood sunset.<br/><br/>I thought for sure this would be better than Runaway Bride, which I felt was average. But no, it is not even as good. You never can tell.<br/><br/>Julia and Hugh deserve better movies than this. Put unknowns in their roles and it would have sunk like a stone. People went just to see them, and tried to find something good to say about it. But the emperor has no clothes!<br/><br/>
No originality, no charisma displayed by either star, in a story that never moves you, except for five minutes near the end (Did they get a guest director for that segment? It doesn't fit in with the rest)."

But alas, when a romantic film is done right, you get a nice surprise, which Notting Hill was. <br/><br/> The screenplay is very humorous and pleasant, and so is the acting. While Hugh Grant is nothing great, I must say he chooses good romantic comedies to be in. <br/><br/> I lived in England over 5 years, and picked up the British 'humor' that is so many times overlooked, or called 'raunchy' and while their sitcoms may be this sometimes, the main humor is not raunchy! Notting Hill captures this humor and puts it in a blender, along with a great screenplay, cinematography, and chemistry.

He was in the vanguard of the resuscitated middle classes who gleefully began filling our screens in such self - regarding fluff as ""Four Weddings and a funeral"" . In ""Notting Hill"" he plays a Trustafarian who falls in love with a huge Hollywood Star who is so well - known that he doesn't recognise her. He owns a book shop so he can appear to be clever(probably an Oxbridge man)and wear glasses without seeming girlie.His flatmate is played by Mr Rhys Ifans who is apparently Welsh and clearly believes he is giving one of the great comedy performances.The huge Hollywood star is played by Julia Roberts in not the most taxing role in her career. His friends,trendy and liberal to a person,are just the sort of tossers you'd run out of ""The Ivy"" to avoid. The Notting Hill they inhabit is unrecognisable to any real Londoner, being - as the former D.G. of the BBC coined the phrase - ""Horribly white"" and totally unlike the vibrant culture - mix of the real area. Come Carnival time,Hugh and his chums would hotfoot it to the South of France for the duration,but still consider themselves ""street"".

"chiku2se","4","1","5","16 October 2005"," Irritating movie
","Notting Hill is a very simple and ordinary movie. The movie will be liked by those who watch it without needing explanations for the happenings. <br/><br/>Right from the beginning it leaves holes in the script. A famous actress comes to a book store and goes unnoticed by the crowd of that town!! Several characters in the movie find themselves proud to have lunch or talk with the celebrity but knew nothing about the movies she acted in!! The character of Anna Scott (Julio Roberts) is half-baked. In the initial half of the movie she is portrayed as a simple, straightforward person with an unassuming personality. She fells in love with an ordinary man William (Hugh Grant) who owns a book-store. The sequence in which she stays overnight with William and shares bed with him indicates her willingness of a long term relationship with him. In the very next frame when she is exposed by the media, she lambastes the same person and considers him responsible for all the mess and leaves him. William seems to be an absolute draft in this sequence. Why the hack he could not prevent Anna and then his eccentric house-mate from going out of the apartment when he knew that there is a huge crowd of media waiting outside. <br/><br/>Six months later for no reason explained in the movie Anna comes back and ""begs"" William to love her. Six months of abstention from a person could actually subdue any feelings William if at all she had any. However in the movie it happened differently. There are so many sequences which will leave you in awe due to missing conversations which you would normally expect. For example when Williams's sister reveals that she is engaged to someone William expresses his surprise. But to my surprise he didn't bothered to ask who she got engaged to.<br/><br/>This movie could be viewed without getting irritated only if you overlook all these holes in the script. If you view with a normal mind set it will start getting on your nerves very soon. The only intelligent sequence was when William declines Anna when she returns to him for the second time. I love suspense thrillers specially Alfred Hitchcock's' movies. Give it a miss if you carry a critical view point while watching a movie. I will give it 4/10."

","I'm not big into romcoms but I found this one a lot more entertaining and engaging than the usual. The lead male is a very lovable guy and the lead girl is fascinating and surprises you many times. The film skips a lot of the usual ""missed connection"" and wooing portion and instead you get to enjoy a strange spark between the characters and a very funny script. The strange supporting characters that fill out a romcom can often be annoying to me, but these ones were also likeable and also have their own surprises along the way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the second half of the film is premised on the lead lady's very toxic way of dealing with their relationship. And it seemed like the film was setting itself up for a very interesting end where the lead male, who up until then had been a pushover, would confront the lead lady about what she had done and evolve their relationship. Instead, the film suddenly loses all its unique charm and falls into a very standard scene of the lead male hectically running back to beg for the lead lady's hand once again. Everything the movie had built up suddenly dripped into a pile of syrup that tastes just like Love Actually or, you name it, any other bad romcom.<br/><br/>I also have to say that for a romcom which seemed very self-aware and witty most of the way (except for the disappointing ending), the licensed music was noticeably bad. It really pulled you away from what were supposed to be the most romantic moments.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Notting Hill and definitely recommend it as a more interesting and funny romcom than most, but I lament the ways it was sabotaged from being a great movie."

Hugh Grant is typecast (or should that be miscast?) as the by the numbers coy, clumsy, bookstore owner - while Julia Roberts does her best to convince, as the poor-little-rich-movie star. Both have to deal with a forced, unrealistic, script by the same writing team of '4 weddings and a Funeral' (& it shows) with a dreary slow pace. Example; if you can swallow the idea that an International Mega-Star beauty, can walk unnoticed through the streets and shops of London - without attracting any Paparazzi! Or on the other hand, that a nobody, spreading a rumour one night in a local pub, can bring a street blocking avalanche of international press to an unknown 'private' address - then you might enjoy this outlandish 'would-be' situation comedy. Ms Roberts knows only too well, how impossible it would be for her character to get away with this super-stretched situation.<br/><br/>It's amazing what star power can do to convince some audiences to part with their money. If you happen to be in the right starry-eyed mood (like; newly in love or just won the lottery) you could possibly be the right audience for this fluff - otherwise, don't expect too much, look for something worthwhile or just steer clear. If this is being touted as one the best romantic movies of its year - then, seems to suggest there may have been lean pickings on offer.

But mistaken identities are a staple of successful romantic comedies and of comedies in general. They were probably staples when Aristophanes used them. And that's what this is, a traditional romantic comedy, with three ups and two downs.<br/><br/>What makes this different is the understatement and unease in the budding relationship. Nobody is better at discomfiture than Hugh Grant. Hugh is as good as Cary, better maybe. Some of the other staples I could have done without -- Hugh's eccentric but warm family, a near-slapstick ending, the soggy music. (A melancholy rendition of ""Love Makes the World Go Round"" when Hugh seems to have lost Roberts and is moping around.) It's a colorful comedy though and I enjoyed it. There are just enough touches of realistic diffidence to tickle the heart of anyone who was once swamped with the neuropeptides of true love and then lost it."

","Stories of class divide are almost always fascinating and will be told for many years to come, mainly because that wondrous, utopic vision of full automation and zero work is still so far away. They've become familiar enough to us to enter the cultural psyche; I'm thinking of time-tested tales like Cinderella and The Prince and the Pauper, with ideals so simple and inspiring that even Disney cartoons can appropriate them. This also means that any movie that wants to tackle the issue is facing an uphill battle. In Notting Hill, we chuckle because of the sheer coincidence of the spilling of the drink, and because we know that little innocuous incident will spark so much more. But we also don't expect it to be that easy for Will and Anna - it wouldn't be a movie if it didn't wait up until the very last minute for the pair to truly realise what they mean to each other. <br/><br/>The true strength of Notting Hill is how it lifts its characters out of these tried and tested archetypes. Roberts has all the makings of a glamorous Hollywood goddess, so we expect her to be a little high-minded, a little dismissive of the residents of Notting Hill, which has charm, but not the glitz of the Boulevard. Yet the movie resists the temptation to establish her as some snotty brat to be humbled by the family, to go through a re-evaluation of her entire life just because of a culture shock. One of the best scenes has her going toe-to-toe with Will's family, in dinner talk that is highly characteristic of British humour and self-depreciation, laced with the right amount of darkness. Anna is tender enough to join in on their game and open up a little about herself, but more importantly she also shares their ability of self-awareness and being able to laugh at herself. She's not merely a high and mighty aspiration for Will to strive for, but put through her own challenges, and though she may have millions, we come to understand that this does not mean her emotions can be easily discarded. <br/><br/>This lovable bunch, reminiscent of another in Curtis' Four Weddings and a Funeral, are immediately likable because they feel like real characters, not merely bits of Will's modest, working class tapestry. They have real lives and struggles outside the window from which we view them through the film's plot, and we can see that they care deeply about each other. They might go wacko when they first meet Anna, a little starstruck as most might be, but also show their fierce loyalty to Will when they realise that he has been hurt and needs emotional support. One of the marvels of the Thacker family is in how their depiction normalises disability - Bella's condition slips into their stories, loves and jokes with ease, and we witness how the others adapt to it. It is accepted as a fact of life rather than something that defines her. <br/><br/>So if anything it might be Will that is the weak link. Try as I might it's difficult to see him being so bogged down by heartbreak and situation. This is, after all, Hugh Grant at his peak, roguishly and lazily handsome, carrying himself with an aloofness and effortlessness about him like the wavy parting in his hair. He even has too goofy sidekicks at both home and work to accentuate his relative sanity. It's a pity that most of the men in Notting Hill are obnoxious, sex- crazed pigs, the most egregious intrusion being Alec Baldwin, who's unshaven and crass, and who all but sneers dismissively at the help before shoving his tongue down Anna's throat. The relationship is defined not by Will's own character, but rather how special and different he may be to all the other male suitors out there. He's modest in dress and tone, shacked up in a bookstore away from all the glamour and gossip of the world, and it is not him but her that initiates the sex instead.<br/><br/>Anna, after all, is looking for that diamond in the rough that won't give her the concessions of a film star but treat her like an ordinary human being with flaws and weaknesses, and it's not an unfair request. Her characters are are exaggerated, over- the-top heroines, and all she wants is someone that realises there is a person behind those portrayals. And along the way we shake and bury our heads in our hands as they navigate the more typical conventions of the genre, and how the story inevitably twists their words and inserts convenient inconveniences to trip them up and try as hard as it can to tear them apart. It isn't immune from the dramatic confrontations and spillings of the heart of the rom-com; in fact it happens twice, and we can understand both perspectives. And the music cues are obvious and cheesy, these days borderlining on self-parody. But aren't they just part of the package? We go into Notting Hill expecting to be comforted and satisfied, and it delivers exactly what we want."

","While this film certainly doesn't pull anything new, it still satisfied my romantic heart as only Julia Roberts can do. Think of it as ""Pretty Woman"" in reverse, this time with Julia as the wealthy one. But what makes this bit of cinematic romance really take flight is the superb cast, consisting of the best English actors available. Hugh Grant, always excellent with his self-effacing grace, was the perfect foil for Roberts, with special mention for an amazing Rhys Ifans as Grant's scruffy roommate, nearly stealing the show. Having finally seen this movie in 2016, one of the more interesting asides was a minor role played by Hugh Bonneville, who later became the iconic male lead in ""Downton Abbey,"" quite a younger man when this film was made. Music always makes the movie, and this one succeeded quite well, with the theme song ""She"" performed memorably by Elvis Costello, this hit song originally made famous by Charles Aznavour, the great French crooner. If you're looking for an uplifting romantic fantasy to take you away for a couple of hours, I recommend it."

","Notting Hill is one of those films that can still make me laugh no matter how many times I see it. The idea of a normal everyday guy falling in love with a famous Hollywood actress is an interesting spin on the romantic comedy, and shows how fame can have its downsides.<br/><br/>The characters are interesting and well developed, and while Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are as good as always in the lead roles, the standout star is Rhys Ifans as Spike. He's the kind of flatmate you wouldn't want to have and that's what makes him so endearing.<br/><br/>The film is full of hilarious, and quotable, lines, especially from Spike. His scenes are so laugh out funny it hurts! However, the best line is at the end when William and his family are chasing down Anna, and Max exclaims 'James Bond never has to put up with this sort of s**t!' <br/><br/>The only part of the film I didn't enjoy was when William does several interviews while posing as a magazine editor; it simply isn't funny and just drags on. Despite that, Notting Hill is a very enjoyable romantic comedy and one that can still make me laugh on repeated viewings."

","The life of a simple bookshop owner (Hugh Grant) changes when he meets the most famous film star in the world (Julia Roberts).<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed about this film is the guest stars. Alec Baldwin shows up unannounced for a brief but crucial scene. Heck, even Mischa Barton appears as the child actor whom Will pretends to interview for Horse & Hound. Of course, when the film came out no one knew who Barton was, but that is what makes looking back at movies fun.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it is your typical romantic comedy. I suppose it is slightly different in that the main character is male rather than female, and Grant is more charming than the average male lead. In fact, Grant is the saving grace of this film, because Julia Roberts is just as awful as ever. Her character is uptight and only opens up in the second half, completely without any reason."
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","0","1","11 February 2016"," Carried Largely by Two Very Charming Leads
","Watching Notting Hill I came to the realization that it's been a while since I have seen a movie that is so unabashedly romantic. Today's romantic comedies tend to add layers of cynicism in lieu of two people, on screen who actually have chemistry. It's like half of the rom-com industry has decided to pander to the eye-rolling, smartphone scrolling, shrugging indignation crowd. The other half cater to those who like their romance overcooked, contrived, and unbearably overwrought as to render them offensively outdated upon arrival.<br/><br/>Thankfully Notting Hill falls into the latter category without wholly reaching Nicholas Sparks territory. Our protagonist William Thacker (Grant) is a normal, good-humored Brit who has a chance encounter with American darling of the screen Anna Scott (Roberts). Despite being consistently befuddled around the constantly on-guard ingenue, William manages to endear himself to her and they begin a charming little courtship away from the flashes of paparazzi cameras.<br/><br/>Grant's character manages a struggling bookstore because in the late nineties and early two thousands screenwriters wanted to let us know how unfashionable books were. His shaggy-dog normalcy, quick yet harmless wit and his social circle of close-knit friends, endears him to the audience within the first few minutes of the movie. This is important because with the arrival of Robert's character it's as if a draft of arctic wind had assailed his life. Take away the moments where bit characters do a double take when she enters the room and you're left with a very cagey actress who Grant at first seems to admire because of her celebrity. She doesn't come across as endearing at first but slowly gains your trust throughout. As she slowly un-spools to a level the audience can commit to her struggles, Grant also begins to grow and change in unexpected ways. In the hands of other actors this movie might have been relegated to rom-com purgatory. Yet so much audience goodwill can be made with Roberts's winning smile and Grant's signature stutter.<br/><br/>The secret to Notting Hill's success is its ability to play out the scene in a meaningful way and earn the audience's respect with well- formed characters. The central gaggle of friends played by Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee, Hugh Bonneville and Emma Chambers all have interesting backstories and aren't the one-dimensional boors we always see. The movie goes into a bit of a third act stumble culminating in that frantic ""mad dash to your lover"" sequence we've seen in every romantic comedy since Manhattan (1979). It's a shame too because everything leading up to that moment was organic and fun while not being too sweet.<br/><br/>I didn't love Notting Hill but then again the film is not for me. Much like William's bookstore, the movie is for a special class of people who don't know or care that the world has left them behind. It's a piece of well glossed fantasy that has the ability to harken back to older movies such as Roman Holiday (1953) and The Shop Around the Corner (1940) only with updated stars and risqué humor. It's obviously a winning formula as proved by the film's enduring popularity. Give it a try if you're not completely callused by the prospect of love; otherwise there are other fish in the sea."

He asks her what would she like and she is very discreet to him and says she's fine. But when she leaves the bookstore he discovers that she is the famous American actress Anna Foster(Julia Roberts). And later bumps into her again as he accidentally spilled orange juice on her t-shirt,and from here on in an inevitably romance blossoms between the two of them. Trouble comes however when Anna's American boyfriend shows up(Alec Baldwin from 30 Rock)and it causes a stir on her relationship with William as well as the paparazzi spying on her as they found out she was sleeping with William. <br/><br/>So will they,won't they get together in the end. Bottom line I haven't seen this movie in over 10 years since last night as it happened to be on TV and I decided to watch it again as I had it all forgotten. Julia Roberts is one of my favourite actresses of all time so any film she is in I have to watch it for her. Hugh Grant is well Hugh Grant in any film he is in. Boring,dry and just down right dull. But here he wasn't that bad in it. However him and Julia Roberts chemistry was kinda average to be honest. I felt that they were uncomfortable in this film,but it wasn't all that bad. <br/><br/>But the show stopper here of course in Rhys Ifans(from The Amazing Spiderman as Dr Curt Connors)as Spike. He was hilarious in this movie and every time he appeared on screen he cracked me up. Also starring is the guy who I think was on a programme called Black Books and the man who played Glen Close's henchmen Tim McInnvery as Grant's brother in law.<br/><br/>Overall I found it enjoyable and I recommend it to those who are a fan of Grant or Roberts.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Notting Hill (1999): Dir: Roger Mitchell / Cast: Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Hugh Bonneville, Rhys Ifans, Emma Chambers: Romantic comedy with fairytale realism. Observant sketch of a celebrity desperately seeking solitude and love. Julia Roberts plays an actress who is involved in a film in London, and she encounters Hugh Grant when she enters his bookstore. After an accident involving orange juice, Grant offers his home for her to clean up thus begins predictable circumstances chalk full of clichés. Director Roger Mitchell delivers insight on the price of fame and the strive for normality. Part of his success is his fairy tale delivery on the place of Notting Hill combining it with the realities of celebrity lifestyles and that of those observing from the outside as Grant does here. Roberts is strong as an actress struggling with a high price lifestyle, while Grant feels guilty due to her fame yet he really does love her. They counter formula with wit and charm making their roles likable. Supporting roles are the usual band of distracting props with actors like Hugh Bonneville and Rhys Ifans making appearances that amount to nothing. Emma Chambers plays Grant's sister and that is about the extent of her role. Strong emphasis on solitude and fame make up for its predictable structure. Guanine love celebrated as oppose to the fluff usually seen in movies. Score: 8 / 10"

But as friendship turns to romance, the fame and attention, not to mention an American actor, threaten to destroy their relationship.<br/><br/>Okay I have to be honest here but Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts never stood out to me in they movies. I don't think they terrible actors or anything like that, it's just that they performance in they movies I never thought it was groundbreaking or pure greatness, just okay and nothing else. And now both of them are in Notting Hill and I can positively say that I thought both did pretty good in this movie.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Grant and Roberts was sweet and well written. Yeah it was cliché and I could predict what was going to happen next and normally I hate it when I could predict the relationship and all the drama in a romance movie, but in this it didn't really bother me that much. Because of the great acting and good character development that stopped me from hating the movie completely.<br/><br/>I actually was surprised how much I laughed during this movie. The side characters or the supporting characters to those people would like to say, but anywhere the side characters were pretty damn funny and give a lot of funny lines. Rhys Ifans in this movie was the true comic relief of this movie. He stole every scene he was in. <br/><br/>For problems there only are some: Has I said before about the romance cliché thing and how Grant and Roberts chemistry stopped me hating this, well towards the end of the movie it went so cliché I won't lie I rolled me eyes. The scene that stuck out to be the stick in the mood cliché is towards the end were Grant and Roberts have this big fall out and you see them feel sad and they missing each other but they don't want to admit it, but one of them finds out that he or she was wrong and goes chasing after the girl or men of he or shes dream. That right there is the biggest cliché that still been used today and I don't know why that cliché has to be the worst. <br/><br/>Notting Hill overall may turn people off by the has I said before those annoying cliché but let's put that a side and look at the movie fully. The movie has some good chemistry and good acting. This isn't like any other romance movie out there, and what I mean is that this movie didn't make me mad and that's so rare for me."

","Writer Richard Curtis set out to answer a question: What if I showed up to a regular get-together with friends, accompanied by the World's Most Famous Woman? This is his answer. Hugh Grant plays a bookshop owner, in Notting Hill, who lives his life within a very small area. Of course, as these things go, he has a chance encounter with Julia Roberts, who is stretching her acting muscles by playing a famous, superstar actress. After an awkward first encounter, a series of events lead to a slightly more charming, if improbable second encounter. From there, an incredulous, and rocky romance develops.<br/><br/>As with four Weddings and a Funeral, the film is largely a series of sketches, driven by dialogue between the characters. Curtis excels at this kind of stuff and his scripts have memorable exchanges. Perhaps his plots are a bit far fetched, though stranger things have been known to happen. They do tend to tread a bit on a romantic fantasy of life; but it is a romantic comedy, after all.<br/><br/>The cast are first rate, with Hugh Grant returning to the Curtis world as yet another charming, awkward man. He can pretty much play this part in his sleep. Julia Roberts plays a version of herself, though with a bit of tweaking here and there. The rest of the cast are filled with terrific character actors, including Curtis alumni Tim McInnerny (Black Adder series) and Emma Chambers (Vicar of Dibley), as well as newcomers Gina McKee, Hugh Bonneville, James Dreyfuss and Rhys Ifans. Curtis knows how to write character pieces and these actors make music of his writing.<br/><br/>It's easy to pick apart the reality of the film, that a famous actress would find true love with an ordinary guy that she, literally, bumped into; but, the scenario is so wonderfully done that you don't really care. The chemistry between the leads makes you forget the plot holes and the rest of the cast create an atmosphere that would be attractive to anyone, famous or not. It doesn't have a huge laugh quotient, but peppers the film with some really great comedic moments to keep you amused, while it charms you and brings a tear or two to your eye (like the scenes at the park bench, or when Roberts is in Grant's shop, begging him to forgive her). You can dismiss it as forgettable fluff; but, chances are, you'll be swept up in it, even if it's for just a little while. That's what movies do."

","I liked it but not to the extent that I love it.<br/><br/>It's a good film, a fun watch but it's clichéd in dialog and screenplay. It relies heavily on the two leads, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. Though Julia Roberts as Anna Scott does her part with ease, Hugh Grant as Will Thacker seems to be shaky, and uncomfortable. Also, its way too long with a running time of more than two hours for something that a very light romantic comedy. <br/><br/>Editing lacks hold in an otherwise well written film. But the dialog ruins the well written scenes by putting some mediocre lines that were extremely predictable by me. I felt, this film did not have the charm of romances like ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""Love Actually"". The chemistry between Julia and Hugh though made up for most flaws, it did not cover them well enough. <br/><br/>Just an example<br/><br/>William Thacker: I've opened Pandora's Box! Spike: I knew a girl named Pandora in High School once...Never did see her box though!<br/><br/>If such jokes make you laugh and smile, then this movie is certainly for you. For me, this was a very poor joke and I could not buy such jokes. The sad part is the film is filled with such lines and that is why I did not like it much. <br/><br/>For sure, there are good aspects in terms of production. But with such actors at the helm and budget taking a toll, those things are expected too. Writer Richard Curtis seems to be a good one at slapstick comedy and slick dialogs but what he is not is mastering the same and adding a touch and flavor of his own. The same ""I love you"" can be said in innumerable ways but it has to be one that will be attractive and has it's own place in the hearts of the viewer. <br/><br/>I am going with 2/5 for this. Though its a very well made romantic comedy. It lacks that specialty of becoming greater than a normal film. I am also skeptical if this will stand the test of time either."

","First of all, this movie's background is really beautiful. I hope to visit London sometime. Also, I like the way that main characters meet. They meet again and again accidentally. I don't have enough experiences to tell about love, but after watching this movie I can tell that lovers have to understand each other and be honest, and the most important thing when people love is their serious mind, not other people's thinking.<br/><br/>Even though this movie is old one for me, the story made me be touched. At first, main characters have different opinions from different jobs, lifestyle, environment, private things and others. As most people think, it is hard to get into a relationship for a famous actress. But we can know that the actress is also person who wants to love a man like normal person by this movie. In this movie, she said that ""I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her"".

","I'm fascinated by this movie.This movie has a gorgeous cast which includes heroine Julia Roberts and hero Hugh Grant. The story is a work done in the tried-and-true style of a romance movie. So if you like romance movie,you might like it.The heroine is an actress and the hero is an ordinary guy,so it could say the opposite of the Cinderella story.<br/><br/>The scene of the first meeting of the heroine and hero is little bit unnatural and too unrealistic.Though the heroine is a big star actress,she can often go out alone. And why she loves him,that reason isn't described on screen.So I couldn't see how her feeling will develop.<br/><br/>But,this movie has good music that works on a romantic story.Also,you can enjoy other humorous characters.Sometimes they make funny scenes on screen. I like the heroine,who is not perfect even though she is an actress and has gorgeous looks.Everyone has a weakness and defect,but we are looking for the person who accepts us as ourselves.<br/><br/>If you watch this,you could feel a romantic and impractical world."

","The story starts with two people living very different lives in two geographies. They have no reason and intention to meet each other. Life brings them together, through a small accident, and its never the same for them again.<br/><br/>Hugh's effort to keep his feet on the ground, yet struggling to hold his affection for the woman he loved at first sight, is nothing short of admiration. Julia's stature of being Hollywood's biggest star (which she is in real life anyway), and yet failing to fall for a financially inconsequential guy, is a leaf straight out of strange life we live. The movie is a struggle of two people who come from poles apart lives, try to make it work. They fall, they get back, and fall again, and get back again, never to fall again. Julia's portrayal of the dark/gloomy side of living and ending the glittering life is profound. Her last lines in the store before Hugh realizes his mistake are full of plain truth. I don't know anybody else, except Hugh and Julia, would have pulled William Thacker and Anna Scott role, as better as done by them. The strange family and friends only add to the color of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie can be an inspiration to the ones who focus more on their limitations, than the opportunity, love offers to them."

","""Notting Hill"" I believe it's a movie which is the definition of a romance movie and combines really nice romance with comedy. In this movie we have a beautiful and really famous actress who changes the life of a simple bookshop owner and love starts there. Also in this movie we watch what difficulties have to get throw and how are they going to do that.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because of the plot, the storyline and the direction of Roger Michell who I believe that he did a great job in that and this is something that is obvious in whole of the movie. Julia Roberts who plays as Anna Scott a famous actress makes a nice interpretation as Hugh Grant who plays as William Thacker a bookshop owner for one more time do. Another good interpretation made by Rhys Ifans who plays as Spike the roommate of William Thacker and best friend who is really hilarious.<br/><br/>Finally I have to say that ""Notting Hill"" is a must see movie for all the people. I also believe that you will like this movie not only for the above reasons but because of the music which accompanies the movie and I really liked it."

","This film is about a love story but it has one point unordinary. A normal book seller William fell in love with a Hollywood star Anna. At the beginning of this film, Anna goes to the book store where William works. After she buys a book, they again come across each other in the middle of the town. Then they get along with each other. However, since Anna is a Hollywood star, there were lots of difficulties for their love. Will they be able to get married? Each conversation of two main characters makes me smile. I like the phrase ""Oopsy daisy"" which is a phrase William used in this film. What's good about this film is that the ending is so dramatic. William asks Anna to marry him in a special way. I can't say anymore since it would be a spoiler so I would strongly recommend you to see this film."
"bbewnylorac","7","0","1","29 January 2014"," Not bad but too long
","I love screenwriter Richard Curtis's affectionate way of creating characters, and his witty scripts. Julia Roberts gets good directing support here, and puts in her best role since My Best Friend's Wedding. Unlike that movie, when her character was quite dark, here she is very much playing herself -- a rich movie star on vacation, albeit a bit down in the dumps at first. She must have found it interesting virtually playing someone in her own real life world -- doing press interviews, dodging the paparazzi, trying to have a personal life and making wry comments about plastic surgery and obnoxious co-stars. Curtis puts in interesting lines for her (and presumably Roberts didn't object) for her character, such as wryly stating she's earning $15 million for one film, which is very bold, but quite accurate for someone like Roberts. Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, but hey, it is quite an attractive character, and he is believable as a book shop owner. As usual for Curtis, the supporting cast are not just bland faces -- they're real characters with their own good and bad points. However Curtis does tend to make them all a bit too lovable and winsome and kooky. But it is a comedy. I loved Grant's flatmate, the skinny Welsh eccentric. All in all, a very likable film. The big complaint I had was, it was too long. It was 'boy gets girl, then loses, then wins, then loses...' when it should have wound up in half the time."

","I re watched Notting Hill today as I've been trying to go through all the romantic movies that have been made in the past two decades trying to find the ones that weren't absolutely improbable and bogus. This movie reminded me of why I fell in love with rom-coms and romantic movies in the first place. There IS something that tugs at your heart strings with this movie and the narrative and events that unfold could maybe just one day happen. This movie isn't a disgrace to this genre and reminds audiences about the lure of a good romantic movie. Of course Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are two stellar actors and were truly great in the film. Notting Hill doesn't feel rushed at the climax as if the director/writer was just trying to wrap up the story, the filmmakers put their heart into this film and took their time to develop the continuity and fluidity of the film. Overall just very well done. Really reminds us of what is lacking in so many romantic films today. plus the amazing soundtrack."

"refresh_daemon","7","0","1","3 October 2006"," A serviceable romantic comedy
","One of my friends really likes this movie. So I decided to give it a try. Well, it was a pleasant, simple and mostly implausible romantic comedy about a famous fictional actress and the man that loves her.<br/><br/>In terms of romantic comedy, this film basically gets the touchstones right. There are quirky, but fleshed out supporting characters. Silly scenarios and the like. It's cute enough to be smile-making funny, albeit nothing laugh-out-loud. But that's fine.<br/><br/>It's likable. But it still has a few faults, some of which I'll describe here. The film takes a shortcut in developing the characters' relationship by use of montage. I generally dislike this practice, except if you need to get across a lot of information quickly. In this case, it was to skip past the hard work of showing these people get to like each other. And so it comes across to me as cheap and I have a hard time believing that they've come to like each other. Of course, I just bought it for the sake of not hating the film--but it would be nice it the story featured more of that and cut a little bit more of the not-as-funny comedy bits.<br/><br/>The other thing is that the main characters are pretty flat. That is, both protagonists aren't very well developed (albiet the male protagonist is a little more developed than the actress) and so sometimes wasn't really caring about their trials and tribulations. But otherwise, they seem to be lifted from templates rather than having been thought through carefully. The supporting characters, on the other hand, have more depth than I expected. Unfortunately, it's not their story.<br/><br/>Still, it does its got as a serviceable romantic comedy just fine so I can say that you might enjoy it. I enjoyed it at least, even if at times I was throwing crumpled paper at the screen. 7/10.<br/><br/>Another note: I really didn't like the overuse of pop music in the film, especially the overblown music used to bookend the film. It felt a little tacked on or inorganic to the soul of the film and almost seems to try to ""sell"" the scene as emotionally related to the piece of selected music. Perhaps with more carefully selected tunes, it wouldn't have been so bad, but the choices were either overly melodramatic or just too well-known."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","1","6 September 2006"," Dull and unfunny
","First (or second) impression is that Notting Hill doesn't bear more than one viewing. I originally gave this light comedy 3.5/5, but on seeing it a second time could only give it a 2.5  and I think even that might be a little generous. There's too much about this film now that irritates: the slow pace at which the story unfolds, Hugh Grant's trademark hesitant quirkiness, Julia Roberts' cloying ""I'm just a girl"" line, etc. And behind it all is the unshakable suspicion that Richard Curtis is running on autopilot, simply rehashing the same themes that worked so well for him with Four Weddings but which come across as so contrived here as to be nearly cynical. For example, choosing to have one character confined to a wheelchair seems either unashamedly manipulative or simply included to add a little something to the ""biggest loser"" speech in the dinner party scene  which doesn't really work anyway.<br/><br/>Grant is almost a parody of the old image he has since gone to some lengths to shed: a dithering, stuttering, self-conscious throwback to the Ian Carmichael school of acting. Perhaps attempting to broaden the film's appeal beyond that of the middle-class, Curtis attempts an injection of crude humour in the form of Thacker's witless lodger, Spike. Spike is a working-class lout with dirty feet and a poor taste in tee-shirts, and so is exactly the type that someone like Thacker would run a mile from. But then, this is a film which seems to specialise in unlikely relationships: perhaps, being a heterosexual male, I'm not really in a position to venture an opinion but, to me, it's impossible to see what a Hollywood mega-star like Scott would see in a knob like Thacker. But then I suppose that's the idea  Curtis is simply exploiting that juvenile fantasy that lives, to some degree, within all of us. Perhaps that is why so many people buy into what is essentially a half-baked comedy with improbable situations, characters who have little history beyond the boundaries of the story, and very few laughs."

","NOTTING HILL was a breath of fresh air when it entered the theaters in 1999. Written by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually, The Girl in the Cafe - as well as the Bridget Jones scripts) and directed by Roger Michell (Persuasion, Changing Lanes, Enduring Love) the story is a bit cockamamie but blossoms in the hands of the fine cast. Now with this Collector's Edition release it is available for us all to appreciate again.<br/><br/>William (Hugh Grant) is an ordinary bloke who runs a Travel Book Store in Notting Hill, a man whose life is abruptly changed when an American actress Anna (Julia Roberts) enters his shop and his life. Bumbling William spills orange juice on celebrity-shy Anna and the two cross the street to William's flat, shared with the wildly mad but lovable Spike (Rhys Ifans), and despite poor starts there begins a romance to test all romances. The manner in which William and Anna gradually find each other's vulnerabilities, including exposure to each other's lives - Anna with her celebrity entourage, William with his loony but oh so tender extended family (Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee, Emma Chambers, and Hugh Bonneville) - is the story of love overcoming hurdles. The secondary themes are lovely and beautifully played by this committed cast.<br/><br/>For a springy, funny, tender, sweet British humor story, this one is hard to beat. Recommended. Grady Harp"

She's supposed to be the romantic lead girl, and she's not particularly lovable or endearing, and it really stretches one's ability to suspend belief to buy the plot line. Poor Anna - she could have been worth loving, I'm sure. Eventually, I guess.<br/><br/>There's a lot good about this movie, and it's worth a rent.

","If you liked Four Weddings and a Funeral, then this follow up from writer Richard Curtis is a fantastic romantic comedy. Golden Globe nominated Hugh Grant returns from Four Weddings and a Funeral as William Thacker, an everyday normal unknown guy who works a pretty ordinary job in a travel book shop with Martin (James Dreyfus), and lives in Notting Hill with a curious flatmate named Spike (BAFTA nominated Rhys Ifans). (Oh, he had seen her films before he met her) Then one day the girl of his dreams, American movie star Anna Scott (Golden Globe nominated Julia Roberts, pretty much playing herself) walks into the shop, and they meet a second bumping into each other (and spilling orange juice) in the street. It is this second meeting that leads her to unexpectedly kiss him. A phone call from her is what allows another meeting, and a chance for them to set a date, when she's not busy, at William's younger sister's birthday, His friends, Max (Tim McInnerny) and his wife, disabled sister Bella (Gina McKee), Bernie (Hugh Bonneville), and of course, younger sister Honey (The Vicar of Dibley's Emma Chambers), who is most pleased to meet her. Many of the problems with fame crop up when they are together however, including some bastards (including Sanjeev Bhaskar) in a restaurant talking about her, autograph hunters, celebrity interviews, and for a little while worst of all, a secret boyfriend named Jeff King (Alec Baldwin in a cameo). Eventually though she comes back to his place when some new photos appear in all the newspapers, and she wants to escape the press for a while, this is when they get closer (and finally sleep together). But a little Spike chats to some mates in the pub, the press find her again, and they are apart again, it happens again at a film set for a new film where William overhears her shut him out in a conversation with a co-star. In the end though, after he finds his way into a press conference about the new film, he manages to seal their love, and they have a happy ending with a marriage, and all that comes with it, being a celebrity. Also starring, in order of appearance, Dylan Moran as Rufus the Thief, Mischa Barton as 12-Year-Old Actress, and if you look carefully you'll see Simon Callow as Himself in Film within Film, Omid Djalili as Cashier at Coffee Shop and EastEnders' Michael Higgs as Man at Market. This is not only a great comedy of embarrassing occurrences, involving two great stars, but it is good insight into the life of a celebrity, all that they have to go through in life when they are that famous, tough! It won the BAFTA for the Audience Award, and it was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Hugh Grant was number 73, and Julia Roberts number 29 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Grant was also number 8 on The 50 Greatest British Films, and the film was number 95 on The Ultimate Film.

","A classical theme of fairy-tale romances has been commoner meets prince. Think Cinderella, for example.

These are celebrities. Whether they be pop idols, models, or movie stars, the idea of a celebrity dating an average joe seems as unlikely as a prince dating a commoner must have seen in an earlier era.<br/><br/>Hence this movie can first be seen as updated fairy tale.

(3) Rhys Ifans was hilarious as the Hugh Grant's roommate. (4) The best scenes had Hugh Grant pretending to be a reporter from a well-known British magazine. (5) The script was unbelieveably well-written. (6) The ""walking down the street"" scene was great statement about how as time moves on, everything changes either for the better or worse.

My theory is that Americans pay for shallow junk like this to make their own films look better. Notting Hill is a self-conscious comedy, with all jokes clearly sign posted, and all periphial characters ""wacky"" and ""zany"". There's Grant's crazy sister, overbearing mother and his effeminate employee. Aren't all us crazy English exactly like that? Well, no, not compared to the Welsh character, whose every line and pace is so predictable so as to bore off the screen.<br/><br/>Writer Richard Curtis even gets in a bitchy dig at the film industry when Grant reads through Robert's (American) film part. Commenting on the writer, he double takes and changes it to ""writers"". Fine if your film is Citizen Kane, but when you've just written Notting Hill, it seems a little ill-advised to criticize others. Grant and Roberts do quite well in the midst of all this sub-realism, but at the end of the day Robert's character isn't that nice to begin with."

","I found Notting Hill to be a wonderful feel-good movie and the first time I saw it, it jumped straight into my personal top ten list.  Can a major film star really bump into Mr. Average  (Well, Mr. Handsome and charming average) and fall in love with him?  I`d like to think so (personally, I`m waiting for Liz Hurley to get tired of the shallow multi-millionaires she usually dates and ask me out - but thats another story)  Hugh Grant plays the owner of a small book shop who one day looks up to see one of the worlds top film stars browsing through his books. He is basically playing the same role he so often does - that of the witty but diffident Englishman - but he does do it well. Julia Roberts is often described as one of the worlds most beautiful women but I have never seen that in her, pretty yes, but not beautiful.  However, I have now changed my mind, for there is a scene in this film where her face lights up with a smile that I do consider truly beautiful. Watch this film and I can guarantee that you to will smile too."

","Yet again, we have a British film which doesn't offer anything knew. Notting Hill is an average lightweight picture, which never challenges or tries to be different. We have the usual Hugh Grant, oh boy, he doesn't have a wide range of acting skills, does he? This is the same role as Four Weddings and a Funeral. The British film industry is technically superb, we have the best film technicians in the world, our films are photographed with a sense of verismilitude, but we lack ideas, this is why we'll never compete with Hollywood from a money point of view.<br/><br/>Notting Hill is a simple, very simple picture, the story never takes off in any direction. You'll come away feeling that the picture didn't achieve much. Interesting to note that the film tries to paint movie stars in a fresh light. I think it's the simplicity of the picture which makes it undemanding for the viewers, it wasn't boring, but not exciting, either. The direction is good, I thought the scenes were handled well, even the predictable finale, one could see it coming a mile off. I think a better script could've helped.<br/><br/>The acting is fine, I think the supporting work was excellent, but Hugh Grant was just too light, and Julia Roberts was terribly shallow, she had nothing to offer. <br/><br/>It's not surprising to see why the film made money, but the lightweight script was disappointing, still, I think most romantic film fans will enjoy it."

","First of all, I think that this movie was a bit overrated , in my opinion, it is not that good , and doesn't deserve the stamp of  `Perfect' on it, just `Normal'. Obviously the greatest triumph of this film, is of course Julia Roberts which is one of the most perfect and talented actresses nowadays. Of course, but that's me, in the opposite extreme is the most annoying than ever Hugh Grant. His lines (except one or two), his acting and his accent are unbearable, he plays a character that is supposed to be so normal', but centralized himself how center of everyone's attentions he is. Please better casting next time (Joseph/ Ralph Fiennes, Jude Law, Liam Neeson) The supporting cast, on the other hand is good and deserve praise for their work and for the way they acted their lines. Once more, what blew up the whole movie was Hugh Grant, and the inevitable perfect love story with almost nothing that stands on their way.

","I've just seen this film, and maybe it is too early to write something about it but it impressed me.<br/><br/>In this film once again Hollywood dreams about itself: maybe, actors need to escape from their golden life, so these films come up, but they are surely unbelievable.<br/><br/>I can't imagine the poor film star who needs a ""normal"" friend ( or maybe lover ). I do not like the choice of H.Grant, since I cannot imagine him being the normal person. I would have preferred the choice of a less-known actor, it would have been more believable, but, Hollywood has its rules, and, as usually, real life stays away from there! The famous,rich,beautiful actress cannot fall in love with a ugly, or at least not handsome man: she needs a normal, every-day prince!<br/><br/>So that, I think that once again they've made up a newer version of ""The Prince and the poor"", of course a bit changed, just to prevent people from remembering it.<br/><br/>Definitely, 5 is more than enough for a stupid, romantic film."

","OK, it shouldn't take a genius to figure out why this film was made - to capitalize on the cinema popularity of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in the late 1990s. On first viewing I thought ""there isn't anything substantial here, but a good script and good acting make it a very enjoyable viewing, deserving a rating in the mid-7 to low-8 range"". But after viewing it several additional times over the years I have come to appreciate it more, and it has become one of my favorites to re- watch. It has a lot more depth than I realized in my first viewing. Plus it contains a collection of great characters on the British side of the casting.<br/><br/>Grant plays a shy and unassuming bookstore owner in Notting Hill section of London. Julia Roberts plays an American movie star, and the film is about their romantic possibilities. If you are a ""romantic"" and like to see two young lovers try and figure it out, then this is a very enjoyable film. I think most of us men can identify with Grant's character, even though the object of our affection perhaps was not a movie star.<br/><br/>The DVD extras shows a bit about the ""making of"" Notting Hill. Of interest to me, even though street shots of the Notting Hill area are used, all the filming ""inside the bookstore"" was done in a studio on a set created to look like the bookstore.<br/><br/>I now (2016) own the BluRay version and the picture and sound are a definite improvement over the DVD, plus the ""extras"" are a bit different. This remains one of my favorite movies."

","As a ""celebrity"" of sorts, Notting Hill has a special appeal for me.  I was just starting a relationship with a ""commoner"" when the movie released, and since we lived 2500 miles apart we were each going to see it in our own cities and discuss it later.  But in a bid for romance he flew down to take me to the movie and then flew back again that evening.  Awww!<br/><br/>I could definitely feel Anna Scott's turmoil in dealing with image and celebrity, and my boyfriend that of William Thacker.  The conversation in the morning about Rita Hayworth is a lot more truth than poetry.  Do people go to bed with ""Brandy Alexandre the porn star"" and become disappointed when they discover it's just me?  It's a tough task for a commoner to overcome being judged as just another fan and earn the trust of the celebrity. Kudos to those who try.  But the instant you hit a bump the celebrity guard goes up, be it Will's ""masturbating Welshman"" spilling the beans on Anna's whereabouts, or (well, that's personal).<br/><br/>All in all, Notting Hill was a joy to see and fresh enough to see several times.  The music was new and unique enough to prompt me to buy the CD, which I rarely ever do.  I also bought the video when it came out, which is another rarity.  Like all romantic comedies there is a meeting of the minds and a melting of the hearts in this film.  I thought I, too, had a happy ending, but as it turns out, real life isn't like Hollywood or the many streets named Kensington in the corner of London known as Notting Hill. But having watched the video for the first time after the fact of my failed attempt at bliss with a commoner, the appeal and message still held up. My faith was once again renewed that I still might one day enjoy the often elusive ""happy ending."""

The hidden love Julia Roberts has for Hugh Grant and the way Hugh Grant gives his whole self with no masks or guard is poignant. And the hurt Hugh feels is the same type of hurt we've all once experienced: the one where we have no shell just bare heart, and a hurt causes us to create a shell. That and the overall wit and support of all of Hugh's family makes you feel happy. And that one line, that one line that is so famous but sounds so corny alone, comes alive when heard in context. ""I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her."" And the event that happens after that!!

Ups! I think I need the CD next. . . ""William Thacker"" Hugh Grant (Sirens) is a such a down-to-earth,  polite, nice guy and nice looking too. Always wearing his casual everyday kind of clothes. Sort of ""The Gap, L.L.Bean, Eddie Bauer"" commercial type of guy. The wilderness in the city, casual but sophisticated. Neat! Somewhat reminds me of my husband.  I think it is interesting that the part is for a man and not a woman. He is the one waiting for her, getting dumped, feeling left out, depressed, the entire family knows about it. This is a stereotypical female role. Hugh did a great job and received awards for his acting.<br/><br/>The famous actress played by Julia Roberts (Something to Talk About, Sleeping with the Enemy) ""Anna Scott"" is also down to earth trying so hard to just be herself. Julia is always so likable. I think I have the tape of every movie she has made. We love her smile around here. To be that famous is just not good. It is just not healthy. Now the roommate ""Spike"" Rhys Ifans(Dancing at Lughnasa) is funny. At first I thought I couldn't stand this guy as a roommate. I still think their house is too messy, and because Thacker is so neat looking and Spike is weird I assumed that Spike was the one messing up everything.  But I crack up with ""Spike."" He is a lot of fun. Since when does yogurt taste like mayonnaise? It must be spoiled. Duh! Thacker just has the ideal family, although they are a little bit dysfunctional. There is unity in that family. I recommend the movie. I would not watch this movie trying to let the little slips in the actor's personal lives influence my judgment. Just think about their acting and about how well they are playing that particular role. That is what I try to do with everyone in the business. Everything else is history or just ""story.""

","""Notting Hill"", the latest venture from the makers of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", lacks the charm and depth of the original film, which, in retrospect, stands as one of the top romantic films of the 1990's. ""Weddings"" soared on the basis of three essential elements:  the sharp, offbeat wit of its screenplay, the likability of its subsidiary characters, and, most important, the emotional and psychological depth of the Hugh Grant character, who, in many ways, functions as the archetype of all those modern men caught between love for a good woman and the paralyzing fear of committment.  ""Notting Hill"" unfortunately approaches romance from a far more conventional direction, settling for wish-fulfillment fantasy rather than a more acerbic reality.  The trouble with ""Notting Hill"" begins, in fact, with its initial premise of the world's most beautiful movie star falling in love with a handsome but essentially average Joe bookseller in the Notting Hill section of London.  By creating such an unlikely setup, the film loses the emotional connection with the audience so essential to the success of a romantic comedy.  The contrivance at the movie's core makes it impossible for us to really identify with the principals and, thus, the movie devolves into little more than an exercise in play acting for the two leading characters.  This is a shame because Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are certainly two of the world's most attractive and likeable stars and this role obviously seems tailor made for Ms. Roberts who carries with her the built-in aura of all that goes into being a world famous media celebrity. Perhaps, the stars are let down by the film's screenplay, which seems strangely devoid of real imagination and wit and the pace of the direction, which often allows comic lines to fall flat.  A scene, for instance, in which Grant, through a convoluted set of misunderstandings must interview other actors in Roberts' new movie, is deadly in its lack of comic freshness and timing.  The same can be said of a poorly written dissertation on the comparisons between some food Roberts is eating and Mel Gibson's much-exposed derriere.  Moreover, unlike in ""Weddings"", the secondary characters, who surround Grant and provide him with a running commentary of advice, come across as bland and witless and subtract rather than add spice to the central romantic proceedings.  ""Notting Hill"" does provide a few scattered moments of genuine humor and charm (Grant's being forced to attend a movie wearing his prescription deep sea goggles is hilarious), but the film often relies, stereotypically,  on sappy  montage sequences accompanied by a song-filled soundtrack rather than incisive dialogue to achieve a romantic mood.  ""Notting Hill"" simply does not ground its characters enough in reality to make us care."

","I really don't understand all the fuss about this movie. Okay, I really don't like Hugh Grant, 'cause he always acts the same way in every movie he's in: the dopey guy, big deal! About the movie itself: terrible slow, loose ends, highly predictable and utterly boring, that about sums it up.<br/><br/>If you liked ""Pretty Woman"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", you're about to like this movie as well."

","I may have actually encountered a romantic comedy that I could stand! Yes, Four Weddings* was comparable but lackluster in comparison. Admittedly Julia Roberts' character wasn't much of a stretch but there is some frank insight into the life of anyone ever caught in a British tabloid.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant has this uncanny ability of always looking uncomfortable, like a penitent child. Still charming as ever though.<br/><br/>I must say, that at first glance, Julia Roberts' character was distant, cool, definitively unlikeable--but that just goes with the territory. You don't truly appreciate her until the very end.<br/><br/>Comedy made this film, and for that Rhys Ifans must be commended! It was more comedy than romance...<br/><br/>All in all, a must-see (though for the life of me I don't know why...) Perhaps you will understand if you just see it!"

","This movie is an attempt at a cross between Four Weddings and a Funeral and Pretty Woman -- and not just because of the overlapping cast members. Like Pretty Woman, it involves a potential relationship across a big cultural (and economic) divide.  Like Four Weddings, we see the beautiful American who comes to Britain, meets the same good looking guy, leaves, returns, leaves, returns, leaves, returns . . . .<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Notting Hill doesn't live up to the standards set by either of those movies.  Although neither was brilliant cinema, I enjoyed both of them immensely.  Notting Hill, in contrast, mainly just bugged me.  For one thing, it's much too slow; half an hour could have been cut.  Second, I didn't care much about these characters.  Maybe that's because of a third problem -- this movie was so much like Four Weddings that I felt I had already seen it.  And it wasn't just Roberts and Grant that I didn't care about.  The supporting cast members, although occasionally mildly amusing, were mainly just silly.  The Four Weddings supporting characters were much funnier, much more real, and much more talented.<br/><br/>I'm not saying Notting Hill was terrible.  I just think it was a mediocre movie that I could happily have skipped.  Of course, then I would have missed Roberts who, at least by the end of the movie, showed some of the radiance and charm we too rarely see."

","Julia Roberts is a lot better than Andie McDowell in Four Weddings, but that's not a recommendation.  Notting Hill is a pretty cynical rerun of Four Weddings:  Hugh Grant's circle is the same (his sister is identical to Scarlett, and has the same storyline;  it is his ex-girlfriend rather than his brother who has a disability...).  There are some funny moments, but it adds up to very little.<br/><br/>She loves him because he is ordinary -- as ordinary as someone with a business and house on prime £1m real estate in West London can be  --  and can give her the private life she craves.  Then where does he declare this love? At a press conference.  Roberts' character would have hated that.<br/><br/>The district of Notting Hill has been severely ethnically cleansed too.  It is sad that the film has been made to appeal to a fictional American view of London:  white, waspy, funky but aristocratic.  Certainly no one seems to have a job that can fund their lifestyle.<br/><br/>It also bothered me that there were bits of script that were US English, not UK English.  Grant says ""anyways"" at one point.<br/><br/>Anyways, that's enough from me."
