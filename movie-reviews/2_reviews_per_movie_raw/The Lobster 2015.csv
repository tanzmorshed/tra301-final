"vbrt0117","8","402","500","17 October 2015"," Very true reflections of our society
","The film is dark humoured, satiric and mocking mirror of society reflecting on human's obsession to fit in certain rules of society, despite how ridiculous they are. We step on our primary feelings and ignore our instincts just to play by the rules, to belong. And even it was the clear theme of being obsessed with being in a couple, I see it as a bigger reflection of society. After the main character runs into the woods, where he finds rebels of coupling, it's clear that they are as extreme as the hotel people. It looks like it's shown that people have to belong to survive, but options are limited and you have to obey, pretend or risk to be destroyed. Various examples of dysfunctional relationships are shown in the film, which looks so familiar – pretending to have something in common, pretending that you understand that you are the same. Desperation, rejection, cruelty in the relationships – we have seen and know it all, but director found the way to remind it with a lighter tone, with the possibility to laugh at ourselves and society. All the characters acted and talked in the same hyper-polite manner – that's what we do, so often we dance around difficult and extreme situations with our repressed feelings. And despite how similar everyone talked, with the same tone and politeness, we can see through that and find individuality of the characters, and it shows that we are more than just rules, etiquette  The obsession to have something in common with you partner reached the peek at the end. It looked like even David and blind women are still in love, but a realisation that in society norms they don't have anything real in common drives to an extreme decision. It shows that we sacrifice so much if we love someone different, and all just to be more acceptable in the society, but at the end society doesn't care, so do we just have to be braver? This film makes more think than feel. The audience who is used to relate to the characters might find it difficult, as even the main character is not very lovable, he is a week and very human in other words. It's not a 'feel good' film but not miserablism, it's smart and innovative reminder"
"themadmovieman","9","376","512","18 October 2015"," Easily the weirdest film you'll see all year
","There's no chance that you'll see a film as weird as The Lobster this whole year. In what is effectively an indie art-house piece, you get a completely insane and almost unfathomable world filled with more and more absurdities everywhere you look. However, it's such an incredibly unique and eye-catching film that it's still hugely engrossing and surprisingly entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>The story centres around one man, played by Colin Farrell, as he attempts to find a partner as a part of this bizarre system. The first act revolves around his time in 'The Hotel', and is not only hugely odd, but both dramatic and unnerving as well as hilarious to watch, featuring some of the best dark comedy written in years.<br/><br/>The film takes its story as seriously as any drama, and you feel that through the deeply disturbing atmosphere that emerges off the screen. However, as the film is just so weird, it eases you into the oddness of it all very impressively through the use of humour, something that more pretentious art-house films fail to do, and are resultantly a lot harder to really get into.<br/><br/>So, you'll definitely be laughing a lot, if not in a more disturbed than hugely entertained manner, throughout the first act, and by the end of it, you'll surely be as used as you can be to the incredibly weird feel of this whole film.<br/><br/>Just to give you an idea of how unorthodox this film is, every scene is full of awkward silences, the actors speak as if they're reading off of cue cards with no emotion whatsoever, the imagery is very ugly and unpleasant to look at right the way through, and the incredible slow pace of it all means that the film feels like it goes on for about five times as long as it actually does.<br/><br/>And yet, I still can't get around the fact that this is a brilliant film. Mainly, it's the fact that it's just so unique and almost shockingly bizarre, but it's just filled with so many captivating ideas that it's impossible not to be fully drawn into this insane story.<br/><br/>So, the performances, the directing, the writing, and pretty much everything is stunning, apart from one big issue that prevents this from being a truly incredible film. Following the end of the first act, the film does lose its way quite a lot, taking almost too big a leap into an even stranger abyss than you ever imagined at the beginning, and, with a little less humour in the latter stages, isn't as easy to watch as the first act had been.<br/><br/>However, it does pick up again towards a terrifying and as bizarre as ever conclusion, and that's why I'm going to give The Lobster a 9 out of 10, but I must warn you that if you feel you can't cope with this film for longer than the first twenty minutes, then it's not for you. This is definitely a cult film for the ages, but won't be a big hit with general audiences."
"Albert_Orr","9","394","559","31 July 2015"," An Absurdist Screwball Comedy
","The Lobster is a surreal deadpan comedy about the strangeness of social pressures and modern relationships. <br/><br/>The setting is a bleak, tightly controlled hotel on the coast of Ireland. David (Colin Farrell), a recently divorced Architect, is given 40 days to find a partner or else be transformed into an animal of his choosing; in this case, a lobster. Sound strange? That's just the first 10 minutes. Guests of the hotel are subjected to routine trips to shoot 'loners' with tranquillisers, and awkward high-school dances to entice singles to mingle. As David's days start running out, he decides to feign common interest with a heartless woman in order to escape his fate. But can he pull it off? <br/><br/>Farrell really hits the mark with this role, displaying awkward machismo and fragile humility in equal measure. His comedic timing is matched only by his supporting cast that includes John C. Reilly, Ashley Jensen, and Olivia Coleman. Rachel Weisz is also spot-on as the short-sighted woman.<br/><br/>The Lobster has just about everything you'd want from a film. It's unpredictable, it's offbeat, and it's laugh-out-loud funny. But it's most impressive feature is the subtext - it manages to reflect how odd our own modern-day social pressures are. How loneliness is feared, how individuality loses out to the mainstream system, and how relationships have to be deemed 'legitimate' by some higher order. There's plenty to talk about with this film, and I'll definitely be seeing it again to delve a little deeper...."
"CinemaClown","Null","277","404","18 December 2015"," Weird, Whacky & Wicked But Also Dull, Sterile & Vapid.
","Weird, whacky & wicked but equally dull, sterile & vapid, The Lobster is a strange beast that actually begins quite well but tumbles down the road after the halfway mark to conclude on a rather uninteresting note. The concept is no doubt intriguing and it takes its time to make us familiar to the society inhabiting its tale but all of it doesn't amount to much in the end & it fails to leave any lasting impression.<br/><br/>Set in a dystopian future, The Lobster presents a world in which single people are arrested & taken to a hotel where they are obliged to find a matching partner within 45 days or they are transformed into animals & released into the woods. The plot follows David who arrives at the hotel for the same reason but his endeavours of finding a mate before his time is over ends far more tragically than he expected.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, The Lobster marks his English-language debut and the idea & inspiration behind it is both clever & admirable. The sequences taking place in the hotel are nicely carried out but its second half lacks the same level of creativity that's present in the first half. The excitement goes missing once the protagonist leaves the hotel and from there on, it just limps throughout its remaining runtime.<br/><br/>The hotel is neatly maintained but it also has a creepy vibe about it. Camera movements are fluid, colour hues wonderfully compliment its overcast ambiance and lighting seems natural for the most part. Editing allows the plot to unfold at an unhurried pace but the whole story feels twice as long because of that, with no idea of where it's headed. Last, the background score is just as odd as the story's content and is intermittently utilised.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Lobster features a fine cast in Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw & John C. Reilly and most of them are simply bland & lifeless in their respective roles. It can be argued that the spiritless rendition of these scripted people was deliberate but it doesn't really help in enriching the experience, at all. The deadpan wit is occasionally amusing but it's also too easy to get frustrated by whatever is happening.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Lobster is an uncanny mix of bizarre ideas that, in its effort to play with multiple things at once, may end up drifting many of its viewers. While I found nothing lovable about it, its parody of the society that gives way too much credit to companionship, in addition to the dig it takes at those match-making algorithms which rely on similar traits & likeness factor is one aspect I liked but in all seriousness, The Lobster is too mediocre to be of any significance."
"Cjalln1","9","237","359","18 October 2015"," A remarkable oddity of a film
","""The Lobster"" takes the tropes and expectations of modern-day relationships and satirises them almost out of existence. The farcical ""Hotel"" aims to partner 'loner' humans with each other (based on 1 characteristic) in a stress-inducing timeframe of 45 days, often resulting in deception and the suppression of true feelings in order to garner a relationship as a means of escape. The other side of the coin is the outcast tribe living a meagre existence in the woods, where even flirting is punished with physical mutilation. The cold mechanical delivery of every single character's lines emphasises the absurdity of the situation, and bizarrely makes the jokes even funnier. Not since Richard Ayoade's ""The Double"" has cripplingly awkward humour been so effective. This film has a lot to say about the fickle nature of relationships, set against the background of a dystopian society. The cinematography is as flat as the actors' delivery; this contributes to the emotionally-stunted, often silent world that the characters inhabit. The ending is beautifully ambiguous and surprisingly tense for such an understated scene. A score which fluctuates from terse, rough string melodies to Italian opera heightens the sense of weird-art-film which pervades ""The Lobster"": definitely a film which requires full attention, reflection, and a mind open to arty weirdness, ""The Lobster"" is a remarkable oddity."
"DarraghQ","7","101","147","2 April 2016"," Quirky and original, slow film
","The film's concept: all adults who have recently lost a partner through death or divorce are sent to a hotel, where if they do not fall in love within 45 days, they are surgically transformed into an animal of their choosing. ''A lobster's a great choice''.<br/><br/>I try not to explain the film's plot when somebody asks, so as not to completely dissuade them from viewing. Maybe this ridiculous concept is in reference to how ridiculous forcing someone to fall in love due to common interests is, or even just forcing someone to eventually get married, a practice common in the modern world. A comment on the societal pressures put on single adults. There are constant references and reminders to how even numbers are perfect, a couple. There is a further commentary on applying limiting labels and boxes to people, bisexual not being an option on the sexuality question, no half-sized shoes.<br/><br/>Collin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, along with the many minor characters, all add to the film greatly. There are no weak actors which I could point out. The screen writing can be fast and witty at times, but I felt the ''quirkiness'' was definitely overdone. The robotic and monotonous speech pattern was generally funny but also overdone.<br/><br/>I have spoken to many people who do not enjoy this film, and I can definitely respect and understand their opinion. The Lobster is not for everyone, with it's strange plot, writing and imagery. It's script is similar to that of a Wes Anderson film, but still remains very dark, and at times, disturbing. It is without a doubt, a slow film, heavily reliant on dialogue (which many people won't even find funny).<br/><br/>I would recommend the film to people who enjoy quirky films such as Frank, Juno or The Grand Budapest Hotel, although The Lobster is definitely darker than those examples.<br/><br/>Probably one of the strangest film I've ever watched."
"Amadio","6","93","136","13 February 2016"," Tale of Two
","The Lobster is a curious film with shades of the Coen Brothers or Grand Hotel Budapest (the fact that so much is set in a hotel is incidental, or hotels in movies are places to be avoided). Dysfunctional characters drift through, delivering their lines with humorous lack of awareness and emotion, strange rituals are performed to bond the guests, and all the time the clock is ticking - find a partner, become a couple, within 45 days or be turned into an animal of your choice.<br/><br/>The first part of the film is amusing, quirky and entertaining. The style is pleasant and interesting, despite some nasty moments. Some of the shots drag a little, but it adds to the curious atmosphere. The dry, deadpan dialogue is perfectly delivered, Colin Farrell as the main protagonist shows he really is a fine actor.<br/><br/>Then the film changes. New characters are introduced and the mood becomes much bleaker. No longer is this humorous, the stakes have changed. It is hard to identify with the new characters as we had already invested emotion in the earlier ones. And it gets worse, leading to en ending that is as unclear as it is unpleasant.<br/><br/>The Lobster cannot seem to make up its mind what kind of a film it is, is it simply saying that we are all venal and craven in the end? If so, why the humour at the beginning? And if we are capable of love, is it really so shallow as to be broken by people saying things?<br/><br/>I loved the beginning, I didn't like the end. This was one fish dish that left a bad taste."
"toniacuna","1","571","920","28 March 2016"," Painful
","I am obviously going against the trend here, so be it. I found the movie pretentious, ill balanced and with none of the nuances other more accomplished directors manage to reveal with their use of absurdism and counterpoint.<br/><br/>First, if the movie had been short, maybe it would have been bearable, maybe, as it stands, its length goes to show, at least for me, that there was not a compass that guided the director, this was a rudderless attempt at social commentary. I don't care if Mr Lanthimos is considered the plus ultra of directors, this is bad.<br/><br/>The movie tries to match absurdism with social commentary, but fails to create a world in which A) the absurd seems plausible and B) the plausible seems absurd. The deadpan, flat delivery of the lines loses all power after the first 30 minutes of the 1h 58m this thing goes on for and the humour, again, always spurred on by the absurdity of the moment/comment/observation, fails to find me (as it failed to find the funny bone of most people in a packed, large movie theatre in London, in fact, first movie I've gone to see in ages where people began to leave the cinema half-way, which I longingly followed with my eyes wishing it was me).<br/><br/>The cinematography is fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but Lanthimos fails to use it to punctuate the absurd moments (something Wes Anderson does very well, as does Paolo Sorrentino) nor is the dramatism enhanced by precise camera work (Hitchcock, Fellini, Truffaut). The dialogue, even in its supposed absurdist nature, is poor, fails to weave across and is uneven. While the leads do a super job, the characters are flat and I don't care for them or what happens to them, which is always a bad sign for me.<br/><br/>There are moments when this thing is good, like the hotel managers singing a duet, but they do not translate across the whole story, mainly because very quickly we leave the only part where there are interesting characters and spend the rest of the movie in the forest. <br/><br/>I found the movie:<br/><br/>-Too long -Pretentious without the grace to be so -flat -Uninspiring -did I say too long? -A convoluted way to tell a story that could have been told with the same intent in less time, with more observant, astute dialogue and far better crafted cinematography -A depressing experience -Not funny, by miles<br/><br/>Having just seen for the first time 'The Great Beauty' followed by 'The Royal Tenenbaums' I realized now what The 'Lobster' could have been but did not have the artistic currency to do. The social commentary is there, no doubt, I just did not like how it was executed.<br/><br/>Maybe I am just a heathen with no taste...but of course, these are my impressions, I know others who truly loved it, and that is good too."
"cantrell-4","3","125","193","28 May 2016"," Boredom with a dash of nausea
","Meh. The film starts with a delightfully surreal premise, and gets off to a promising start as a Strangelovesque dark comedy, or perhaps even a ""Being John Malkovich"" maze of mind-boggling left turns.<br/><br/>The moments of humor, however, thin out. The plot hews to the obvious even in its twists. The deadpan delivery becomes merely dead, and a sea of intolerably flat affect gradually crushes any empathy we might have for the characters. Exhausted of its premise, disinterested in both the humans who inhabit it and the humans who are watching it, and groping for any sort of social observation that is not already obvious and well-trodden, the film finds it has little left to say and another 90 minutes to say it.<br/><br/>It drags itself, sallow and lifeless, to a cliffhanger conclusion that leaves us wondering what happens next, but not really caring."
"burnettwm","1","38","56","4 November 2016"," Started out interestingly, but went nowhere very tediously
","While the film was creative in it setting and filming, the strange dialogue, which helped set a tone, made the interpersonal relationships seem completely forced even when they should not have seemed that way.<br/><br/>The worst part is that I watched it until it stopped. It is as if the film maker didn't have an ending to go to, and just go tired of the movie. Unfortunately, that took a long time. As a short, this film might have been remarkable. As a full length feature, it was just tedious and not entertaining.<br/><br/>On the positive side, it had a great cast who probably did as much as they could with the material they were given. Yorgos Lanthimos wrote, directed and produced the movie and I'm unlikely to want to go see another movie by Yorgos. It was billed as a wickedly funny romance, but was none of those. I did laugh once. It was a single ""ha"", not a ""ha, ha, ha!""<br/><br/>Ultimately a waste of time."
"bakerj7","2","14","18","6 August 2016"," A dissenting opinion
","Good writing has engaging characters in an interesting story infused with metaphor, irony, moral ambiguity, and other nuances, wrapped around a pertinent issue. This movie has none of that. It is a haphazard mess of unrelated metaphors and irony, badly scripted, with a meandering plot. If it's intended to be a parody of bad avant-garde Eurotrash cinema, it took two hours to accomplish what could have been done in one. The only laughs were at a flamingo and camel wandering around in the background. The depictions of horrid cruelty to animals were disturbing. It dragged on so long I wish it had been my own eyes (and ears) that had been gouged out. By the end of the movie I didn't give a flip about any of the characters, nor how it ended, only hoping that it would mercifully end as soon as possible. We continued watching hoping that something interesting would happen at some point, that it would actually go somewhere or come to some sensible conclusion. We only threw good time after bad. But hindsight is 20/20. Do yourself a favor; skip this movie, and spend two hours doing something more enjoyable, like chewing on tin foil."

","Not going to write a lot here, as not much to say other than contains Boring robotic acting, flat zero-dimensional totally non-plausible characters which one can't care anything about, ridiculous boring pointless dialog, sexual scenes and language in gross and offensive way, pointless animal cruelty, disjointed ridiculous plodding overly long stupid plot.<br/><br/>I've seen really boring movies, offensive movies, maddeningly stupid movies, really badly acted movies, movies with annoying, boring and vile characters.

"Vidhound","1","224","383","16 May 2016"," Dishonest trailer and reviews hide the cruelty of this film
","Despite the spoiler tag, I've kept this review clear of specific plot spoilers. Instead, I've listed, more generally, the types of cruelty involved in this movie.<br/><br/>And I know I'm taking the risk of getting a lot of thumbs down from people who could take what this movie dished out -- specifically, people who could take it, and think others should take it too, without any warning.<br/><br/>These people might argue that the intention of the movie is to lure you in with false expectations, then spring the nasty stuff on you, and that your upset reaction is acceptable, because the film is deliberately designed to ""shock"" you that way. I disagree.<br/><br/>If someone makes a movie that has both comedy and horror elements (torture, mutilation, etc.), it is dishonest to make a trailer out of only the quirky and funny scenes.<br/><br/>This is a cruel and ugly movie. From the beginning, it is gray and grim, with the exact kind of depressing music that Americans expect from arty foreign films. But very quickly, it becomes clear that the film is worse than that.<br/><br/>The trailer makes it seem like a fun and quirky movie, maybe something like Being John Malcovich. I suppose it is, during the ""funny"" parts. But in my opinion, that is overshadowed by the other nasty things that happen in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie tries to make points in its ""dark satire,"" but they are pretty similar to points that were covered a lot less painfully in, for example, ""But I'm a Cheerleader."" The director's agenda seems to stem from his own miserable world view. Forget the fantasy element of the movie's premise; he has his own fantasy in which far too high a percentage of the world is capable of murder, torture, body mutilation and so on.<br/><br/>I'm hoping this review will help others like me avoid the movie. I tried to scan the RottenTomatoes page to get a sense of what I could expect from the movie, but I basically walked away with ""The Lobster is definitely an acquired taste -- but for viewers with the fortitude to crack through Yorgos Lanthimos' offbeat sensibilities, it should prove a savory cinematic treat."" This is not the case, and it is not a fair summary. Sprinkling a few drops of battery acid into your ""savory cinematic treat"" completely offsets the value of whatever other ingredients you've included.<br/><br/>I hope people will go into this movie armed with more knowledge than I had."

It starts out looking very art-house, with very slow story line and everybody looking artsy, but as it goes along the story becomes so utterly ridiculous and sickening without any purpose other than to be ridiculous and sickening that the movie really just turns into an empty shell, a pretentious 'how weird and shocking can we be' sort of thing. It wants to be art-house so bad it screams it at you. Overkill. The entire movie I wondered who had managed to convince the actors this was a good job to take on. Maybe I am looking at this from a European perspective? Maybe American cinema is lost in between Hollywood and a place they don't know where it is anymore.

Is it motivated by animal rights activism? Do they become animals as a way of making us humans more caring for other non-humans? (i.e. place a 'personal' or 'species' bias into the mix to create empathy) ... No ... Well, maybe for a minute ... Is it motivated by psychopathy ... well, maybe for a few more minutes ... does make you wonder whether the writer has some serious relationship issues! ... Smiles are extremely rare ... All characters have serious issues resulting from relationship problems it would seem - i.e. none are emotionally open in relating to one another (only emotions that characters express in the whole movie are negative: jealousy, anger, insecurity ... Nothing adds up - which is not an insecure need of the modern age as opposed to the post-modern one ... but a purely healthy way to make any sense of experience at all!!!!!!!!!!!! Nothing about this movie made sense for more than a short while ... Totally unpredictable, i.e. it has NO STORY to FOLLOW but is a random scene of stuff that never adds up and leaves you wondering whether the maker seriously thinks they can actually justify its existence on the basis of some lame postmodern perspective that warrants anything and everything as equally cool!!! TOTAL GARBAGE!!!!!"

","Unfortunately, the trailers for this movie portray it as a comedy. And therefore we rented it. However we found the trailer to be quite misleading. I am particularly fond of foreign films, especially anything from Ireland or Great Britain and even enjoy subtitled flicks, but I'm afraid this one was just over the top disturbing, and not what I would categorize as a ""comedy"" at all. It is definitely satirical with a very twisted sense of humor, more macabre than anything else. Would not recommend this for anyone looking for a laugh; it is very vulgar in language and is graphically violent. And we watched it with our 18 year old son, which was quite uncomfortable due to the sexually ""suggestive"" (and I'm downplaying it using that term) scenes.

The theater was nearly empty and no one laughed at any point in the film. I failed to see the point and also I failed to see why characters in the film did as they were told.

It has been mentioned that Colin Farrell gained about 40-pounds for this role. Why I am not sure, but I thought the 40-pounds looked good on him. So if you didn't know that he gained 40-pounds, you probably will not recognize him. I didn't .<br/><br/>Yes, this is a satire, but a very unconventional one. It mocks relationships and pretensions that we go thru to show normality for the most part. All dialogues are mono-toned and no emotions are shown regardless of what just happened. Oh, WAIT, John C. Riley as Robert the Lisping Man has his fingers put into a hot toaster as punishment for masturbating (he got caught) as that is not allowed. He does scream and shows emotions. Sexual stimulation is allowed but only given by a maid in a sort of lap dance way. <br/><br/>There is another group of people who live in the woods and are called ""Loners."" And these Loners are hunted and tranquilized by the people from the Hotel. It is against the law to flirt or have relationships among these Loners. David escapes to these people and finds the Short Sighted Woman (Rachel Weisz) and they fall for each other and have to be careful not to draw attention to themselves. The Loner Leader (Lea Seydoux) discovers that the Short-Sighted woman becomes close to David and encourages her to have her eyes fixed, but this operation intentionally leaves the Short Sighted Woman blind. One of the last scenes shows David and the now blind woman in a restaurant. David orders a steak knife and goes into the bathroom to blind himself. We don't know if he goes through with it as the movie ends. Is it possible he didn't go thru with it and returned to the Hotel to become a Lobster? (Who cares?) <br/><br/>I have mentioned many things that perhaps, I shouldn't have, but you need to know that his is not an entertaining movie. It is deeply disturbing and you have only been given a small sampling of some disturbing images and dialogues. Yes, there are many more. (Whaaat?) Remember: this is a satire and mocks relationships.<br/><br/>Here's the thing. I saw that Colin Farrell was in this and decided to watch. Tsk. Tsk.

The motivations of individual characters are just as uncompelling as the obstacles they are ""forced"" to overcome.

In Orwell's 1984 dystopia, at least we understand why the outer party members are so accepting of their situation - fear.

Many scenes were unnecessary, lingering way too long on the same thing.<br/><br/>I often felt my attention drifting away and I actually had to make an effort to register what was going on.

There's a specific thundering sequence that was so unbelievably annoying and repetitive that my friend and I laughed about it. The ending was indefinite and the most boring of all. I was indifferent to the Lobster and that's how it left me feeling as well. Indifferent to everything except the time I wasted preparing to watch this movie and watching it. I would've abandoned it by the 5th minute if it weren't for good company. So that's that, overall a snobby film. Reminds me of the Grand Budapest Hotel, except that at least had aesthetics."

","This is one of the worst pieces of crap that I have ever endured! I watched the entire movie and anything after the first ten minutes was merely hoping that the next painful minute would be better than the last. And not once was it. I am no genius but I couldn't divine from the content how humanity had gotten to this point and I hope that it never does. I don't know if it is a alternate reality or different dimension. If it was supposed to be futuristic it isn't very distant as all of the vehicles in the city scenes were cars that are currently used with only slight modifications to look futuristic. The only redeeming value was a competent and respected cast, who I would have never dreamed would have participated in such a mess, which is what duped me into watching this from the get go."

","(Humor): The true story behind the movie is this: Director Yorgos Lanthimos was sitting on a tavern with his close friend and writer Efthymis Filippou. They were eating lobster. Suddenly, Lanthimos started to talk about how art is overrated and that people tend to pretend to understand as art even the weirdest nonsense just in order to show off and blend with the other intellectuals. Filippou on the other hand, strongly disagreed with his friend.<br/><br/>At the end of their argument Lanthimos said that: ""Eftyhmi, I will show you that I'm right. I'm gonna make the stupidest movie you ever saw and people will love it"".

"ginocox-206-336968","3","57","99","24 February 2016"," A gifted cast wasted on a tedious exercise in pseudointellectual cinematic self-indulgence
","""The Lobster"" has a stellar cast of talented actors and a refreshing lack of jiggly-cam shots. The shots are carefully composed, even when there isn't much of interest on the screen. <br/><br/>Some reviewers consider the film a brilliant absurdist parody. I do not share their enthusiasm. Guy Lodge at Variety loved the film and gave it a glowing review. I'm sure he knows a lot more about the theory of film than I do. I'm just a guy who doesn't know much about Dramatica theory or monomyths, but I know what I like. <br/><br/>I found the film slow paced, tedious, overly long, hopelessly contrived, vapid, self-indulgent and decidedly not funny, amusing, compelling or thought-provoking. The characters are so aggressively uninteresting to each other and to the audience, so apathetic and so disinclined to any sort of sexual pursuit beyond masturbation, that one is amazed the society doesn't simply die out and by the end of the film, one wishes the characters would hurry up and do so. <br/><br/>The filmmakers seem to have the notion that if they simply multiply everything by negative one, reverse polarities and turn everything black to white and vice versa, that they will have a cohesive dystopian society. What we get instead is a group of characters without motives. <br/><br/>They have motives in close-up in their daily decisions, which usually default to doing nothing differently from the day before. David has a cohesive rationale for wanting to become a lobster if he doesn't find a soul mate, but seems disinclined to apply those same motives to his life as a human. <br/><br/>But nothing makes sense in the grander scheme. In dystopian films, usually the dysfunctional society is thrust upon the citizens through war, famine, pestilence, invasive vampires or some other external force. Often it is a consequence of a totalitarian government run amok, as in ""Fahrenheit 451,"" ""1984"" or ""The Hunger Games."" But the government has some sort of rationale for what they do, which usually involves perpetuating their rule. In ""Bananas,"" when Woody Allen's character assumed power in San Marcos and declared that henceforth the national language of the Latin American nation would be Swedish, it was absurd in a funny way. Here, the absurdity is created for the sake of absurdity and seems contrived. <br/><br/>If one take the time to deconstruct the film, as Lodge did, and wonder why the characters are so obsessed with finding partners who share some inconsequential physical flaw and decide that the filmmakers are parodying our tendency to seek out and identify with people who share some inconsequential interest, ability or flaw, and if you agree with the filmmakers that this is one of our defining traits, it may seem brilliantly insightful. But audience members who don't happen to share the filmmakers' cynical insights may be less enthused. <br/><br/>In ""Defiance,"" a group of Jews found refuge in the forest and soon built an elaborate, if rustic, habitation. Here a group takes refuge in the woods and never builds anything beyond digging their own graves. The actions of the ophthalmologic surgeon in contravention of the Hippocratic Oath are incomprehensible. One character is described as having absolutely no feelings, but demonstrates suspicion, anger, rage and self-congratulation. The manner in which close friends affirmed, repudiated or betrayed their friendships had little rhyme, reason or consistency. <br/><br/>The plot device of changing people into animals is taken quite seriously by the characters. Apparently it is such a simple procedure that anybody can do it, even without training and even out in the forest without any laboratory equipment. And yet we never see it. I fully expected it to be either a big lie, as in ""Logan's Run,"" or a hideous reality, as in ""Tusk."" Instead, it was frequently referenced, but never really brought into play. <br/><br/>In the end, I'm not at all certain what the filmmakers wanted to say. Given a group of unbelievable and largely unsympathetic characters existing in an unbelievable dystopian society who engage in actions without any credible motives, it's not clear what lesson we are expected to learn about our own lives. <br/><br/>The film offers a few cringe-worthy moments, but no laughs and no brilliant insights into human nature, society or courtship. It features a cast of talented, versatile and wonderfully expressive actors doing their best to display no emotion."

","Now for those who want to take an over extended facile metaphor and glorify it as art, then this might be for you. I would suggest you go and see the original metaphor of Duchamp's urinal; indeed this film is what you put in aforementioned cultural artefact.<br/><br/>Indeed any cultural import this digital decadence may tenuously have is that it itself is symptomatic of a nihilistic post-modern anomie, the lost world of the religiosity of the self, where just because you have idea everyone must be burdened by it. In the words of chairman Mao ""just because you break wind, doesn't mean I have to sniff it""<br/><br/>This facile confused dystopian narrative can only be compared to some over-indulgent self-absorbed up its own solipsistic end of year Art Show; if Tracy Emmmin made movies even she wouldn't make this. Well maybe?<br/><br/>Be warned even watching a Benny Cumberbatch period drama wont clear out the detritus of this movie from your psyche as your fatigued mind tries to piece this nonsense together for the ""cult"" director. In fact I'd rather join a cult and deal with that psychological fall-out than the trite banalities I was subjected to in the dark by this nonsense. <br/><br/>Even the sound track on its own drives you to distraction and in all likelihood to a migraine. The violence of the film is random and brutal; which was ironic as I chose it instead of going to the latest Bond romp because I was not in the mood for stylised violence. Believe me that was the only irony I experienced during this film<br/><br/>I confess the only reasons I stuck it out was that I am a tight fisted Scotsman who will get his money's worth, even if that is just sitting in a warm cinema; that it was an art house cinema and I figured that sometimes you have to suffer for that kind of indulgence and lastly I had a forlorn hope that there might be a disclaimer at the end apologising for the waste of my life and high jacking my psyche and that I might be able to claim some kind of refund on the grounds of diminished responsibility in the face of directorial indulgence, at least that would have been the decent thing, cause I sure as hell would not have done this to him.<br/><br/>My worry though dear reader is, you read this review and it might encourage the curious to go see. That is what the so-called premise of the film did to me; believe me it doesn't even hold it own.<br/><br/>If you have to see this movie then treat it like you are going to see a brutal car accident in slow motion that will require to be enacted in your head accompanied by a relentless jarring sound track forever!<br/><br/>Or you can save yourself the sheer monotonous pain and let me take the bullet for you. <br/><br/>On a lighter note the film is so bad that the ridiculous stultifying dialogue and direction actually make Colin Farrell look like he is actually acting, so good type casting there!<br/><br/>Now if you think I have been indulgent you haven't seen this, whatever this is?"

","As a Greek myself , I'd like very much to have positive feedback for this film. <br/><br/>I had seen Dogtooth with great effort not to turn the thing off , only because I had a sense of respect for the Director and I felt obliged to at least finish the damn film. <br/><br/>However I did have a feeling that Lanthimos is an -above average- Director.<br/><br/>So I gave "" the lobster "" a fresh try. I hoped this "" weird wave "" thing would be gone , and perhaps we'll get a good dystopian sci-fi from a masterful Director. <br/><br/>Sadly, this wasn't the case. The ""weird wave"" continues adamantly. <br/><br/>There is no character development , there is no insight to the dystopian set up , there is no science fiction. <br/><br/>There is only the weird. The acting is buried and we are presented with the bizarre script ,the scenery and the baroque soundtrack to add some ""quality spice"". <br/><br/>There is no entertainment in this film , each minute passed very slowly , and frankly , I was embarrassed on behalf of Colin Farrell and those other fine actors /actresses playing these ""roles"". <br/><br/>Was there even a point? Does it raise Big questions on relationships and couples and society? Was it Political? <br/><br/>I failed to see any of these hints in the film. It was just weird and bad. <br/><br/>I must say that , again , I do see that Lanthimos -can be- a good director. But since a director is the supreme maestro of a film , the man most responsible for the outcome , after such a film I cannot say that he is a good director. Only that he can be , or he might be , perhaps if he abandons his "" style "". So let's hope he doesn't remain faithful to it and his next film is free of the ugly weirdness and focuses more on character and fun. <br/><br/>1/10 (the film is borderline unwatchable)"
"eadaoin7","2","38","65","8 July 2016"," Critics & snobs love films like this--audiences don't.
","That pretty well sums up my overall impression of this film, that I admittedly had high curiosity and hopes for.<br/><br/>This is a film, like Pi, filled with many non-absorbent instances and images that culminates into nothing but stagnation, ultimately.<br/><br/>Now, granted, one man's pretension is another man's secret identity. And I get what they were going for: They were hoping to make a dark comedy about the societal pressure to be mated, and the scarlet letter on anyone's back who is alone. That's clear in the first several short scenes. So, the film accomplished its goal before the 10 minute mark. From there, it limps to a black screen - no ending, no resolution, or even a hint at continuation. Just a feeling that they ran out of either film or ideas.<br/><br/>This is a 'piece' about a man who checks into a resort for people who have come to their last hopes of finding a person to live their existences with. Sort of Howard's End-cum-Hotel California, in that no one can leave, and everyone only speaks once an hour in a monotone. The gist is that if they don't find a mate, they turn into a member of the animal kingdom. 'OK, not a bad idea, they could go somewhere with this...' I so naively think to myself after the first 4 minutes. And from there, we have the parade of statues: Characters introduced as fellow residents and meant to bring some humanity in the form of interaction. They forgot, however, to give them any substance. A nosebleed isn't a 'quirk', I'm sorry. If the actors had been directed to speak in more than one timbre, and had been written dialogue that didn't amount to a ""minutes of the meeting"" memo, then maybe they could have had something.<br/><br/>So, after some milling, the main 'character' tried to cuckold another 'character' and fails. So he leaves and finds himself embraced by another group with a separate set of standards and clothing that the group he just fled. And that about all as far as differences. The group has the same hollow, banal intonations as the people we were just tired of. And the same prattle happens all over again.<br/><br/>This has the label of Dark Comedy. But, 'dark' does not mean colorless; and, sudden gasps at horrific snap-cut deaths & mutilations do not constitute laughter, which one expects from a comedy.<br/><br/>As I said in the title, snobs will flock to this film because it gives them a perfect chance to say their favorite line: ""Well, you just didn't get it."" I just love hearing people say this. Why? Because it is usually said right after someone asks for their overall impression or opinion or reflections of what they just saw. I will never forget the time I saw a movie with some friend of a friend that was ... I think it might have been 'Pi'. I asked what he thought of that ending. He literally snapped his jaw up in the air and said, ""Well, if you didn't get it, I certainly won't be able to explain it to you."" I looked at him & said, ""You don't get it either, do you?"" He laughed, but he didn't deny what I said. 'The Lobster' is going to be THAT kind of film, you just watch. So many people have already said the 7-paragraph equivalent of 'You just didn't get it' already on here. I may get some in reply.<br/><br/>Well, you know what, my gentle 'parvenu-bies'? I got it. Everyone got it, and people who see it after this will get it.<br/><br/>Art means something different to everyone who views it; that's why film is art. And I will not dismiss this as art simply because I'm of the opinion that 'The Lobster' is the cinematic equivalent of waiting for the nurse to guide you back into the waiting room after a routine checkup.<br/><br/>Personally, if I wanted to watch an hour and a half of culminated silence peppered with 10 minutes of flaccid dialogue, I certainly wouldn't pay for that - I'd go to an empty theater before a movie starts. It would have been a more meaningful experience."

Walks up to one of them and shoots it dead.I felt as frustrated as that woman on watching this meandering excuse of a story and wished the director could have been shot to avoid the creation of this pathetic 2 hours of time waste.

","The Lobster is a load of pretentious BS, to put it simply. It's core message is an incredibly simple one, and one that the director seems to think is much more profound than it actually is. As an allegory, it's incredibly confusing - both sides are clearly meant to be villainous, but in terms of what they represent, it's black-and-white - being in a relationship or not. The audience becomes so confused that they just stop listening to what it represents, and As a story, it just doesn't work. Nobody has even a slight reason for doing anything. Society's reason for the relationship thing is never explained. The lady kills the dog for no reason. The singles are pointlessly mean and petty, and the protagonist is stupid for even trying to be with them. It's a flimsy narrative that falls apart under the slightest observation.<br/><br/>The film tried to advertise itself as a comedy, but if it weren't for the marketing, i would never had realised. It just wasn't funny. Not even slightly. Any jokes there were were either so poorly executed that they didn't even seem like jokes, or just not funny in concept. There's also a load of gore that has no reason for being there. I was covering my eyes for half of the 3rd act of the film expecting something horrible to happen (and it did often).<br/><br/>To put it simply, The Lobster is the worst kind of bad film: a bad film thinks it's way better than it actually is. it thinks it's funny when it isn't, it thinks it's deep when it isn't, and critics seem to think that it's good when it isn't.

I have seen way better and I am surprised that some of the actors in this movie actually agreed to be in it? Story aside, this film was too long and did not go into enough detail about the why and when. I have seen way better from films that were not even shot as well as this one and with an unknown cast. I cannot in good conscious recommend this film unless you want to be bored. How this has a rating of 7.6 I am at a loss to explain? I am also disappointed in how they ended the film. I think that they let it run on for so long they did not plan an ending and just had to stop leaving the viewer hanging. I think overall this story has potential in the right hands of a competent director. The acting talent was there. Overall though this was a letdown."

","A man is sent to a hotel where he has to find a mate in a few weeks time. If not, he will be transformed into an animal of his choice. That was the description I read and which made me think: ""That's an interesting idea! This could be fun!"" Unfortunately, that's where the fun ended.<br/><br/>The beginning of this movie is acceptable and still made me wonder where it was heading to. However it became more apparent with every minute that this movie was heading nowhere (sorry if that's a spoiler). Especially after the escape by the main character from the hotel the thing went from bad to worse.<br/><br/>The scene which at an early stage crashed my hopes was the first of two scenes in which the the loners in the hotel have to watch ridiculous performances of the advantages of being together instead of alone. OK, so we have some absurdism, I was prepared for that. But this scene of having grown adults watch these scenes without some of them laughing out loud or boo-ing was totally unconvincing.<br/><br/>From that moment the thing went completely down the hill, alternating between supposedly funny moments (ahem) and shocking scenes including disgusting cruelty towards animals.<br/><br/>I have watched movies, which ended quite sad, but still caused me to leave the cinema in a good mood, like, ""well at least they really loved each other"", or ""who knows what good will happen to them in the future"". The Lobster did none of this. By the time the movie was dragging to its insufferable long ending, I had seen the message that the director wanted to give (apparently) so many times that I had gone totally numb.<br/><br/>The most ridiculous was the scene where the loners in the wood (they are depicted like a kind of para military group in this society of couples) speak to their spy in the hotel. Suddenly they start to talk in French. It actually reminded me of Allo Allo (Michelle: ""Now listen carefully, I will say zis only whence""). It would have been funny except that at this time I was more concerned with my mobile phone keeping track of the time and waiting for the monster to end.<br/><br/>Now I know that movies are not made to please me but honestly, this is piece of garbage.

","This film is a great example of the ability of films to offer strong, polished images, but offer very little in polished storytelling. The film contains many strong visuals, some pleasant and some disturbing. On the pleasant side, it offers scenes in a peaceful resort, beautiful scenery, and attractive and quirky characters. On the negative, it contains images and implications of violent death to both people and animals (and blood), crude depictions of sex (both normal and criminal sex) and characters that would easily qualify as psychopathic. The dialogue uses crude language and a minimum of storytelling exposition. The overall feeling is of people who are simply emotionally retarded, except for one or two, such as a maid who finds ways to rebel against the oppressive society in which she works. The film is far too long for the amount of story and message in it. It is also disjointed, so even if it had enough storytelling, it would be hard to follow. As a view of romantic relationships in an alternate future, it can be contrasted to ""Her,"" which is a far superior film, much more moving, and much more satisfying to watch. ""Her"" tells a story in a logical sequence that leads to a sensible set of dramatic conclusions, and the viewer leaves thinking that it could plausibly happen in the foreseeable future. However, in ""The Lobster,"" I left with the thought that this is too confused to be worth my effort to take seriously as a future. All in all, this film is not worth your time.

This movie stayed in the premise but the audience was never told why the premise existed in the first place, why certain ""rules"" were instigated and why most of the things that happened happened. Much of what turned up on the screen seems to have come from the writer's random thoughts with no real chance for the audience to get involved in the story and therefore to feel any empathy for the characters.

"ClaytonDavis","10","162","316","27 September 2015"," A beautiful dream with Colin Farrell's best screen role ever...
","It took some time to let Yorgos Lanthimos' new film ""The Lobster""  settle into my mind. On the surface is a dark comedy, full of rich  images, and staggering performances from its principal cast. Deeper  lays one of the most original and heart wrenching stories on modern  relationships, likely the best seen in film since Michel Gondry's  ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""  ""The Lobster"" tells the story of a dystopian near future, where single  people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel,  where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty- five days  or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods. At the  center is David (played by Colin Farrell), who enters the Hotel with  his brother, who's been turned into a dog, and begins a domino effect  that will make him both an outcast and a fugitive.  Beginning with a hilarious and smart script by Lanthimos and co- writer  Efthymis Filippou, ""The Lobster"" gets some of the year's biggest  laughs. The two create a symphony of truth about our society's  perception of relationships and love. When David first enters the  hotel, you can see the initial despair and fight against the system. He  believes in the idea of love but isn't particularly fond of being under  its spell once again. Its simply life and death but when the story  makes him an outcast, where love is forbidden, you see his hopeless  romantic self become drawn to his ""Short Sighted Woman."" (played by  Rachel Weisz) The evolution of David's outlook on his current situation  is authentic and real, as he shows the center of his heartache in only  intermittent spurts. You can thank all that to the powerhouse  performance by Colin Farrell, who delivers his best and most audacious  film role to date.  ""The Lobster"" isn't just about its script and lead performer. It also  assembles one of the year's best cast ensembles. Rachel Weisz is a  sensation, giving her best work since her Oscar-winning role in ""The  Constant Gardener."" As the ""Lisping Man,"" its refreshing to see John C.  Reilly dig deep into a role like this, one of which we haven't seen  from him in nearly a decade. As the ""Limping Man,"" Ben Whishaw  continues to build an arsenal of titanic-like performances, all of  which solidifies him as one of the best kept secrets working today.  More roles for him please. As the ""Loner Leader,"" Léa Seydoux's  villainous and vile demeanor is a fantastical addition, adding a needed  depth and danger to the film and role. Olivia Colman's Hotel Manager is  a bonus treat, as she effortlessly brings chuckles and fear to her  mystery woman.  Cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis finds his stride and vision early on,  capturing an aesthetic that is both stylized and advantageous. The  visual contrast is dazzling and particularly noteworthy but what's  lurking between each and every frame is especially dynamic and robust.  One of the year's very best. Upon first viewing, Yorgos Mavropsaridis'  editing work can seem bloated but over 24 hours later, it's a taut and  vivaciously engaging piece, cut with a resemblance of Jeff Buchanan and  Eric Zumbrunnen's snubbed work on Spike Jonze's ""Her."" The score is  insanely haunting and very appropriate for its dark natured comic look  at life.  It took some time to digest but ""The Lobster"" feels full of life and is  a soulful opus on love. Quirky and clever, its black comic tones  shouldn't distract from its core narrative and mission; to engage the  parimeters and infatuation of devotion. Just a dream."

","Lobster fails as a film because it is burdened with far too many incredible features to make the viewer accept the reality of the bizarro world it exists in. It begins with the totally unexplained premise that an alternative universe exists in which single people are required to find a mate within 45 days or face being turned into an animal and goes down from there. For example, the primary means of attracting a mate in this alternate universe is to have some sort of defect shared by a potential lover such as nose bleeding or the inability to feel compassion. Nor is it clear why virtually every character speaks in the same stilted pseudo-Stalinist manner, or why the hotel in which they must search for a mate seems to be lifted straight from 1930s Soviet Union . In short, all credibility seems to been jettisoned in an efforts to create some kind of black humor. But the artists seem to have forgotten the humor is only funny if it is found in a credible context. There is nothing credible about any of these robotic characters nor the weird illogical world in which they live. Therefore when the film reached its final idiotic and yet repulsive conclusion I felt nothing but relief that the torture was finally over."

","The Lobster is a revolting, dull and unfunny film that attempts to be funny (in a blatantly ironic & satirical way) by employing deliberately stilted dialogue delivery and awkward scenes that sometimes present outright disgusting cruelty/gore. As the main theme of the film is to make a mockery out of modern human forms of communications & relationships this is understandable, but it falls like a limp, smelly half-dead fish that flops hopelessly on the sand in the hopes of trying to elicit attention from it's audience.<br/><br/>The idea that this is a film about the social conformity and the pressures of marriage and monogamous relationships is typical of a postmodern mindset that arrogantly rejects any kind of stability whatsoever. Besides, is this really a critique of the modern world? Is this really a film about how suffocating monogamous relationships are? If so, it seems to be a film about the pressures of the 20th century rather than the 21st since an increasing amount of people live alone than ever. The question is then: Why does The Lobster seek to satirise such a thing? One answer is partly because it is a film devoted to a specifically air-headed sort of person who lives a fairly modest if not boring state of existence, both in their social and ""professional"" lives. Of course, you can debate as much as you want about what ""The Lobster"" is about, which really shows how completely pretentious and, at the same time, vacuous it really is.<br/><br/>Of course, all this is seen by people who admire the film as very intelligent and daring because, as well all know, laughing at modern existential suffering of humans in the form of presenting scenes full of crude and violent symbology is apparently hilarious - if you're someone with an anti-social, psychopathic or sociopathic mindset, that is. All the scenes are typical of the symbology of an arm-chair psychologist. It seems to make the overall point that people do irrational things - out of fear of loneliness - to belong in society. It screams out: ""This is what we all do.""<br/><br/>Ultimately, it is a film that presents a presumptuous and misanthropic view of ""all"" human beings with the exception of the arrogant admirations of the ""one"" person watching and lapping up the self-indulgent narrative of the film. The fact that this is categorised as ""comedy"" only reflects the overall sadomasochistic nature of The Lobster."

The sheer novelty of it all sucks you in.<br/><br/>However, almost as quickly, the cracks in the concept and plot start to appear. Why do people go along with the preposterous idea? If they are forced to find a partner, why not just find anyone and pretend to be a couple, rather than suffer this fate? While obviously the central idea is quite ridiculous, it is the way people respond to it that is truly implausible and sets the movie up to fail.<br/><br/>Also, why does the opposite of this ""couples are everything"" regime have to be a ""being a perpetual loner is the only way to go"" group. Surely there can be a middle ground? The extreme polarity of it all was irritating. <br/><br/>Despite these flaws, however, there was a chance this could develop into an interesting drama. I figured I was happy to overlook these obvious faults if the movie got some momentum. Alas, no, it just gets worse and worse. From a point the plot just becomes very random and, ultimately, pointless.<br/><br/>Only worth watching if you're curious to know what all the fuss is about, but be prepared to be disappointed."

","A film that ought to ooze charm, wit and menace – instead The Lobster, complete with its ludicrous plot, is extremely heavy-handed, and due to gratuitous scenes of animal cruelty, repellent. <br/><br/>The stilted dialogue implies a disingenuous subservience to a pervasive totalitarianism. It is as convincing as the overdubbed voice-tracks on early 1970s German sex comedies. The standard of acting is no better – Farrell and Weisz sleepwalk and procrastinate unnecessarily throughout the movie. The production values are non-existent – whatever budget the director had available was clearly spent on renting a hotel for a day or two and hiring the cast. A cast that that largely appear to regret ever becoming involved in this train crash of a film. <br/><br/>The Lobster is desperate to both unsettle and amuse. Excepting a kitsch performance of Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart by the hotel managers, there are no smiles. Animal cruelty aside, this film is less disturbing – and not as credible - as Santa Claus Conquers The Martians. <br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, the ending is abrupt and unfathomable; no doubt designed to seed speculation and debate on internet forums. <br/><br/>The film would love to be Kafkaesque. Orwellian, even. It dreams of being Terry Gilliam's Brazil. But The Lobster is not even poor man's science fiction. No self-respecting art house cinema should even consider screening this drivel. No thrift store should accept unwanted DVD and Blu Ray copies of this utter tosh.<br/><br/>There are online sci-fi shorts with more imagination, flair and purpose than The Lobster.

It over uses pseudo intellectual psychobabble to disguise pointless animal cruelty and an empty sterile plot. I anticipated a dry comedy and a creative tale about relationships. Being an animal lover, I was looking forward to a film that explored the depth of relations a human can have with the unconditional love an animal has with its owner. Instead, the film lacked any depth regarding relationships at any level, human or animal. Film critics may like it. I cannot fathom viewers liking it. The idea of the film was very catchy.

As a result of that, it is impossible to support or care for them on their journey, as they do not seem to care themselves. <br/><br/>The films genre is also all over the place, I know it was on purpose, but when you are a romantic comedy, with a bit of drama and elements of science fiction, but without any special effects, it becomes messy and hard for an audience to keep up with. Unfunny and simply boring to watch, The Lobster suffers from the fact that the director is trying so hard to deliver a groundbreaking and original story that he forgets what makes a movie compelling in the first place. <br/><br/>A recently divorced man is forced to go to a hotel, in which he is given 45 days to find a new love, or else he must become a different animal. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Colin Farrell / Worst Performance: Olivia Colman"

It is a potentially interesting concept, which is completely and totally ignored in exchange for the director's obsession with pseudo-torture porn and a genuine misunderstanding on the nature of human relationships and friendships. It makes me as a viewer wonder if the director understands human interactions at all. In fact in every major way that one can judge a story, the movie fails horribly.<br/><br/>Consistent or discernible Plot: There is not a coherent plot or story arc to this movie. While it does follow the ""story"" of Colin Ferrell (who does put on a powerful performance), there is no real arc to his story. Things (mostly painful and unnecessary things) just seem to happen to the characters, and often you find yourself as a viewer wondering whether the director had any intention other than just being shocking.<br/><br/>Character Development: Don't hold your breath if you are looking to see anything resembling that. He starts miserable, and remains miserable. His character isn't likable or empathetic, but just desperate and lonely. There are no characters in this movie as a viewer I found myself empathizing with, and the only characters who are actually likable in the movie are subjected to outrageously cruel treatment.<br/><br/>An understandable message: Leaving the theater after watching this movie I was left with two distinct thoughts ""Why did I just do that to myself?"" and ""Did the director even know what they were trying to do?"" If the director had intended to pass some message or moral on to their audience they failed in every regard. The premise is never explained or explored, the characters don't grow they simply act, the world is shallow and impossible. I came out just hating every character in the movie except for John C Reilly's, not because the actors failed to act well, but because their character's had no determinable motivations and every choice they make is baffling.<br/><br/>This movie would have been much better, had it been a 25 minute short film without the minutes of dead silence, and the gratuitous violence."

When David's wife leaves him he is sent to The Hotel where he has 45 days to find a partner. If he finds one - awesome. If he fails, he will be turned into an animal. Of his choice, naturally.<br/><br/>It's stylish, it's got technique, it's disorienting (in a good way), it asks questions about us and doesn't really care about hearing our answers. It instills within you the great sense of uneasiness that the characters must feel in this collection of increasingly odd situations through stilted, brutally frank dialogue in a masterclass of a script. The performances, also, are stunning. I was pleasantly surprised by Rachel Weisz in her subtly moving role as the Short Sighted Woman.<br/><br/>Having watched it no more than five hours ago, I find myself recalling it as if it was a dream. The carefully considered combination of editing and cinematography gives the feature that lifted, slightly angled and unaligned feel. Its world presents itself to you in a disembodied kind of way and, in the way you may leave your bed after a dream, you will leave the cinema questioning everything about it.<br/><br/>I can honestly say The Lobster has entered the ranks of my favourite films.

Sad, because in some weird and eclectic way this maybe could have been an interesting movie...."
"MovieRat-2","2","11","16","28 January 2017"," Intriguing premise.....depressingly disappointing
","(Very minor spoilers)<br/><br/>Sometime late 2016, I happened across a trailer for this strange looking film starring Colin Farrell. At its very basic, it is the story of a guy who goes to a hotel and he must find love in 45 days or he will be transformed into the animal of his choice...in this case, a lobster. It was very strange and the trailer implied that it would be comedy of sorts (Dark humor, maybe?) set in a world similar to ours but yet very different. I missed it when it came out in theaters and I have only just watched it via Red Box.<br/><br/>There was one glaring question as I watched this film and after it was done: how did this film get all this praise (3rd place at Cannes, and nominated for Best Screenplay at the Academy Awards)? <br/><br/>To hear/read the accolades and to listen to the cast and crew reminisce on how beautiful and thought provoking this film was...made me wonder if I am just not in tune with ""true art"". Maybe my rational brain is incapable of absorbing the nuances of the director's soft yet firm take on the love story. Yes, this supposedly a love story set to a dystopian dark comedy. A dark comedy it is not, not even the slightest snicker even dared to pass my lips the entire film. What did pass my lips was either a yawn or a demand for the film to ""get on with it!"" and stop dragging it's feet.<br/><br/>Here is the main problem: the majority of the film possessed absolutely zero emotion. The only time anyone even gave a hint of human emotion was when something painful/traumatizing occurred to a character. The rest of the time they spoke like Ben Stien after taking too many depressants. The actors said that if they gave any emotion it would detract from the beauty of the script...I'm sorry, when Shyamalan characters have more natural sounding dialogue than you then there is a serious problem. It also doesn't help that the majority of the cast don't speak English as a primary language...or that this is the first English language film by this director!<br/><br/>And what about the love story? It is more a story about what is love or how you know you are in love. In this film and the setting...love is finding someone who has a similar distinguishing characteristic to you regardless of true feelings. You have a limp, I have a limp...we are a perfect match! Yes, the ""love"" in this film is that absurd (not funny absurd, just depressingly sad absurd). And then you have the two societies in this film: the couples and the loners. The couples are the general population that forces everyone to strive toward partnership regardless of actual feelings. Concepts like individualism are oppressed and family is simply a product to help combat partner conflict. The loners are the ones living free in the woods to be individuals.....individuals that must live by the group's rules or suffer terrifying punishment on par with what the couples do. <br/><br/>The film is absurd to the core. The characters are not at all realistic. The absurd dystopian society exists without rhyme or reason. The plot aimlessly drags on forever. And the ambiguously sudden ending left me shouting ""Thank God It's Over!"" rather than ""No! I want to know what happened!"" <br/><br/>If you must see it, rent it for find a free copy. Spend as little money as you can on this ""film.""<br/><br/>I give this film one steaming red lobster....straight into the trash can."

I'm by no means sure that this is the director's intention or concept, however. The film reminds me of more than one opera I have seen on German stages, where the director dresses up an obscure concept with all kinds of strange touches whose purpose seems to be to mystify the audience.

","The lobster is possibly one of the worst movies ever made.
The characters are thrown in a dystopian world where singles have 45 days to get back on track and find a soul mate or be transformed into animals. And it gets even worse. Inmates at the ""coupling hotel"", which is a mix between a lunatic asylum and the love boat, are forced to hunt each other with anaesthetic darts to prolong their stay at the hotel and get more chances to mate.
Acting is pretty dreadful: Colin Farrel could not act to save his life, and apparently it was an ""artistic"" choice to make all characters behave like lobotomy patients.
The hero does not get a better deal with the revolutionaries, singles that chose to live in the woods, and whose rules are even more stringent.

","The premise of this movie was actually appealing and it seemed to have potential as a quirky satire. However, this movie is so bad in so many ways that I stopped it about halfway through.

In the good ones, the story revolves around real people struggling with difficult situations. But in this one, based on their reactions to various ridiculous situations, every character in this story behaved as though borderline insane or deranged or drugged. I rated this a 2 instead of 1 for the nice scenery and for Rachel Weiss who is always a pleasure to watch. Both were wasted on this nonsense.<br/><br/>A week after watching the first hour, I watched the balance to see if there was anything interesting or thought provoking to take away from this. There was not. My best summary for this is: boring, disturbing, sick, and a waste of time."

things he and the ""heartless woman"" did when they got together.
Yet, he turned down the biscuit girl for sex. 45 DAYS and his
time was clearly running out. They at LEAST had sex in
common which was SOMETHING. He had virtually
NOTHING in common with the heartless woman.
If you are going to fake a relationship, fake being
a sexaholic instead of being emotionless. Yes???
A lot more fun. <br/><br/>And, what was up with the Lonelys. Why the
rule of no hook-ups?? It seems not a very good way
to live being hunted all the time and if you got hooked 
up you wouldn't be in violation of the law anymore. 
Or did I miss something?? It seems they would WANT to be
hooked up to live in the city. <br/><br/>And what as up with the donkey? I know, I know..

"synallagi","4","13","20","14 July 2016"," an advertising guru posing as indie film director
","I have watched many mediocre films like the Lobster and always blamed either myself for not figuring it out sooner or the production company behind the misleading marketing hype that lured me into the theater. Never have I blamed the director whose vision and labor I differentiate from such mishaps, regardless of how much I disliked their film. Lanthimos however takes the full blame because his films rely exclusively on a marketing stunt idea and the precondition of the extraordinary tease.<br/><br/>In fact, without the tease there would be no film. The director ends up turning an idea that typically stands as the starting premise for a complex story ready to unravel (see Godard's Alphaville or Truffeaut's Fahrenheit 451) into the only idea that according to him requires description and analysis. More than one film hour is spent demonstrating the different aspects of this unique teasing idea from every possible angle, without the plot moving from it.<br/><br/>The unsatisfactory tease, a forced tactic from advertising executives and a director's nightmare, appears as the organic part of Lanthimos' films. The idea of turning a corporate disadvantage into an artistic advantage felt creepy until i read on the internet that this guy and his script writing partner were advertising gurus in Greece before shifting into film making. So, no wonder.<br/><br/>Another disadvantage he has turned into an advantage is... being Greek. 10 years ago his skills or even his style would simply be inadequate for the film industry, coming from a country with no film tradition or industry. Today, a man who can make films that look three times their budget (the norm expertise required in small advertising markets like Greece) and himself costing 5 times less than any other director in the market who can produce the same stuff is pure gold.<br/><br/>He also tells the dark awkward stories the teenagers love to see in a film (I have no doubt that the average age of the Lobster's audience is 17, add some older barely educated childish hipsters on top). Youngsters are the fresh butter.<br/><br/>Everyone loves the youth. Even star actors like Kidman (soon to star on a lanthimos film) who want to reboot their career and introduce themselves to a new generation of film consumers. Why not do it with a man who for an indie newbie knows how to light, frame and tell a seemingly more sophisticated story than the Ring II (the Oscar gravitas must remain intact). Kidman appeals to older ages? Good for lanthimos, maybe this is the last awkward film he has to make and can finally move to level 2. I love win-win situations.<br/><br/>It is clear that Lanthimos plan is to pose as an indie film director as much as he can to preserve fresh status until he hits it big on the mainstream market (god knows what will happen then, does anyone remember edgy Francois Ozon?). He won't stop repeating his maniere teasing awkwardness (good recipe, why spoil it like other directors have done?) until there's not a stone in this planet that hasn't seen one of his weird films. His ticket to big money. Good luck Yorgos! <br/><br/>Boo hoo (again) for the cinephile.<br/><br/>ps. Lanthimos interviews where he goes on and on in a painfully slow and funny way describing a total nothing are a must watch."

"dario_malic","8","44","82","30 July 2015"," Is this love that I'm feelin'?
","Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos has made a name for himself with strange, absurd films, so it's not unexpected that 'The Lobster' falls in the same category. The story is set in a dystopian world where all single people get sent to some sort of hotel where they have a limited number of days to find a partner or they'll be transformed in an animal of their choosing.<br/><br/>The methods the staff at the hotel use to convince people it's better to be with someone, although shown with deadpan humour, are very disturbing and unexpectedly effective. For instance, when people arrive at the hotel one of their hands is tied up behind their backs to show them that ""everything is easier in pair"". But there's also a way to extend your stay and remain single. The nearby forest is a hiding place for a group of runaways from the hotel who the residents go out to hunt once in a while. For each successful capture they get their stay extended. It's a pretty straightforward representation of society's fight against diversity and those who don't adhere to rules, but Lanthimos doesn't stay there.<br/><br/>In the second half of the film, when the focus moves from the hotel to the forest, we get even more rigorous rules and brutal demonstration of intolerance for those who don't follow them. It's one of director's ironical twists, but also a disturbing example of illogical and revengeful human nature. Those who were forced to find a partner formed a community in which it is forbidden to have a partner, or even just flirt. Main character proves to be an constant exception and keeps breaking the rules wherever he is and whatever they are (which brings to question whether there's any possibility for him to have a happy ending), symbolizing in that way a fight for individuality inside an oppressive system.<br/><br/>I've wrote more about its messages and themes (although I've mentioned but a few) than about the film itself because I find them more interesting. That's not to say that the film isn't good, on the contrary. It's a film with great acting, haunting music, bleak, washed up cinematography (which perfectly suits its themes) and many standout scenes. It's just that the philosophy behind it is more impressive than what goes on on the surface. 'The Lobster' is more than meets the eye, all the way to its questioning, if not engrossing, ending."
"lvilardo-551-49220","3","9","13","11 June 2016"," Art or self-indulgent drivel?
","Many years ago, as a young film student, I attended a screening of a film called ""Savages"" at which the director, James Ivory, was present for Q and A. Savages is about a group of primitives who stumble out of the forest to find an abandoned mansion. They enter and, one by one, assume the various trappings of civilization. One character finds and plays a cello. And, as you could have guessed, one by one, they leave the mansion to return to their presumably more noble lives in the wild. <br/><br/>After the screening one attendee earnestly asked Ivory, ""By having the cellist be the last one to leave the mansion were you making the statement that it is the artist who is the last to appreciate his art?"" Ivory bemusedly shrugged and responded, ""Um, no, I mean, somebody had to leave last.""<br/><br/>I think of that moment when I see a film like The Lobster and see how very hard some people will work to ascribe profound meaning to what some others will dismiss as self- indulgent drivel. <br/><br/>I'll concede that's probably too strong a criticism in this case. The Lobster's artifice, which I won't bother to describe since so many of the other reviews have done so already, is clever enough and the film has its moments, some of which are genuinely funny. <br/><br/>The struggle to find loving relationships and dealing with loneliness are central tenets of our existence and Lanthimos deserves credit for examining them in an offbeat and inventive way. But, despite it's ardor, The Lobster fails to develop the subject matter in any meaningful way or reveal anything particularly insightful. It pretty much says all it has to say in the first 30 minutes and the rest of its two-hour length finds us waiting for a point which never comes. <br/><br/>By itself that might have been excusable were it not for a relentlessly somber tone and pace that wore me down to the point where any concern I had for the characters was replaced by an obsession with checking my watch to see how much more I'd have to endure."

","The Lobster left me Crabby<br/><br/>If you had to be turned into an animal, what would it be? <br/><br/>That is the set up for the film, ""The Lobster."" People go to 'The Hotel' from 'The City' because of a tragic romantic loss and are forced to choose the animal they will become if they don't find a life partner in forty-five days. It is unclear whether people are forced to go there or they choose to go because of their emotional loss. One bit of dialogue could have solved this problem, such as, ""I had to come here because my wife left me; Why are you here?"" would have solved this conundrum. That is just one of several parts of the story that are unclear. A film that is not completely explained is one thing; a film that is inexplicable is a let down. Like the Lynch film ""Inland Empire"", ""The Lobster"" ends too soon but goes too long and is more confusing than mysterious. <br/><br/>The Hotel is a combination of the worst dating scenes know to humanity. Some people are there seeking a relationship, others are happily hooked up while others try to mess up those romantic bonds using rumor, lies, unfortunate truths and the maiming of others. <br/><br/>Some critics say this film is in a dystopian future. It seems more like a parallel present, with the film being an allegory for relationships and how we treat each other. It is an incredibly interesting story until near the end. The setting changes, a new plot point emerges and while interesting, the end doesn't honor the quality of the rest of the film. An interesting ending might have saved the film and made it fabulous, but it got lazy. It seems the director and writer didn't know how to end it, so they left it hanging. I don't need everything resolved, but setting us up and not resolving anything is bad film making. <br/><br/>Imagine 'The Usual Suspects' ending with the scene of Verbal Kint sitting in a chair in Detective Kujan's office, then a fade to black. Imagine 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' ending on a shot of the three gun men facing off in the graveyard, then fade to black. Nope, the directors and writers of those films knew they needed and ending, wrote one, filmed it, and then distributed it. 'The Lobster' fails to end and runs too long. It is a major disappointment, for it had such a great beginning and middle sections. Not even the good acting, great cinematography and good editing could save the film from dying. <br/><br/>The critics love this vagueness, as if being confusing was artsy, just like critics once called a blank canvas fine art. It's all up to interpretation, you see, so go forth and interpret. Well, then why make a film at all? At Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 90% rating by the critics. I wonder if half of them fell asleep near the ending or went to the bathroom and missed the vast emptiness of its mindless conclusion? That must be it. Who else can explain such ratings?<br/><br/>Rating: Rent it. I have written myself into it giving it a low rating. It disappoints so completely at the end that it doesn't deserve more. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"

"Manal1987","10","19","34","8 February 2016"," The Lobster: The Absurdist Brilliance of Yorgos Lanthimos
","In a world where staying single is a breach of acceptable social norms, single people are isolated in a hotel and forced to find a partner in 45 days otherwise they will be turned into an animal of their choosing. People who somehow manage to escape to the woods are called 'loners' and are occasionally hunted by the hotel dwellers. An incongruous story that must have made Kafka dance in his grave, not only because it breaks away from logic but because it takes the absurd to a new level of significance. The Lobster has all elements of absurdist fiction – dark humor, irrationality, and cynicism, add to that a lurking social criticism that hits your mind and soul hard. The narrative is constructed in a way that lures you into giving up all your logical defenses after the first few minutes and totally surrender to the surreality of events. I truly envy writer and director Yorgos Lanthimos for having a mind that can come up with such twisted and brilliant stories.<br/><br/>If you have to choose between pretending to have feelings when you don't and pretending not to have feelings when you do, which would you prefer? This seems to be the kernel question of the film. The hotel dwellers are forced to pretend they have feelings for people in order to avoid being turned into animals. On the other hand, the loners are banned from showing feelings for each other even if they do. This absurd conundrum levels harsh criticism against a society that advocates binary opposition, an inherent concept that has become part and parcel of the human belief system of love and relationships as well. From the beginning of the film, it is made clear that there are no gray areas in this world; you're either heterosexual or homosexual, a size 44 or a size 45. It might not be that severe in the real world, but emotional extremism is just as bad. If you are in a relationship, you are expected to love to the fullest, and if you appreciate isolation and individuality, you are stigmatized as a heartless loner all the way through. Whatever you choose, you have to bend your personality or change something in yourself to fit in either group. In the film, this forced appropriation takes an emotional and a physical form, and it keeps you wondering which leaves more permanent scars, emotional or physical transformation? The story disparages a society that fails to acknowledge the paradoxical human condition – humans need company, yet they are innately loners; they love other people, yet they love themselves more; they have feelings, yet feelings are not meant to last forever; they are spiritual, yet predominantly physical. A world that fails to recognize this complexity is a pathetic, oppressive place.<br/><br/>As usual, Lanthimos' script is funny, iaconic and strikingly smart; all the dialogues are meaningful despite their seeming absurdity, and the scenes are meticulously written to contribute to the intricate world of the story and its underlying intended significance. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when the hotel manager (Olivia Colman) visits David (Colin Farrell) in his room and tells him that he has to carefully choose the animal he wants to turn into because, as an animal, he won't be able to have a sexual relationship with an animal of a different species, something that he can't already do as a human being since he has to find a 'matching' partner. The whole conversation is very humorous and absurd, and the joke continues as we see how people strive hard to find matching qualities in their partners including nosebleeds, limps, good voice, shortsightedness and lack of emotions. An extremely elaborate and cunning joke that deconstructs the myth of soulmate.<br/><br/>I think the acting is great and one of the main sources of dark humor and irony in the film. Imagine a story about love and relationships where actors don't show a single hint of emotions and talk and walk like constipated corpses most of the time. Martin McDonagh has already rediscovered Colin Farrell as a comedian in In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths and it is always nice to see another director picking up on that streak. Ben Whishaw and Aggeliki Papoulia are notably spectacular.<br/><br/>As if it isn't enough for Lanthimos to subvert storytelling and acting norms, he seems to play with artistic trends too. If you are familiar with the Lars von Trier's cinematographic experimentation (Antichrist and Melancholia in particular), you will see how Lanthimos uses slow motion and classic music to create a grandiose effect that stands in a hilarious contrast with the event taking place on the screen.<br/><br/>The Lobster is another must-watch multilayered witty narrative from the impeccable imaginarium of Yorgos Lanthimos.<br/><br/>It went straight to my heart and to my all-time favorite films list."

","After watching the trailer for The Lobster, I decided to watch it. It felt like a quirky, off beat comedy with a main character who is socially awkward, looking for love. But what I found instead was a movie that dealt with themes of fascism, conformity, oppression, suicide, loss of personal identity, and frankly a depressing soundtrack.<br/><br/>The lesser offense in this movie is the over-narration, which spoon feeds facts to the viewer as we see them happening on screen much like Idiocracy, only this time it's serious and not a joke. Please stop narrating movies and let the viewer experience the journey along with the characters. Stop the spoon feeding.<br/><br/>The greater offense to this film involves two instances of animal cruelty that was enough to turn my stomach and end this movie half way through.<br/><br/>This movie is not a comedy, rather a pitch black dark comedy."

","This film is like an inverted pyramid that starts off with good, big juicy ideas and gradually becomes progressively more small-minded, self-conscious and lost in belly-button lint picking. Main ideas being: what is a couple? Who decides? When does the solitary self need another self to be complete? Unfortunately the narrative loses speed as it progresses towards a climax that never really happens. It's a story that lack catharsis. It is crippled by literary development (too wordy!). It tells too much and shows too little -- specially after the escape from the sanitarium. Why? Is the wordiness supposed to be meaningful? If so, the meaning does not come across. The culminating vacuum scene in the highway restaurant is what Woody Allen used to call a ""take the camera and run"" ending -- the film stops but doesn't really arrive at a conclusion. In spite of the movie going from hot to tepid to deadly dull (honestly, it's one of those movies you start looking at the time about 60% through...) -- some of the acting -- specially that of Angeliki Papoulia and Léa Seydoux -- is truly charismatic. But these occasional jewels -- as the use of our contemporary nowhere shopping mall placelessness in key scenes -- exist amid a very uneven and overall an intellectually pretentious effort. The film suffers from a lack of overall coherence. In sum, a good effort -- but better luck next time."

","This film is neither pretentious nor stupid. This is a great representation of what it feels like to want to fit in: people will do whatever it takes.

Just wanting to fit in.
When or if you decide that you don't want to be a part of this group after all, you eventually come across another group that (as with the first one) seems great and just for you. But this one has it's ridiculous limits too.

","Contains spoilers.<br/><br/>First, I'm a fan of quirky films, indie movies, and stuff that's generally non- mainstream (in addition to regular mainstream stuff like Star Wars or whatnot), so I was curious about this film from the trailer. <br/><br/>I get that this film is a satire about finding true love, including a host of other interesting ethical questions, but in doing so it tries to be as off-putting as possible, as if to say ""only smart people will make it through this film."" In essence, it's a pompous movie. I've seen plenty of smart, challenging films that don't insult the audience by showing how smart the director or writer is.<br/><br/>From the get go, you're going to be watching long-takes, which is fine, I love well-composed shots, except the shots and cinematography in this film are not particularly interesting nor well-composed.<br/><br/>You're also going to have to sit through a first hour of dialogue that's delivered so stilted (for the sake of satire) you'll wonder how these A-List actors could possibly be in a film that's acted worse than your first-grader's play.<br/><br/>The film opens up a little after the halfway point and becomes more human, but it took everything for me to make it through that first hour. I'm just riffing here, but every line sounds and is delivered about as thinly as it's written below:<br/><br/>""Would you like to have some tea?""<br/><br/>Awkward pause.<br/><br/>""Yes. I think I would like to have some tea. Thank you. That is very nice.""<br/><br/>""You are welcome.

For if you do not have kindness, what else do you have.""<br/><br/>Awkward pause.<br/><br/>""Yes ...""<br/><br/>Awkward pause.<br/><br/>""... That is true. Okay. Then. I think it will be good if we kiss now.""<br/><br/>""Very well. How would you like your kiss?""<br/><br/>""I think on the lips. Thank you.""<br/><br/>Awkward pause. They kiss for ten seconds.<br/><br/>""It was nice to kiss you.""<br/><br/>""You are welcome.

The writer and director were trying to be too smart for their own good and in turn try their best to alienate the viewers to show their intelligence. I love smart movies, just not ones that purposefully try to tick me off as a mode of emotional engagement."

","""The Lobster"" is a Movie about love and society! Is a dark comedic tragedy made in the context of the Greek Weird Cinematic Wave and it's a masterpiece of the silver screen.
The acting is absolute perfect for what it must be, but the ultimate protagonist here is Lanthimos's mesmerising Original Screenplay. So, If you are willing to Take an obscure view on society and it's basic pieces, this is your movie!"
"Mick-435","1","5","7","20 February 2019"," Please do not suggest anyone Watch this film (or watch it yourself)
","The best advice I can give to anyone who hasn't seen this movie is to not watch the movie. DEFINITELY do not suggest anyone watch it with you. This is the type of movie that will lead to movie picking probation. Anytime in the future when your significant other or friends have a debate over what film to see, this will be the first and only exhibit presented which will result in an automatic veto of your suggestion. The only acceptable time to suggest this film is if you are trying to end a friendship or get out of a messy relationship. Now on to the movie itself.<br/><br/>Pretentious doesn't even begin to describe this movie. You can tell early on that the director was making this for film critics and could care less about the audience. The premise is quirky and is used ad nauseam to pound the same message home.We get it. Society has dumb/superficial rules and traditions that we all go along with. When these rules are shown through the lens of a dystopian society that in some way mirrors our own culture, the absurdity of these rules is revealed. This is a valid point, but the director spends 2 painful hours hammering this same point through escalating, unnecessary violence. ""The audience is about to fall asleep for the 100th time in the first 45 minutes? Cue shot of mutilated dog."" I should have known right then that the film would have no redeeming qualities. At that point, the director had already spent way too much time upping the ante of how disturbed and uncaring the female character was.<br/><br/>The story gets even more boring when the main character makes his way to the woods to live with the outcasts. This is when you get to spend another hour+ of your life watching the same point play out. There are quirky rules in this group as well, and the director is going to show you just how brutal and violent the repercussions are if not followed. Did the scene with the mutilated dog not shock you? Maybe cutting peoples lips/mouths with razor blades or forcing someone to have intercourse with a pig will keep you interested in the movie. Don't worry, if you still find yourself in need of more senseless violence, there's also intentional blinding and dogs eating peoples faces off.<br/><br/>The movie is a dark, depressing, emotionless film that takes entirely too long to play out. I have no idea why a critic would like this movie. Maybe they were amazed at how the Director was able to bore an audience so thoroughly despite including the most gortesque scenes throughout the film."

","I don't usually write reviews, but this one was just that bad. Now, the main idea of the film, and this is a bit of a <br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>is basically that that society puts too much pressure on people being in a relationship. You are either forced to conform to the social norm, or be treated as some sort of an outcast (hunted or turned into an animal, in this case). It had some commentary about the superficiality of relationships as well, if my memory serves, with people getting together because they both had nosebleeds, or they both had limps or whatnot.<br/><br/>SPOILER ENDED<br/><br/>While the ideas presented could be valid, this film is firstly, very on the nose, driving the same point over and over again, and worst of all, it is an absolutely boring mess, with the film's main distinctive features getting old pretty quickly, unfunny flat deliveries and situations that are absurd, but not plausible even in the way the movie constructs its universe.<br/><br/>This movie is not art, it's pretentious garbage."
"Qrobur","4","8","13","23 March 2016"," Leaden, juvenile and dreary nonsense
","Is it a satire? Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? No, it's an earthbound turkey.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos appears to be a director in the mould of Roy Andersson, that is, somebody who has mistaken miserabilist absurdism for profundity and who literally projects it at us on the narcissistic assumption that we all think the same. Fortunately, most of us do not.<br/><br/>'The Lobster' is a failure for a number of reasons. First, a satire is supposed to point out the absurdity of a state of affairs by depicting it absurdly but recognisably. However, nowhere in this film, except towards the very end, is there a relationship that is at all recognisable, absurdly contorted or otherwise. If 'The Lobster' is a satire, it misses its mark because it's not clear at what mark it aims. Secondly, is it a comedy? If you conceive of a comedy as something that makes you laugh, chuckle, smile or even is a little amusing, 'The Lobster' is not a comedy. There is a complete dearth of humour in this film; black, dark, twisted, absurd or any other kind. Thirdly, is it a drama? Well maybe, in a thin, unsatisfying manner. Of course, this film has no substantial dénouement so I'd argue it's not a drama. 'The Lobster' has another debilitating flaw. It appears to be two films and it's hard to avoid the impression the second half has been tacked onto the first because the director and writers had little idea what to do with the original material.<br/><br/>So, what is 'The Lobster'? In passing, there is some decent cinematography and Ireland is made to look sternly beautiful on these occasions. However, above all what 'The Lobster' is, is absurd. Regrettably, this isn't the kind of absurdity that has something to say about the human condition. It's the kind of absurdity that is preposterous and uninteresting.<br/><br/>I think it's absurd this film was made. It appears to be the product of an immature mind with an inchoate understanding of human relationships. The result is dismally boring."
"Kino_Corner","4","8","13","8 February 2016"," Meandering and monotone in every single aspect
","Let me preface this review by giving some attention to the truly fantastic poster art for this film. Whoever designed it did a great job. But now this poster frustrates me when I look at it. When I first saw this poster, I thought I was going to get something actually engaging, thought-provoking, a more nuanced and intellectual take on modern relationships. As it turns out, the poster is one of the only truly good parts about ""The Lobster"", and yes, it has nothing to do with the movie itself. I am not familiar with or have seen the director's previous work, so I come in with no biases or particular expectations beyond the poster and that it stars Colin Farrell, an extremely competent and fluid actor who scored some great roles in the past. <br/><br/>The film's premise is highly original and almost begging for fantastic execution in providing a succinct dark comedy. ""In a dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods."" This is great stuff they're working with, and this premise does indeed provide some truly good scenes in the first half of this two-hour film. Notice how I said, ""first half"". <br/><br/>For some reason it seems the filmmakers were making this great story, a dry-witted satire about being turned into an animal if you don't find a partner in this nightmarish hotel, and they just up and said to each other, ""you know what? F*ck this, who the hell would want to see this! No, no, let's ditch this premise and make it all about boring sh*t involving people speaking in monotone to each other in the woods, doing absolutely nothing? Yeah mate, that sounds fantastic, let's f*cking do it, let's crash this movie into mumblecore monotone indie garbage with nothing interesting going on except watching some ""romance"" of characters the audience has absolutely no interest in!"" <br/><br/>Screw you, filmmakers. I expected a lot more from this. I may not have expected an ""amazing"" movie, or perhaps even a ""great"" one, but I certainly didn't expect myself to be watching the screen with my eyes half-open wondering ""what the hell is this?"" Some bits are good however, there is one particular bit in the hotel portion of the movie (the only half-decent portion) where a lady crushing on Colin Farrell says she will commit suicide if she doesn't find a partner. He doesn't reciprocate her feelings and then we are treated to a particularly gut-wrenching seen where she plops right in front of him and he just stands there looking uncomfortable and flirting with a psychopathic woman who he suddenly falls in love with. And then I find myself wondering, wait a minute, this was a good scene. Since when is Colin Farrell a psychopath or attracted to psychopaths? Why does he want to set up with a woman like this that *spoiler alert* he has a bad end with the very next night?<br/><br/>And from then on, it only goes downhill. It doesn't help at all that every single actor in the movie is speaking in such a disgustingly uncharismatic monotone, nobody cares if this was the ""point"" it makes a dreadful movie! Who wants to watch stupid, illogical unsympathetic characters who all speak to each other in a single tone of voice? You're better off giving the premise to a five year old child and telling them to draw a series of stick-figure pictures on what happens.You'll receive a more entertaining movie than this."

I don't think that I give anything away with the review, so I am not marking this a spoiler, because the movie has almost nothing to actually spoil.<br/><br/>I guess the movie is a commentary on the fickleness of love and the things that we do to be in love, and what we think love is, and etc. Somehow the whole thing is predicated on a view that love is merely an on-off switch that requires equal defects between two persons. Maybe if you asked an alien what love is, this movie would be the answer.<br/><br/>I think of the movie as 2 narratives stuck together: 1) a man that isn't in love being in a place where he tries to force love, followed by 2) that same man being in a place where love is forbidden and he is in love. Both settings show absurd personal and institutional cruelty against humans, animals, etc.<br/><br/>Some of the sexual dialogue is clearly intended to shock or amuse, but it doesn't and it seems out of place. There is a light torture scene with a toaster (no worse than Ghostbusters 2). The delivery of dialog is purposefully stilted/wooden and the characters are 1- dimensional. The training skits are like kindergarten meets 1984.

","I will start with what I actually liked. The end credits were amazing,I was so thrilled that this pathetic excuse for a movie was finally over. I can't remember the last time I was so grateful to see 113 minutes of pure misery come to an end. That should sum it up.<br/><br/>First of all, I have no idea what I was supposed to gather from this sorry movie. It seemed so promising, since singledom and relationships are a recurrent theme in today's society. What looked like an intriguing idea - the stigmatization of single people - took a sudden turn for the absolute worst. At this point in the movie, which is maybe 20-30 minutes in, the director decided it was a good idea to add a bunch of random elements, so that by the end of it everyone felt confused and as if they wasted their time. And boy, was that so. On one hand you have some delusional, closed minded people, who throw communist parties and force others to form a couple, or else they are turned into animals. On the other side you have a gang of sworn single, sadist hipsters who engage in equally aberrant activities. In short, whoever made this movie abused stereotypes on either side to the point of absolute confusion. It's dumb to be in a relationship because you clearly started from false pretenses and it's equally useless to be single because you'll either become mentally ill or fall in love and therefore fall in the first category. <br/><br/>Second of all, it wanted to be such a quirky, progressive and abstract movie, and yet it got trapped in the most basic and boring stereotypes. In no particular order: the man on the journey to find happiness, the man pretending to be something he's not to fit in, the man falling trap to human nature, the pretty and dumb woman, the desperate woman with a distinct habit and the list can go on.<br/><br/>Furthermore, what is with the director and animal cruelty? If he's got that kind of issues, he should see a psychiatrist and not make movies. But maybe he did that to divert attention from how obnoxious his movie was, hoping that viewers will think something other than what a waste of time it was.<br/><br/>I have noticed this movie is a comedy. Yes, the way it trashed what could have been a thought provoking piece of art is indeed laughable. It's a shame really. <br/><br/>As a conclusion, I can assure you everything else you might want or have to do is better than this movie. Even a rom com or an adaptation of some John Green book will leave you with a sweeter taste in your mouth."
"lucasbreder","6","2","2","8 February 2017"," A very good idea, but somewhat poorly executed
","An absurdist comedy that brushes into the weirdness of social pressure regarding relationships (and being single). The movie has it's moments, mixing disturbing moments with dark humour, using clear and not-so-clear allegories to illustrate basic human needs such as love, sex and acceptance, and how we reinvent ourselves in order to try to find a partner. Also, it offers funny and disturbing insights on the great pressure society makes in this area. However, the excess of the absurd in the human relations tend to make them over simplistic and not human at all. Therefore, there are several ocasions where the movie could have better explored the complexities and subtleties of the theme within relationships, but didn't, for being over simplistic. At the end of the movie you get the sensation It didn't really get anywhere that made some sense, and that the basic idea of the script could have been much better executed"

","Quite coincidentally and without aforethought, I started knocking down a few about a half hour before starting to watch this movie. I almost never do that, but in this case it was strangely apropos. Now I like quirky, and the first half of the movie, even though a lot of it was non-sensical, managed to elicit it's fair share of laughs from this viewer. But what I originally thought might have been daring and brilliant eventually just collapsed upon itself. It's got nothing on Monty Python, and the thing just wound up wearing me out. I was never so glad for any kind of ending to put this picture out of it's misery, no matter how stupid, and that's exactly what happened.<br/><br/>However - the story had some great lines I'd like to highlight: <br/><br/>""I'm sorry I've got blood on your shirt."" <br/><br/>""Don't expect anyone else to dig your grave for you or carry your corpse."" <br/><br/>""You don't need to accept rabbits from other people."" <br/><br/>And my personal favorite - ""You wouldn't want your face eaten by dogs, would you?"" <br/><br/>I put that all in here so the reader knows at least that I was paying attention."

I'm not sure what's going on in the US or what's the vision of the Screen Writer about real world people relationships that this movie tries to imply. Sure, the society is quite sick and gets worse now-days but people relationships will probably never get near the play of this movie, at least for normal human-beings. Yet, if I'm looking at some societies, of how some people treat each other, sure, you can put it this way if you like. However the entire message could've been played in like 10 minutes or less with a higher impact. <br/><br/>I personally lost some precious 2 hours of my life by watching this. It was so boring with so many ""WTF am I watching"" moments (one of them being the torture of the poor animals and why not people) that I'm not sure what was in the director's head. I think a 10 y/o kid could've done better. The ending is as ""exciting"" and obvious as the rest of the movie."
"Floated2","3","2","2","23 December 2016"," Interesting Premise but Disappointing result
","The Lobster features and interesting premise in itself as it is brilliant and loaded with comic situations, but where the movie goes wrong is in its cynical attitude towards the dating world. It tries hard to distinguishing itself and be creative and unique, only for the actual result of the film to be quite boring and doesn't seem to live up to its potential of ideas. Though one could argue there's a really wonderful love story buried somewhere beneath this cynicism, director Lanthimos' attitude towards society and relationships in particular is awfully bleak that it comes across cold and emotionally distant. The scenes at the hotel, while certainly better in their own twisted way, are an exaggerated response to the dangers of conformity. The Lobster feels longer than it's running time, and does not feel satisfied once the film ends. It isn't as funny as several critics claim, and although it is quite different, that does not necessarily make it good. Certainly this is a film for those of acquired taste."

","Overall sh*t movie. I don't usually think movies with a two hour run time are too long but for this movie... far, far too long. It's initially kind of interesting but after about half an hour it feels like it has already said everything it has to say, however, it continues to go on for another hour and a half. Its absurd but nonetheless dull style just drags on and on, having lost all its initial intrigue and shock value. Sure it makes social commentary, but its almost like that is all that it does, there is no real story arc (at least not one with the slightest bit of entertainment value) and a movie couldn't make you care less about its characters. The visuals are decent but like most aspects of the film pretty drab, which would be OK if there were some other aspects to raise the films entertainment value but the dreary aesthetic ends up just adding to the boringness of the movie. If you are not into artsy fartsy abstract film festival type movies stay away from this title. While some might say this film is ""bold and brash"" I would say its ""more like belongs in the trash"". If you want a film that makes social commentary but is presented in a more digestible package watch Shrek."

","I became really interested in this movie when i read the description on IMDb. It was a creative one with lots of fantasy. So i started watching and immediately realized that this was going to be a slow movie. That is not a bad thing if the movie itself has lots of detail. And although you can clearly see that the writer tried to make it detailed and hard to understand, it is equally clear that he missed the point each time. To give an example: When they try to explain how the people are transformed to animals they say that the eyes and heart are transplanted and that the rest is custom made because it wouldn't fit. Implicating that the heart of a human would fit in a lobster or a parrot. Oke so that is how most of the movie fails. But you are curious if it gets better in the end. Because there would be potential for it to have an amazing end. But the answer to that is no. They actually made the end worse than bad. They let the main character do something illogical and then stop there. Really unsatisfying."

","Apparently the opening sequence showed an actual donkey being shot and it didn't get much better from there. I should have turned it off at that point, in hindsight.<br/><br/>The movie was relatively interesting when they were first checking into the hotel, but the deliberate monotone dialog wore thin in short order. Then came more gratuitous violence, but a sterile sort that really didn't register. Grimness and blandness were the main themes. The views of water and woods were good, though.<br/><br/>Once they escaped the first time it really lost my interest. I ended up fast-forwarding through it until the depressing final scene.

Then add in quirky characters with nonsensical props and characters talking in silly and pretentious avant-garde nonsense and you wonder how they did it with a straight face. What puzzles me and why I kept watching all the way thru is this. All the actors in this movie are very good and I mean 'all' the actors but I can't tell if they were forced to produce something this bad or maybe this is one of those movies where the actors are let to run amok.

","(Note that this contains a mild spoiler in the final paragraph to flag up a potentially upsetting scene for some viewers).<br/><br/>I can only hope that the creators of ""The Lobster"" – Greek writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos and his co-writer Efthymis Filippou – find treatment at a good rehabilitation clinic: a black and disturbing comedy, it can only be the creation of medically warped minds.<br/><br/>David (Colin Farrell) checks into a remote Irish hotel with his brother Bob. Bob is a collie dog. Bob unfortunately had a previous failed trip to said hotel, having been single and unable to find love within the 45 days required of the hotel management. So they turned him into a dog. Such is the fate of every 'guest' at the hotel, 'checked in' by security staff when individuals fail to produce the necessary 'couple' certificate and have to face the consequences. This is a highly dystopian future: think ""Never Let Me Go"" without the benefit of viable organs. The good news is that you can choose what animal you want to be transformed into. Dave's choice is a lobster because they have blue blood (curiously, my favorite trivia question), they live for 100 years and maintain their fertility throughout their life.<br/><br/>It becomes clear that all of the hotel guests are basically a set of dysfunctional folks, many of which would be left sitting at the back in the local disco. 'Love' is perceived as finding something – anything – in common with the other person. Find love, and you get a double room, an assigned child, and a yacht to stay on. Fail and pet food awaits.<br/><br/>There is a choice though. You can run away to the woods and be a singleton. But no sex; no heavy petting; or indeed any flirting of any sort is allowed. Else the 'red kiss' or – worse – the 'red intercourse' fate awaits.<br/><br/>This is a film that rather defies conventional definition. It is like the bastard child of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""Under the Skin"". Yet it is portrayed, via extensive media advertising, as a mainstream film. It is far from it, and I fear that a lot of audiences will be bemused, shocked and disturbed in equal measure by this film.<br/><br/>But is it any good? <br/><br/>The first half is a delight. A warped ""Fawlty Towers-esque"" vision of farcical proportions, with hotel manager Olivia Coleman (brilliant as always) viciously applying toaster-based punishment to lisping but masturbating resident John C Reilly (""Star Trek TNG"", ""Chicago""). And desperate biscuit-lover Ashley Jensen (""Extras"") throws herself with comic effect at our hero, offering every sexual option possible as bait. Outstanding is Ben Whishaw (AGAIN is October a Ben Whishaw season?) as a guy with a bit of a limp, falling for nosebleed girl (a delightful Jessica Barden from ""Far from the Madding Crowd""). At last, with Ben Whishaw and John C Reilly we have a mano-a-mano fight to equal Grant vs Firth in ""Bridget Jones""! <br/><br/>There are some laugh out loud moments in this segment: John C Reilly wants to be a parrot and Whishaw berates him – ""With that lisp, you want to be one of the only animals that can speak??"".<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this comedy rather goes off the rails in a gratuitously over-long final section. In the same way as you never wanted to see tents again in ""Three go mad camping"" (aka ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1"") we spend what seems like forever locked in the woods with the singletons led by Léa Seydoux (soon to be seen with Whishaw in ""Spectre"") and David's new love interest the 'Short sighted woman"" (Rachel Weisz, married to Daniel Craig soon to be seen in ""Spectre"").<br/><br/>While this segment is enlivened by the occasional appearance of 'ex-humans', it is generally dull and dark enough to drive all of the comic momentum out of the film. The story eventually stutters to – for me – a rather unsatisfactory ending which is not for the squeamish. (No spoilers, but a similar ending to a 1963 Ray Milland film left me permanently scarred as a youngster).<br/><br/>In summary this is quite a random art house film with a clever premise that that was firmly in the 8* category for the first half, but out-stays its welcome by about 30 minutes. I predict that – like ""Under the Skin"" – it will attract lovers and haters in almost equal measure. A clear winner is likely to be the Parknasilla Hotel in Sneem, County Kerry which looks a delightful place to spend a romantic weekend away.<br/><br/>N.B. Animal lovers, particularly dog lovers, need to be warned that there are a few truly upsetting scenes in this film – one in particular that made members of the cinema audience audibly cry out in disgust. You have been warned.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email to receive future reviews)."

","The Lobster actually takes a pretty interesting idea about love and societies views of it and creates quite a dramatic piece about it. One can delve deeper into analysis of this film, but even at the surface this manages to be quite a journey and entertaining movie. Whilst it defiantly has its moments, the one minor flaw that I found was the prolonged sequences midway through the film. However, with that said, it's greatest moments are in the films writing. It's darkly comical, political and touching (in an oddly sick way).<br/><br/>The Lobster provides quite a entertaining two hours for its viewers, giving them something quite provoking and, at points, quite heartfelt. Towards the end, and I really enjoyed this, was a somewhat reference to Dogtooth, and without spoiling it, it was what put the cherry on the cake."
"pyrocitor","8","18","38","10 October 2015"," I'm friends with the Lobster that's under my bed/get along with the voices inside of my head
","If there was such a genre as the (un)romantic comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster would be a prime example. Black as pitch, yet crackling with satire and quotable one-liners to spare, it's an unusual viewing experience to take in a film so enjoyable yet deceptively, unrelentingly bleak. <br/><br/>The cleverly absurd premise is exceptionally funny, and even if it's somewhat disappointingly played in the subtle side (no major metamorphoses here, but keep your eyes peeled for stray creatures wandering through the background), it still leads to a crackling critique of societal coding singlehood as despicable, the expectations of heteronormativity, ideal pairings and compatibility in the 'tick box' pickiness of the post-online dating world, and, ultimately, how everyone's first true love is their own needs and desires far beyond anyone else's. Residents of this least sexy 'love shack' in cinematic history are forced to publicly declare their love in an eerie awards ceremony style presentation, and children are thrown into the mix as a means of mediating inevitable domestic disputes. Like I said: for a comedy purportedly about romantic union, don't expect redemptive romance at play here. That would ruin the fun. <br/><br/>But hey – it's not like residents have no autonomy! If finding 'the one' under threat of being transmogrified into an animal isn't one's jam, there's always the alternative of escaping into the woods to join another grimly restrictive cult of asexual outlaws who are hunted by hotel inhabitants on a daily basis, and punish any hint of budding romance with grisly mutilation. There is no nonconformity - it is simply a matter of which horribly restrictive society and lifestyle is the best fit (there's a metaphor there as well...). No wonder all inhabitants of Lanthimos' world appear depressed and only capable of blunt literalism, but there are troves of chuckles, if not belly laughs, to be found amidst their melancholy perennial deadpan. <br/><br/>It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye, though, but hardly a surprise that Lathimos' gloomy fairy tale would only buy into a happy ending kicking and screaming. Nonetheless, it's a bit of a shame that the film – already overlong through liberally leisurely pacing - drags in the second act, losing the satirical sparkle of its introduction as the film pulls the rug out from whatever embers of hope that were fanned. There are some real flinches in store too, as Lanthimos plays the gruesome card at full force (don't be surprised to find yourself avoiding steak knives for the rest of the day after). Thankfully, the mournfully bouncy soundtrack of classical compositions is spot-on, while Thimios Bakatakis' dolefully sterile cinematography perfectly captures the cheekily melancholy feel of the film as a whole. <br/><br/>As such, it's left to the cast to find ripples of humanity in a script largely painting them as ideological chess pieces. In a perfect inversion of his pouty histrionics from In Bruges, Colin Farrell is exceptionally funny, his note-perfect deadpan and comedic timing conveying a surprising wealth of character and emotion through his Eeyore-like slump and moustache. Rachel Weisz is equally impressive, carefully avoiding (un)manic pixie dream girl stereotypes and stealing many of the laughs through her impressively crafted fiery personality carefully buttoned down, yet expressed through bursts of emphatically eccentric voice-over journal entries. Finally, the odd but fantastic comedic tag team of Ben Whishaw and John C. Reilly are reliably hilarious throughout, so much so that their absence in the second half of the film is largely what renders it so comparatively sluggish. <br/><br/>Like many black comedies that ply for laughs in such awkward or morbid territory, The Lobster won't be to everyone's tastes. However, for those in tune with Lanthimos' unconventionally morose sensibilities, this blackest and bleakest of comedies could well provide a gourmet repast that just hits the spot. <br/><br/>(now, what animal do I deserve to be transformed into for that despicable metaphor? Is it too late to cast my vote for swordfish – the only sea creature with its own built-in wea-pun?<br/><br/>I'll see myself out) <br/><br/>-8/10"

It's always glum, miserable, and just like this film, a little too depressing.<br/><br/>But then again, if this film was set in a utopia, it would be a kooky chick flick probably starring Ashton Kutcher and Anna Faris.<br/><br/>Heavily influenced by Gilliam and Brazil, The Lobster is a film of two halves. The first half is more or less set in the hotel, and it appears here that David has got himself a 'death' sentence. He's not a very likable person, not a people's person, and the friends he does make are as bizarre and as solemn as he.<br/><br/>And whether this is intentional or not, the majority of the characters in the film bar two, are horribly dislikable. And the two likable characters, Ashley Jensen's biscuit loving depiction of desperation, and Weisz's metaphorical exit from all the madness, both succumb to some sort of life changing incident.<br/><br/>And then the film offers a glimpse of relief, a glimpse of hope for David when he meets the loners, but their rules are more terrifying than that of the hotel. Here he meets Weisz, and it seems that all is not lost, but big brother is always watching, so not only is he trying to hide from the hunters of the hotel, but also from showing his true feelings.<br/><br/>Which is a big part of the acting here, not showing feelings, for which many have mistaken as bad acting. This couldn't be more farther from the truth. Farrell hasn't been this good in years, and the segment where he is pretending not to show any emotion when his brother is killed, is the single greatest piece of acting he has done.<br/><br/>Now to some, this probably doesn't mean much from the guy who starred in the remake of Total Recall, but these scenes are genuinely shocking, you can see he wants to react, but he's so desperate for his own freedom, he has to push himself to the limit.<br/><br/>Calling it a comedy is maybe pushing it a bit too far. There are funny moments for sure, but there are some horrific moments in this piece, and some of the characters traits are seriously sinister.<br/><br/>It's an oddity for sure, some will hate its narrative structure, and although I thought it was a wonderfully written, acted, and highly original piece of cinema, it left me feeling really depressed after.<br/><br/>Worth watching, but my gosh, you'll feel low after."
"gregsrants","5","22","49","20 September 2015"," Wha?
","This one's going to be tough to describe. The winner of the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Festival , The Lobster is the new film from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos who had me involved while scratching my head at screenings of his previous resume entries Dogtooth (2009) and ALPS (2011). I considered both decent films, but I surely wasn't put in a position to recommend either film to the average film watcher. Even the posters for his first two films were a difficult digestion.<br/><br/>With The Lobster, Lanthimos gathers together a cast that includes Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, John C. Reilly and Ben Whishaw to introduce us to a world where all single people over a certain age must report to a hotel to find a mate. If, after a 45-day perusing and courting period, the individual does not find a mate they are then transformed into an animal (you can sign up for any particular animal) and sent into the wild.<br/><br/>Wha? Colin Farrell plays David. David has recently separated from his wife and is therefore deemed 'single' and reports to the hotel for his search amongst the residents. Registered to become a lobster if things do not progress accordingly, David is none too accepting of the hotel's policies and he befriends a group of other disgruntleds in the woods (notably John C. Reilly and Rachel Weisz) where they discuss the unorthodox methods and ideas behind the premise. The group, named The Loners, are a weird bunch to say the least and that doesn't even take into account their names which include ""The Limping Man"", ""Nosebleed Woman"" and ""Biscuit Woman"".<br/><br/>If nothing else, The Lobster is something I haven't quite seen before. In an era of men and women in tight colorful clothing running around saving our cities with their superpowers, The Lobster seemed like a breath of fresh air. But without being able to put my finger directly on the pulse, I was a little baffled and let down by the overall execution.<br/><br/>Weisz is good and her soothing voice is a welcome both in her presence and in her narration of the film. But Farrell, Reilly and others are just too boring to have kept me interested in a truly unique story by Lanthimos and Filippou. The film is a commentary on the whole dating ritual and how the world almost forces us into finding a soul mate, but the characters fail to connect with audiences in a way that would turn The Lobster into an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br/><br/>Maybe I just didn't get it. Maybe the film was smarter than me and I failed to pick up on any of the nuances that helped The Lobster walk away with the Jury Prize. I liken it very much to the first Wes Anderson film I saw – The Royal Tenenbaums – which confounded me but has grown a bit on my soft side like old university ivy.<br/><br/>Whether Farrell's plump David or Reilly's Lisping Man become something I grow affection for remains to be certain. What I do know is that I saw something original. I just don't think I liked it or will recommend it to others.<br/><br/>http://theintestinalfortitude.com/"

I love these films which come up with these unconventional stories. The Lobster is a strange movie and the people in this future are all apathetic and uncharismatic which makes the fact that they have to form couples (probably for the survival of the human race) even more ironic. They bond on basis of common character traits (like .e.g a limp or short shortsightedness).<br/><br/>This low budget production (4m$) has some big names like Rachel Weisz, Colin Farrel (who got a beer belly for the movie), Léa Seydoux, John C. Reilly and Ben Whishaw who all play their roles very minimalistic and subdued. The film is slow paced but still hypnotizing to look at, but I can imagine if these kind of movies are not your thing that you will find it quite boring.<br/><br/>I found it an interesting movie which has some very dry humor in it (it's not a comedy mind you) and says something about the human condition and human relationships.

","What would you do in a world where you must have a partner, lest you be turned into an animal of your choosing? <br/><br/>Colin Farrell plays David, whose marriage of 12 years (11 years and one month to be precise) has come to an end, where he finds himself in a lush hotel reserved for those who are single. Upon his introduction he is shown his room. His room number is 101 – a perfect sign for what is to come – and is told the laws of the land. If he does not find a partner within 45 days he will be turned into an animal and set loose into the woods. He is told that most people pick a dog, which is why the world is filled with so many dogs. Obvious, really. David's choice is a Lobster. I won't tell you why as it will ruin one of the many, many hilarious moments that the first half of this film is filled with. Among them is the 1984 references, which go further than his room number as he is woken every morning with a stern announcement of how many days he has left. The couples are also kept separate from the single people, as if a they are a class above them. David is able to make a couple of friends, a man with a lisp (John C. Reilly), and a man with a limp (Ben Whishaw) who had an ex-wife who also had a limp.<br/><br/>The sold out crowd I saw this with was roaring with laughter, as even the narrator gets in on the act, with countless deadpan jokes that shouldn't be funny. But they are, and I found myself slapping my knees while crying from laughter. A lot of the humour stems from the singles trying to meet other people, the ticking time-bomb of their 45-day stay, and of course discussing among themselves which animals they would like to become. Nothing is sacred in this movie, it will make a joke of anything, including a suicide attempt. Needless to say, I counted at least four walk-outs. But hey, their loss! One person didn't walk out mid-film but I overheard her talking to her partner/husband. Her reaction was incredibly pessimistic and insulting, as in addition to hating the movie, she stated that anyone laughing at or enjoying the film, which was almost everyone, had their own problems with what they were laughing at.<br/><br/>Her partner replied that he quite enjoyed it. I had to stifle my laughter to the point that snot was coming out my nose. The couple eyed me strangely and moved on.<br/><br/>Another element of staying within this hotel is the Hunt. At regular intervals the singles invade the woods, the area in this alternate world where single people are banished after being transformed. It is also a kind of rebel base, where single people avoiding the hotel stay. Hence the hunt; armed with tranquiliser guns, each single person is required to try and bag themselves a single person to be taken back to the hotel. Days are added to their stay if their aim is true.<br/><br/>To go on further would ruin the movie for any kind folk reading this, but this film is essentially separated into two halves. The first half is based in the hotel, while the second half moves to the woods. Deep down, under all the humour, is a love story that is not only touching, but, as well as the entire film, offers numerous comments on modern relationships. How we court others, the dedication one can have for another, the perceived need to share interests in common, I could go on. Having not been in a relationship in a fairly long time, I'm sure I took away a different perspective than anyone who has just had a relationship end, or someone in a relationship currently. The true genius of The Lobster is its ability to weave so many themes within the raucous comedy, which slows just a little in the second half of the film but is no less funny.<br/><br/>This is director Yorgos Lanthimos' first film in English, and having never heard of him, I am very keen to see more. Not only was the camera-work unique but he also got the most out of his actors, Colin Farrell in particular is extremely restrained and barely shows any emotion for the entire movie, adding more humour to the situations he finds himself in.<br/><br/>If I were to slap a label on this work I'd label it a surrealist, absurdist romantic comedy. This obviously is not for everybody, as its humour is very far from the crowd-pleasing, user-friendly jokes (I'm looking at you, The Martian) that so many Hollywood productions are filled with. The humour is arresting, it is in your face and it is not for everyone. However, if this sounds like your cup of tea, you'll be treated to an extremely unique view on modern relationships and the oddities that often arise, all while you are laughing at the extremely ludicrous jokes.<br/><br/>www.epilepticmoondancer.net"

","The Lobster has created the perfect environment for me to explore the precepts of humanity. We are exposed to fantastic characters as they move from one surreal activity to another. Like all of us, they are struggling with desires and behavior that falls outside of societies expectations/<br/><br/>The stilted dialog magnifies the sense of remote dispassion. They often behave as observers and their ""separateness"" is extreme. Their isolation blurred the boundaries between themselves and the members of the audience. With the constraints loosened, there was a new freedom to observe and then reach conclusions. I found this much more satisfying that being force fed a story. I found myself being engaged in new and interesting ways while still being fully entertained!<br/><br/>Without being too much of a spoiler, here is an example from one of the begging scenes. We see a woman stop, single out an animal and abruptly release her awful wrath upon it. We're never told who she is or why she might want to do this. Even so, it is easy to imagine the details behind her actions for yourself by the end of the film.<br/><br/>As much as I like this film I feel some disclaimer is in order. This style probably isn't for everyone, I know some people just don't like the genre."

"truemythmedia","10","4","6","11 September 2019"," What Relationships Are Like
","Rather than show the trappings of singleness as they are, Lanthimos shows how they feel. It feels like everyone is watching you and evaluating. It feels like you are just looking for something to have in common with other people. It feels like you are just faking it until someone accepts you or else you enter into this sort of forever other life where you no longer matter to anyone because society is for coupe and children, not singles.<br/><br/>By creating a world totally unlike our own, Lanthimos is able to highlight feelings that we all relate to rather than situation only a few of us might relate to. We all know what it is like to have sexual experiences that leave us unsatisfied although, hopefully, very few have ever had the experience as it is portrayed in this film.<br/><br/>That is the strength of it though. At the end of the film when Rachel Weisz (""The Fountain"") is waiting for Colin Farrell (""In Bruges"") to return to her, we as the audience can sense the tension of a young woman awaiting her groom in the honeymoon suite, or a groom standing at the front of the church waiting for the doors to open, wondering if his bride will be there or has she run off? We feel the fear and pain of telling a hard truth to a husband and waiting to find out if he will stay and endure the hard work to rebuild or leave for easier relationships.<br/><br/>The themes in this film cause it rise above simple dark comedy and absurdist situations. It makes the film funny and sweet and daring.<br/><br/>Of course the writing and acting help it along as they are both stellar examples of their respective arts. The writing slants just off of normal leaving the viewer with an immediate impression of alienation and solitude. The voice over narration has a calculated cold just-the-facts attitude which has clinical scientific aftertaste.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz's performances, likewise, do much to convey a sense of confusion, trepidation, excitement, and reservedness which mixes rarely well, not alienating completely the audience yet never giving them the warm comfort of false and easy relationship that so many rom-coms exult in bestowing upon their viewers. They are the performances of wonderful actors who have known the thrill of those sorts of rom-com romances but also can understand those relationships from a mature place of understanding.<br/><br/>The whole film is beautifully wrapped up, so to speak in a lingering shot of Rachel Weisz, wondering if Colin Farrell is coming back or not. If he doesn't, she is doomed to die. If he does, they will live on together, closer than ever, but he must blind himself for this to occur.<br/><br/>Will he come back? Will he be able to do it? Does he love me that much?<br/><br/>For some reason this long hold on her in this diner booth landed on me with a real heaviness that I felt in my bones."

"RforFilm","8","6","11","9 June 2016"," The Lobster is a surreal and funny story about the stress of relationships. It's defiantly an acquired taste movie
","Our world has been changing a lot recently. Interracial relationships, orientation exploration, people questioning their gender, and revaluation of their faith has become more acceptable in a period where the internet and social media has opened doors that have been closed for so long. Places like Facebook and Instagram have let people know more about themselves, creating something of a revolution for those that are different. Though I still feel like that there is a benefit to privacy, this has given people more of an openness to new ideals, so I can give them credit for creating new social norms. <br/><br/>One thing that still happens to raise eyebrows is when we find people that are not just single, but those that don't want to be in a romantic relationship. Society does place a lot of pressure for everyone to try to find a significant otherand to do it before it's too late. It's not just our media that's filled with constant relationship programs, but entire industries are built upon this with wedding, family, and even travel that supports the idea that no one should ever be alone. The Lobster is a surreal comedy that explores just how forced we are into relationshipsor not. <br/><br/>Within the rules of an unnamed city, being single is forbidden. This is the case for a middle age man David (played by Colin Farrell) whose wife leaves him for another man. Now free, he is taken to a resort where all single people go. They are given forty-five days to find someone they like (they have to say which gender they want as bisexuality is forbidden as well) or they will be turned into an animal of their choice. As with the title of the movie, David decides that he'd like to be a lobster as he likes the ocean and he would be able to live for a long time.<br/><br/>The hotel is filled with various dances and propaganda that fuels the importance of having a companion from the ban of masturbation to stage plays on why we need someone by our side. David talks to the other people that are also there, which include a Lisping Man (played by John C. Reilly), a Limping Man (played by Ben Whishaw) and a Nosebleed Woman (played by Jessica Barden). Outside of the hotel are a group of Loners, led by their leader (played by Léa Seydoux), who are hunted by the hotel guests in exchange for extra days to find a companion.<br/><br/>I'll start by saying that The Lobster has a lot of creativity for creating this unique world that's clearly addressing the problems of our society (not just American, but worldwide) about the pressures of relationships. But without spoiling anything, the movie intelligently shows the other side's faults on why putting a label on something like love or solitude isn't a good thing. <br/><br/>The joke of the movie is that everything is set is place, so most of the cast has a deadpan way of communicating, even during some of the more emotional moments. Some might see this as a problem, but independent filmmaker Yourgos Lanthimos uses it to his comedic advantage. <br/><br/>Much of the ideas are surreal, especially with how they handle the idea of people remaining animals for the rest of their lives. The Lobster, like The Tree of Life and Eraserhead, is an acquired taste that not everyone is going to like. This movie may have a three act story, it's logic falls into the emotional category on how the film progresses. My only problem is the final scene, which tries for something ambiguous, but came off as incomplete. The Lobster is a movie that deals with getting answers, and I wish the ending had gone on longer.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight lobsters out of ten. If someone were to tell me that this wasn't their cup of tea, I'd totally understand. This is a story that you simply have to allow to let loose to see what kind of emotion it can get from you. It makes you question just why society puts stress on relationships, so see if you can gain a proper insight."
"WeathermanTom","4","6","11","23 December 2015"," Shock for shock's sake
","I like symbolism. I get symbolism. However, the art of symbolism or the portrayal thereof should, in my humble opinion, be handled discreetly. I prefer searching for references on my own rather than have them thrown at me. This is a film which is directing my thoughts to a certain direction, with strict directions by the director. It leaves little space for reflection upon what is being portrayed. Greek directors such as Lanthimos, a Von-Trier wannabe of sorts, use extremities and shocking images to project their ""philosophie du comptoir"" perceptions of reality upon their audience. In all honesty, I have almost never left a film halfway in, but in the case of The Lobster I have. Some might actually indulge in what the film is about, but taste is subjective in any case. In a nutshell, I do not appreciate shock for shock's sake, nor art for art's sake for that matter. If you do, then by all means watch this film. If you do not, opt for something way more through provoking, like The Life of Brian."

","One of my most anticipated movies of 2015 based solely on the premise. I was fascinated by it as soon as I heard it and have been anxiously awaiting to see it develop since January. Now whilst a part of me is relived and enjoyed the film, I cannot help but be majorly disappointed by what this film ended up being and how far the final product end up from what it could have achieved.<br/><br/>Maybe its part ingenuity since I am not familiar with Yorgos Lanthimos' work, that by the way after seeing this I look forward to check out, but this just seems to be a gold mine of ideas and developments that simply never expand and become the commentary, satire and dramatic storytelling they could have been.<br/><br/>With also some perfect casting choices, especially in Farrell, Seydoux, Colemand and Weisz, whom are all really great and genuinely fun and interesting to watch on screen. They get what the material is about and are one of the main reasons the film never looses its pace. Thanks to their talent you are treated every once in a while to touching, funny and smart scenes that are a little too rare for this film. These are the moments that really get under your skin and make you think and laugh.<br/><br/>There is, of course, a reason for why the rest of the films feels slightly off beat and not to the point: it is simply too unreadable. With such a premise you really have the occasion to make us as an audience relate to a million different situations and turn these situation on themselves and make us both laugh to death and emphasize with characters. But the dead pan of the people in this film and the situations taken into analysis simply don't leave space for the movie to explore what I wanted or to make it pose or answer the question it wants to ask or answer.<br/><br/>There are some brilliant moments of dark comedy and uncomfortable storytelling that really ignited a flame in me when they came on, I was continuously asking myself: ""but why did they leave that there?"". I basically had a very frustrating time with this movie: on one side I truly admire is ambition, its premise, its ideas and part of the execution, but on the other I really had a hard time enjoying myself as much as I wanted because I wasn't given enough to imagine, think about or simply connect with."

"Semisonic","8","6","12","28 March 2016"," Yet another author's bitter view of the human flaws
","I'm not too familiar with Yorgos Lanthimos' works, and so far i've only seen his Oscar-nominated Kynodontas. But it looks like the author is on the mission of exposing the defects of the modern society in a not-so-cryptic but still an allegorical way. And while i believe that his view of the parental overprotection/abuse of their children was way too exaggerated and dramatic, his view of the awkwardness of today's relationships between people is much more curious and realistic.<br/><br/>Freddie Mercury, when he was once asked what Bohemian Rhapsody was about, gave a simple answer: ""It's about human relationships"". The same description probably fits this film if one was after a simple answer. A more detailed description would be inherently subjective, for a film that speaks riddles and metaphors to you is never what it shows but rather what you see, and different people can see different things. What i saw was a rather sad contemplation of how we humans interact with each other, of the pressure the society puts on us when it tries to categorize us or impose its views of normal on us, of the fact that no matter how you run or hide, there alway will be someone who thinks that they know better and that you're obliged to follow their opinion on what's right and wrong.<br/><br/>In the modern Western world, where a CEO of a huge corporation can openly admit being homosexual and have no problem with it, such visions could be considered too dire to be relevant. So maybe the works of Lanthimos are a reflection of his personal tragedies or his experience of living in Greece. But there is still a reason to view The Lobster as a warning (or even a revelation) that we all should pay attention to.<br/><br/>You see, the best way to expose something crooked or perverse is to simply demonstrate it in action. The Lobster does that by showing the societal pressure and personal defenseless as a norm, to provoke a response in us and make us think something like ""Why the hell aren't you doing anything? Stand up and fight for yourself!"". And it's a powerful tool, for it's often the case that only by feeling discomfort about someone else's compliance and passiveness we finally realize how much we avoid fighting for our own selves.<br/><br/>But the scariest thing about The Lobster is that not everything that it shows is that utterly uncommon. But this time it's not the society and its latent dictatorship, but the people themselves. Even alone with their close ones, even when nobody's watching and there are no rules to play by, they still can't relax and be genuinely interested in and kind to one another. And that's not just fiction, it's what i personally see in more and more people these days: social awkwardness and sociopathy, lack of empathy and ability to read the emotions of others, a general coldness and discomfort from another person's presence. Like the parties where people bury themselves in their smartphones instead of actually talking to someone or the families where the partners hardly even speak, each in their own cyberreality. The way such people talk when forced out of their virtual covers, that helpless look of a fish taken out of the water - that's eerily similar to how The Lobster's characters behave sometimes, which creates a sinister picture of what our world of tomorrow might become. And if some of us do manage to see themselves in that distorting mirror then maybe transforming into creatures that live long and mate happily but are otherwise cold and indifferent is a fate humanity might still avoid."

","There's nothing out there quite like The Lobster. Yorgos Lanthimos has invented something harshly relevant to a society eminently apparent of now and till the future. I abhor the fact that a majority of audiences unquestionably missed the mark on what this movie meant. To me, not only is Lanthimos take on society's perception of love darkly and satirically delightful to watch, but also, culturally relevant to what today's standards in terms of building a relationship are. <br/><br/>This is How I Perceive the 1st Half: With the uprise of social media-an undoubtably other circumstances-love and romance has been in demand at higher levels than it has ever been. Marriage has been worshiped as such a ""positive"" norm in society, that people continuously are feeling more and more pressured into finding a partner, no matter the odds. Socialization has caused us to become ignorant of love's meaning/ purpose, and more focused on the selfish endeavor of finding a way to fit into our now devious world through progressive appearances. <br/><br/>This is How I Perceive the 2nd Half: ""Specific"" societies often deny people who have ""taboo"" (according to their norms) relationships from continuing their accords by punishing them through severe practices, simply because ""taboo"" occurances don't follow their general beliefs. Their are countless examples of what is considered a ""taboo"" form of love within many societies (different sexualities, different nationalities, different personalities, different social statuses, etcetera). Adversaries are always trying to shut you down when the one good thing in your life finally comes into play-relatable. I'm assuming Lanthimos is modestly saying, ""Hey people need to mind their own freakin' business and let folks love who they want to love. As long as it's real, who gives a damn.""<br/><br/>This is How I Perceive the Ending: ""Oh, the crazy things people will do when they're in love.""<br/><br/>So...yeah. The Lobster is probably the most informal love aphorism of the 21st Century. Go figure. <br/><br/>Yorgos has the most f***** up vision in Hollywood right now, but that's exactly why we need him. This wickedness he constantly froths into his filmography is awfully necessary in order to get timely, critical, and imperative messages-like this-out into such a flawed province (society). The more I watch The Lobster the more poetic, shocking, outlandish, traumatic, disturbing, sinister, and umm...funnier it becomes. Don't be ignorant fellas, please, look at this film as a MOMENTOUS learning lesson. Embrace the eccentricity, as they say. (Verdict: A)"

Yeah: the bad society tries to make all of us the same, and it sometimes feels like there is no groups we can be a part of without suffering the consequences of its limitations. But what I really did not understand was the difference between the forest world and the hotel world, and their connection. Is this supposed to be something like Wuthering Heights? I understand it's supposed to show that there are two opposite worlds but none of them are of any good. However this was expressed so poorly through screenwriting that everything about the film itself felt very artificial. I did not believe the main character or any other characters to be frank.<br/><br/>Besides, I don't know what this film was. A comedy, a drama?

","THE LOBSTER (2016) ** Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Ben Whishaw, John C. Reilly, Ashley Jensen, Angeliki Papoulia, Lea Seydoux, Michael Smiley, Olivia Colman, Garry Mountaine, Ariane Labed, Jessica Barden, EmmaEdel O'Shea. Flat-footed satire of a totalitarian, dystopic society set in the near future where those who are not coupled are given 45 days to find a significant other or face the fate of being 'reassigned' as an animal. Farrell is the best thing about this oddball black comedy as a sad sack whose life is in a downward spiral at the spa from hell attempting to find a mate or find his fate. While filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos - who co-wrote with Efthymis Filippou - has made the attempt of an Orwellian tale of despair (and succeeded in alienating his audience) the film itself is one hot mess and misfire. Not even as a sci-fi parable of say a Twilight Zone or X-File or even a black comedy say like Monty Python. Just dreadful."
"c_keane","Null","4","7","16 January 2016"," Hilarious, gloomy and completely absurd
","This is not a film for everyone. It's weird. It's often irrational. The central plot revolves around single people who must either find romantic partners or be turned into wild animals. Literally turned into animals. If that sounds too strange, this may not be the film for you. But if you're the type who enjoys movies that are a little different and don't necessarily need a Hollywood ending, ""The Lobster"" may deliver.<br/><br/>We meet David (Colin Farrell) as he is being ousted from his home by his wife, who has fallen in love with another man. The rules of society dictate that because he is now single, he must be sent to The Hotel to find a new mate within 45 days. If he fails, he will undergo a procedure in which he is turned into the animal of his choosing. David has chosen to become a lobster, because ""lobsters live for over one hundred years, are blue-blooded like aristocrats, and stay fertile all their lives."" He settles in at The Hotel with the various other men and women who share his predicament. I don't want to get too much further into the plot details because, like most films, I think the less you know going in the better.<br/><br/>Farrell plays the slightly insecure, puppy-eyed character he's become so good at, though this time he put on so much weight he's at first almost unrecognizable. The other main characters, including Rachel Weisz, John C. Reilly, Ben Whishaw and Ashley Jensen all give great, reserved performances, helped no doubt by the unusual writing and directing style of Yorgos Lanthimos, known best for 2009's Greek- language ""Dogtooth"". Together they've created a world that looks and feels exactly like our own, right up until the moment someone speaks.<br/><br/>The film often feels surreal in the same way that Wes Anderson's films do, but whereas Anderson's movies can have almost slapstick over-the-top exaggerations, ""The Lobster"" succeeds by playing it completely straight. It's an entertaining black comedy, due in large part to the deadpan delivery of its characters. The one possible exception to this is Reilly, whose role as the Lisping Man seems to be channeling some of his exuberant, childlike Dale from ""Step Brothers"". While no one in this alternate world seems especially happy about the prospect of ceasing to be human, very few seem to be all that terrified by it, either. Least of all the Heartless Woman (Angeliki Papoulia), who produces one of the film's darkest scenes. What would be a brutal moment in any other film is made all the more jarring by its placement in what is otherwise just a very morbid comedy.<br/><br/>""The Lobster"" may fly under many people's radars as it's not the typical rom-com fare, but it won three prizes at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival (and a nomination for the coveted Palme d'Or), along with an array of other film festival accolades. It does very much feel like a festival film, and as I said that may not be everyone's idea of a great movie. But if you've read this far, you'll likely want to give this one a watch."
"ilana2000","9","5","10","8 January 2019"," Liked by the critics
","I understand why a lot of people had problems with this film, and why, for the most part, the critics did not. Personally, I loved it. As a film student, I'm used to putting my 'critic-head' on, but I get that 'The Lobster's bizarreness and unfamiliarity might make some viewers lose interest. I won't lie, its quite a rough watch.<br/><br/>One thing I do wish to comment on is the ending, so if you haven't seen this film yet, stop reading now. So at the end, we are left with a blind Rachel Weisz sitting alone in a cafe, and a short-sighted Colin Farrell with a knife to his face in the next room, ready to blind himself (we assume this is the plan he describes to Weisz in their secret code). The screen cuts to black and we are given the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers. Farrell himself said there were three possible outcomes:<br/><br/>1. David blinds himself and the two live on as a couple.
2. David runs away, leaving a handicapped Rachel Weisz abandoned.
3. David pretends he has blinded himself for the rest of the couple's lives, but in reality, keeps his sight.<br/><br/>When watching, I originally assumed he would pick the last option, and we would see him saunter back to his seat, maybe knocking over a glass on the way to make it seem more believable. But as soon as the screen went black, I changed my mind. My instant thought was that the jarring cut was representative of the moment David stabbed himself in the eye, and the film ends here as there is nothing left to see. Whatever the ending is supposed to be, I liked it.<br/><br/>Although we know that this is where it ends, earlier in the film, I assumed there would be a different ending. When he uses code to tell Weisz his plan, I assumed he was planning to return to the hotel to transform into a guide dog for her. This is for a few reasons. Firstly, the leader of the single people told her to find herself a guide dog. Also, David's brother was a dog, showing the people are possibly still self-aware after turning into animals. At the start of the film, the hotel manager (Olivia Colman) praises David's choice of a lobster because most people think of 'dog' which is apparently a bad choice?? This is the main reason why I thought he would transform, as it would suggest he had overcome the selfishness of this new regime, and made a decision purely based on love. His actual decision (to blind himself) was only made to fit into the idea that you must have something in common with your partner (short-sightedness, nose bleeds etc.), giving the film a very disturbing and unsettling ending to force you into contemplating modern relationship expectations.<br/><br/>These are just some thoughts I had while watching. Let me know what you think. :)"

","There were elements on this movie that did not need to be in it. <br/><br/>For one, there was no need to bring up ""sexual orientation"" when Farrell was checking into his hotel nor was there any need to have any ambiguities suggested. There is no need to ruin a film with any such references especially when it is irrelevant to the remainder of the film. To whom does the director appeal?<br/><br/>Moreover, there's no need for all the weird references to abnormal sex, such as doing it ""up the arse."" More so, the various sexual aspects of this film was so weird, disturbing, that if young teenagers watch they may be forever scarred.<br/><br/>In all, the only sexy scene in the whole movie is a pretty girl (in bikini) doing backstrokes in a swimming pool. It was a nice respite, and sadly so brief, from the horrors this film embodies.<br/><br/>That said, let's get on with the movie. <br/><br/>When each guest checks into the hotel, they get to choose which animal they would like to be if they fail to find a mate - Farrell chooses he'd be a lobster if he's to be transformed to an animal. If there's any sense at all in the world, everyone would choose to be a porpoise or other high functioning animal and at least retain their minds. Instead, Farrell wants to be a lobster, others want to be ponies, parrots, etc. Dumb. <br/><br/>To make it more weird and stupid, the mates that everyone wants to find must have similar characteristics - short-sighted for short-sighted, a limp for a limp. Things like that. <br/><br/>And there's the incongruities throughout.<br/><br/>For one, if the guests run away into the woods rather than be made an animal, they aren't even allowed to enjoy their freedom but enter a different kind of hell where any attraction and affection between themselves will result in mutilation. Such an inhuman trait for those who want to remain so.<br/><br/>Then finally, at the end, there's too many unanswered questions - one must surmise how the young couple get by in their new condition - how do they get past the authorities - how do they get around safely - do they even survive exiting the restaurant?<br/><br/>This movie in short is one of the dumbest, unsatisfying experiences I've ever had the misfortune to waste my life on. <br/><br/>On the plus side, the cinematography was quite nicely done - could've taken off the ND filters and given the film more pleasant light but that's the director's prerogative I suppose."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","5","7 January 2017"," Let's get cracking! Come on over for some lobster. It's a delightful watch.
","In a bleak dystopian future, where relationship are to be understood as simple as black and white, comes a movie about living in the grey area. Directed by Greek director, Yorgos Lanthimos, the film tells the story of David (Colin Farrell), a single architect that is forced to check into a sinister ""hotel"", in order to find a suitable life mate in 45 days. If his search ends in failure, he would be turned into an animal. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I took it to be a film about authority/herd mentality of human trying to put everything complex into a few simplistic type groups and those trying to survive life through fighting against that system or allowing it to rule them for self-preservation. The conflict of man vs machine and man vs self was very well-told by writers Efthymis Filippou & Yorgos Lanthimos. It's a movie about the human condition in the most nonhuman way. Yet, there were a lot of critics might dislike, this film for its intentionally awkward slow pacing and tone, finding it, kinda boring. However, for me, it's one of things that makes this movie, unique in a slow burn Hitchcockism mixed with Twilight Zone and Stanley Kubrick's horror type of a way. After all, the film is supposed to present a somewhat fictional dull world of distant sex mixed with complex bureaucracy. Great world-building. It remind me of biblical conservative blended with Stephen King's 'The Shining' & George Orwell's '1984' book. Also, it really needed to be that way, for the dry deadpan humor to have an effect. Because of this, the satire of sex comedies kinda works for me, while others might find it, pretentious. The scenes like, where they were watching propaganda extolling advantages of partnership & hunting single asexual people in the forest was hilarious to me in a dark way. Even some of the music were very funny. I kinda like the little thriller, Bernard Herrmann's theme that plays, during the fight scenes. It remind me of 1960's 'Psycho'. Another was the 'Something's Gotten Hold Of My Heart' by Roger Greenaway and Roger Cook, dance scene. Yet, there were some parts of the film, where some of the jokes seem to fall flat, mostly with the surreal concept of 'turning people into animals'. It really could had been funny, but the idea never really get off the ground in my opinion, and didn't lead to anything. It was very disappointing that we didn't see, much of that. Instead, the film goes with a different direction with a very unlikeable blind person punishment concept in the third act. In my opinion, it wasn't really interesting as we seem movies like this, before. Plus, it was very extremely inconsistent, seeing the villain mention other punishment like the ""red kiss"" and the unthinkable ""red intercourse"" yet they don't show it. It's here, where the movie really starts to loose, its charm. Still, I have to say, the acting throughout the film is amazing. Colin Farrell really put it all, as the paunchy sad-sack, David. He put on 40 pounds for his role. Even the supporting cast like LÃ©a Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, John O'Reilly, and Rachel Weisz was just as good, in their untitled character roles. Everyone speaks with very little inflection and odd, stilted, overly-formal sentence structure, which surprisingly works for this type of a movie. Another great thing about this film is the cinematography by Thimios Bakatakis. Great use of the rural, lush, muted Irish locations. I also love the fact that production worked almost entirely with natural light and without much make-up. It's added to the naturalism look of the film. The classical music that went with it, was great as well. Love hearing Ludwig van Beethoven Symphony No.7 In A Major,Op.92: II.Allegretto & String Quartet No 1 in F major, Op 18, No 1 Adagio affettuoso ed appassionato, during the slow motion scenes. ""Where the Wild Rose's Grow"" by Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds was also nice to listen to. Overall: I have to say, this movie is very watchable, even with the slow parts. Dazzling in its sinister surrealism, wicked black comedy and touching pathos, The Lobster achieved in nearly everything, it was going for. It was a fantastic film that artists such like Luis Bunuel, Franz Kafka and Salvador Dali would had love."

","In a somewhat skewed alternate version of somewhere in present-day Europe, David (Colin Farrell) is sent to the Hotel, where he has 45 days in which to find his match, failing which he will be transformed into the animal of his choice and set loose into the wild. Despite selecting a lobster (just in case) he initially attempts to set himself up with a woman with no kindred feeling for others, before escaping and joining a group of Loners in the woods. Unfortunately, they have their own rules which preclude him and Rachel Weisz' characters falling in love, which is exactly what happens.<br/><br/>It was only after watching this film that I discovered that the man behind it - Yorgos Lanthimos - was also responsible for Dogtooth, another deeply peculiar film in which the relationships between people, and their behaviour, are completely incomprehensible to anyone brought up in conventional society. In The Lobster, everybody speaks with conventional politeness and an utter absence of emotion.<br/><br/>The whole thing is completely bizarre, yet it is often surprisingly funny and, notwithstanding my expectation of finding it annoyingly pretentious (which it is) it also held my attention: I watched it all the way through and didn't switch it off.<br/><br/>I don't think I would recommend it, but it had sufficient weirdness and an odd warmth for me to quite like it.

","Director/Writer Yorgos Lanthimos, along with Efthymis Filippou, present a futurist film so out-of- the-box in it's storyline that it's hard to believe it attracted the likes of Collin Farrell, Rachel Weisz and John C. Reilly. Set primarily in The Hotel, where single people must find a mate within 45 days or be turned into an animal, residents fill their days hunting ""free people"" or watching mundane ""couple people"" therapy presentations. While probably an interesting storyline in theory, the monotone dialogue delivery, the dark fill of the film, and the less than humanistic performances throughout painstakingly drag this bazaar film down. Farrell reaches far from his familiar film persona, yet one can't help wonder why he changed his body for this role and what attracted him to this project. Weisz's ""one note"" character blends in with the rest of the ""one note"" performances, and John C. Reilly is so under utilized it's amazing he'd want to lend his talents to the project. One can only think that these qualified actors must know something about the director that the viewing audience doesn't. And, one can only think that Lanthimos, with this his first English language film, was trying for a Wes Anderson, Spike Jonze ""HER,"" Coen Brothers type film, but fell short, very short. Some will call this a comedy, however, you probably won't laugh at all. Others will call this film a master piece, however, you'll probably walk out calling it something completely else."
"Brap-2","7","9","23","13 September 2015"," TIFF 2015 -- The Lobster: Another take on relationships
","Yorgos Lanthimos gives us another taste of his monotone storytelling with 'The Lobster'. The story revolves around several nameless people who exist in a society that demands people to be in a relationship, or be transformed into the animal of their choice and be expelled into the wilderness to fend for themselves. Those who either become single through break-up or becoming widowed are sent to a hotel-like prison where they are cared for, but only for 45 days. If they fail to find a suitable mate, they are transformed and expelled.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long to realize that you're not watching a Sci-Fi flick, but more so a satire on relationships and how people should always be a part of one, that single life is frowned upon. Colin Farrell's character attempts to jump through the hoops of the hotel by doing as they please, but his and other people's mentalities reveal that they cannot stay in that environment and would rather live amongst the Loners who vacate the forests, or die.<br/><br/>We learn that mostly everyone who is a guest at the hotel is repulsive in some way: looks, attitude, or even a minor speech impediment. Eventually, it is understood that this brood of people -- losers, if you will -- are still supposed to be given a chance to find a mate and then live the rest of their dull life with that mate in order to avoid transformation.<br/><br/>While the film exaggerates for our entertainment, it paints a very clear picture about how we perceive relationships and how we must be in one to complete our lives. Clearly, the attitude towards this idea is frowned upon (without going into Spoilers). The entire cast does a great job meeting the tonal demand of Lanthimos' films: dry, monotone, and almost no emotion. Farrell does a great job being terribly awkward. Rachel Weisz narrates the film, reading awkward lines in exchange for laughs. This film should be praised for its photography and script, but not for its length. Perhaps 20-30 minutes could have been shaved off to spare one from nodding off at times, just waiting for the end to come.<br/><br/>'The Lobster' probably could have been a lot better had it been shorter. Despite its great script and hilarious pacing, the film eventually falls flat when it probably could have stayed on its feet."

The only reasonable explanation you might find for the storyline is that all the characters are on the asperger-autistic spectrum, except as it turns out, two of the characters 'match-up' by creating the same artificial medical complaint. Our male protagonist witnesses both of these characters performing the necessary 'accidents' but still falls in with the malevolent Hotel's processes. Eh? (The 'couple' are truly matched, so what's the issue?)The second incomprehensible issue with this film is the narration by the main female protagonist whose journal is found after she is blinded, yet she still narrates the story leading up to the male protagonists attempt to join her in her blindness. So, whose, journey have we be on? Don't expect anything to make sense. I guess 'courtship' and 'relationship' building don't make sense to some."

The way apps or websites match you to people with the most similar interests without considering that we are more than that. It exposes the way we minimize who we are in order to be more easily classified and matched with others. It also critiques the way people act versus how they think in a couple situation and the way we are sometimes ready to completely change who we are in order to survive.<br/><br/>To me it was an immensely satisfying movie to watch because I could see meaning behind every word and every action and could also connect on a very basic human level to the characters.

","Yorgos Lanthimos presents the audience with a dystopian society, unlike something such as George Orwell's 1984, or Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, it is simply hilarious. It presents a world riddled with absurdity, Camusian absurdism, it allows the audience to realize the value in uncertainty, presenting a radical and meaningless society, analogous to that of our own. As Camus does in The Myth of Sisyphus, The Lobster poses the statement that life is meaningless, men's desperate longing for the rational, for meaning and purpose, only leads to desperation and irrational behaviors, that is itself absurdism. This is manifested through the pointless rules of love presented in The Lobster's society. The film looks at weather or not one should commit suicide, the futile attempt at happiness, the importance of freedom and uncertainty. The pure awkwardness of the film, the robotic dialogue, the repetitiveness, it is all a means to show us, the viewer, that life is absurd, and while we are at it, just laugh at that fact, what else can we do, but be happy."

That kind of 'in your face' thing that any rustic person would notice and leave the cinema with an awkward sensation that you can't bring this artistic job down. All this critics high rates are from this 'awkward with their proud' people who couldn't see through the joke they were in:
At the same time the greek director forces us in this artistic sense, he puts a great effort on doing the most unbearable movie ever made. The funny thing here? It's a movie about people doing padronized paterns determined by a imaginary society. And they try so hard, even mutilating their selves. Anything to match what they are expect for.
In the end of the movie, as you walk away the theater, you struggle your self to make a positive commentary on the artistic aspects of the movie you actually hated. And why?

","Dystopian future film by the man who brought us Dogtooth and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. A story and narrative structure that defies genre classification. Colin Farrell looking like Bizzaro World Colin Farrell. A slightly-unsettling, detached narration to match the slightly-unsettling, detached acting. A bold, satirical take on relationships. People turning into animals. John C. Reilly.<br/><br/>These are all great reasons to love- or want to love- The Lobster. Unfortunately, all of those ingredients turned into an endlessly horrible slog that felt an hour longer than its running time. If your movie defies classification because it's like nothing anyone's ever seen before, that's fantastic. If your movie defies classification because it's too depressing to be a comedy, too cynical to be a romance, too absurd to be a drama, and too dull to be a thriller, you haven't broken ground.

","From the other reviews I expected something fresh, different, clever and insightful. What I got was something different but different but that's all. The movie posits a world organized to promote couples but populated by idiots. By age 40 you must be coupled and apparently it matters not if you had been coupled but no longer are, all that matters is whether you are coupled AT 40. From that follows the setup and setting of the movie, a hotel where you have a month to find your matched partner or else you suffer the penalty.<br/><br/>This absurd world is, for some unfathomable reason, tolerated by the inhabitants. Well, there is a reason of sorts I suppose, it's because these are no ordinary inhabitants, no, the inhabitants are a cross between the Stepford descendants and barely functional morons. We are to believe people meekly line up for their ""stay"" at the hotel, question almost nothing and if they do escape go on to be just as foolish and meek and stupid in their new environment.<br/><br/>The acting is wooden but that is on purpose and in keeping with what apparently was the vision for this movie, a world full of wooden idiots meekly and blindly accepting their fate. Oh how clever..<br/><br/>I might accept that premise if it was not taking place in the bigger setting of our current world with cars and well engineered highways, etc, etc. But it is just not believable that a world of people as meek and stupid and compliant and almost utterly lacking in self-awareness would have the smarts to create our current world yet be such moronic idiots by the age of 40. The movie Idiocracy seems far more realistic an alternative world than this waste of almost 2 hours.<br/><br/>I gave it a 3 instead of a 1 because it's somewhat more engrossing than Plan 9 From Outer Space."

"Imdbidia","8","2","3","4 March 2017"," Unique but slightly disappointing
","Yorgos Lanthimos has the great virtue of looking at our modern world with great insight and dissecting it for us. He turns the insight into a metaphor, and presents the freakishness of our society in essence, for what it is, not or what we've come to accept as normal. <br/><br/>In this film, Lanthimos reflects on the pressures that single people have to endure in our society: why are you single? why haven't you married yet? You should date and mate a person like you (meaning, your own social class, race, country, tribe, religion, age, etc.). You should allow somebody else to decide what's best for you (your parents, the group, or the algorithm of a dating site). You shouldn't (mustn't) have sexual relationships with your partner until you marry, or you should have meaningless sexual contacts until you marry. All of those things are societal and cultural, not natural, they treat the single person as an object to manipulate. All of this pressure and questions are analyzed in the film but with a detached mind, masterly, so you might ask, what has this to do with reality? The answer is everything! This is an intellectualizing exercise about reality, the reality of being single in the present day and world. <br/><br/>The script is very original -- unique. The actors are all good in their roles, especially having into account the material they've been given. The mood is also great; there is this 70s sort of vintage cold vibe that really suits the story. Some of the scenes in the film are great, as well; my favorite ones being the getaways of the singles to the city, the visit to the supermarket, the flamingo in the middle of the forest, or the group of singles taming their libido with dance music in the middle of the forest. You might find others more of your liking. There are plenty of odd scenes, dialogues and images, some of them really gory, and not my taste, but really impacting. <br/><br/>A few things annoyed me in the film, and most of them come from the direction and the script. 1/ I can appreciate the intellectual exercise, but I wasn't able to empathize with any of the characters. The script didn't take me from my head to my heart; a frigid world with frigid characters, even those supposedly in love. I couldn't care about them, unfortunately. 2/ The script is too rigid. The actors had no permission to improvise and develop their characters, something that would have give them depth and humanity. The actors were repeating sentences as robots, and that was what felt like. I'm sure that is intentional but, again, if you don't touch my heart, I won't give a dam about the story. 3/ There are a lot of outdoor scenes in the film, yet the cinematography is grim and alien-like. I thought of the way the forest was incorporated into the story of Fahrenheit 451; the forestry and city in this film are not hostile or beautiful, more flat than anything else. I found they lacked on cinematographic and narrative treatment to incorporate them into the story. It might be intentional, but it didn't work for me. 4/ I was expecting dark deadpan humour and found deadpan horror, so that was a bit of slap on the face; the horror took me aback, and I didn't find enough funny elements, more absurd and grotesque ones. <br/><br/>This is one of those films rarely produced in English, certainly an European film because I find difficult to imagine a film like this being produced in the US: elitist, daring, merciless and ruthless. Unique film-making for sure, mentally satisfying, but also disappointing and emotionally frigid to me."

","I'm not usually a fan of dystopian films, but this one reminded me more of 1984 than anything else I've seen. I was drawn in right from the beginning, and for a good while, I was happily along for the ride. There was an offbeat sense of humor that I appreciated. However, I felt like it lost focus and went in a direction it didn't need to go to make its point. My interest started to wane as the movie went on and I saw where it was going. What was fun about the early sequences is you start to learn the rules of this world bit by bit as it unfolds. If this movie is commenting on the need for approval to be a couple in today's society, it sure meandered a lot to get there."
"thekantana","4","2","3","16 January 2017"," Bland and Underwhelming
","As was the norm in 2016, The Lobster was yet another over-hyped film. Despite an intriguing premise and a stellar cast, the film never quite makes it past the limitations of Lanthimos' dour direction. Where a better film would have zigged or zagged, the director chooses a straight, gray-toned, dull classical path that fails to fully embrace the absurdity of the plot or connect the audience emotionally to the key points or characters of the film. And make no mistake, hidden in the dim lighting and few shooting locations is an interesting and striking critique of traditional relationship expectations. There's a few shots over the bow at traditional religious conceptions of marriage and some echoes of a dystopian future where the government controls who you love as well as a few strikes at the technological culture of isolation we find ourselves in today. But this never goes far. Lanthimos takes cues from Wes Anderson and from a number of successful French films but fails to catch the color and contrast of Anderson's worlds or the passion and expression found in films like Two Days, One Night. Where a change in color palate would have offered a symbolic contrast, Lanthimos continues to live in gray. Where a quirky beat could have changed a moment, Lanthimos presses play on the most boring classical soundtrack I have ever had the misfortune of listening to. Where a few shades of supporting characters could have poked and prodded at this alternative universe, Lanthimos chooses to force Seydoux and others into tight-lipped monotone commands and little else. And where the plot needed precision, Lanthimos refuses to allow clarity, which culminates in a weed-like storyline that can't seem to bring itself into focus. To top it off, the film is completely devoid of scope or establishing shots. It lacks the broad spectrum science- fiction control network and it's technocratic representation but also lacks the color and detail of Wes Anderson's surgical and hyper- limited absurdist set creations. And in perhaps the most damning moments, Lanthimos resorts to Zach Snyder levels of slow motion, an absolutely stunning mistake for a film so highly lauded. The slow motion kills moments of tension and cuts the legs out from moments so absurd they must be felt in real time. This is all such a shame. The themes of repression, isolation and control are so promising and Farrell and Weisz are more than game for their roles (Weisz in particular is practically begging to be allowed to express some of incredible emotional gravity she was allowed to portray in films like Constantine and others) but the director refuses to be swayed. The final death toll for The Lobster came as the ending just trickled to a close. It was ambiguous (not acceptable, given the quality of the previous acts) and as dreary and dour as the rest of the film. And while I accept that Lanthimos might just hate any and all relationships, hate is still a powerful emotion, something this film lacked entirely. Don't believe the hype for The Lobster, this is one film that doesn't have the legs this awards season."
"jadavix","5","2","3","3 January 2017"," A dead zone
","""The Lobster"" is certainly a challenging viewing experience, and it is a challenge I wasn't equal to.<br/><br/>Conceptually, it is like Peter Greenaway's ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"", and the short stories of Australian writer Peter Carey.<br/><br/>People have described it as existing in a dystopian near future, but I don't find that approach necessary to understand the movie. Like Greenaway's movies and Carey's short stories, it's a fable: something we're not supposed to be able to place on a realistic timeline. It's just food for thought. <br/><br/>The difference is that, in ""Her Lover"", Greenaway starts with a metaphorical situation and piles on the meaning until you have no choice but to work it out for yourself. The style is such that you can't look away.<br/><br/>""The Lobster""'s style is no style. Even the performances are drained of any and all emotion. People say and do the most outrageous and bizarre things, and it's just not that interesting. I wanted to look away, and I did.<br/><br/>It hurts to react with disinterest toward what is an intriguing central premise: a world where single people are forced to check into a hotel where they must find a partner before time runs out. Those that remain single are turned into animals. <br/><br/>In the hotel, people are paired up for stunningly arbitrary reasons, eg. people who limp are paired together, people who are short sighted, and people who have nosebleeds. The similarities are so inconsequential that they are easily faked: one man bangs his face on the wall to make his nose bleed to hook up with a woman whose nose bleeds spontaneously. <br/><br/>Outside the hotel, ""loners"" live in the woods, espousing a polar opposite ethos: for them, any and all romance is criminal, and acts of intimacy are punished with mutilation of the lips.<br/><br/>At this stage, I had lost interest. The movie becomes predictable in its unpredictability: you tire of seeing so many inexplicable things on screen. The true lack of style is depressing and hard to watch.<br/><br/>This is a movie that sucks life out of you, and I didn't appreciate it for that reason."

","Let's start with positive things. There is a great cast. Rachel Weisz makes a brilliant performance as a woman falling in love and especially the part when she is blinded is so well played.Sadly she didn't get more screen time. Colin Farrell is nearly every cut on screen and the only one who gets space to develop effectively. He makes his job very good as a man trying to fit in the system and searching love but also as someone who isn't able to find it on this way. Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw and Olivia Coleman as well were able to make their less time on screen effective. They all use their limited space of action given by the playbook really great. The biggest surprise for me was Angeliki Papoulia. Only around 20 minutes in the movie, but I don't remember someone being more realistic heartless. Also the work with the camera, especially in the woods, is well done. The colors always seem to be depressive and fixing to the intention of the Lobster. The world is so realistic created that I started feeling uncomfortable while watching it and thinking of what I would do in this world. The fact they didn't use make up also made everything in the presenting very realistic and touching. So what went wrong? Great idea, great cast, great production - but the two hours felt so long. The intention is explained very fast and is repeated and repeated again and again-BORING! The dialogues are most of the time useless and inconsequential. It helped at the beginning to understand the world of being pushed into relationships; to understand the constraint. But after 30 minutes it is clear what they wanted to say so why to continue this? At the end we have a story and idea could easily get around 8 points. We have a crew that could easily get 10 points...but what came out isn't even close being a good movie. The cast saved the Lobster to get an rating as an average movie, but without the movie would be on my list of worst movies 2015- sadly."

","What a strange, grim movie. Yet it was surprisingly enjoyable. Let's go over the surrealist aspects of the film first: if you're the type of person who wants logical explanations, realistic premises, or any kind of closure in a film, then this is not for you. The Lobster is relentlessly absurd, and it demands a lot more out of its viewers than most other movies.<br/><br/>I love this kind of weirdness. Yes, the themes of this movie could have been explored in a more realistic and comprehensible manner. But we have so many of those already. I'm glad these kinds of movies can also exist.<br/><br/>So is the message of this film about love? Kind of. It's more about the institution of love. We have no federally enforced love laws, but societal pressures can sometimes be just as powerful. Anyone who's been single for a long stretch of time, especially over a certain age, probably knows how weird and absurd people can be about relationships. How people get annoyingly nosy and how they assume things about single people. How desperate some singles can get. The Lobster is about all this garbage our culture puts on us regarding love and marriage. So yes, it's about love, but not at all a romantic movie.<br/><br/>In fact, the bleary performances of the actors brought it down a few points below what I initially wanted to give it. I understand why they were directed like that. The Lobster's dystopia is full of people whose lives completely revolve around staying in these state-mandated relationships. These people are constantly miserable but don't even know it. While this was amusing in the first hour or so, it slowly started to falter as the movie stretched for another hour. I think some more cutting or performance adjusting would've done it good. As the humor faded toward the end, the nightmarish qualities of the movie got a little too real. Too bad ""Deadpan horror"" doesn't work as well as ""deadpan humor."""

After this be aware that absurdity is a big part of the film (less than Dogtooth, more in the line of Hard to be a God), you'll have to deal with unanswered questions or unsatisfactory answers to side stories.

All the actors in the film truly seem to be fully immersed in the concept and the script, but none truly bring any impressive measures to the table, or stick out significantly. The cinematography does make for a chilling and interesting atmosphere, but in the end does not prove to be of much use, and simply feels out of touch as it goes on. The film is slow, and at times has trouble finding what it wants to be.

","To appreciate a film like The Lobster (2015) you need to know something about absurdism and dystopia. Whether we recognise it or not, our brains are wired into binary sets that help us make sense of the world. For example: in fictional narrative we tell stories about being unloved in order to express our need for love; we portray the fearful 'them' in order for 'us' to feel safe; and we explore the depths of 'evil' to celebrate what is 'good'. Absurdist films take these inversions of logic to their extreme in order to make us question the world we take for granted. They often add black comedy and dystopian/chaotic themes as a way of messing with our minds and challenging the foundations of our reality.<br/><br/>If you are still reading this, you will recognise The Lobster as an absurdist dystopian essay. It is a story set in a place referred to as The City where coupledom is compulsory and being single is illegal. If anyone becomes un-coupled they are immediately incarcerated in The Hotel where they have 45 days to re-couple or they will be transformed into an animal of their choice. Most of the unnamed people we meet are referred to by a defining characteristic, except for our protagonist, recently widowed architect David (Colin Farrell). The inmates must participate in dancing to bland music and attend lectures about the evils of being single. They are only allowed to leave the hotel to join hunts in the forest. If they shoot escaped loners they earn extra time before being turned into an animal.<br/><br/>In this rule-bound parallel universe everyone wears the same clothes and everything is hyper- regulated. When rules are broken punishment is severe: one victim has his fingers jammed into a burning toaster at breakfast for everyone to see. The forest world is the opposite to the The City. Escaped loners enjoy cool music and dance, but must stay single and any physical contact is forbidden. As his time runs out in The Hotel, David fears that he will fail to couple and flees to join the loners. As fate would have it, he meets his love amongst them and must sneak back into city life.<br/><br/>What to make of this strange tale? Despite its all-star cast, conventional acting criteria seem irrelevant as performances are understated and almost expressionless. The filming palette in The Hotel is blandly desaturated while that for the forest is richly foreboding, making both feel unwelcome. There are no flashbacks or other cinematic devices that offer insight into why things are the way we see them. We are left then with the classic absurdist challenge: to find meaning in this film you must turn logic on its head.<br/><br/>If you reflect on how much of our lives are focused on preparation for love and marriage, and how much real-world capitalist consumption is obsessed with beauty, sex appeal, and appearances, the absurd inverted metaphors of The Lobster begin to make sense. The City is not that different to romance TV reality shows where contestants hunt for mates based on defining characteristics. The real question is why are loners ostracised and why is there such pressure on finding partners? In the real world, I mean."

","Even after the obligatory head-scratching from the confusing opening (and the usual, modern day mumbling mix of poor speech delivery and horribly mixed background sound and music), this film just takes too much getting used to. Some of the tres-noir humor is quite funny, but mostly lost in the flat affects and depressing absurdity. I recently saw an excellent local production of ""Waiting for Godot,"" and it was downright light-hearted compared to this. After ten minutes I was saying ""got it,"" and not sure why I sat through the rest. To what depths goes sarcastic satire? Apparently endless."

You can't knock the performances of this fantastic cast either. Lots of internal characterisations which just emulated from Colin Farrell's facial expressions and made you feel truly awkward with him. He felt utterly tortured. But overall, it was just a bit dull and I got a bit bored. Maybe it went a step to far with it's satire and I got distracted. Would have made a good 'Black Mirror' episode but there was something missing from this as a feature length film.

"KineticSeoul","8","5","12","19 December 2015"," A satirical film that is ridiculous and yet amusing
","I will start off by saying this is a surreal and ridiculous movie that is highly satirical. But that is what makes this movie work for the most part because even the actors seem to know exactly what direction this film is taking. Especially with there robotic acting and dialogue. Now when you hear robotic performance, most people will interpret that as negative. However because of the structure of this film, it actually compliments it. So the story is about a fictional and ridiculous setting where you either have to be in a married relationship with someone within a 45 days or be turned into a animal of their choosing. However you get extra days to get into a relationship depending on how many people you hunt down with a tranquilizer rifle that try to run away or rebel. This environment takes place within a very communist setting, where everyone has to dress and follow guidelines such as no masturbating and no listening to their own personal music. And the people that are against that group is a group of rebels that are against being in a relationship but allow masturbation and freedom to listen to whatever they want. And the person that the film focuses in on through these trials is a average guy that isn't very likable and yet he is very human. Except the fact that if he were to change into a animal he wants to become a lobster. And that is what I liked about this film. How there isn't really a hero but instinctual and psychological parts of human actions and thoughts. Although it's shown in a very satirical way with it's surreal, weird and ridiculous direction. This isn't a movie I would want to see again, but I appreciate it for what it is. If you are a audience member that likes art-house films or satirical films, you might enjoy this one. You will at least be amused.<br/><br/>8/10"

David (Colin Farrell) <br/><br/>The dating game is alive and well but this time in a surrealistic romantic comedy, The Lobster. Filmed in Ireland, but probably meant to represent Europe in its current hot mess, this enjoyable magical-realist romance satirically and figuratively features the complex challenges facing anyone dating in the modern age and anyone hoping to assert a unique personality in a time that homogenizes rather than individualizes.<br/><br/>David is attending a spa specializing in his finding a suitable mate or turning him into the animal of his choice if he doesn't find a mate in 45 days. David chooses the lobster also because, besides the admirable life expectancy and fertility, it has the reputation for fidelity, albeit serially monogamistic.<br/><br/>The fascinating narrative is filled with juicy eccentrics identified by their ""defining trait"" (e.g., ""Lisping Man""—played by John C. Reilly), a nod to the online shortcuts of match making in a harrowing search for love that too often ends up in the figurative animal kingdom. Writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos can satirize boilerplate screen writing manuals at the same time.<br/><br/>The strict adherence to a couples-only society may appeal to extreme social conservatives today, but it is fraught with frustration for the average sophisticated citizen.<br/><br/>David's discovery of the ""Short-Sighted Woman"" (Rachel Weisz) offers hope in a world where ""loners"" are hunted in the forest and tranquilized. Falling in love, the two go through various plans eventually to liberate them from the strictures of both the hotel and the free-spirited loners in the forest.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a very Greek tragedy-like outcome affects their eye sights possibly to emphasize the blind nature of love and its violent possibilities. Fortunately, Farrell and Weisz deadpan through the vicissitudes of rebellious love, allowing us to concentrate on how desensitizing the forced decorum of contemporary romance can become.<br/><br/>""If you encounter any problems you cannot resolve yourselves, you will be assigned children, that usually helps.""

","Set in an alternative reality in which unmarried individuals have 45 days to find a partner or be transformed into an animal, a jilted middle aged man flees to join some outlaws, only to find that they live by an equally rigid code. With such an offbeat premise, 'The Lobster' is always clearly a satire and the film cleverly mocks the way contemporary societies function. The unmarried individuals, for example, have to find a partner with a 'deficiency' in common (like the way dating services work), and they are subjected to spelled out lecturers in which the benefits of being in a relationship are driven home - to avoid rape, choking death when eating, etc. The film is incredibly funny at times too with Colin Farrell giving an excellent deadpan performance, pretending to be uncaring of a suicide at one point to seem as heartless as a prospective partner to-be. Rachel Weisz also has a superb turn late in the piece. With such an outlandish story though, the film unavoidably leaves open unanswered questions. Where does the child suddenly appear from? How can a society properly function where individuals cannot be separate from partners (what about those mall cops?). The film's take on the coupled society in which we live is sharp enough though for make any such issues a secondary concern. There does indeed something amiss with the way people tend to bounce almost immediately from relationship to another in the world in which we live, and certainly it is easy to imagine some of the rituals of our society seeming just as bizarre to the characters in the alternative reality of this film."

"Quinoa1984","10","5","13","31 May 2016"," What does it mean to be connected? Or arranged? Or programmed? Or all of the above?
","Among the major artistic triumphs of cinema as a medium of the 21st century - and yes that is a hefty bunch of coconuts when it comes to praise - The Lobster is on the surface a dead-pan, ice-cold, horrific-as-the-Shining satire on marriage (notice the strings and shots of long hotel corridors), but is about so much more. It's a film that is devastating to watch in many moments, and it all comes down to how people are programmed; like the best dystopian fiction there is - Clockwork Orange, Kafka, 1984, Philip K Dick - it examines what it means when the heart and mind are ripped open and messed with to where they can conform to standards and rules. How can the heart have rules if it wants what it wants, so to speak? In Yorgos Lathimos' brutal, hysterical and harrowingly funny and sad look at what it means to fall in love, the rules are made to be broken and yet the hard-wiring is also essential.<br/><br/>The film's themes are rich for examination, such as how it looks at marriage, this idea that we have someone we ""must"" be with (arranged of course, in a great manner of speaking as, if you don't in this world, you're turned into an animal, albeit of your choice with makes it rather existential in that very real sense), and also on the flip-side what it means to have solitude and be content with that (or not, as case may be). But a great film, a new favorite film, won't be one only on its themes, if it feels like homework to watch it. While The Lobster is not something that is made by a filmmaker who is out to conform to what everyone's idea of a typically shot narrative is (in this way he wants to stick to a rigorous form, maybe like Wes Anderson but also I got some RW Fassbinder in there as well, and Bresson in some of the acting but not all), it's a lot of fun to watch... well, in a manner of speaking.<br/><br/>This is horrific stuff: Colin Farrell's character has to find a wife in 45 days and is sent to a hotel where all men and women are put into, for lack of a better term, uniforms (all the same suits and pants and dresses) and must find a mate. Also compatibility is all in this instance; while initially they may have found their first spouses on their own (this is a world so rich by the way in its construction you can feel the confines of it outside the hotel or, later on, in the woods), they're trained from birth that they MUST be with someone or ELSE. So when they are in this hotel they have to try and find, um, 'matching characteristics' such as a lisp (John C. Reilly, perfect from start to finish) or a limp (Ben Wishaw's John) or, for Farrell, near-sightedness. But this compatibility turns into a nightmare when a particular someone is matched up - they're moved from single to double beds - and the nightmare seems to be over once, as in many a dystopian story (i.e. Fahrenheit 451) when the hero escapes to join the so-called underground rebellion. Nope, not quite.<br/><br/>What's so remarkable to me about this film is how it manages to show in its style and approach forms of distance and alienation (again Fassbinder comes to mind), but I was so emotionally engrossed in what was going on. The actors I think do so much to contribute with that, as people like Farrell, Rachel Weisz, even in her own subdued way Lea Seydoux (who becomes sort of the real, unexpected but most terrifying villain of the story in the conflict sense, at least to me), bring so much emotional weight to a movie that is all about what we hide and what we show. What you show can get you punished, or transformed (notice the odd but awesome placement of a flamingo in the woods at one point among some other animals), or killed or even worse turned into something that will change you while keeping you human, so the 'characteristics' aspect of a relationship - do you like this, do you know this - is all part of the point.<br/><br/>It's a daring and provocative film that feels like a breath of fresh air, even as it's at many points unpleasant to watch. It's a strange thing to recommend a film like The Lobster so readily, in large part because it's a) like nothing else out there (a credit to my new favorite film studio, A24, also responsible for the horrific delights of The Witch and Green Room this year), and b) it's highly watchable. Again, this is, with all its slow-motion sequences (done at times to classical music) a chore to sit through. In a way its watchability is what may contribute to you squirming. I say good - sometimes you should squirm, whether it's a comedy or a horror or a cynical take on love or a tragedy. This is all of the above. Lanthimos may have his influences - some I may guess in my critical response, some I may have not gotten right - but he is all his own director, fully formed like some figure from Greece who's risen to the top of the ladder of artistry. I can't wait to see everything he does (aside from Dogtooth, which is amazing as well)."

","Extraordinary but actually, whisper it, a bit dull.<br/><br/>Having slept through fairly long tranches of this movie I'd nevertheless call it a success.<br/><br/>In part.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell is quite wonderful as the central character who is consigned to a form of detention in a hotel in the depths of Ireland after his partner dumps him. With his brother in tow (a Border Collie names Bob) he has 45 days to find a new partner or face being turned into an animal of his choice which is a lobster. Why? Because they live over 100 years and are fertile throughout their lives.<br/><br/>On arriving he faces a gentle interrogation as to his sexual preferences in which there is a slight suggestion that he may in fact be homosexual but faced with making a decision he opts for straightness. It's an odd moment that isn't actually played out in any underlying way in the movie that follows.<br/><br/>It's a dystopia in which no-one has any names and humans are not just transformed into animals but are also hunted in a nearby forest for hotel extensions.<br/><br/>His quest for love is challenging and results in his escaping the, presumably government run, facility to join a band of guerrilla terrorists where he finds his match in Rachel Weisz. However the terrorists ban love so a complex sign language evolves between the pair as they seek to develop a relationship. It's kind of silly but also kind of funny. It's part farce, part surrealism and has several laugh out loud moments but it's too slow, dragging endlessly in parts. Yet the juries at Cannes nominated it for their top prize. I can see why, but I can also see why it failed to scoop.<br/><br/>The director, Yorgos Lathimos, is renowned for his satires and this is his first English language excursion and has much in common with previous outings.<br/><br/>This is Farrell's movie from start to finish as he is rarely off screen. He demonstrates his knack for off kilter humour that had us rolling in the aisles in In Brugges, but this a very different kettle of crustaceans.<br/><br/>Nevertheless he pulls off his task with aplomb. It really is as quite remarkable performance ably supported by John C Reilly, Ashley Jenson and Olivia Coleman.<br/><br/>Odd? Yes.<br/><br/>Great? Not quite."

","Lanthimos delivers a brilliant thought-provoking film that defies traditional parameters of storytelling within its genre. The Lobster provides a high-concept black comedy, depicting an absurdist dystopian society where singlehood is illegal. Those found to be without partner are hunted and sent to a hotel where they are given 45 days to find a partner or be turned into an animal of their choosing. The protagonist, David, played by Colin Farrell decides that he would like to be turned into a lobster. The criteria for partnerdom is based on singular, shallow traits of commonality, such as ""short-sightedness"" ""having a lisp"" or ""having a limp."" Those with partners, do not experience bliss however, they exist isolated in their relationships, without intimacy or true community. To fight this system, there is a renegade group of fiercely independent singles who live in the forest, hunted by society. This group is equally brutal in their obsessive rules about the eradication of love and sex. The film co-stars and is narrated by Rachel Weisz, a member of this renegade rebellion.<br/><br/>Beyond the obvious point of reflection that we might debate, namely, do we only have worth if we are in romantic relationship, have a kid...etc? Lanthimos uses this satirical atmosphere to convey his greater meaning to the viewer, or at least get the viewer to question their own beliefs. He explores notions of intimacy, loneliness, connection and divide through the lens of humor and brutality. The music throughout the film is discordant and foreboding, we are aware that everything we see is vaguely familiar to our own experience, but also alien enough that we see the absurdity in it. The characters themselves are not entirely believable, but nor are they supposed to be in their affectless communication. Even the lighting is dull and muted as if to suggest that life in this world is without vibrancy, it is hollow and dull, just as their existences are. <br/><br/>The film primarily explores humanity's need for intimacy. Asking, what is connection and do we need it? Those living within this society answer that humans need relationship for pragmatic purposes, that connection can be forced based on singular points of commonality. Those choosing to rebel in singledom recognize the pull that humans have towards connection and impose Draconian laws to eliminate the threat of intimacy in their community, more so to make a point that is equally false: we don't need intimacy to live. Both those living in false intimacy and those who dismiss intimacy altogether, experience profound loneliness and something of their humanity is lost in the process. The viewer is forced to decide what is intimacy? We are left to wonder if intimacy is simply an animalistic primal desire for sexual companionship, procreation, or a societal pressure to ""couple."" Perhaps the film suggests that it goes beyond the practical. We must ask if there is a deeper need within humanity that relentlessly pursues intimacy. The act of sacrificing for the other, or even self-harming to maintain intimacy suggests, perhaps, that we are not merely the sum of our biological impulses or animalistic drives. Perhaps, part of what a human is, is this spiritual need for meaningful connection with one another in a way that is in its own way, transcendent."
"Zerker161","10","3","7","5 July 2016"," Brilliant
","Quite easily the greatest movie I've ever seen. It's as if someone took the surrealism of Rubber and added real depth to it. The movie's one and only flaw is the length, but other than that, it's flawless. The acting was robotic and dull, but with the intention of being so as it parallels the animalistic nature of love within society. The movie creates a drastically hyperbolic representation of society's push for us to find love, even if it isn't meaningful. Then it later shows us the push by the other side of society to avoid love in any form. Both sides harshly punish those who fail to meet their standards, and in the middle, we have our protagonist. A man who, in between worlds of fake love and forbidden love, finds real, true love. The City's policy of turning people into animals should they fail to find love, the robotic nature of the people and their tendencies to spew out information at others, and the surface level romance where people are attracted to one another based on things such as physical disabilities they may share are perfect example of how this society treats its people as animals who exist merely to breed. In all of this, however, our main character suffers and struggles through the loss of love and the finding of it. A masterpiece of cinema that is sorely underrated. In a mass of Michael Bay-esque movies with no story or character development in exchange for gross amounts of CGI and explosions, a rose like this with meaning and beauty to it is a gift to the dying culture of today's world.

","On June 5, 2016 at 9:55pm MST I sat down to watch what just might have been the most damning indictment of society, sexuality, loneliness and mortality I have ever seen. The Lobster, while being utterly off-kilter, weird and occasionally sweet has a humor as black as a Cuban espresso and a message as fatalistic as a Franz Kafka story. Director Yorgos Lanthimos may have made a name for himself with the equally deadpan Dogtooth (2009) but it is The Lobster that elevates him beyond the mantel of youthful provocateur. This guy is a one-man Molotov cocktail, meticulously creating his own little absurd world before tearing it apart.<br/><br/>The Lobster takes place in a near-future dystopian society where being single is completely illegal. If death or divorce does occur, people are brought to ""The Hotel"" where they are to meet someone new within 45 days. If they fail to make a match, they're turned into an animal of their own choosing and as the Hotel's (Colman) concierge puts it ""find another chance for love."" David (Farrell), a recent divorcée is brought to the Hotel with his brother (a Border Collie) in tow. Mustached, bespectacled, slightly overweight and awkward even by deadpan dystopia standards, David tries his best to find his one and only.<br/><br/>Much like the buttery shellfish this film takes it's name from, The Lobster is certainly an acquired taste. Characters awkwardly shuffle across the screen speaking in impassive, wooden phrases hinting at their desperation, their insecurities and their disconnectedness. Even when not paying mind to the Hotel's strict code of conduct, the social mores of Lanthimo's world requires partnerships start with a physical commonality. David makes friends with the Lisping Man (Reilly) and the Limping Man (Whishaw), both of whom hope to find partners with their defining features. When the Limping Man fails, he switches gears and purposely starts nosebleeds to get the attention of Jessica Barden...known as you guessed it: the Nosebleed Woman. Those unable to find a partner can extend their stay by going on the hunt and tranquilizing hordes of militant singles who hide in the forest. The Heartless Woman (Papoulia) is infamous for this, extending her stay by about a year based on captures alone.<br/><br/>This is the kind of exaggerated, bleak, freakishly and fiendishly clever world building you can expect to find in this film. A film that aptly skewers modern society's views on relationships and equates elaborate social norms as nothing more than bestial courtships, many of which are based on lies and lunacy. Once we leave the Hotel and enter the forest, the movie slowly shifts like an ice shelf into a blossoming romance mixed with a visual anarchism that excites comparisons to the second half of Godard's Weekend (1967). The resemblance is made even more conspicuous in a scene where singles enter the city to gather provisions in a slow-motion dance of consumerist glee; abruptly followed by a return to savagery.<br/><br/>This takes place in the second part of the film which unfortunately fails to match the absurd high-points of the first half-hour. The film replaces these flourishes of the bizarre with sentimentality that certainly feel sincere; though a little wanting by comparison. Still, flashes of incongruous brilliance still linger within the frame, even providing one or two divine comic set-piece that couldn't have happened without shifts in scenery. As for the ending...oof, how about that ending!<br/><br/>In it's own understated way, The Lobster is one of the best art- house imports offered in the last decade. While decidedly not for everyone, those already exhausted by this year's lackluster summer movie schedule might want to try this bold little experiment on. Though word to the weary, The Lobster may not be a movie for couples. If you decide to go with a loved one on date night, keep the steak knives out of arm's reach."

A good cast as well. Reminded me of Dogville, a movie that I couldn't watch. Same approach of doing something different from what is expected with really known actors. It feels like a play. It feels European. If feels like art.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it's one of those you either love it or hate it films, but you at least respect it."

","I love this quote machine of a masterpiece. This is very Kafkaesque, and done just right as a satire, instead of pictures such as ""Deep dark"", which are very commendable, brave and fun, but tend to escalate into pure flimsiness and really rub it in your face how ""edgy"" they are. No, the photography, directing and acting in this flick will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. I myself see myself as an easily distracted guy, I must admit I tend to get a little bored by drama, but the subtle tone of this film, the comedy and absurdity of the human condition had my eyes peeled throughout the film. I dare already say one of the best films of this year. What I myself being a writer find most noteworthy in the interaction and dialogue is how the pressure of society get really obvious when they flip the script like they have done here; Our modern world WORKS JUST THE SAME, but instead of how things are in our modern real life society, the characters here do their very best to parade their perfect treats and are all painfully honest about their disadvantages, but also invent new ways to lie, when the stake is that society will turn them into beasts and leave them in the woods if they can not mate. Because, as they say ""two is obviously better than one, this is a reminder"". Every characters antics and actions makes perfect sense in this fully logical context, where even just standing alone by yourself in a shopping mall will not only be frowned upon -it will have dire consequences. A brilliant portrait, analysis and analogy of what loneliness is. Let this remind you of death. It won't get more fun and stylish than this."
"aanusha-ghosh","9","3","7","20 January 2016"," Offbeat, timely, and profound: the best thing I've seen this year
","The Lobster, with its absurd premise and stilted dialogue delivery, breaks countless cinematic rules and the expectations of even a seasoned audience to become arguably one of the best movies to have been made this year.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell plays David, a middle-aged man whose wife has recently left him. In this dystopian world of his, single people are taken to a hotel, where they are given a chance to find themselves partners within fortyfive days, failing which they are turned into an animal of their choice. Once David checks into the hotel, he's issued clothes and shoes, and assigned a single room. If he manages to find a partner, he will be upgraded to a double room, and the hotel management will monitor his relationship for four weeks before allowing him and his partner to move to the city together. Residents at the hotel can extend their stay by hunting down escapees, who they tranquilise with dart guns â€“ each loner hunted down adds an extra day to the hunter's stay. After David escapes from the hotel, he comes upon a band of renegades who have, if possible, an even stricter code to live by. They are loners, and are forbidden any sexual interaction. When he meets a woman among them (Rachel Weisz) who is short-sighted like him, they fall in love and plan to escape to the city together.<br/><br/>This is as far as I am willing to go in revealing the plot. I am told that Yorgos Lanthimos, the director, typically uses stilted dialogue and ritualised actions in his films. The Lobster is his first English venture and features both heavily. The rather offbeat humour might take some getting used to. What is striking, however, is the quiet undercurrent of desperation that both Farrell and Weisz manage to channel underneath those poker faces. The deadpan expressions of all the characters and the near-surgical precision with which they communicate with each other belies the tragedy of living in a world where the worth of people are measured by their romantic proclivities. Rather paradoxically, the eccentricities of the characters, the events, and the plot serve to heighten this feeling of world-weariness, and makes the film more believable for viewers.<br/><br/>In fact, The Lobster is ultimately a success because of its paradoxes. Invigoratingly ambitious and enthusiastically weird till the very end, it plays out like an Orwellian ballad for the twentyfirst century, a masterful allegory of the times. It's one of those movies that work because they capture the zeitgeist so wonderfully. In a decade that has seen the rise of Tinder, OkCupid, dating algorithms, left-swiping, and selfies, no movie seems more timely, no movie sounds more urgent. Spike Jonze's Her, another movie of this decade on the theme of futuristic dating, seems laughably optimistic in retrospect. The Lobster is not only far cleverer, it is also far more breathtakingly imaginative, and so wonderfully scripted that it was hard to find faults with, except perhaps the presence of a few lines of dialogue in French which added nothing to the movie, seeing as how the film-makers deemed it unnecessary to provide subtitles for them. All said and done, this is a movie that awards repeated viewing and will, I can staunchly claim, go on to join the pantheon of dystopian futuristic movies that will continue to be discussed even fifty years hence. Two thumbs up."

","This movie is supposedly dystopian, but even dystopian movies depict future societies whose leaders have a vision or an objective that, while unappealing, can be understood. Unfortunately for the viewer, the rules of this dystopian society have no discernible objective. Without including spoilers, I'll simply say that the viewer will be unable to discern whether the new society wishes to limit population, eradicate love, or simply ensure the pairing of like personalities. To add to the confusion, the insurgents opposing this dystopia have rules that - while different - are no less inexplicable and seemingly pointless. One of the advantages of streaming is the ability to advance through the tedium. Anyone who sat in a theater to view this pointless movie and made it to the closing credits either has no life or merely wanted to get their money's worth. To Netflix subscribers I can say only this.

"WubsTheFadger","8","2","4","4 March 2018"," The Lobster
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>First off, the story is set in a somewhat dystopian future were everyone is expected to get married. Trivial things become the corner stone of relationships like nose bleeds and limps. The story takes the ideas of love, relationships, and societies view of love and turns it into a terrifying world. The story is at time funny and horrifying. The ending is very ambiguous and leaves you feeling stunned. Yorgos Lanthimos directed Dogtooth which is also a black comedy with some very interesting social questions that is much like The Lobster.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Colin Farrell performs the best as an average Joe with nothing special about him at all. Rachel Weisz also performs well as she narrates the story and plays a pivotal part in Colin Farrell's characters story. John C. Reily, Ben Whishaw, Angeliki Papoulia, and Lea Seydoux all perform well.<br/><br/>The pacing is very bland and slow. It is done on purpose though. The film wants us to turn into Colin Farrell's character and see his meaningless existence. The music is also a little repetitive and the runtime is overlong. <br/><br/>Pros: Interesting, funny, and dark story, great performance by Colin Farrell, good overall acting, a good ending, and slow pacing that was meant on purpose<br/><br/>Cons: Slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and repetitive use of music<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8.2"
"VVMini","7","2","4","23 February 2018"," More absurd than necessary
","The Lobster is a very difficult movie to assess. Its premise is so ridiculous and absurd that it's bound to be a divisive movie that isn't for everyone. The first half in particular is a difficult sit through, as due to their absurdity, many story elements seem completely random at first. It's only halfway through that things seem to click together, and an impressively cohesive story emerges. I'm actually so impressed with the underlying story, that I believe this would have made a terrific science fiction movie if played a little more seriously. <br/><br/>It is basically a movie about a dystopian future in which people are forced to become married or run the risk of being turned into an animal, or being hunted if trying to avoid this outcome. There are some very interesting reflections on the pressures of society to find a partner and the superficial ways that people get together and pretend to be someone else in order to avoid ending up alone. Interestingly, the fugitive group of loners is equally as radical in their approach, forcing their members to stay alone and punishing them for showing any type of romantic affection towards another. I see this broadly as a remark on society in general, in which there are extremists on both ends of the political spectrum, each hating the other, but neither one being particularly desirable from a neutral point of view. Like always, the truth is somewhere in the middle. <br/><br/>I found myself being thoroughly engaged in these ideas, but at times were taken out of it by the absurdist nature of many of the scenes. The deadpan and deliberately wooden acting is quirky and interesting at first, but grows tiresome rather quickly, and the dialogue seemed very scripted and unnatural (as it was intended). I also personally didn't think it was as funny as the writers hoped I would think, being left confused and frustrated at some scenes rather than laughing at them. <br/><br/>I'm sure many will disagree, and believe the absurdity is at the core of the film and the movie wouldn't have worked without it. Indeed, it might have run the risk of being a little more run-of-the-mill if played more seriously and left in less capable hands. However, the underlying ideas were so strong that I really don't think it needed the excessive absurdity. I believe this might be a case of the writers underestimating the quality of their screenplay and throwing in some quirky things to make it seem a bit more alternative and anti-mainstream than it needed to be. Even the central concept of turning into an animal if failing to find a partner within 45 days was superfluous to the main story. The movie would have worked just as well if a different type of punishment was presented. Or at least it could have been given a bit more prominence. The fact that the animals that are walking around were once humans is being mentioned in a throwaway line or two, but never really fully explored. <br/><br/>I'm not saying it should have been a full on dark and gritty science-fiction drama. It could have retained its satirical outlook, which suits the story quite well. It just went a little overboard with trying to seem as weird and quirky as possible, which is a shame as The Lobster is now mainly being remembered as 'that weird movie in which humans turn into animals', even though there's so much more to this great story."

""Which is worse- turning into an animal and be killed at any minute?

Self sufficient to a point of digging your own grave. ""We only dance alone- that is why we only listen to electronic music"" But in that world full of denials, one cannot find true happiness.<br/><br/>Will there ever be two equal halves that are perfect for each other? Even if there is it might not be the same way forever. Will you change yourself the way your partner has changed so you can be on the same page? So what if you don't?

","The Lobster is not a movie you watch every day. The Lobster and a movie: Visionary Accurate Dreamlike. Actual Real. The author Yorgos Lanthimos, lays bare a contemporary society, made up of very specific rules, made of mass choices, where the collective has not the individual. The mirror of our society, the thin line that separates the rule of married life, the ""horrible and traumatic"" choosing to live alone. You can live on their own and be free? Be happy? No It can not because now the society to also impose the rules. You can not: do not you have to be happy. Not only can you not be yourself. I really appreciated the narrative style of the film, inspired by the old silent films, combining the current contemporaneity. We are a society bred like cattle, we are a collective, we have lost our identity is individual, we have lost the most important thing: Free thinking."

","With scenes as beautiful as dramatic, intelligent touches and good (rare) acting quality, The Lobster is a different movie, extravagant and yes, very rare.
Single men and women must meet in a hotel and get a partner for the next few days, otherwise they will be turned into animals and abandoned. That premise alone sounds peculiar enough, but watching the movie is even more so. Although it is categorized as a comedy and romance, I must admit that I didn't find room within any of those categories. I didn't consider this movie funny at any time, on the contrary, it is disturbing. Don't consider it a romance either, because it's more of a criticism of that romance. This is where the film shines by showing us a palpable message about ""love and society"". A look through a different lens that takes us into a world as pessimistic as it is optimistic, a world without contradictions where everything is perfect, and yet, wrong; a false world.<br/><br/>It's worth seeing, even if it feels strange and somewhat tight, and fails miserably in its touches of ''comedy and romance''. It's worth just because of how... rare it is."
"filipovnanastassja","8","0","0","3 July 2020"," How to watch Lanthimos
","Alright alright alright. If you can not stand blood, deadpan (intentional) line delivery, dry and dark/ridiculous/diabolical humour (works for me but I can imagine for many it wouldn't stand a chance) - don't watch. You'll get angry and frustrated. You either like Lanthimos or not. And either way it can be justified.
But if you can march through all that, you'll ne satisfied. You'll laugh out loud (scene when the hotel owners sing at the banquet or when loners are dancing with headphones - this really happens at festivals: was this Lanthimos poking them or not beats me, but since I always found it ridiculous, it worked for me). This isn't intuitive, feel-it-all movie; it's rather made to make us feel kind of uncomfortable - because, how many times have we obeyed to the rules of society? Are we going to do anything to fit in? What is the merit of a successful relationship? We see a relationship 2 relarionships built on a lie (nosebleed couple: we don't see them part, even when the lie is told - perhaps some are okay with a little illusion? David and heartless woman can't stay together because he shows emotions - hence, she can't stand that) Besides, who can say that we can only function if we are alike, or even if we have identical traits (as over the top depicted here) - nothing, nothing but caring for other human being and working for your relationship can make you two last:even then nothing/no one guarantees you a happy ending. Maybe the ending is open because Lanthimos himself is not sure: how much are we ready to sacrifice ourselves for happiness of our loved ones? For me, there are two thesis on this:
1. David is again *blinded* by love, so he smashes that knife into his eyes
2. David hesitates because he is aware that love, no matter what the sacrifice is, is prone to ending.
However, I believe more in the option no. 1. The owners of the hotel represent the lack of will for sacrifice - David and the blind woman might just be their opposite pair."

","The Lobster is one of the most complicated movies ever.<br/><br/>Certainly, The Lobster has its own philosophy, but it is not easy to understand it completely, aside of the themes of the movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps, if one sees the movie more than once, he would be in the position to figure out what exactly is going on and what is the reason behind every incident.<br/><br/>Like in Dogtooth, Lanthimos and Filippou used as a title for their project a symbolic object, but the connection between the lobster as an animal and the protagonist wasn't clear.<br/><br/>The film is said to be full of symbolism about human relationships, but it is difficult to be identified from the first sight.<br/><br/>It probably needs a lot of thinking to get the meaning and that is why limited viewers will understand it.<br/><br/>Perhaps, you need to have a couple of notes with you from the writer and the director to understand what is happening in the film.<br/><br/>The majority of people who watch movies are not geniuses, so to put them in a situation to guess what you mean with symbols is like a brain teaser.<br/><br/>People watch movies for fun, to get amusement. If they wanted to solve mathematics they would apply in a Mathematics undergraduate program of a University.<br/><br/>Lanthimos and Filippou have written simpler scripts in the past, so I believe that to write one like this, it was a product of an intended project. They might have done it for the Oscar, which they didn't win with the Dogtooth.<br/><br/>The point is that you don't need to write something so weird to win an Oscar. Sometimes, the simpler things are more difficult to be shown than that and definitely worth more. I am not saying that this film hasn't merit. But most people won't see it at all.<br/><br/>To win an Oscar, you must be comprehensible and I don't think that every person is in the position to be connected with that movie.<br/><br/>There were also some provoking incidents in the Lobster such as deaths and shootings, which in my opinion must not be taught through the cinema.<br/><br/>Fortunately, some cruel scenes were avoided, but still there were sad things included. Of course, this is how life is. There are good and bad things, so someone must know it all. But entertaining the audience is the most important thing, not to pose him more problems. And with the Lobster you have to surmise what is meant through the allegories of people's actions.<br/><br/>It was a very carefully applied project and it deserves the respect of everyone, but it is cursed to be liked by a particular audience, which is not the majority of cinema addicts.<br/><br/>As an experiment, it is clever and it is evolutionary for the cinema to have movies like this one, so, as a part of the film industry, the Lobster is a worthy project. It has quality, especially for those who become identified with the story and the way it is flourished.<br/><br/>The Lobster is a valuable movie for the cinema, regardless of the people who might find it extremely peculiar and incomprehensible.

I'll be straight with you and say that it isn't non stop intense viewing that you will feel changed after.

"ferguson-6","7","3","8","12 March 2016"," Strange, Bizarre, Peculiar
","Greetings again from the darkness. The scene playing over the opening credits is baffling to us and sets the tone of peculiarity that runs throughout the film. A lady gets out of her car during a rainstorm to perform an unthinkable act as we watch through the windshield as the wipers rhythmically clear our view. Next we watch as Colin Farrell's wife announces, after 11 years of marriage, she is leaving him for another man. Curiously, Farrell asks if her new man wears glasses or contacts.<br/><br/>Welcome to a dystopian future via the warped and creative mind of writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos (Dogtooth, 2009). It really boils down to a satirical look at relationships and our societal outcast of single adults. In Lanthimos' world, Farrell, now a single man, must check in to the oddest country hotel you've seen. He has 45 days to find a romantic partner. If he doesn't, he will be transformed into the animal of his choice. He chooses the lobster because of its long life span  ignoring the probability of ending up on a restaurant platter.<br/><br/>It's an oddball world overly structured with rules enforced by the Hotel manager – a terrific Olivia Colman. Farrell befriends a couple of other single fellows: the limping man (Ben Whishaw), and the man with a lisp (John C Reilly). It's funny and uncomfortable and kind of sad to watch these folks awkwardly try to connect with others with a deadline fast-approaching.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is really black comedy at its finest, but once Farrell escapes the Hotel and joins the ""loners"" in the forest, the tone shifts a bit. An uneven romance develops between Farrell and a woman played by Rachel Weisz (who is also the film's narrator). Even though this group of loners pride themselves on independence, it's ironic that Farrell has merely traded one set of rules for another  courtesy of the rebel leader played by Lea Seydoux.<br/><br/>It's a bizarre film, and one from which we can't look away. The deadpan-yet- emotional dialogue delivery is strange enough, but the site gags are even further off the charts – keep an eye out for animals (former singles) strolling by in the background (peacock, camel, etc). There is certainly insight into modern day relationships and how people connect based on instantaneous judgments  but at least we don't have to dig our own graves  yet!"

Wonderful elements, exciting plot, the cast was very proper and British which I think it made the film more special.The director's work was immaculate. Those refined British humor was indispensable. With its upsetting story and shocking scenes, with its weird and pathetic dialogs this film is a unique one. A must see, a classic one.

There's just not enough here to keep going for so long.<br/><br/>This will get more hype because of the cast, and Farrell, as (almost) always, is spot on, as are many of the others in the hotel, however Rachel Weisz has the worst voice-over voice I've heard, and started to make me dislike this very early on. <br/><br/>Interesting premise, a few good scenes, and a not half bad ending, should give a higher score, but lack of everything else, and Weisz's continuous voice croakily explaining everything just made this disappointing. <br/><br/>If you do however like this, I'd recommend Dogtooth, similar dark dry vain, but better in every way."
"shaunjmaher","9","3","8","7 February 2016"," Is Love really Blind?
","The premise of The Lobster, once revealed, is totally banana's, but it uses it's surreal elements to perfectly satirise the ridiculousness of relationships, the lengths people go to start them, and to stay in them.<br/><br/>In the world of The Lobster, single people are not just socially ostracised, they are completely outlawed. Newly single people have to find a partner within forty five days or they are turned into an animal. The small mercy is that you get to choose which one - best if you don't choose a dog though, everyone chooses dog's, that's why there are so many of them around. David (a fleshy Colin Farrell) has recently been dumped by his wife and has chosen to be turned into a Lobster, ""because they live for a hundred years"" if he is not successful. If he chooses not to conform, he would have to go on the run and live as a loner in the wilderness. Normal society does not want loners.<br/><br/>The Lobster pits the single people and partnered people at opposite sides of a war. The Loners are literally hunted like wild animals and they in return run guerrilla operations exposing the hypocrisy of the people in relationships and break couples up by releasing truth bombs that cannot be recovered from. Both sides of the social divide are run by tyrannical leaders, enforcing their world view with extreme acts of violence and humiliation for those who break the rules.<br/><br/>When David checks into the Hotel to begin his forty-five days countdown to meet a partner, everyone he meets has some sort of affliction. There's a limper, a lisper and even a nose bleeder. David himself wears glasses and seeks a partner who is similarly short- sighted. As the days shrink and he sees those around him partner up, he knows what he has to do. If you can't make it, fake it and he pretends to fall in love. Despite the horrible consequences, he maintains his lie for as long as he can.<br/><br/>Initially you may think the stilted dialogue and odd narration may be a consequence of this being Lanthimos's first English language film, but as things develop it's clear that this is by design, with everyone at a level of deadpan that would make Steven Wright get the giggles.<br/><br/>This is dark, dry comedy at it's best, but there are no pauses for laughs here. You get the feeling that the filmmaker isn't sure if you will get it, and probably doesn't care if you don't. He has constructed the story so expertly, releasing details that leave you alternately curious as to what is going on, or on edge over what will happen next, that the jokes aren't the most important thing anyway. You care about the characters and at the end are left wondering if love really is blind."
"SquigglyCrunch","9","4","13","31 December 2015"," Unique, Awkward, and Very Amusing
","I've wanted to see The Lobster for a while, as it sounded like a pretty weird yet interesting movie. I'm very happy to say that it completely met up with, and surpassed, my expectations. <br/><br/>The Lobster has a very, very different plot. It's one that I've never seen and probably doesn't exist anywhere else. It's extremely original, but what's originality without knowing what to do with it? Luckily, Yorgos Lanthimos knew exactly what he was doing, and he did a fantastic job. <br/><br/>The characters and their exchanges are one of the best things about the film. They range from extremely awkward to completely psychotic. It really sets the mood of the movie when you know that despite how weirdly innocent it is it can also be very dark and disturbing. All the characters are great, and you really care about and know them by the end of the movie. <br/><br/>The movie's awkwardness combined with the plot can make for some very funny exchanges and scenes. Sometimes a conversation is so awkward that you can't help but laugh at it, while other times there's something so surreal about a scene that it's just funny to look at. <br/><br/>Overall The Lobster is a very different movie. It's nothing like what you'd expect in a sci-fi romance, and because of this it's easily one of the best movies of the year. In the end I would, without a doubt, recommend this movie to anyone."
"naysbaghai","9","4","13","12 December 2015"," A quirky and playful yet despicable comedy
","I never really thought about how film has the power to translate extreme theatrical styles and ideas onto the big screen, until I watched The Lobster. Borrowing heavily from Absurdism, this science fiction artwork from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos is disguised as a quirky and playful yet despicable comedy that presents a relevant commentary on relationships in the world in which we live. It does so in an original fashion that is becoming exceedingly rare in modern cinema.<br/><br/>Let's place ourselves in the familiar situation of the not-too distant dystopian future, and imagine that we are imprisoned in a remote hotel, and if we fail to find a suitable romantic partner in 45 days, we are turned into an animal of our own choosing. This is an idea that sounds both interesting and frightening at the same time, but is without doubt innovative, as is the rest of the narrative. The plot is unpredictable and expertly paced, and balances moments of shock and anguish with spasms of rupturing laughter. If I mention any in this review, I will have made the same mistake as the movie's trailer did, and that is reveal too much of the film. What the trailer doesn't reveal is the enormous complexity of the film's message; neither side (being in a relationship versus being single) is an ideal side, and that the real nature of society is not restricted to black and white. <br/><br/>For a film with a budget of just over $8 million, the film boasts an ensemble cast that takes the wheel of this film with little effort. The residents at the hotel include Ben Winshaw (Skyfall and Perfume) and John C. Reilly (Step Brothers and Guardians of the Galaxy), while the rebels hiding in the woods include Léa Seydoux (Spectre and Mission Impossible IV) and Rachel Weisz (The Mummy and The Fountain). Most of these unnamed characters support the protagonist David, played by an unrecognisable Colin Farrell, whose character development propels the film even further.<br/><br/>In terms of execution, the cinematography is exquisitely composed, and is complemented by the bleak colour palette. Returning to the sci-fi features of the film, I applaud Lanthimos's choice to employ normal locations such as hotels, woods and cities to show how the possibility of a dystopian future is very real and very imminent. However, I feel that he may have indulged too heavily in the usage of slow-motion, and the recurrence of the same piece of music quickly wore out its welcome. Upon further reflection, this technique not only symbolises the cyclical nature of the world portrayed in the film, but dodges a few of nasty entanglements associated with copyrighted music. Overall, The Lobster, while undoubtedly eccentric and esoteric, was quite enjoyable to watch in my opinion. Having seen it in the cinema, I was initially confounded as to how many people (mostly contumelious seniors) complained about it and/or walked out. However, that did not ruin my own experience of watching the film; a sign of a very good film."

"paul-allaer","8","2","5","28 May 2016"," One of a kind movie about love (mandatory or prohibited)
","""The Lobster"" (2015 release from Europe; 118 min.) opens with a bang, literally. In the pre-opening credit scene, we see a woman getting out of her car, running into the field, and shooting a donkey (spurring gasps from the theater audience, more on that later). After the opening credits, we get to know David, whose wife has just left him. David is taken to a hotel where he now has 45 days to find a new mate or be transformed into an animal. If it gets that far, he chooses to be a lobster (""because they live to be a hundred, have blue blood in them, and are fertile their entire life""). ""Excellent choice"" responds the hotel manager, adding ""most people choose to be a dog, that's why you see dogs everywhere"". Will David find a mate? Or will he become a lobster? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Greek writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos, who previously gave us the brilliant ""Dogtooth"". This is his debut English language film. Here he brings us a completely original, truly one-of-a-kind, story about love, be it mandatory love (first half of the movie), or prohibited love (second half of the movie). The movie feels strangely dispassionate yet engaging, in particular in the last 45 minutes. Colin Farrell brings the performance of a lifetime as David, your average ""Joe Six Pack"", slight beer belly and all. Even though Rachel Weisz gets second-to-top billing, she doesn't appear until the second half of the movie, but when she finally does, she blows everyone away as ""Short Sighted Woman"". There are many other choice performances, though: check out French actress Léa Seydoux as the ruthless leader of the ""loners"", always on the lookout to detect (and punish--""red kiss"" anyone?) any flirting between the loners. In the opening credits, all the different co-producers seemingly amount to a mini-European Union summit, as LOTS of European countries co-financed this movie. It's almost amazing to me that such an original and let's face it, very unconventional idea was able to garner the necessary financing or was able to convince first rate stars like Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz to sign on to this. But the main thing is that Lanthimos made it happen somehow.<br/><br/>""The Lobster"" made a huge splash at the 2015 Cannes film festival. No idea why it's taken another full year to find its way onto the screen here in the US but better late than never I suppose. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay, but just okay (about 10-12 people). After the initial gasps, the audience settled in and laughed at all the right times. I can't see this playing in theaters a very long time, the movie is too ""weird"" and off-center for that. I happen to think it's one of the most original movies about love I've seen in a very, very long time, and would readily suggest that you check this out, be it in theaters, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""The Lobster"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

","The movie surprises with some awkward truths regarding relationships, mostly exposes in a strange way. It's a dark comedy that captures attention and requires reflection. ""The Lobster"" presents an original idea and a disturbing way of looking at love relationships. Its uniqueness puts the sinister aspects of the movie in an interesting light. The film's message is well delivered through symbolic dialogues which amuse and reveal. It directly attacks society. The metamorphosis of the single people into animals may symbolize the lack of choice and pressure that sometimes society offers and the single person viewed less credible in the world where finding the better half is almost everyone's purpose. An artistic and pessimistic way of seeing love."

","This is sci-fi only in the sense that Brazil was, a way of baring the social wiring under the floorboards with more bluntness than we would accept in real life; allegory, usually a dreary thing. The comedy comes from absurd leaps and reductions in world and feelings.<br/><br/>But it's a treatise that we really get; the mechanization of contact and love, an obsession with courtship, implying an intolerance or fear of being alone. A man who as soon as his wife leaves him is immediately taken to a secluded hotel where single people have to find a partner in 40 days, such are the rules of the city.<br/><br/>Yes, we see people in such circumstances as these reduced to a childlike meekness, wooden displays of human beings. Yes, we see how the process stifles and gives rise to neglect and callousness. A loss of genuine feeling replaced by compulsions and all of this as something we're meant to recognize around us.<br/><br/>Out in the woods exists a society of outcasts, single people who have escaped confines. But we're not shown any antidote among them; rules that forbid romance are as strident and absurd here, another dystopia of thankless freedom. All told we're shown a world bled of truth and a hodge podge of behaviors in its place. Although the world is ordered by rituals, we get to feel the slow collapse of persons, the perversion of truths.<br/><br/>It's the method used to achieve this disarray that I find the most interesting here and seems novel enough. Some filmmakers stage and have the actors convey, beauty or anguish. Others channel through the eye. This one engineers behaviors, tinkering to create tentativeness as the shape of emotions. The actors don't convey, are not supposed to have real access to their person; we note the fumbling as innocent discovery of real emotions.<br/><br/>But now having mentioned all this, questions. There's something resembling love eventually pursued, but is it even close? Do we have use for films that make as if we're hapless victims of a society that prevents us? The film strips down to where the concrete and wirings show but does it put any of it together as a place in which to live? Surely, we're not a mass of foibles. Surely, there are paths that lead out of our neuroses, we spend our lives finding these out.<br/><br/>I guess this will do just fine for viewers who can find some measure of glee in the gloom. It seems like a tentative step at this point but Lanthimos is setting out to carve, which is half the battle. It will be interesting to know with hindsight what this one was prefiguring. Was he fumbling in the discovery of real emotions, a necessary middle step? Or will he turn out to be someone who film after film controls and reduces just like the villains here?"

","There are those who love rules. However, they mostly want others to live by them, not themselves. This is the premise of The Lobster where bizarre rules reign. Among them is a rule that if a spouse dies, then another spouse must be chosen - in a controlled environment and among slim pickings - within 40 days. Failure results in being turned into an animal of your choice. Of course there are exceptions. If you kill someone, you get an extra day. In such an Alice in Wonderland type atmosphere it is only the keepers of such insane rules who thrive.<br/><br/>These rule-keepers rarely have a heart or any empathy for others. Rather, they are the best killers. Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz and John Reilly play characters that are caught up in this nightmare. I loved the theme of the story and the characters, yet I thought it was disjointed, awkward and too far-fetched even for me (a lover of such Kafkaesque settings).

I have to admit that I laughed out loud at several ""inappropriate"" moments. Colin Farrell seemed to be really stretching himself in this role. His performance delighted me as much as when Brad Pitt plays gritty crazy characters in Kalifonia or 12 Monkeys. The reason I appreciate such roles is that they appear, to me, to push an actor's ability to play something quite different than the majority of the roles they are cast in. To me, this demonstrates a higher level of ability. Although the film as a whole was dark and unusual, it certainly held my interest, got me thinking and provided several bursts of laughter.

Meanwhile all the singles in the hotel are regularly organised to hunt for loners - those single people who rebels against the City and live in the woods. For catching a loner, their stint will be extended for one day, but David is not very good at it, the deadline is pressing, he concedes to his proclivity for short- haired woman and chooses a heartless woman (a steely Papoulia) as the last resort, who is the record-holder of the loner-hunting and has no urgency to end up her single status. It is a terrible mistake, eventually David sneaks out of the hotel and plunges into the wood, becomes a loner himself, which brings the film into the second half, the world of loners.<br/><br/>Loners lead by a French woman (Seydoux), they conform to the doctrine where no relationships are allowed among loners, they cannot have sex, cannot dance together, even flirting will be punished by ""red kiss"", it is the exact the other side of the coin from the City, however, David again, is a misfit here, since he falls for a short-sighted loner (Weisz), David is myopic too, their romance develops steadily, they even invent a set of body language only can be understood by themselves, to communicate with each other without being too intimate in front of others, a make-up free Weisz elicits a memorable presence radiant of earnestness and compassion. But the leader finds it out eventually, and deprives the woman of myopia. And then the two decide to flee together and enter the City as a couple, with one big decision for David to take, to test how strong their love is, and after a suspicious long-take, the film ends without revealing what has happened to David, and what's next for the star-crossed lovers.<br/><br/>In spite of the outré setting of the story, unlike the elusive ALPS, the film puts forth a quite comprehensible narrative arc which channelled by a woman's voice-over (later viewers would know it is from the short-sighted woman's journal), and leaves audience hooked in the idiosyncrasy of the concept and the exigency of David (and his lover)'s plight. Relying on dramatic classical pieces, including a smart exploitation of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' WHERE THE WILD ROSES GROW hummed ominously by David; contrasting landscape and scenes of hotel and wood, outskirt and city; highly stylish camera-work from Thimios Bakatakis (slo-motions and long-takes are put into action during crucial moments), Lanthimos' metaphysical methodology of exposing the deep- rooted alienation among human individuals ends up with an impressive high note with THE LOBSTER, it is a slap-in-the-face ridicule about rigid conformism, whether being single or staying as a couple, accepting the anomalies should be the new normal."

","I have known about this movie for quite some time now, but I have always found different reasons to neglect to watch it until now. I always thought that the film looked really weird, which ultimately steered me away from watching it. I finally decided to give it watch, and even though it ended up being far weirder and much darker than I originally expected it to be, I was not pleasantly surprised. The dark humor and extremely cringe-inducing interactions between the characters was incredibly amusing, and was something that you do not see very often in cinema. I also really liked the unique plot of the film, even though it could be confusing at times. The entire cast was great as well, and they all added a lot to the film in their own ways. There were only a few problems that I really had with the film. One being that it was a little long, and really dragged on at times. I think that a few scenes could have been removed to prevent that from happening. The only other issue that I had was the ending. It felt a little bit rushed, and then it ends with a bit of a cliffhanger, which I was not a particularly big fan of. All in all though, it is definitely a film that I would recommend to you if you like original ideas, great acting, and clever dark humor."

"BadChristian","7","1","2","23 June 2019"," A unique and interesting yet dull film
","I feel like no matter how many time I watch this film, I'm never going to
""get it"". I can see the commentary on modern relationships and such, but so much of it just doesn't make sense and I'm not sure it's supposed to. The less you now about The Lobster going in, the better the experience will be, so I'll keep it brief and spoiler free. The biggest things that the movie has going for it is the story, which is insane and for every question it half answers, I have three more. The movie is essentially two distinct parts and while I loved learning about how the world worked in the first half, the second half slowed down and stopped addressing my questions. There is too much that they won't explain and instead try and lead you on to another thing. Beyond the very interesting story, there really isn't much else going on. Every character talks in the same emotionless monotone, which sometimes adds to the very dry humor and other times just gets annoying. ""Dry"" is a good descriptor of the whole movie. The camera shots are dry and static, the dialog is dry, every character has basically the same dry personality, the score is dry classical music, everything is ""dry"". I liked the story and occasionally found it mildly funny, but every scene left me wanting more. By the half way point, I was disinterested with the characters and much more intrigued by the world they live in and we learn so little about it. The Lobster is one of those movies that can't possibly find financial success, because it's hard to market to a specific audience. It's listed as a comedy, but it's not really funny, especially for a standard audience. The static monotone acting from everyone got on my nerves and I assume a general audience would find it even more grating. It's a very unique story, but the way it's told puts way too much effort into being ""quirky"" and ""wacky""."

"aractos-890-607133","5","1","2","12 June 2019"," A visual concept should not be confused with quality or originality
","--The Lobster is pretty aesthetically pleasing. But that is it's strongest point. The atmosphere is heavy, unpleasant, reminiscent of Dogtooth with it's long shots where few things transpire and the tension builds, and any human interactions are severely disjointed. However, Dogtooth had an internal logic which became apparent from the beginning of the movie and remained consistent up until the end. The Lobster on the other hand does a very poor job of describing it's inner mechanisms.<br/><br/>--I've tried searching for reviews of this movie to see why it is so highly acclaimed, and they mostly seem to be revolving around the statement ""oh, it's a smart critique of how our society views human interactions."" However, where is the foundation for this statement? The Lobster seems to have been designed to jam a few superficial observations down the viewers throat, but each of these have been previously explored deeply in better works of film or literature. It is a series of superficial and vague statements which are not interconnected by any internal logic within the work itself.<br/><br/>--The problem with this is that any set of images can be then interpreted by the viewer while searching for depth, but this does not mean that the movie has any actual depth. Which it doesn't. The characters have all the complexity of cardboard cutouts. This left room for the society in which they live to be a character of its own, but this opportunity is not seized, as the society itself is not elaborated upon in any way. The central source of all tension within the movie are its society's rules, and since their role in society, or the motivation to create them, all remain without explanation, they come off as trite and arbitrary.<br/><br/>--In the end, this movie felt rather humorless, pointless and left me hungry for substance. I firmly believe there is a lot of ""art"" in the world which thrives on people ""not getting it"" and then being scared of seeming foolish to those who do ""get it"". Stop this nonsense. There are wonderful, symbolic works of art out there. Go enjoy them and never praise this movie again. I would include suggestions, but the list would be too long and then this would no longer be a review for The Lobster."

After 40 minutes, I realized I was grimacing reflexively. After nearly an hour and a great deal of vocalized ""whys"" and ""buts"" and witnessing horrible attempts at humor, I paused playback, saw that I was barely past the halfway point (in utter disbelief because it felt like an eternity), and couldn't turn it off fast enough.
I looked at my husband and said, ""I hate this film.""

","I'm reading a lot of the reviews which are mixed. I thought it was me but I do not think so. This movie drags along trying to be funny or maybe meaningful. I didn't find either.
The plot in the end really makes no sense at all. A utopian society? Really? Finding a mate, hunting or dying or being turned into an animal? Or hunting others for what really?
Nothing to speak of is explained and you slog along trying to find meaning in this film and I found none. I'm a big film buff but this was neither funny or meaningful in any way. That being said, I would take a pass on this film unless you are bored and have nothing else to occupy your brain or your time.
Others found meaning and sense behind it but me, nothing, zero. No humor, no social meaning. What are we reduced to hunting our significant others then killing them or someone else? What and why? You decide whatever this movie means. Some equated it to the The Grand Budapest Hotel, that was funny and you could follow along with the silliness but this, no.
Take a pass, please.Colin Farrell, you are much better than this."
"mozeg0d","6","1","2","26 January 2019"," Lost Opportunity to Explore a Brilliant Idea
","I totally understand the artistic value of this film. I loved the idea behind it as well as the visual and score. I loved noticing that whenever we'd see people in the woods we'd also see a variety amount of animals walking behind them, indicating that many of those animals were formally people who weren't able to find their partner. I thought that was a pretty decent sight gag. I also thought the classical music during certain scenes was a nice touch; whenever it'd intensify or slow down I felt as though I was feeling the emotions of the characters on screen unravel. The fact that the majority of the music was repetitive was quite funny which I'm assuming is what they were aiming for. The shading/lighting of the film was beautiful as well, and the acting was quite good.
However, as far as the plot itself, it sort of felt...dull in most cases. In the beginning, it's very clear what the motivation was. You must find a partner within 45 days otherwise you will become an animal of your choosing. As the film went on, you begin to learn that there are ""loners"", who are people that refuse to become an animal after their 45 days were up (or people who decided to escape the hotel). Up until that point, I thought the movie was going brilliantly. It wasn't until David ended up being part of the loners did I feel like the writers were having a bit of a challenge on where they wanted the movie to end. As a viewer, I assumed that either way it went, we'd come to find that someone would be an animal or in love. And because of how heavily they pushed the rule of ""you will be an animal if you don't find love"", I began to believe that we'd ultimately end up with a sad ending where David becomes a lobster. Frankly, I would much rather prefer a bittersweet ending like that rather than what we got. It left me wondering...what was the point of having people turn into animals in the first place? I really believe that this idea would've been absolutely perfect had they done a better job at it.
Towards the end of the movie, we are left with a cliffhanger on whether or not David blinded himself for the woman who became blind after breaking the Loners' rule. It left me completely unsatisfied. Not only was I expecting a more psychological twist, but now I was faced with a question from the director: What do you think he did? The answer is simply...I don't know. I would like to think that perhaps he chose not to do it and instead went back to the hotel where he decides to become the lobster he mentioned earlier because it seemed too important to him for the ending to be left the way it did. If they'd explored that idea more, I think I would've enjoyed it better. Overall, I do recommend this film. It's not a complete waste of time. Its aesthetic is to be boring and stiff to portray the way David feels throughout it, which I find interesting. There are probably points that I missed or something that completely went over my head with this movie, and for that purpose being, I see no reason why anyone shouldn't watch this film."
"livhh","10","1","2","1 January 2019"," Perfect
","Amazing metaphor.
It draws parallels between the absurdity of the arbitrary relationship norms and rules that exist in its world and our world. It asks bigger philosophical questions about the nature of relationships: what love actually is, what marriage actually means, what it means to be free (he was neither free being forced to be in a couple, nor was he free as a 'loner' - both sides were equally oppressive) - this begs the question of why we have to be in conventional relationships and not acknowledge changes in relationships. It sheds light on the very black and white nature of society's expectations.
He remarks in the first half something about ""is it easier to pretend you dont care when you do, than to pretend that you care when you dont"".
I thought it was interesting that in the whole movie there was a strong theme of lack of loyalty. Most interestingly, rachel (1) tells the loner leader that they could have blinded him instead of her and (2) at the end she lies to him about it heightening your senses in an attempt to make him do it - and when he responds ""i know"" (he has seen her mistake a tennis ball for a kiwi fruit) i think he sort of realises the flawed nature of their relationship - the only relationship in the movie that was momentarily real.
In the end, i think she doesnt want to be blind and alone and turned into an animal, and it begs the question that if she really loved him, would she want him to cut out his eyes? I think the answer is no.
This movie will annoy you if you need a resolution, as this is more of a fascinating exploration of this fictional world."

"mshackletonchavez","8","1","2","21 December 2018"," Lanthimos' Best Film To Date
","This is a most unique feature, brimming with wonderful direction, cinematography, screenplay and performances. A showcase of Yorgos Lanthimos' unique method.<br/><br/>There is much to praise, first and foremost comes the screenplay and direction from of which the rest of the glory comes from. Yorgos Lanthimos delivers what can only be described as absurd, but truly never feels 'cringed' or forced. This film has incredible tonal consistency, and its entire band of emotion is delivered to perfection. The dialogue within is very unique, every character feels awkward within their own skin, and highly intriguing dynamics then play out. Yet it doesn't feel bad, it is silly, but works extremely well. Once again Lanthimos delivers the best from his actors, none of the performances fall on the weak side, and with so many talents here and so many differing angles of character and the variety of emotion, it is truly a wonder that they all came out to the quality in which they did. The comedy feels mischievous and yet some may call it distasteful, I believe it compliments and feed the tone of the feature. As a matter of fact, I was so enthralled by the comedic elements that I had started coughing on three separate occasions during the feature, it truly is a funny experience, yet is deadpan but not boring. It doesn't run out of steam, it flows at a steady pace.<br/><br/>The cinematography of this film is stellar, having read into it, it turns out this film was not shot on film (Due to no labs being present in Ireland), and thus they used a very specific combination of lenses to deliver a grained, classical and vibrant look. The colours are very deep, it feels not 'vibrant' in the sense of an explosion of colour, bit vibrant in its depth, it feels real, the colours contrast and match in all the right places. In addition to this, most of the feature was shot under natural light, this compliments the tone of the film in a most unexpected way. It feels more raw, and has greater depth in all the right places. In addition to this, The way in which Yorgos Lanthimos and Thimios Bakatakis have created the angles used in the feature is truly unique, they repeat the same angle when in the same place, indicating the monotony of the characters lives. The angles are highly creative, creating a unique image, when in tandem with the colouration, it truly has a unique picture quality and perspective.<br/><br/>Another great strength of this feature is its performances, first is Colin Farrell as David. For the longest time I didn't like Colin Farrell as an actor, but this has truly changed my opinion of him. His performance as the silently heartbroken, yet pragmatic and funny David is really magnetic. He doesn't hold back in any aspects, yet the performance is not over the top, it is subdued where it has to be and is highly enthralling and entertaining to watch. Seeing him step out of the usual drunk irishman role, and into something highly unique and so successful was a delight.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also wonderful. Ben Whishaw as John was great to see, along with John C Riley, they give David some backbone in the first half and help to prop up his character which is rather quiet in the first half. Léa Seydoux as the loner leader was great, she appears in far too few roles, and delivered the slightly deranged and power crazed leader very well. A great antagonist who yet the main character rely on. Ariane Labed as the Maid and Angeliki Papoulia as Heartless Woman were both great, seeing them in another Lanthimos movie was fantastic and here they play upon their characteristic strengths of strange, somewhat evil and some might say cruel ladies within the narrative. They also deliver some of the comedic highlights of the film which one must only see to truly understand. Olivia Colman was as wonderful as ever, the sadistic yet friendly hotel manager is truly what begins the absurdity of the feature was was delivered extremely well by Colman.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz as the shortsighted woman who falls in love with David was a great presence. She narrates the majority of the feature, though we do not first encounter her in physical from until much later into the film. She was masterfully performed, her and Colin Farrell were well matched, and her witty and obtuse character was really a needed balance to Farrell's character.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I did feel that in some parts the film dragged on a little too far. For instance the comedy sometimes went on a little too long, however I understand Lanthimos' decision to portray it in this way, its meant to be awkward and strange. Yet in some parts I understood this and yet I felt it went on a little too far. In addition to this, most of the film is devoid of music, while I also understand this decision, I felt as of it was somewhat lacking in some areas, although this did not impede upon my enjoyment of the feature.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a truly great film. One of the ultimate, if not perhaps the, blend of comedy, absurdism and dystopia. Yorgos Lanthimos has done it again and is truly writing his name as one of the best filmmakers currently working, due to his masterful way of constructing a film from all aspects, most notably acting, cinematography, direction and screenwriting which are all distinct and unique to his own expression. 8/10"

","This was a very interesting movie because I do not recall seeing anything quite like it. The idea that people would be turned into animals for failing to find partners is as original as it is absurd. There is simply no reason for any society t be set up this way. If anything, due to the treat of overpopulation, people in a society would be more likely be encouraged to be loners. Even in a society where there not enough kids, people would not need to have partners or be couples to procreate. The movie simply makes no sense whatsoever but somehow I kept watching it to the very end. So,obviously the people who made it did something right. However, the ending was so insane I had to deduct a lot of points for that. They had hardly nothing in common before she was blinded but they clicked as a couple. Plus, their clicking as a couple had nothing to do with them both not being able to see well. After all, they relied on their vision to communicate without words. Shared poor vision was not essential to their relationship. So, it made no sense for him to blind himself because she was blind. It especially made no sense for him to stab himself in the eyes with a steak knife when he could have had the same doctor who blinded his woman blind him. Hell, he probably would have felt obligated to do it free of charge. Also, I feel the movie dragged on too long. Nevertheless, it was interesting, and hence my rating."

","The film didn't specify the year - so you can say it is a story about either future or past, or whenever the time you think is reasonable. But funny enough, I really like the way the director sets it.<br/><br/>The technology they use to turn human into animal, and the way they operate the hotel, or, the social system, make you feel like it is from the future. Plus, the way people talk in the film (unemotional - in fact, I find that it is the director's intention to have characters act that way to make the film look surreal) gives you a stronger ""future"" feeling.<br/><br/>However, if you look at the facilities - the entire hotel, the yachts, people's dresses - everything looks so old fashioned, like it is from 70s. Especially the way how Colin expressed David - serious, cautious, introverted - literally a dogmatic guy from decades ago.<br/><br/>I believe there is a reason the director designed it that way. The conflicts more or less satirized the advanced technology versus backwards social system and people's cognition. <br/><br/>There is another conflict in the film - couples and loners. Both use extreme approaches to maintain and manage its systems. However, there is no right and wrong side, it is just how you choose. Ironically, David (Colin) is always on the wrong side. He was a loner in the hotel, and fell in lover in the woods. What a sarcasm.<br/><br/>In the end, what would be in front of them? Would David finally sacrifice to fit into the system? And, would the system accept them? To me, it's an open question too."

Is it a social commentary? Is it an extreme love story? Is it an allegory?<br/><br/>I can live with the disturbing images and ideas because I expected them beforehand.

","I would completely concur this movie ranks near the top of absurdist or oddest films of the decade. The premises of this dystopian, yet contemporary, film are never explained nor defended--they simply are, which can be frustrating when the internal ""logic"" of the bizzaro world collapse. It reminds me of some type of comic television shows where anything is allowed for the sake of a joke, even if it means, for example, characters dying and being brought back to life to setup the next laugh line. Nothing is spared to keep the viewer in a state of bafflement. As with any avant-garde type of art, the defenders often ""see"" things that simply aren't there, in my view, and this film is also such a Rorschach test.<br/><br/>In addition to the lack of coherence, I found the wanton cruelty and violence to be quite unnerving, yet I have a weak stomach for such things. I know not to see slasher-type films for this reason, yet this film gave no warning that it might not be suitable for sensitive eyes.<br/><br/>I give it three stars for technical achievement and to prove I'm not a total Philistine and want directors/writers to try new things."

","Yorgos Lanthimos delves deeper into his realm of weirdness to portrait in ""The lobster"" one of the most shocking, distressing and yet meaningful dystopian future the industry of cinema has thrown at us in decades. Does one really have the right to choose when he is denied the right to choose not to choose?<br/><br/>No room for singles in this dystopian city out of Lanthimos' mind. No rights for them but a last chance to fix their malfunction, to set themselves right and find a partner. After all, there's no safe stroll without a partner, no dinner without risks without a partner, no being human without a partner. Its either marriage or a trip back to being an animal.<br/><br/>But it is not just the oppressive atmosphere of the re-educating hotel Lanthimos crafts the best. It is the demonizing of both sides he delivers with utmost skill, showing no right choice but two opposite views stubbornly and cruelly carried through no matter the consequences. David must pick a side knowing both are wicked and wrong, and with all certainty that none will end well for him.Farrel delivers a great performance, topping an all around good performance from the whole cast.<br/><br/>It is perhaps the subtle cruelty beneath all the glamour and glitter, the non-graphic violence delivered through oppressive peer pressure and witty dialogue that surprises the most and makes ""The lobster"" so enjoyable.

","As when we read Shirley Jackson's the Lottery or Animal Farm, we are taken to another reality with The Lobster. If our reality is that we must be in a relationship and the only relationship allowable is one where we have something in common with our significant other, then the rules of our society will reflect that certainty. If we are in opposition to that and are members of the underground fighting this reality then the opposite is true. There should be no relationships and the authority will discourage that. The reactions of the characters to different life situations reflects those certainties and their solutions to problems confirms their opposite dogmas. Spoilers hereafter. When the main character's brother (now a dog) is killed by his fiancé, her actions are logical in this new reality we are visiting. She must have someone with whom she has something in common. He has said he is heartless, so she tests him with the killing of the dog. The certainty that he must be heartless makes her test logical. On the other hand, those who have taken the opposite view must blind the girl who needs a near sighted mate. It's fun to go back to high school with a Lord of the Flies analysis. So, if this was an interesting challenge for you, it might just be that the Lobster will be your cup of tea."
"howard.schumann","8","2","7","17 April 2016"," Holds up a mirror and lets us see our reflection
","The premise of Yorgos Lanthimos' latest absurdist film (or should we simply say ""absurd"") The Lobster is that those who are unmarried have forty five days to choose a mate or are turned into animals. This is something my mother might have said but even she would have offered the possibility of clemency. Co-written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, the film continues the same style as Dogtooth with wooden characters that are tight-lipped, undeveloped emotionally and uncertain about how to handle their desire for companionship. Like those in Charlie Kaufman's animated satire Anomalisa, everyone has the same robotic presence, perhaps a commentary on the way people relate to each other these days. <br/><br/>The film stars Colin Farrell as David, a dumpy-looking middle aged man whose wife thought better of their relationship and split. In the world he finds himself in, hopefully sometime far in the future or on another planet, it is against the law to be single, though we don't learn whether it is a felony or a misdemeanor. In any event, David is checked into a hotel with other unfortunates who must choose to register as either hetero or homosexual and must decide on the kind of animal they would like to become if they cannot find a match. It is a serviceable place to spend one's last days as a human, but it is not the Grand Budapest. <br/><br/>Unlike most who choose to become a dog, David wants to be a lobster because they live one hundred years and remain fertile, though that's really not an asset when you are thrown into boiling hot water, but I guess if you like water, why not? The people are friendly sorts but are not big on warmth or caring. The hotel manager (Olivia Coleman) and her husband (Garry Mountaine) are likable enough as is the maid (Ariane Labed) but David hits it off mostly with two hotel guests, ""the limping man"" (Ben Whishaw) and ""the lisping man"" (John C. Reilly). The drive is to find a match, someone who shares the same physical characteristics with you, such as a bloody nose or a hatred for other people such as one known as ""The Heartless Woman"" (Angeliki Papoulia). She's a real sweetheart.<br/><br/>Naturally, you may have to work at being heartless to gain her approval, though many people already have considerable experience. Aside from Las Vegas type galas with the manager and her husband providing the entertainment, the only approved playtime activity is to go hunting in the nearby forest to subdue and capture those poor souls designated as the ""Loners."" These are the dreaded single people, those without a partner that they can spend their lives fighting with. Neither the Loners nor the hotel hotties are big on sex but talking to each other is okay, at least if you don't call for a political revolution which seems to be in the air these days. Since masturbation is frowned upon and is rewarded by having your hands stuck in a toaster, there is little else to do but talk. <br/><br/>To the ominous strains of an original score by Johnnie Burn, David finally says enough is enough with this rot and escapes into the woods where he joins up with the Loners but finds out that they have rules which are just as rigid. Guided by their uptight leader (Lea Seydoux), who is so cold that butter wouldn't melt in her mouth, they go to the opposite extreme, prohibiting any attempt at a love relationship. When David meets Rachel Weisz, however, the first sign of something positive emerges but their forbidden relationship takes the film into even more difficult and disturbing territory, not recommended for small children.<br/><br/>Lanthimos' first English-language film evokes strong reactions from viewers by simply holding up a mirror and letting us see our reflection or, perhaps even more disturbing, sense the direction in which we are headed. It is not a pretty sight and The Lobster is not a pleasant experience unless you are a blind man looking in a dark room for a black cat that isn't there. While ""dystopian"" films such as this can be looked upon as a warning or cautionary tale, the question must be asked whether, in relentlessly envisioning the future as taking place in a bleak and lifeless world, they might actually be helping to create it."
"BrendanMichaels","10","2","7","1 April 2016"," One of the best films of 2016
","The Lobster is one of the most realistic depictions in satire of relationships nowadays. It never takes a side but let's you choose for yourself. Most people will laugh at the ingenious satire and come out of it a bit happy but reflecting on what happened in the film. Others will watch this and think of it as one of the darkest films they've seen because of how it hits the nail on the perception of what others think people need to be happy.<br/><br/>The Lobster stars Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux, John C. Reilly and Ben Whishaw in a dark dystopian comedy where people who are single go to and hook up with someone. If they don't then they become an animal of their choice. This is by far the weirdest movie of 2016. What makes it even more hilarious is how everyone acts normal like this just happens to everyone. The dry humor becomes extremely messed up to a point. To some it might be excessive but it never goes beyond a point. There was a part in the movie that was so dark I had to pause the movie and think about what just happened. It's plot feels stiff but in a playful way that fits with the characters.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell hasn't had the greatest time recently. While I love the actor he's gotten a lot of criticism for his recent role in True Detective Season 2. While I personally really liked Season 2 (That's for another time.) and can see the flaws the best part of Season 2 was by far Colin Farrell. Farrell is great in this film. This is probably his best role since In Bruges. He plays a character that is a mix of Takashi Shimura's character in Ikiru and Bill Murray's character in Lost in Translation. Farrell plays the character brilliantly. He plays his character with an almost emotionless tone. While some say that this is pretty bad acting really it shows how desensitized the people are in this world. Yorgos Lanthimos is known for direct his actors in a very stifled way. It works as it shows the desensitized world the characters live in.<br/><br/>The Lobster is one of the best films of 2016. It's dystopian setting had traces of 1984 and helps shine on how relationships are treated so black and white in the real world. If you don't find the film hilarious or funny you'll find a great drama about a man's inner turmoil with his life."
"hou-3","5","2","7","17 March 2016"," Disappointing
","In the last few days I have watched Olympus has fallen, Me, Earl and the dying girl, and The Lobster. I thought The Lobster the weakest of the three. Does this show that I prefer blockbusters and indie movies to high concept art-house? Not at all, if anything the opposite is true. But I thought the first two were excellent contributions to their genres, firing on all cylinders, while the third underperformed. The Lobster has a terrific cast and it is beautifully filmed with lovely music - though I could have done with less of the staccato Shostakovich. But a film like this needs intellectual clout and the idea driving The Lobster is thin. It simply doesn't sustain a two hour movie, and by deliberately presenting its characters as emotionally distanced, the film denies itself the chance to engage your heart as well as your head. In comparison with a film like Never let me go it is a cold and empty experience. It is beautiful to watch and occasionally funny but that's not enough."

","As he sat in his theatre seat, he didn't know what to expect. He'd seen the trailer a few times, but it hadn't really told him enough to know what The Lobster was about besides that it featured a hotel for lonely people who'd be turned into animals if they didn't find a partner in time. He figured it'd be a satire on relationships and it turned out it was. He'd also find out The Lobster would be one of those films he'd never want to see again for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>The film started with a woman driving along the countryside in the rain. She pulled over and shot a donkey, then drove away, leaving the other donkey baffled and slowly waddling over to the dead donkey. At first, he thought that it looked very realistic and anticipated a credits message that said no animals were harmed during the making of this picture. Then he got to thinking about the film's theme--people turning into animals--and he realized the donkey must've been her unfaithful husband or something. We then cut to David (Colin Farrell) entering The Hotel with his brother who stayed at the same hotel, but didn't find a partner and was turned into the animal of his choice. When asked what kind of animal he'd like to be, David replied, 'a lobster'. David is told how The Hotel works and so began his life there, searching for love.<br/><br/>After the film had concluded, he was left with a dilemma: he knew on the one hand this was quite a smart film, but also that the strength of its satire was also the source of its lack of likability and lack of replay value. He knew the film was at its satirical best when it played with language. The characters would say what they meant and meant what they'd say, but the bluntness, straightforwardness and 'dry' way of conversing made it quite funny. It was all meant to parody every aspect of relationships, from conversational subjects to how we view each other, from how people select a suitable partner to the first flirtations. This film is almost merciless, he thought, merciless in how it dissects people and relationships.<br/><br/>Yet, he thought, this type of satire comes at a price. Not only does it make the film come across as unlikable and lacking in replay value, this is exacerbated by the film's length which is too long for the film's subject matter and style. It's obvious the film's promoting healthy relationships (and all that entails) with its parodies, but you still have to sit through all of the director's Variations on a Theme, so to speak. And that ending. Ah, that nauseating ending. Regarding the ending, he thought to himself, 'you know, I remember a time when 'love hurts' referred to 'mental hurt', not physical hurt, but that's just me'.<br/><br/>He didn't regret seeing The Lobster. At least, he thought he didn't. He had always valued honesty and authenticity above all else and that's what the film was going for in the end. By exaggerating and parodying the negative (e.g. unhealthy relationships), you emphasize the positive (e.g. healthy relationships). It's just that the film's repeating the same point over and over occasionally made the film a bit of a drag.<br/><br/>ps: if you're wondering about the writing style, then you obviously haven't seen The Lobster."

A very weird surrealist future revolving around couples, love, being single, and the basic premise of finding someone just as screwed up as you. The script and idea were well written, sarcastic with a bit of dry humor. The production quality was very solid. My one and only knock of this movie was ""the constant talking like you are a robot."" They need to not read straight off the cue cards. Maybe that was their vision I don't know, but it seemed to drag the movie down. It wasn't like that for the whole movie and definitely not all the characters. But for a few it was very odd and made the movie seem like it had poor acting.

It's one of those movies that's so different with it's story and visuals that it's quite intriguing to watch. The cinematography was tremendous and the movie isn't predicable, as many times it takes a different turn for the best. Yorgos Lanthimos knows what he's doing and I can tell what he was going for when it came to the self aware moments. Every choice Lanthimos made in this movie when it came to the acting was done on purpose, as it fitted well in this unusual world that these people lived in.

There is even a hint of animal farm in there as well with all the crazy animals appearing in certain scenes(including a huge pig).

"jkikianis","9","2","9","19 December 2015"," Quirky, Dark Comedy; not for everyone
","This film tackles a variety of interesting themes through the lenses of this strange and fairly ridiculous dystopian future. The basic premise for the film is that in a dystopian future any single person in society is brought to a hotel where they have 45 days to find a partner or be transformed into the animal of their choosing and be released into the wild. Of course, with that premise the film must have a humor about itself to work and it does. This film from beginning to end has a well balanced sprinkle of dark and depressing moments with this outlook on a future dystopia. <br/><br/>While being a rather dark story the film has an understanding of it's own ridiculousness and uses that as the inspiration of the dark humor in almost every scene. While being a very odd film, it says very intelligent things about human behavior and the nature of relationships. Much of the film is an analysis of romance, love, and what a genuine relationship really is. The actors in the film have a lot required of them and they totally deliver. Colin Farrell gives a great performance in the lead role. Due to the nature of their situation and society the characters often have to have a simple complexity to them. We never for a second are questioning the thoughts our motivations of a single character. Every character in the movie is for moments of the film playing a role for the surrounding characters in order to get something they want. For that reason, I saw that it was important that I knew what the characters were thinking. With that said, I found that the frequent voice over by Rachel Weisz to be somewhat tedious and annoying. I wanted to get a feel for these characters and this world and I found my immersion being interrupted by a pointless segment of voice over. <br/><br/>This film has very complex storytelling it needs to accomplish and it does so with intricate detail and a clever narrative arch that goes in unexpected directions. There are dozens of moments in the film in which a random out of place animal will drift in the background for a single shot. The style of this film both technically and structurally often reminded me of films like The Master (2012). This film could have easily become hollywoodized and become a movie about a societal revolution but the film keeps the quirkiness and humor and maintains the focus on the situations surrounding Colin Farrell's character of David. This film is so strange in its presentation, in the performances, and in the very dark humor but it still somehow manages to be emotionally and intellectually captivating. Many viewers won't be able to engage with this film which is neither a flaw of the viewer or the film. This movie has a very unique sensibility and style that many people will find off-putting. I, personally, fully bought into this world and these characters and I will be excited to revisit this film again."

","All the nonsensical violence of a Clockwork Orange, and the oddity factor of a Lynch movie.<br/><br/>Most characters in this movie are somehow cold, unfeeling and shallow narcissistic sociopaths, psychopaths, but all have a robotic autistic quality. Some of the characters seem to be altruistic at times, but they are shallow and self-serving gestures that are merely to gain something in return.<br/><br/>It is clearly a satire on the pressures of society and the human condition. How we are all indoctrinated from birth into these crazy cultures to accept the clothes we should wear, the behaviors we should follow and the food we should eat, religion, nationalism, about how these societal norms are actually insane. How our lives are warped by the artificial pressures created by societies and the self-interested ways people interact within society, often failing to do the right thing, but following the madness and doing callous things because of societal norms, convenience or fighting for their own self-preservation at the expense of others, or simply doing evil if they think they can get away with it.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing are good, as is the acting, the message is somewhat absurd and abstract in its presentation and the film not particularly enjoyable as entertainment. If you like the style and the message of the satire the movie might work for you and give you a few chuckles, however if you were to watch it in a bad mood, or with the wrong expectations you may end up hating it.

","After seeing 'The Lobster' I have no doubt that Yorgos Lanthimos is one of the most remarkable film directors living and creating today. Each of his films shocks and disturbs, in each one there are copious doses of absurdity and cruelty. These extravagant and extreme elements are not gratuite as they start from real-world situations (or from history as in his latest film) and amplify them to grotesque and nightmares. The nightmares of the Greek director's films are our very existence, or what it could become. 'The Lobster' is among the Lanthimos' movies I've seen, the best structured and the clearest in message. A mute and tragic scream about the dangers of social and family engineering, about the emptiness of our lives and of the relationships between people.<br/><br/>The story takes place in the near future, or maybe it's not even the future. Life in couples is the only legal form of existence. Those who do not have or lose their pair are sent to an institution that looks like a luxury hotel under strict control, where they divide their time between finding the right pair, participating in propaganda-educational activities and hunting animals. However, the animals (important as in all of Lanthimos's films) are actually just ex-humans, because if loners do not find their pair in 45 days (plus or minus a few days won or lost in the hunting games) they are entering the 'transformation rooms' and turned into the animal of their choice. When the hero manages to escape, he discovers the world of the opposants, only in dystopia as in dystopia, the opponents are also fanatics, extremists from the lonely side, any connection between them being also cruelly punished. Falling in love leads to tragedy and happiness is not possible in any of the sides of this dark world.<br/><br/>The execution is impeccable. As in all the films of Yorgos Lanthimos, we deal with a world whose rules are only apparently familiar to us. The motives of the actions of the characters are often shrouded in mystery. Emotions are controlled by the laws of a society in which fear has become the main resort. Colin Farrell performs one of his best roles, succeeding in rendering the lack of emotional capabilities and the fear of the absurd and the inevitable that is going to happen with remarkable discretion. Bizarre and absurd seem to dominate the world described in this movie, a universe in which Beckett meets Hitchcock, but is our society so far away from it?"

","""The Lobster"" is certainly an off-beat dark comedy and satire. The dystopian depiction of state-enforced couplings and the equally rigid renegade singles is rather simplistic, but the absurdity of it all is quite amusing. In it, those not already bonded to a romantic partner are forced to check into a hotel with other singles, whereupon they have 45 days to pair up or be surgically transformed into the lower animal of their choice (hence the title). Indeed, David (Colin Farrell) brings his brother, who is now a dog, along with him. Hotel guests--or, rather, inmates--also have the chance to extend their stays by slaying the renegade singles, who like other ""uncivilized"" animals inhabit the woods. To encourage the marriages, the hotel performs parables on a stage for the guests (a woman saving a man from choking at dinner, and the man protecting the woman from being raped on a walk) and enforce symbolic punishments (on the first day, inmates have one arm tied behind their backs). Punishments for other offenses, along with those applied by the loners in the forest, have the flare of the Code of Hammurabi or Biblical laws of retaliation. A man who masturbates--a decidedly singular act--in the hotel has the masturbatory hand burned in a toaster. Likewise, acts requiring a partner are similarly punished by the loners, whereas masturbation is accepted.<br/><br/>""The Lobster"" is most amusing while occupying the hotel; whereas, it threatens to derail into a self-contradictory celebration of coupling in the woods when David meets Rachel Weisz's character, who up until then had been providing monotone narration. Their shared short-sightedness (note the use of this term instead of ""near-sighted"") marks them to be together, just as one's defining characteristic--in a society that reduces one to be identified by their limp, nose bleeds, lisps, sociopathy or what have you--required one to find a mate with the same trait at the hotel. Fortunately, however, writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos and company don't settle for such a cop out of affirming the state-repressed individuality in rom-com banality. The acting remains intentionally stilted and the characters entirely unsophisticated. As the pun with the main couple's sight underscores, this is a world where an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."

","Made by the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, there is no wonder that ""The Lobster"" makes you feel completely uncomfortable and uneasy, showing off the director's script writing techniques and unique style. The plot centres around a dystopian future, where single people are placed in a hotel and given 45 days to find a romantic partner or otherwise they will be turned into animals. Starring Colin Farrell as a newly single man trying to find a partner in order to remain human, after failing to do so, he decides to flee and become a loner - who the people in the hotel hunt, which extends their stay in the hotel.<br/><br/>With an absurd fictional storyline, the film delivers an interesting premise, criticizing the ridiculousness of forcing someone to fall in love due to common interests, or forcing someone to get married, being a common practice. Commenting on the social pressure that is put on the adults, along with the notion of putting people into boxing, not allowing bi-s well as not allowing shoes that are between sizes.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of the director's works; however, I try to remain unbiased when judging the work. The content along with the plot of the movie throws a lot of people off because of the ridiculous concepts, however it is in that ridicule that the director exposes the real life flaws of different cultures and social activities, such as critiques of marriage. The film is shot with a lot of thought put into it, the shots are well framed and show off the breath-taking locations of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Collin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, along with the other cast members add to the film greatly."

Everything rolls along with its own logical progression but all is nonsense. This reminds me of the late 50s/early 60s Theatre of the Absurd, spine tinglingly confrontational plays that might have triggered some base connection with long distant animal past but looked crazy. There may even be a nod to Ionesco's 1959 play Rhinoceros in The Lobster. Dogtooth (2009) was difficult to watch because it was so disturbing and understandable, whilst remaining horrific. Here, particularly when we go out into the woods and real connection with reality seems diminished and it becomes too hard to relate to the terrible goings on. Assured direction but ultimately uninvolving."

The problem is that these directors use certain framing, lighting, slow motion etc, and certain narrative techniques for a reason. They are there to tell you something, they set up some emotional connection, they tell you about a character, they set a mood important for the story, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Without going into spoilers, there is no point to many things in the movie.

The movie is really dark, and manages to have a both cynical worldview and naive dialogue. Mostly, the characters talk to each other like they only know of ""love"" from books and movies, almost as if they were children. In the closest the movie gets to (what's considered) real love, it's hilariously non-verbal.<br/><br/>What I think the movie is getting at, is that people expect love to happen by itself. You will find someone that will match you, in a sense. Complete you. Either this, or live a love life that is a lie. The alternative to this, is that you have to work for love, and sacrifice for it. You might not find someone that matches you, but if both parties work at it, you can still find love. Or something like that.<br/><br/>The performances are great, and the movie is hilariously dark.

","Yorgos Lanthimos disturbed the hell out of me with ""Dogtooth,"" his Academy-Award nominated film from 2010, and I still can't get that cinematic mind f**k out of my head. Now he returns with another provocation, and while certainly giving my wife and I something to chat about afterwards, doesn't make the same impact that he did with his previous film.<br/><br/>""The Lobster"" is billed as a dark comedy, and certainly the premise sounds like a bit of absurd surrealism: single people are taken into custody and sent to a hotel where they must fall in love within a certain number of days or turn into the animal of their choice. There are all sorts of rules in place within the hotel as well as punishments for breaking them. Outside of the hotel, a group of resistance fighters have created their own little society of single people, and impose as strict punishments for those caught falling in love as the hotel does for those who remain single. The whole thing is presented as a nightmarish alternate reality to the one we live in; as in the world created in ""Dogtooth,"" everything is slightly off-kilter and out of step with the world as we know it, yet familiar enough to make us uncomfortable that it so closely resembles the one we live in.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with ""The Lobster"" is the inconsistency of tone. I never knew from one scene to the next if Lanthimos was striving and failing at black comedy, or whether I was supposed to be taking everything at face value. There's a lot going on in the film thematically to make it resonate strongly with the troubled times in which we live -- themes of totalitarian government, intolerance of differing lifestyles, cultural obsessions with placing people into easily identifiable categories, the absurdity of trying to manufacture love in this age of ""The Bachelor"" -- but unfortunately the languid, monotonous rhythm of the movie undermines its examination of any of these topics. The actors, many of them usually very good -- like Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux, and John C. Reilly -- are directed to walk through the film in a deadpan haze. This maybe was an attempt by Lanthimos to establish an ironic distance, but it has the effect of making all of the characters, and as a result what happens to them, difficult to care about.<br/><br/>I like challenging, provocative cinema, but not when used to obfuscate rather than enhance.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

The main ""message"" I took away is that any social demands about how relationships are ""supposed"" to be will inevitably warp those relations.

"gortx","Null","1","3","8 June 2016"," The Lobster - Greek Crustacean comedy
","THE LOBSTER is almost the very definition of a one-joke movie. Surprisingly, it has become one of the biggest art-house hits of the season. The premise is simple: In some unspecified future, you either couple up with a mate - or, you get turned into the animal of your choice. Singles are shunned - or, worse. Our hero, Dave (Colin Farrell), chooses a Lobster, and, hence, the title.<br/><br/>And, for quite a while, the movie manages to use droll humor to amuse. It's never quite as clever as it thinks it is, nor does it ever truly hit its targets. Half-way through there is a turn in the story and a new chapter begins. Unfortunately, the dry humor looses steam and an attempt to humanize the tale never quite works, save for an entertaining clandestine mission by Dave and his cohorts (led by Lea Seydoux). But, it's too little, too late in an overlong movie that stretches it's thin joke too much.<br/><br/>Genre fans will recognize bits of Orwell's 1984 as well as more modern examples of alternate history such as the sublime NEVER LET ME GO, MELANCHOLIA, ANOTHER EARTH etc.. I was also a bit reminded of Luis Bunuel's sense of absurdist comedy, but Director Yorgos Lanthimos doesn't have the touch or visual acumen of the best of the master's work.<br/><br/>What is surprising is that THE LOBSTER has become an art-house hit despite its offbeat storyline and sensibility. Lanthimos made his name a few years back with DOGTOOTH, but it was mostly noticed by high-minded critics. His follow-up, THE ALPS, was ignored even by those groups. I guess it's the vaguely sci-fi angle and solid reviews that have buoyed THE LOBSTER. That and the fact that it's in English (of course) and stars recognizable faces (if not stars) in Farrell, Rachel Weisz and John C. Reilly.<br/><br/>THE LOBSTER isn't a misfire, but, it never transcends it's one-note gimmick either."

","As quirky as it is, this film is a strong commentary not only on the rigid ideas human society places on its relationships, but also on the shallow expectations we have of each other. David is willing to lie in order to fit in, then once he does 'fit in' (in the wrong place) he has to lie again in order to be accepted. Apparently it never occurs to him to ask questions or to try to be authentic. It's more important in this film to fit into what the establishment dictates.<br/><br/>The pace of the film is a bit disjointed, which can cause a disconnect. While the dry humor often hits its mark, sometimes the viewer can find himself getting the joke about three minutes later. <br/><br/>The reviews I've seen from many people who claim this movie is ""slow"" and ""boring"" frustrate me. I might expect that from Joe Movie Goer, but not from a professional reviewer. Too many of them have forgotten that film is an art form, one that is not built on instant gratification.

I love how the movie kinda showed how relationships run their course and how we look for people who are similar to us. Specifically the resort for single people tended to match up people with the most superficial similarities like short slightness or a limp.<br/><br/>Collin Ferrell gives his all in his performance by doing very little, and I also like Rachael Weiz, whose character narrates the story. <br/><br/>I found the Lobster to be a true art form as it narrated and interesting dystopian tale which symbolism are a good reflection on today's society, and overall the story is well played out."

","""The Lobster"" is quite a unique experience. It's a story about a man in the near future in a hotel that's designed to help single people find a mate, or be turned into an animal if one fails to do so. It's a tale of loneliness, love, and transformation. The deadpan nature of the actors and environment mixed with the grim, silly humor makes me feel like this film would be the result if the boys from Monty Python tried making a serious movie. The characters are mostly apathetic, as it seems those in charge in the future wants everybody to lack emotion, which sort of adds to the hilarity. It's a weird movie, but I enjoyed it. Although I feel like I would've enjoyed it more while drunk. It starts off well and rather funny, but it gets more serious as it goes on, and sort of loses its charm a bit. A film such as this that starts off dark and humorous but loses its humor towards the end, just becomes dark and depressing. However it is still an enjoyable flick, worth seeing.<br/><br/>What really got me laughing, were the absurd attempts by the establishment to stress that being part of a couple is better than being single. No spoilers here, but in particular as an example, is what the dart-shooting instructor says to the man from room 187, as he calls him up to take his turn. This is just one example of many. The comedy is emotionless, blunt, bleak, and seems to mirror the lives of those in reality who struggle to find a partner.<br/><br/>There are obvious social commentaries in the film, driving home messages of loneliness, relationships (especially ones that are forced, either from within oneself, or by an outside force), and government's forcefulness and knack for butting in where it's not wanted. You can take it more seriously like this, pretend that the film has a point. Or you can just go along for the random, ridiculous ride.
Just be prepared for it to be a different movie at the end than how it starts.<br/><br/>If you liked this (or you haven't seen it yet but have enjoyed some of the following), I will recommend a few films/tv shows. There's a movie that is even more random than this one called ""Rubber,"" about a killer telekinetic tire. Hilarious, and quite misunderstood. There's also ""Black Mirror,"" an excellent show on the nature of society and technology, ""The Lobster"" seems to me to be a similar in terms of social criticism in the future. Then there's ""In Bruges,"" a hidden gem also starring Colin Farrell. There is also ""Withnail & I,"" ""Equilibrium,"" ""Harold & Maude,"" and ""Barton Fink."""

I only have one flaw of The Lobster; some slow motion sequences seem to go on a little too long. This is extreme nit picking in a film with a great screenplay, stellar performances (John C.

"artmania90","10","1","4","1 February 2017"," Might be the best movie of the year
","The Lobster is about as quirky as they come; a surreal deadpan depiction of some alternate universe or perhaps our future (I'm not sure which the filmmakers were leaning towards) in which partnership is a legal requirement and to be alone is to be a lesser being. It's a story billed as dystopian, but with the complexity and sophistication that this civilization is run, perhaps our heroes who work to fight the system are merely traitors.<br/><br/>The opening scene depicts a woman driving down a country road and then exiting her car to calmly shoot and kill a donkey in a field. Having completed this movie, one wonders what this donkey could have possibly done done to deserve it. We learn the processes and meanings later. In the simplest description, this is a society in which people who are single (whether due to death or divorce) must refuge in a sort of resort for loners, a large hotel in which newly-single folk must meet like-minded people in order to mate and return to society. Assuming you can't find a companion within 30 days of arriving, you are turned into an animal of your choice and released into the wild, forever doomed to be mute and alone.<br/><br/>David is our protagonist (a deadpan Colin Farrell, he's fantastic) who enters the resort with his brother (a yappy dog, transformed by the same resort 4 years prior) after his wife leaves him for another man with glasses. He is given a single room, 4 complete suits, shoes, and instructions to never use the volleyball or tennis courts. Those are reserved for couples. He eats all 3 meals at an individual table (curious since socialization is the key to meeting others), attends stiff formal dances catered by the building managers, and regularly goes in groups to the nearby woods to hunt loners who have escaped the grounds.<br/><br/>The story indeed makes for one of the most unique pieces of cinema I have ever seen. The tone is that of a black comedy, and humor is found not in actions or situations, but rather the curious nature of these characters. They speak in a simple English, and there is a bleak sound to it. David speaks with a textbook-like vernacular. He never laughs, never yells, and seems content with living out his remainder as a human in relative peace.<br/><br/>Not only do our characters require a mate, but they also must settle down with someone of a similar trait. A fellow exile picks a woman who frequently gets nosebleeds and insists that banging his head on the table to cause a drip from his nose will make them a perfect couple. Another unsuccessfully tries to find a woman with a similar lisp to his.<br/><br/>One thing leads to another, and David escapes to join a band of loners in the nearby woods (the loners hunted every night). There he falls in love with a short-sighted woman (Rachel Weisz in one of her best roles). How curious that David is also short-sighted, and how deeply sad that these foresters forbid relationships as a form of rebellion to society.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos is the director and co-writer, Greek in descent and with a decidedly European sensibility to his film. His work, while challenging, concludes on a note that will leave some audiences confused and others amazed by the simplicity of it. Along with ""Her,"" here is another modern film that works to dissect love and relationships in a way that we have not yet seen before. There is much to discuss about the film, and there is even more to debate. It's one of the very best films this year."

The second half gets over-extended as it tries to expand the world. The hotel is such a curious place that I would rather stay there for the whole movie."
"TigerHeron","6","1","4","31 May 2016"," A Good Idea Run Wild
","There are some good ideas in this movie, but it is too long, and the longer it goes on, the more grotesque it gets. The ending is ambiguous and ultimately a cop-out. It becomes a hard movie to watch.<br/><br/>The first half of the film, which is mostly set in the hotel, is interesting. The idea of people being threatened, coerced and coached to fall in love is only one step beyond the real world insanity of speed-dating and other atrocities. The film seems to be mocking society's conformism with black humor.<br/><br/>In the second half of the film, the story gets confused and more frightening. It involves a tribe of single people who are just as vicious as the hotel staff, perhaps more so. A romance develops that appears to challenge the abusive tribe's leader's authority, but in the end, it's not clear whether the main characters have truly risen above their circumstances. I found this depressing and wasn't sure what the message was supposed to be.<br/><br/>Something else I didn't like about this film is that there are two female characters who are completely evil, whereas the men are mostly bumbling along. I found the film to be slightly misogynistic."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","4","22 May 2016"," Amusing and poignant satire about human companionship
","So many great stories end with the message that life is meant to be shared with someone else. This statement, in all likelihood, is one a majority of people in the world would agree with. The latest film from Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, however, will make you seriously consider if not refute this universally held belief.<br/><br/>As he did with his Oscar-nominated foreign film ""Dogtooth,"" Lanthimos builds a concept- driven story in ""The Lobster"" that explores the possibilities of how humans would react to well-intentioned extremism. And like ""Dogtooth,"" ""The Lobster"" puts its viewer in the most uncomfortable of situations through Lanthimos' patented blunt/deadpan sexual situations and violence.<br/><br/>""The Lobster"" imagines a dystopian Europe in which romantic companionship is both required and strictly enforced. We experience the process of finding a partner through the eyes of David (Colin Farrell), a man whose wife has just left him, which means he must go back to The Hotel, where with the help and guidance of management, guests must find a partner and fall in love in 45 days or be turned into animals and sent into the woods.<br/><br/>This bizarre and intriguing premise is sure to capture the attention of just about any imaginative movie fan, but only so many will be able to handle Lanthimos' bold, often unsettling and especially provocative style, which induces squirms as much as intellectual stimulation.<br/><br/>The world and satirical analogy that Lanthimos has constructed with writing partner Efthymis Filippou is elaborate, which becomes extremely apparent when you learn that there are ""loners"" out in the woods, those who fled The Hotel, are trying to live on their own and diametrically oppose the values of civilization to the same strict degree. Hotel guests and encouraged to hunt these people down, and they earn extra time at The Hotel in exchange for captures.<br/><br/>Bolstered by an excellent cast that includes Rachel Weisz, Ben Whishaw, John C. Reilly, Lea Seydoux and Olivia Colman, ""The Lobster"" examines Western society's romantic standards and structures through these exaggerations in hopes of uncovering some greater truths about love and the lengths people will go to to find it (and in some cases, fake it).<br/><br/>Lanthimos is not shy about shocking the audience, but ""The Lobster"" demonstrates some growth in this arena; he dials back some of the explicit imagery (particularly the nudity) as if recognizing that suggested sexual situations can be just as if not more powerful than depicted ones. He has no shortage of opportunities in the film to show nudity or sex and opts for none, letting the audience's imagination do the work and elicit its own potent reaction. Violence, on the other hand, the film is not shy about, though Lanthimos opts for disturbing and awkward rather than gory and gratuitous.<br/><br/>The impact of these choices tremendously benefits ""The Lobster."" Although there's no denying the brusque, uncomfortable nature of the film, these tactics aren't as big of a distraction as they were in ""Dogtooth."" As a result, what we do see doesn't rattle us beyond any possible comprehension of themes and ideas, but provokes them. And there's plenty of breathing room to let it all sink in.<br/><br/>""The Lobster"" provides incredibly fresh perspective on and sharp insight into love and relationships, something that will undoubtedly resonate with those viewers intrigued enough by the premise and not repelled by its explicit situations. Its ambiguous ending will annoy some and multiply the adoration of others, but regardless, it succeeds at pushing the viewer to really consider all of its many facets and ideas. As long as Lanthimos can continue to strike the balance between challenging ideas and images and thoughtful ones, he'll continue to make great films for a long time.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","If you're chasing your movie meal to be served up well and truly above medium strange with an added dollop of weird sauce and odd and odder sides, then my goodness is Yorgos Lanthimos's The Lobster the feast you've been seeking.<br/><br/>One of the most downright bizarre yet somehow never less than engaging experiences of recent times, The Lobster takes the viewer into a darkly comically alternative existence where humans are to be matched with partners in hotel matchmaking or face the prospect of being turned into an animal of their choice and if you think that synopsis sounds cuckoo wait until you witness the final product.<br/><br/>Playing it deadpan and never once letting up on its game of oddities, The Lobster sees a game and capable cast play out numerously amusing scenarios from hunting other humans in the woods with tranquiliser guns, partaking in creepy hotel dances or having hands be placed in toasters, Lanthimos isn't afraid to put his named cast through the wringer and many actors are the best they've been in years.<br/><br/>The comedic talents of actors like Colin Farrell and John C. Reilly (here sporting a lisp) are well known and the two gentleman acquit themselves well with equally thankless roles but Lanthimos also finds gold out of performers like Ben Whishaw, Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman in roles that require them to remain straight faced even though what they're getting up to is anything but ""normal"". Especially there are particular joys and amusements to be found early on here as we're introduced to each of these abnormal characters and as we get thrown into this bizarre world you can't help but laugh no matter how dark things are actually getting and how little you actually understand about what on earth is going on.<br/><br/>For fans of Charlie Kaufman and even select Wes Anderson films, The Lobster will likely become a new favourite and will quite possibly be a beloved cult classic as the years draw on from its discoveries on home video formats and while Lanthimos's film loses some steam from a midway point shift in focus, The Lobster is about as original and often hilarious a film as you're likely to get in today's movie climate.<br/><br/>3 ½ misused toasters out of 5"
"tomgillespie2002","6","1","4","22 April 2016"," Absorbing first act gives way to a rambling latter half
","Early in 2015, word-of-mouth was spreading from festival-goers that The Lobster was a strange masterpiece, a dark and bleakly hilarious portrayal of modern relationships that could even compete for the Oscars as long as the voters were not put off by the general weirdness. It however limped into cinemas with little promotion (that I saw), gaining positive reviews from the critics, but was notably absent during awards season. This may have been down to the film being simply too out-there, but I believe it's down to the fact that the incredible precision of the first act gives way to a depressingly bleak and rambling latter half.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is where Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos sets the scene for this not-too-distant living nightmare, where couples must either find a loving partner or face being turned into an animal of their choice. Sullen David (Colin Farrell) arrives at a hotel in middle-of-nowhere Ireland hoping to find a mate. The rules are simple - find love within 45 days or become a wild beast, and David has decided he is to be a lobster. Escape into the surrounding woods and you'll have your former buddies hunting you at night with a tranquilliser gun in the hope of gaining an extra day for each 'kill'. David tries courting the 'Heartless Woman' (Angeliki Papoulia), as she is billed, but things turn sour and he decides to make off into the trees.<br/><br/>The hotel scenes are mostly uncomfortably hilarious. David's new friend, 'The Limping Man' (Ben Whishaw), tries to find common ground with 'Nosebleed Woman' (Jessica Barden) by bashing his head against a wall to cause his nose to gush so they can share something in common, while the Lisping Man (John C. Reilly) is forced by the stern Hotel Manager (Olivia Colman) to put his hand in a toaster as a punishment for masturbating (which is strictly forbidden, while the inhabitants are forced to receive a dry humping from the Maid (Ariane Labed) without ejaculating every morning). Courtship here is routine and emotionless, likely commenting on the ridiculous state of modern dating, which is usually based on linking shared interests and statistics electronically. Whatever happened to a good old natural spark?<br/><br/>It's also depressing, but absorbingly so, but loses its pace once David is in the woods. He meets the leader of escaped hotel guests the Loners, played by Lea Seydoux, whose way of life seems even harsher than the hotels. Romance and sexual activity are punishable by violence and mutilation, but nevertheless David falls in love with the 'Short Sighted Woman' (Rachel Weisz). Once the focus shifts away from the Hotel and the bizarre hook of the films title, the film is just not as interesting while in the world of the Loners. The satire loses its edge and the story could have benefited from 15 minutes or so shaved off. Still, The Lobster is an oddball experience I would recommend anyone to sit through at least once, and features a terrifically restrained performance from Farrell, playing against type."
"deloudelouvain","7","1","4","1 May 2016"," For once a weird movie that I like.
","To be honest normally I hate movies where the story is going nowhere filled with meaningless arty farty scenes. When I started watching The Lobster I had not read anything about it and so I was clueless about what was going to come. So after ten minutes I was already wondering what the hell was going on. This was for sure going to be a strange movie. But I actually did like it. As long as the movie goes on you get new strange and weird rules that are actually funny. I don't know what kind of drugs the script writer has been taken but it must be good stuff. The cast was also good. The main character David played by Colin Farrell is enjoyable to watch. What makes the movie good to me is the fact that they live in the future and that there are new rules that we don't know anything about it or that we could not even start to imagine. I can understand that The Lobster is not going to be everybody's cup of tea but I did enjoy it."

","This film tells the story of a group of people who are taken to a hotel, where they have to find a partner within forty five days. If not, they will be changed to an animal of their choice.<br/><br/>""The Lobster"" is very different from any film I watched recently. The tone of the film is strangely eerie without any eerie or scary effects effects. It achieves the strange feeling by strange societal rules and impersonal interpersonal interaction. Though I say strange, if you think hard about the society depicted in the film, it actually echoes a lot of the real world, only more exaggerated, organised and disturbing. It is a very interesting reflection on the strange world we live in, and makes us realise that our world is more dysfunctional than we cognate."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","4","1 February 2016"," You should not be surprised this is a strange movie
","After all, the writer and director behind these almost 2 hours is Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, the man behind the Oscar-nominated ""Dogtooth"". ""The Lobster"" is his first really international production with Hollywood stars, most of all Colin Farrell, who plays the main character. The premise is as follows: People come to a hotel where they have a couple weeks time in order to find a partner. If they fail, they are turned into an animal of their choice. This also explains the title reference as Farrell's character explaining during one scene why he wants to be a lobster is one of the finest moments of the movie. This is a science fiction film, but not in the sense of space adventure obviously, more along the lines of ""Never Let Me Go"", but not nowhere near as good. Just equally depressing and bleak for the most part.<br/><br/>There are also parallels to our world, for example there is one quote about how couples whose relationships have gone south often get children in a desperate attempt to fix their struggles. The acting is pretty good by everybody in here, but I personally felt that they missed a chance on making a really great film. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the watch, but there was potential for more. The idea is pretty interesting, but after they elaborated properly on it and we understand what is going on exactly, the film loses a bit of its appeal unfortunately and there are a couple scenes when it also drags a bit. The film scored lots of awards attention all over the world, mostly at the BAFTAs and especially at Cannes. The dog nomination was a bit ridiculous, but also shows (alongside the other recognition) how much they loved this film. I myself did not love it as much, but still recommend seeing it. Thumbs up."

","The Lobster is a love story as revealing and disturbing to an adult as ""Romeo and Juliet"" is to a child.<br/><br/>One should absolutely get past the silliness of the situation (which is there for a reason), and he will be rewarded with a ""scientific"" description of love.<br/><br/>The Lobster script is thoroughly developed and describes all the subtle shadings of emotions that border love.<br/><br/>As father would say:<br/><br/>There are two distinct groups of emotions that border love (if it exists). <br/><br/>The first group of emotions that border love (if it exists), are in random order:<br/><br/>Group A <br/><br/>1.hatred <br/><br/>2.revenge <br/><br/>3.guilt <br/><br/>4.jealousy <br/><br/>5.pity and <br/><br/>6.fear <br/><br/>The second group of emotions that border love (if it exists) are in random order:<br/><br/>Group B <br/><br/>1.companionship <br/><br/>2.sexual attraction <br/><br/>3.friendship <br/><br/>4.acceptance and <br/><br/>5.belonging <br/><br/>6. survival<br/><br/>The average of both groups A and B are of equal distance to love L (AL=AB). Please calculate the distance between love L and each individual emotion and provide examples from the movie ""The Lobster""...<br/><br/>Father aside, The Lobster deconstructs both the ""forced"" love of the hotel as well as the ideal of the ""Romeo and Juliet"" love and deliberately avoids taking sides. If only, through it's factual approach, it promotes tolerance or at least respect for the personal pain people go through to achieve what they think is their ideal... <br/><br/>The brilliance of the movie is that it avoids being clinical which is strange. It is completely emotionally engaging and touching in a very deep way. It manages to be so, avoiding any clichés in actor's performances, script or direction. It does so instead through subtlety and omission..., which I find striking. <br/><br/>As you probably guessed by now, I'm totally thrilled about this movie and I totally sympathize with the decision of the distribution company to market it to a modern mainstream audience as a science fiction romantic comedy...<br/><br/>The only science fiction I can see is in the demands it makes on it's viewers and it can only be a comedy in the minds of it's emotionally crippled audience.<br/><br/>All of the above is of-course my personal opinion.

"nikatnyte","6","1","5","9 June 2016"," I like a film that makes you think, but...
","There's certainly food for thought in this bizarre film. A dystopian present (not future, as some suggest), in which being solitary is a crime punishable by death (or being turned into an animal, as citizens are led to believe). Why? People are celebrated for coupling, even though their relationship is based on superficial commonalities like bleeding noses or short-sightedness. Why? Those who rebel and seek salvation through being solitary are punished when they seek connection with someone else. Why? There are no clues to the answers to these questions. It's a disturbing world, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out what the filmmakers were trying to tell me. Watch out for those who tell you how to live, and with whom? There are far better ways to convey this message than this mystifying film. I enjoyed its cryptic nature, and the performances, but that can only take you so far. Style is not art."

","OK, so first of, this is a weird movie. It's not for you if you don't like those kind of movies. If, however, you do, it might be right up your alley.<br/><br/>The movie represents the constant need for human contact and connection in a weird and sarcastic way. People are not supposed to be alone, at least that's the premise of the movie. And any attempt of doing so is characterized as animal. The basic human emotions needed for creating a deeper connection that could eventually lead into a relationship, are twisted and somewhat ridicule.<br/><br/>People have to have a partner not because they want to, but because they need to, according to law. The consequences if they don't are terrible - they are either transformed into animals or hunted down as loners. Naturally they become obsessed, technical, ready to do whatever it takes to find that one person they can form marital unity with.<br/><br/>This is a perfect setting to comment everything from sexual orientation, having children, a desperate need to belong to a community. But most of all, it twists and reverse a constant focus on physical traits and physical attraction into a connection based on physical disability.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie and its characters is technical, from the way they talk and walk, to the realization of scenes.

The first act took place in a hotel which is the introduction to the odd world and the situation where the plot opens. When it moved to the 2nd half, especially after Rachel Weisz come into the frame, the entire scenario changed to atypical romance mode and kept that way till the last with a simple twist in the finale.<br/><br/>Colin Ferrell's character was something like the one from the movie 'Her'.

"Rendanlovell","8","1","5","11 January 2016"," Unconventional and hilarious.
","'The Lobster' is, as the poster says, an unconventional love story. The film is about a man named David (Colin Farrell). This man just recently lost his wife and, in this near future, that denotes being forced to try and find someone new. He his sent to a hotel where he stays for forty five days. Here he is pushed to find a new partner or be turned into a animal and released into the wild. Is this fairly outlandish and rather implausible? Sure. But once you see the film, it will all make sense. It is very strange yet it works so well. Everything 'The Lobster' does seems to have a purpose. Especially the things that feel a bit too over the top. This is what makes this film so special. The story so incredibly strange and original that it's near impossible not to be sucked into its world. The fact that everything falls into place in such a perfect manner is in large part thanks to Colin Farrell and his immensely committed performance.<br/><br/>In fact everyone involved does a fantastic job in their own monotone roles. It's strange to be saying how great everyone is because of how little emotion these characters seem to have. It takes these great actors and tells them to do something that is incredibly hard. Be dull but not boring.<br/><br/>Again, it's just the right amount of over the top and weird to work. What the film is actually trying to say here is open to interpretation. And there are many different things that it seems to be saying. The most predominate message that is being said is obviously about relationships. <br/><br/>It starts in the first few moments to last few moments. It talks about how many of us see relationships and the things that are deemed ""romantic"". It's an interesting look at human nature and the way some people perceive love.<br/><br/>With a film this ambitious there tends to be a few draw backs. The only real, noticeable down side here is in its pacing. For the most part the film moves at a great pace but there are multiple spots where the film certainly slows down. Whether it's for one reason or another is beside the point. It's just abundantly clear that there are scenes where the film slows down way to much.<br/><br/>This is a fairly small gripe in a film that overall, is great. It's so strange and unconventional that it's near impossible not to fall in love with it. It shows the world in a hilariously dark and uncompromising way. What it lacks in accessibility it makes for with rich rewards for patient viewers."

","People tend to call ""weird"" what they cannot understand, what they fail to fit into their structured perceptions. Many might have introduced this film to you as the ""strangest"" they have watched and critics might have written about how absurd and unique it is. Very few people will actually tell you what the film is really about, because very few people will manage to put aside their cinematic conventions and dive into this world. <br/><br/>The Lobster is more than a strange film; it is pure and instinctive, it awakens those places in your soul you didn't even know were there. In the world Lanthimos built with his images, people who are incapable of finding a partner are sent to The Hotel, an actual hotel where possible partners can be found. People are given a room number, identical outfits and 45 days to find their ideal partner, someone with whom they share a particular natural characteristic, being blind for example. If they fail to do so, they turn into an animal of their own choice for the rest of their lives. <br/><br/>The residents need to attend the hotel's events, but also be prepared for hunting. That includes going to The Woods, loading tranquilizer weapons and hunting down Loners, people who managed to escape this structured world and live on their own in the wild. If the residents succeed in immobilizing loners, they earn extra days at the hotel. <br/><br/>The film that won the Jury Prize in Cannes this year, Lanthimos first English speaking film, is dealing with a subject cinema loves to visualize; that of pure love. But through a different perspective. How could the world be structured if being alone was a crime? In a society where the inability to find a lover would be punished and the talent to kill lonely people would be rewarded? It must be hard to imagine, but look what Lanthimos has created so far; a seemingly cynical and exaggerated version of reality, where love is the only thing making sense. <br/><br/>Lanthimos has the unique ability to create realities that make us uncomfortable, just because they dare to tell us honestly what we'd rather ignore. In this case, he visualizes the fear of being lonely, the love that flourishes in any circumstance, the obsession humans have on trying to change each other. His images look structured and senseless at first glance, but they unlock a greater depth on how love is perceived. His vision is simple and decisive, his cinema is more liberating than weird and in its unorthodox form it breaks all conventions, expressing universal truths.<br/><br/>http://mycinematographies.blogspot.nl/2016/03/the-lobster-2015.html"

This interesting, unusual progress of the plot keeps the viewer focused and wonder what is next to come.<br/><br/>Viewers that are not familiar with the dark humour or uninterested in the detailed dialogs might find the movie a little bit strange at first. For those, my suggestion would be to watch Kynodontas (Dogtooth) before this movie. This will help them focus on the progress of the movie and dialogs rather than the dystophian setting and intentionally enchanted, unusual dialogs. Compared to the ""Kynodontas"", ""The Lobster"" is a lot more complex in dialogs and plot and includes hidden clues about character personas and has more artistic features.<br/><br/>""The Lobster"" is for those who likes to sit and think about the movie and its point when the movie ends. The movie does not give the audience a clear message or conclusion to feed the viewer.

","This black comedy explores devotion, jealously, honesty, compromise, deception, and true love. Bizarre and dystopian, the theme had great promise. Still, it was a movie to be endured. After about 35 minutes, I wasn't sure that I could take any more. The Lobster has that purposeful and all-pervasive awkwardness that saturates Wes Anderson films. The embellishments on this story, however, nearly ruined it. The narration and musical score were grating. In fact, the avant-garde posturing could have been much more easily and pleasantly achieved by leaving out the accompanying music and voice overs. Unfortunate casting with Colin Farrell. It's not that he did a bad job with the part, but that it would have been so much better with an unknown playing the role. Overall, this was not an enjoyable film but instead a provocative watch.

","Some movies strike such a singular chord in your heart, that you feel they were made exclusively for you. For me, ""The Lobster"" is such a movie.<br/><br/>This marks Yorgos Lanthimos first English language film, but don't worry. It's just as uncompromising and delightfully weird as his other features, namely ""Dogtooth"" and ""Alps"". The film is set in a dystopian future, where everyone must have a romantic partner, otherwise they are sent to the Hotel, in order to acquire one in a maximum allotted time of 45 days. If they fail to do so, the unlucky loners are transformed into an animal of their choosing and sent out to live in the wilderness. David is one such bachelor and the film follows his quest for a partner.<br/><br/>I write a ""partner"", because that truly is the purpose of the Hotel. The people in charge aren't interested in some romantic notion of true love or anything like that. The guests must partner up with someone who is an empirical match with them; whether they both suffer from sudden nose bleeds, have poor eye sight, or even a limp, they must somehow be physically compatible. Lanthimos brings us immediately his incisive satire, exploring to an extreme the social expectations of dating in the current online landscape; where you swipe endlessly to the left until you find that one person whose mere looks just click. The way Lanthimos exposes society's conventions, by pushing the concept to its extreme is what makes ""The Lobster"" a humorous but also incredibly violent film.<br/><br/>""If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever.""<br/><br/>The future in this film isn't unlike the one George Orwell described above. It operates in an artificial world, drained of human emotion. Most characters search for a partner, but only out of self-preservation. It is when David begins to experience true love, that Lanthimos masterfully explores the struggle of nurturing true affection in the current oppressive digital age. David reveals himself alive for the first time, distinguishing himself from all others, and those who don't remain indifferent react with violence.<br/><br/>I won't reveal just how far the violence in ""The Lobster"" escalates, but the ending is in perfect Lanthimos fashion, leaving you fulfilled but grasping at your seat. There are still quite a few films from 2015 that I am eager to see, but, as of now, ""The Lobster"" is my favorite of the year."
"piarwood","9","1","6","14 February 2016"," Dystopian, oddball meditation on love and relationships
","Somewhat ironically I'm writing this on Valentine's day after watching it with my wife the night before.<br/><br/>This is definitely not a rom-com and gag-a-minute, but if you like your films in the Harold & Maude, Twin Peaks style then this meditation on relationships could be up your street.<br/><br/>First of all, well done to Colin Farrell for taking this role - it's definitely not the type of role you'd expect him to be appearing in, ie alpha male, confident and worldly. Here he is low-energy, down-trodden and unmistakably average with fantastically understated acting.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the Lobster is that single people (loners)are 'arrested', placed into a hotel and given an allotted time (45 days) to find a relationship/love. If they fail, they are then 'disposed' of and turned into an animal of their choice. Farrell's choice of animal is a lobster - hence the reason for the title. Loners can increase the time limit by hunting and tranquiliser-darting other loners in the forest nearby - kind of like a café loyalty card but obviously more active and arduous. If the loners are successful in 'partnering up' they are put in 'couple rooms' where they are monitored and assessed for compatibility.<br/><br/>So there you have it. A somewhat unusual premise - not for everyone (definitely won't be suggesting my parents watch it, but I have several friends that I would).<br/><br/>Frankly there is too much to say about the film without giving the game away, but Farrell's character finds himself entering this hotel, accompanied by a dog - Farrell's brother (who was unsuccessful at the hotel previously) - and tries to find a suitable partner. Along the way we meet several oddball characters (the kind of people that you would find in a David Lynch meets Blue Hotel kind of establishment) and the desperation is palpable.<br/><br/>Like in life, some succeed, some don't. There is a naive brutality to the movie which at parts made me squirm in my seat, but there is much that is darkly funny and astute in the pitfalls of love and relationships.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this movie - yes, but like I say, it's not for everyone, but for me. A very unique, oddball movie that in a strange kind of way actually makes sense.<br/><br/>Want rom-com popcorn, this isn't it. Want something that you'll end up thinking about for a while to come... This is it.<br/><br/>To me, probably one of the best films I've seen this year so far."

","I was having a really crappy day till I sat down and started watching this film. It asborbed my mind quickly and I found myself enjoying the pace and the plot very much. A few scenes seemed a little drawn out but by that stage I was too deeply intrigued by the plot to care. I just wanted to see what happened next. It reminded me vaguely of both The Sleeper (Woody Allen)I think due to the overbearing authorities and of The Hunger Games, probably due to the hunting and survival in the forest. Parts made me laugh out loud, parts made me wince and grab my boyfriends hand - and this from a devoted horror/sci-fi fan. Sometimes I was laughing at parts that made sense to me in a very personal way, I was the only one in the cinema laughing at those points; it really does make you think.<br/><br/>I was left afterwards with a feeling that I'll not forget in a long time. I don't think I would want to watch it over and over but give it a few years and I'll probably end up buying it as I imagine it'll never be shown on TV; it's a bit too weird for that.<br/><br/>Just relax and let this film take you on a strange journey."
"kilianstakemeier","10","1","7","9 February 2016"," ""Think about it. It would be absurd.""
","Just saw this movie, and what can I say. Absurd, as it is said in the film (and in the quote above), is one of the first words that comes into my mind. Grotesque, but stylistically confident. Maybe the most macabre and morbid movie about Love I have ever seen. And yes, this film is about Love. From the utterly weirdest perspective you can imagine. The actors transport this well-written and inspired screenplay so straight in the visitors face, so that the weirdest scenes made me laugh the most in this movie. Colin Farrell might remind you of Joaquin Phoenix in ""Her"", not only because of the similar mustache they share. But where ""Her"" (which I also liked very much, what's funny because I'm not a fan of Love-stories at all) wanted to be deep and sad, this film holds on to his crazy and brilliant idea and unfolds its highly and numerously funny elements due to his consequence. And all of it yet came totally unexpected. Still the center of the movie is thoughtful. What value does Love have in our todays world? What are we making of it and how do we transform ourselves by doing so? The sobriety of that world and its characters is captured brilliantly by the steady camera-shots and the rather mealy colors of the films landscapes. The music underlines the grotesqueness of what's going on, creating a feeling of uncomfortableness as the story moves forwards to its eerie end.<br/><br/>The originality of the storyboard alone is enough to fascinate; but the outworking and cogency makes this movie a 10/10."

","I had no idea of what to expect from this, but what I got from it was a portrayal of people who felt a need to be loved, even to the point of actually lying about their feelings, just so they could be accepted into that society. The story itself was a bit of an eye-opener on just how far people will go to to fit into what is considered normal, yet it goes against their basic human principles. The stilted dialog makes for uncomfortable conversations, because nobody seems to want to display true feeling, on the chance they may get ostrasized, yet despite this, there are some who decide it's not right, and decide to rebel. The ending is something to think about. How far would you go for love?"
"in1984","8","1","7","28 December 2015"," A Middle-aged Alternate Reality to the Hunger Games
","8 of 10. Alternate reality really needs to become as big a film term as sci-fi. Neither Hunger Games nor this are truly sci-fi, but they are definite alternate realities that could exist here and now or in the not too distant future or past.<br/><br/>If you want to test if someone you know actually understands and appreciates the Hunger Games, not just a fan-girl/boy riding the bandwagon, this is the film to watch with them. If they don't appreciate the sort of dropped in the middle of a seemingly modern world and the mystery of what's actually happening and what's actually real along with the allegorical similarities, they simply have no clue.<br/><br/>This probably will never be a teen sensation. The people, with a few exceptions, are mostly unappealing, either physically or emotionally, and middle-aged. In place of action, there is comedy, mostly satirical. Rather than visual oddities, the normal is turned into the bizarre and you're always waiting for the other shoe to drop.<br/><br/>Definitely a film worthy of a sequel. The alternate world is setup and waiting to be discovered."

","Last year, in Amsterdam a pop-up restaurant for singles opened its doors.I was a huge success, and the tables-for-one were filled every night. I imagine it must have looked a bit like the breakfast room in the hotel where 'The Lobster' is set. Only singles, sitting next to each other, facing the large windows and enjoying the view.<br/><br/>'The Lobster' is a highly imaginative and original film about the way our society handles people without a partner. In the film, they are forced to find a suitable partner or they will be turned into an animal (the lead character's choice is a lobster, hence the title). But in the forests around the hotel live the loners who are just as strict, but the other way around: they refuse to find a partner, and forbid other loners to find one.<br/><br/>The film is satirical, sometimes funny, cruel at times, often disturbing, and overall very weird. But I was less impressed by it than I was by Dogtooth, director Lanthimos's previous acclaimed film. Dogtooth was creepier and more disturbing, although it wasn't so outspoken about modern society and its issues.<br/><br/>'The Lobster' is not an straightforward run-of-the-mill movie. But if you like films that go a bit further than usual, like 'The Voices' or 'Under The Skin', you might enjoy it."
"saketkt","6","1","7","18 December 2015"," A Utopian dystopian setting with inception like ending.
","Premise: The world is a better place if everyone lives as a couple. There is no place for an individual (loner). <br/><br/>Setting: A loner is sent to a hotel, where he is supposed to find a partner within 45 days else he/she is turned into an animal of his/her choice. If he/she escapes they are ousted from the hotel and hunted. So there is no place for a loner.<br/><br/>The movie has two phases, both dystopia ,amidst a setting of Utopian world around them. Colin Farrell has done a brilliant job of portraying a loner who struggles in such a society. This is a lesson that nothing can ever be perfect- that is no society however hard it tries. His choice of animal was a Lobster. But he did not want to be transformed into one. So the struggle begins. The movie starts of by showing different types of people and the mundane activities that always follow them around. It is like familiarizing yourself in this new world. Weird at first, but you will enjoy it later. There is also this narration by Rachel Weisz which helps. Farrell, by portraying himself to be similar, marries a cold hard murderer in desperation as he runs out of days. But his intention is discovered when his wife kicks his brother dog to death. He, with the help of a hotel maid, transforms his wife and escapes to the loners living in the forest. In what animal was she transformed is not shown. But I guess it would be a dog, and he probably kicked it to death.<br/><br/>To his surprise, he finds a world similar to the one at the hotel. It is just the whole thing is opposite, that is no partners allowed. But he falls in love with Rachel Weisz. He falls in love where he is not suppose to and does not fall in love where he is suppose to. Such is the contradictory nature of humans. The evil woman, who is their leader, discovers their intention and blinds Rachel Weisz to dissuade them from running away. But as always the protagonist overcomes his challenge, and they escape to the city to live as a couple. One notion of this movie is that similar natured people are suppose to be a couple. So now that Weisz was blind, Farrell too had to be blind. The movie ends at this point leaving its audience wondering whether they got together or not.<br/><br/>Definitely, an avant garde. Deserves an applause. Something different from the most, and one should watch this just because it is a new experience. The pace is slow, but acting and direction makes up for it."
"deastman_uk","6","1","8","27 December 2015"," the odd couple
","I've often felt recently that society is slowly pushing single men to the fringes. But this unusual art house stylised film, populated by actors who are usually very mainstream, takes that idea to the extreme. <br/><br/>There are similarities with Being John Malkovich in sheer weirdness of the conceit, but there is also a strong feeling, mirrored by the jagged music that this is a film that wants to join the indie crowd, but wasn't born to it. This is made by someone who loves Jonze, Anderson, Gondry, Iñárritu etc - but like Gilliam hasn't quite mastered getting a great treatment to a strong draft.<br/><br/>The problem first comes with the tone, which is played differently throughout the cast. Olivia Colman's Hotel Manager strikes an almost perfect absurdest humour, but then Ben Wishaw plays it almost totally straight. Farrell keeps to a low key with some nice notes of humour but doesn't really fill the screen. There are moments of embarrassing terror, and these leave the audience a bit perplexed next to lighter touches.<br/><br/>And then the film just has pacing problems and feels longer than it should do. In some respects the film is easy to criticize because the ideas are so strong, but there just wasn't enough work put into it to complete the vision properly."

The ending perhaps wasn't what I expected but I should have guessed that this black little comedy would ensure something different was in store. I really enjoyed the main leads but to be honest, the stand out was Lea Soydoux as the psychotic loner leader. I was also a little dubious given the title but enjoyed the movie and thought it was a solid 7. There were really so many classic lines and I loved the dry manner in which the at times R rated narration was delivered.<br/><br/>This movie is not for everyone - it has no Hollywood special effects or stunts and explosions, but what it does have is an oddball, unusual, off the wall, weird and essentially strange love story."

"bugwyrus","2","0","1","28 January 2020"," Love against all Oddity
","Let me start my review by saying that if i could describe this movie in three words they would be: Odd, Weird and Strange.
This is a typical slow paced European movie, with a Greek Director.
I'll start with a small synopsis describing the movie.
Single people in a near future, according to the laws of ""The City"", are taken to The Hotel a kind of reformatory prison, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days OR as a consequence of failing they are transformed into a animal of their choice.
The protagonist (Colin Farell) chooses a Lobster, hence the name of the movie.
Lets start with the GOOD... Colin Farell and Rachel Weiss are great actors, and actually do a good job with the script handed to them. The cinematography, and the scenery used in the movie were nice to see.
Now the BAD... This is the weirdest, strangest movie i have seen by far this year.
The strange bad script, that some might consider to be intellectual and a well done satire, i consider to be just absurd. Nonsense and rubish lines are all over the place. I could excuse the short Budget the director had, and i know this movie tries to be like a theather play, but the fact is that the movie plot is just ridiculous from the beggining till the end with a runtime of almost 2 hours of Borefest. I just laughed in a scene were a women makes a bad suicide attempt, by jumping from the hotel into her demise, but utterly failing. So she stayed on the floor agonizing in pain, screaming! NOW tell me, is this funny or nauseating???
Instead of saying to you to avoid the movie, i recommend for you to see the movie.You will like all the other movies you see in the future so much more.
If you want to see a slow paced, but very well scripted, european vibe movie see BLINDNESS instead it is great. It is scripted after a book made by a Nobel prize winner of my country Portugal called Jose Saramago.
P.S: I Wish a Lobster would destroy this bad script with their bare hands, i mean claws :) I give a 2 out of 10 for the actors performance."

""They"" will provide you everything, but you still get to keep your ugly underwear as not to offend the governmental commission. The extras play with the dignity of the Union worker. The story also has the air of Union contracts. Like with most European films, the story is for 30-40 minutes, blown up to what the governmental commission asked for the run time. But the story is that bad it keeps needing the god voice to explain the empty frames.<br/><br/>Finally, a successful, unpolished film student movie. You have the blue filter when the audience needs a cue it's a cold, impersonal scene. You have the red filter when it should be a personal scene.

Even though it is a bit slower paced (something I don't particularly care for in movies) it really fit the way of the film and its aesthetic.

","I can't think of any movie that has effortlessly explored the human relationships with such insight, profundity, authenticity, and accuracy. Lanthimos simply took some stereotypes and utilized them flawlessly, thus taking advantage of them in a most potent, effective, and cynical way. I don't the movie to be neither misanthropic nor nihilistic, since it displays both the good and the bad in humans. This is one of these movies that makes you wonder why it hasn't been made before.<br/><br/>The Lobster also has one of the most effective uses of voice-over narration in recent years. With a stiff and composed tone lacking emotional weight, the voice-over significantly enriches the film's narrative, particularly for setting its gloomy and dreary tone that seems as if it came out of a dystopian novel, and it's definitely crucial to carry the film's development from start to finish.<br/><br/>It's also impressive that both different halves of the movie have worked pretty well; the first half, with its sarcastic and dry sense of humor, and the second half, with its more serious, focused and extremely intelligent less-is-more storytelling. The movie almost scuppered by the major tonal shift between its two halves, and became very tepid, since its humor lost its bite almost completely. But it picked up almost instantly, and became as, if not more, intriguing and riveting as it was in its first hour.<br/><br/>An instant classic, The Lobster is a highly original dystopian black comedy that proves that Yorgos Lanthimos is one of the most talented and idiosyncratic filmmakers working today. I can't wait to see more of his films!<br/><br/>(9/10)"

"q-53185","8","0","2","18 January 2019"," I Guess You Could Call it a Rom-Com
","When I look to watch a movie, the first thing I look for is a creative idea executed well to make the movie memorable and unique; and Yorgos Lanthimos delivers excellently with his 2015 film, The Lobster. This movie fits its absurdist style absolutely and asserts that relationships can be shallow and driven by our necessity to not be alone.
The general plot of this movie starts by introducing that in this world, Newly divorced David must find a wife within 45 days or face the fate of getting turned into an animal of his choice, to which he chooses a lobster based on its longevity and his fondness for the sea. To complete this impossible mission, all single people are relocated into a bleak and propagandist hotel designed to force singles into couples to conform to society. Lanthimos uses this outlandish setting to present the weak connections behind many relationships.
Lanthimos masterfully characterizes very minimally while filming in an intentionally mundane way. Lines are read choppily and shots are long with little background sound or action. But the first time watching, I could barely look away based on the sheer absurdity of the style and premise of this movie in addition to some hilarious lines and situations that arise out of the awkwardness. In a bold move by lanthimos, he chooses to not give name to any of the other characters, instead describing them by one major characteristic such as the girl who gets frequent nose bleeds, the man with the limp, the man with the lisp, or the cruel woman. The bored disengaged filming style and its creative characterization shattered every expectation that I had that one could do with a movie and kept me hooked throughout the film.
The Lobster fits very similarly to what Lanthimos has done in the past with his movie Dogtooth. In that movie the main characters are also not given names and they are confined to their house under their overprotective parents similarly to how David is confined to the relational pressure to find a companion that manifests itself in the ultimatum enforced by the blank conformity of the hotel.
Lanthimos' directing style contrasts in almost every way to what Anthony and Joe Russo did with Avengers Infinity War. The Russo brothers used every scene and a complex plot filled with colorful scenery, quick cuts, and near constant action to create an energetic movie. Lanthimos did almost everything differently and still created an interesting movie, showcasing his ability to do everything differently from a traditional Hollywood movie and it still create a success.
I have two complaints with this movie, one being the score and the other being the length of the second half of the film. The score of the movie is the same song that repeats throughout the movie, and it often feels overused. My other complaint is that certain scenes in the letter half of the movie feel long and unnecessary. There is one scene where David and the short sighted woman are walking into town. In this particular scene, the uncompromising nature of the style of the film backfires with a long dialogue less walking scene in a second half that doesn't need to be as long as it is.
Contrarily, the theme continues strongly into the second half. David, running out of time, escapes the hotel and joins the group of loners who view relationships in the opposite way. This group faces mutilation if caught with a companion. Lanthimos uses this group to flesh out the opposite end of the spectrum and hypocritical nature of how society views relationships. Lanthimos claims that society penalizes both being happily single and being in a relationship.
The true strength of this film is demonstrated in its unique setting and the style in which it is filmed. This movie stuck firmly in my memory because it is truly like nothing I have ever seen before and that is what makes it great. The film style, with its gray and muted colors creates a movie that is ironically unforgettable.
In addition to being a unique movie, this movie stays strong to its theme and provides a strong commentary on what relationships may become in the future. I will concede that this movie is not for everyone, but I will recommend it to anyone who appreciates seeing a fresh perspective taking to movie making. I'm giving The Lobster a 4/5 and I will definitely rewatch in the near future."

The performance are all solid as well. The manner in which the film spoofs, satirizes, and questions modern relationships and our increasingly technical/machine/impersonal modes of communication was often times funny and thought-provoking. However, after about a third of the way into this story, I found it to grow a little thin and beginning to lose focus. It never really regained its sure footing and ends with more of a whimper than a bang."

I had no idea what to write, so I went to see what others have commented. Rare are films that divide the audience like this. There are no middle grades, I didn't see any fives, sixes or sevens. All the reviews I saw either spit on it, rating it one or two, or praise it and give it nines and tens. I think it is both an exaggeration, but one thing is certain - the film achieved the goal that is shared by all the movies, and that is to make a strong impression.<br/><br/>In the dystopian future, it is not allowed to be single. Singles are arrested and taken into a remote hotel, where they have 45 days to pair up or otherwise they'll be transformed into an animal of their own choice. A lot of them escape to the nearby forest and the hotel residents hunt them and for every one caught hunter gets an extra day at the hotel. The film shows both sides of the coin, life in the hotel and life in the forest. It is totally weird, irrational, morbid and mesmerizingly disturbing, yet again, it's not tiring to watch. The cast is very good and Yorgos Lanthimos definitely hooked me to see the rest of his movies.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>In case you didn't notice, except for the main character and his two ""best friends"", there are no names mentioned in the entire movie.

","An outrageous, simple, horrifying, captivating, and nuanced-yet-not film.<br/><br/>It plays out like a world full of autistic people. Simple and awkward conversations, which are more statements and no frills. Poorly expressed and understood emotions. Discomfort and difficulty in unexpected and changing situations.<br/><br/>It feels kind of like a play, but I guess the robotic behaviour and acting is part of the black and white world presented and how humans behave and think.<br/><br/>The arbitrary and objective treatment of others and of relationships. A utilitarian approach to coupling (which seems odd because children are 'assigned' to couples, one wonders how procreation happens and why there are spare children around). Woeful misunderstanding of the nuance of real relationships and utilitarianism... but it provides a ridiculous look into the isolation of life and the pursuit of relationships to provide a reason for being.<br/><br/>This really was not worthy of such low ratings by some reviewers, but it is definitely not an 'easy' film to watch, because the behaviour of the characters is very stiff and forced...<br/><br/>If anything, I think this film is more of a serious look at autistic thinking and behaviour, than of humanity's pursuit of coupling relationships and a 'cost benefit'/utilitarian analysis of actions.<br/><br/>This film will leave you with more to think about than to feel about. It's difficult to empathise with such robotic characters, but I think instead it requires a deeper understanding and appreciation of these people and the world they live in to really try to react appropriately...<br/><br/>Do I feel sorry for these people, or pleased that life is so simplistic? Some of these single people actually look forward to their lives as transformed animals. The certainty of expectations and the simplicity of relationships must be comforting for them, eg: do we both have a limp, or do we both have similar hair?<br/><br/>I think this film is excellent, whatever the case. It is extremely novel, by premise and delivery, and really gave me a lot to think about. The locations and sets/props were used very well and felt right for this film. There are some horrifying elements to the film, but it is not meant to be gory (save for a few scenes that show blood and/or death (human and animal), but not extreme in delivery) or frightening.<br/><br/>Violence was used well, with restraint, and I think presented the story well and added a lot.<br/><br/>Watch this film, and push through the almost theatrical acting. I believe you will be rewarded by your experience."
"Cinematic_Bullshit","8","0","2","26 November 2018"," A Satirical Critique of Relationships
","In a society where single people will be sent to a facility to be transformed into an animal unless they are able to find a mate within 45 days the stakes are high. Much higher than they would be if it were our society where people merely feel ostracized when they are incapable of fulfilling one of the most basic of human expectations.<br/><br/>Yes, 'The Lobster' serves as a satirical critique of relationships and social acceptance. When someone, is caught masturbating when he should be up and about searching for a woman he is punished. The audience can easily sympathize, for who hasn't felt a bit of guilt after a good old yanking session? There are other weird practices like a maid coming to give you slightest of sexual pleasures, just enough to leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>Another way this film criticizes relationships is the way many of its characters choose to pretend to have things in common, to base their relationship on a lie, rather than turning to the only other options which are to stay alone and either be turned into an animal or run off into the woods where the 'loners' retreat. The loners are as the name implies, alone. Not only that, but they live by rules equally as strict as those in the facility. Only here, no one is allowed to have a significant other.<br/><br/>There are clearly loners who want nothing more than to be with someone, but just like the outside world, they must follow the rules or risk the wrath other people will unleash upon them. However, there are those that will break these social contracts and strive for what they truly want."

","In The City you have to find a partner before you get too old. If you don't, you get sent to The Hotel, where you have only forty-five days to do so before you get turned into an animal. It is suggested to look for someone in The Hotel that you have at least something in common with. No matter how minor that something is. Do you both perhaps suffer from the same physical ailment? Perfect! More than enough ground to build a relationship upon. Right?<br/><br/>The Lobster is very much an art film. The premise is highly symbolic, is not even meant to be logical and realistic, and plays on your emotions more than your common sense. And it is told in such a way that it's clear that there's something behind all the nonsense to get, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>I sure did not get whatever that something was, to be sure. The obvious parallels with societal pressure to find a partner, the fear of spinsterhood, the physiological urge to mate and so on, are of course blindingly obvious, but it's the add-ons that baffle me. Like the whole 'get turned into an animal' thing. Does the film try to claim that beyond certain age you cannot find a partner? Probably not, but then why such a final solution. If it was meant to convey that society believes you incapable of finding a partner beyond certain age, why not a death penalty?<br/><br/>The whole film is very much like that. Clear goals and basic messages conveyed through muddled metaphors, odd symbolic language and a plot so stilted and woodenly acted that it had to be intentional, for whatever reason.<br/><br/>Still, it is very professional on the technical level, the actors are trying their best and some of the metaphors are actually really spot on. Whenever the film tries to be a pure satire, it works really well. It's a shame that it seems to think itself above such a pedestrian art form."

","This quirky dramedy came from the mind of Yorgos Lanthimos & was nominated for Oscar for original screenplay & originality is to be found in this tale of a man who must find love again in a hotel among the various lovelorn but if a match is not found by a certain time limit, he'll be turned into the animal of the title. I know, it's a grabber. For the most part when the action is confined to the estate, the story works whereby the mechanics of masturbation or nose bleeds yields comedic gold but once our hero, played by Colin Farrell, makes a dash back to the real world, the novelty wears off since the story continues to put arbitrary rules where really there shouldn't be."
"andrewroy-04316","6","0","2","17 August 2018"," While certainly bold and original, the second half struggles with the more serious emotions
","The Lobster is a completely absurdist societal commentary on society's emphasis on monogamy and relationships. The first half's humor and exploration of Lanthimos' wildly creative premise is the movie's strength. The functioning of the hotel and how they encourage people to find partners as well as the animal aspect was amusing. The intentional lack of emotion and engagement with others was frustrating to watch - while I appreciate the symbolic nature of it, it took me out of the premise in which partnership was everything because it felt so unrealistic for them to act with no emotion. The second half also didn't feel strong and was less clever and active in plot. A point made repeatedly in the movie was how heavily relationships are based on shared interests or similarities, which just didn't ring very true or relevant to me. Farrell was good, and one of my favorite elements of the film (and a big reason why it's still an overall positive review) was the score - it was dramatic but simple and fit to the scenes very well. The boldness of ideas and themes were fun, but some of the relationship themes didn't quite land with me, and the second half and especially ending were disappointing, especially given the potential of the technical aspects and premise."

"proud_luddite","5","0","3","17 June 2018"," Some greatness but disappointing in the end
","In a dystopian society (likely in Ireland or England though the location is unnamed), two groups of radical control freaks battle against each other. One is a law-enforcing hotel compound in a rural area. Its purpose is to convert single people into couplehood. Singles who fail to couple within forty-five days face serious consequences. The other group is loners who have escaped the compound and live with their own rules in a nearby forest. David (Colin Farrell) sees the worst of both worlds.<br/><br/>The first half is clever at times despite some moments of cruelty and sadism. As bizarre as the anti-single compound is, it seems to make sense within its own set of rules and ideals. Its concept is likely a stab against one of the unspoken prejudices: the belief that singlehood is an unfortunate and horrible situation that must be corrected and removed as quickly as possible. The oddball group of characters make a fascinating show that sometimes has scary moments. There is also a clever contradiction as the ""guests"" are treated with verbal courtesy even as they are being controlled.<br/><br/>The movie goes downhill in the second half once the main action moves into the forest. It's not just overly long (it is); it misses the opportunity to show the misfits living differently from the tyranny they left behind. It's just more of the same controlling mean-spiritedness. By this time one has already had enough and wants less rather than more of what took place before.<br/><br/>Even a plot twist fails. There could have been tension and suspense. Instead, it was done so quickly, one wonders why it didn't happen sooner.<br/><br/>The characters are deliberately bland and almost robotic thus making it difficult to identify with anyone. When David makes a ridiculous and stupid decision by the end, the feeling of disappointment is further fueled."

","Collin Farrell knows exactly how to deliver his lines (with a satisfying native Irish accent) in The Lobster. Writer/Director Ygoros Lanthimos must've been giddy behind the camera, as his world of strangeness and deadpan humor was captured. A very promising future is set for the both of them. (See: The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Also see: my coming critique.) <br/><br/>It's very refreshing to get a tone of weird, absurdest humor out of otherwise dull language. The way he writes his dialogue in repetitive, robotic flow makes for an intriguing study of the human condition. <br/><br/>This is the movie's strongest aspect. Unfortunately, it becomes exhaustive and stretched well passed its welcoming universe. <br/><br/>About the halfway mark, we leave the setting that promised obscure and terrifying things to take place, and instead the writer seems to go out of his way to make a more structured message on love. You will find such a message, but it's beaten and kicked to death, leaving the viewer a bit insulted that no confidence was held in him earlier to find it himself.<br/><br/>Strange and uncomfortable movies are what I get most revved up about and this certainly had that charm, albeit for a shorter time than its 2 hour running. What really upsets me and irks is the useless interfacing between pointless characters
and a reaching climax that rehashes themes attempting to really hone in the message. <br/><br/>In my opinion, Farrel, the dark hotel of lonliness and the animal conversion machine could have been cultivated toward a truly shocking 
twist and utter devastation that would have shaken the audience. <br/><br/>Instead, its interesting rhythm fizzles, and we're left with what feels like a pretentious artist sticking with the flat-line tone he should have shed in the second act."
"vubrett","9","0","3","30 April 2018"," We are currently living in similar dystopia
","I just watched this movie today, after watching ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" by the same director, Yorgos Lanthimos, and also featuring Colin Farrell.<br/><br/>Lanthimos makes movies in the same genre as Stanley Kubrick (most notably ""The Shining"" and ""Clockwork Orange."").<br/><br/>In movies that touch topics like dystopia and humanity and its vices, this one is one of those that I usually sit and think about by a window with a nice hot cup of coffee.<br/><br/>Throughout human history, we as species, are smart enough to think up rules of how we live among one another, but sometimes are very dumb as to think of the logic of why those rules exist. Most rules are made up by usually of one man or one group who happen to think it, and for the rest of history, it stays as a rule. Examples include, why do Hindus not eat cow (beef)? Why did the Salem Witch Hunt occur; how about the Spanish Inquisition? How did Joseph McCarthy come into power? Why can't a family unit consist of two women or two men raising a child? What are the consequences of one-child policy of China today? Or how about the idea that humans need to carry on their family name while wishing for a son. All of them because one man or group of men, thought it might make sense (at that time.) But I repeat myself.<br/><br/>Those are the crazy questions that come about in real world, as the fictional world of the Lobster is just as crazy. I assume your parents have always asked you, when are you gonna get married and bring me a grandchild. Everyone probably has a crazy uncle or traveling aunt who never married. Remember the term, spinsters, alluding to a stereotype of an older woman who is unmarried, childless, prissy, and repressed. Those are the exact goals of the dystopia world of David, where you need to be a coupled or otherwise you are useless to this world, and we rather have you be useful as an animal.<br/><br/>But besides thinking of crazy rules for 7 billions human beings to follow, the movie also brings out the dysfunctionality of rules that are to be followed by what we today call the Government, or the state. Crazy ideas at one time about slavery, sitting in back of buses, not sharing drinking fountains, no free speech for certain people, but just as much free hate speech for others, diversity and tolerance only for those who agree with you, etc.<br/><br/>The movie shows that on either side (the left or the right) there is dysfunction. The two groups, the hotel runs it like a prison, where masturbation gets your hands burned; and when you get away free, the Loners has its own set of ridiculous rules to follow, like no flirting. At the mall, there's the set of rules where you need to have your papers (like drivers licence or passport) with you at all times. Humans are ridiculous, in deed and indeed.<br/><br/>We are currently living in a dystopian world right now, where Trump is capitalizing on people's craziness for bias, double standard, false news reported as truth, and resistance. Just as dystopia was when certain group thought Jews deserve to be burned in ovens. <br/><br/>We are living in a dystopia and not even know it. That's what the Lobster is trying to say."

","I'm not sure how to feel about this movie. Its pretty strange.<br/><br/>Acting/Characters - None of the characters show any emotion. The line delivery is flat and lifeless all around. Somehow, the characters seem to have personalities, but that might just be me projecting myself on them. That could be the point. The acting is good, though. I can believe how nothing the characters are. They are all consistent. <br/><br/>Plot - The pacing is very slow, and the plot, though stupid, is fairly easy to follow. Its hard to tell why everyone is doing everything because of the lack of characters but its still an ok plot. I think its supposed to be a comedy but I didn't really find any of it funny. It wasn't boring either. Just really strange.<br/><br/>Sights and Sounds - There are a lot of long takes. One the one hand, its impressive. On the other, it doesn't help with the pacing. This movie is much longer than it needs to be. The music is extremely repetitive and the same few scores are reused again and again. <br/><br/>Absurdity - This movie doesn't actually get that absurd other than the idea of people turning into animals (which is never really shown). The weirdest part is that no-one has any emotions and everyone talks really casually about everything. Though the main distinguishing feature about this movie is that its weird, its actually not as weird as it could've been. If this whole concept was redone and the characters actually had emotions and fell in love over actual personalities, this could actually be very entertaining. I'd also have enjoyed it more if it followed someone who turned into an animal which has the potential to be funny. This movie was mainly weird and boring. This movie is listed as a Drama and a Comedy, but it is neither.<br/><br/>Narration - There is some really weird narration throughout the entire movie (it starts at the beginning and I don't think that this counts as a spoiler) that is never explained. In most of the instances of the narration, you get to hear about things that happened directly after they happen which is annoying. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is full of wasted potential. Though I enjoyed watching this movie, I wouldn't recommend it or watch it again. The only reason you should watch this is out of curiosity. Be warned though, this movie is boring, uncomfortable, weird and kind of stupid."

","Some movies are fascinating without being enjoyable--maybe emotionally dissatisfying but intellectually compelling. That's ""The Lobster"" for me. I have to add that I did get some emotional satisfaction out of the sheer quality of acting and visuals, the general fabric of the film--or else the casual animal and human deaths would have caused me to leave the theatre. Then watching it again, I realized the humor takes hold of me and I will sit through the very dark joke.
It is definitely science fiction about a future dystopian society. Those who think sci-fi has to come with wild special effects and mind-blowing hardware and latex body suits need to remember that sociology, anthropology and psychology are also sciences. However, as a staunch fan of Rocket the racoon, I have to say piles of space alien carnage are easier to take that the animal deaths in The Lobster. BUT--The Lobster IS STILL A GOOD PIECE OF CINEMATIC SCI FI."
"Turfseer","5","0","2","26 December 2017"," Clever but not enjoyable, downbeat tale of dystopian community
","I can't disagree that the subject of Yorgos Lanthimos' ""The Lobster"" is a dystopian community. Dystopia is defined as a community that is undesirable or frightening but usually stories about such communities are set in the future. Lanthimos, however, provides no back story to his seemingly futuristic narrative, so it probably would be better to label it a ""fable."" From interviews I've read, Lanthimos is content to have viewers draw their own conclusions as to what the film is about. He apparently has drawn no conclusions of his own and is more devoted to the creative process in contrast to offering up a calculated ""message.""<br/><br/>Lanthimos' vision is a bleak one at that. His protagonist is David (a one-note Colin Farrell), who finds himself at a special hotel after his wife has left him for another man. In this universe, if you don't have a mate, you have 45 days to find another one, or else you're transformed into an animal. This is perhaps the weakest part of the film, as the transformation process is never explained or shown and you just have to accept this plot point on faith--which seriously damages the overall verisimilitude of the narrative.<br/><br/>The hotel residents can extend their stay by hunting ""loners"" in the forest by shooting them with tranquilizer darts. Other rules become apparent such as no masturbation (but sexual stimulation by the hotel maid is mandatory). David befriends two men; one, Robert, is punished for masturbating by having his hand burned inside a toaster-the other, John, purposely bangs his head on tables so that his nose will bleed. The main rule for mating is that the couples should have some idiosyncrasy in common. John finds a woman who suffers from nosebleeds and the two are paired off.<br/><br/>David ends up finding a woman who has the highest ""kill"" rate in shooting loners in the forest. While in a Jacuzzi, she feigns choking, and David, desiring to prove that he's as cold as her, sits there impassively. The woman decides to partner up with David but things take a real bizarre turn when she kicks a dog to death (who happens to be David's brother-transformed earlier into a dog). When David cries, she realizes his earlier ""cruel act"" was a ruse and drags him to the hotel manager, ordering that David immediately be turned into an animal.<br/><br/>David I suppose has the last laugh, when, with the aid of a sympathetic maid at the hotel, he tranquilizes the woman, who is turned into an animal. At this point David escapes from the hotel and joins the loners in the forest. You would expect the loners to be the ""good guys"" but this is where Lanthimos proffers up what might be called a ""twist"" of sorts<br/><br/>The loners don't believe in romance at all and if you try to become a couple, they'll mutilate you. The head of the loners (Léa Seydoux) leads raids to disrupt the activities at the hotel. David breaks into John's cottage and reveals to his mate that his nosebleeds are artificially induced. Worse, the head of the loners convinces the husband of the hotel manager to willingly shoot her, which he does, only to discover that the gun is loaded with blanks.<br/><br/>The second half of the plot deals with David meeting another loner, a shortsighted woman (Rachel Weisz). Since David is also shortsighted, they bond and plan to run away together. But a mole discovers the woman's journal and she's brought to the city in a ruse to cure her shortsightedness. Instead a doctor intentionally blinds the woman.<br/><br/>David and the woman still decide to run away and in a bizarre climax, David enters the bathroom in a restaurant where he is about to intentionally blind himself with a knife, so the couple will still have something in common with one another.<br/><br/>That's it folks! It's all very clever and probably designed to be a little shocking in its unrelenting, bleak view of people who are unable to rebel against the authoritarian world they find themselves in. It could be a parable for a place like North Korea but there's not enough history to explain the world we find ourselves observing. <br/><br/>David's decision to mutilate himself suggests that he hasn't been able to escape the world he seeks to rebel against. Since there's little to cheer about here, we're left to admire the director's imagination-but his downbeat tale doesn't prove very enjoyable or even that enlightening."

","I have watched ""The Lobster"" after watching ""The Killing of A sacred deer"", and I must say ""The Lobster"" is much worse.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos probably is addicted to making pretentious, overly-symbolic movies and yet he forgets that a good movie is not made of symbols or weird movie scripts, but of good character development, good cinematography and a decent movie duration.<br/><br/>Here, we don't have any of these 3 items. Character development is one of the poorest I have ever seen in a movie. The way actors speak make they look like robots. I am pretty sure Lanthimos wanted this to happen on purpose to make the movies look ""quirkier"" , but it only makes the movie boring and insufferable to watch. Léa Seydoux's and Rachel Weisz's ridiculously amateurish performances made me want to punch them in their faces. I swear, they are worse than amateur actors having drama classes in high school. Colin Farrell makes the movie more palatable, giving a very natural and humble performance, but he cannot save the movie, because once again, HIS CHARACTER IS NOT DEVELOPED. We cannot give a damn about anything about him. We don't care. Lanthimos creates characters we don't care about.<br/><br/>Regarding cinematography, mediocre at most. Though photography is okay, the soundtrack kills the movie. I was almost going insane with all those cellos, being repetitively played in every scene. Enough is enough. <br/><br/>Also, the movie is too long for a mediocre story. <br/><br/>Yes, the story is mediocre and disappointing. I was mildly interested during the first half at the hotel - which seemed to be a parody of our sick and disturbed society, but after the main character leaves the hotel and goes to woods, the movie becomes a poorly developed crappy love story. <br/><br/>What a pretentious and boring movie. Like I said about ""The Killing of a sacred deer"", Lanthimos thinks his movies are better than they really are. He probably thinks he's the next Kubrick but he's definitely not him."

","Rather a critique/ satire of the way society can influence a relationship.

Of course he isn't the only one who is doing this, but his style of making those things is quite special, and personally I adore it. The Lobster is a film when you can discuses his symbolism and meaning for a while, and the humour and the absurd style of the narrative it's keeping the film for getting boring quickly. I'm not going to discuses it here anyway, yet I want to mention that I like (and I think that Lanthimos did a better job with) the symbolism/ satire here more than in Κυνόδοντας (Dogtooth), however as a move as whole I prefer Κυνόδοντας (Dogtooth) over The Lobster, I just consider that he did a better satire of society here, that's it. And yes, the aspects of society both movie critique are different, is just my opinion that the execution and the way he placed in the movie is more on my preference.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>I watched it 90% because of the title alone (ha) and 10% the plot seemed original, which it most certainly was. In this world, people live in a society that dictates that you must be in a relationship at all times. Anyone 'found' to be without a mate, is bused to a hotel where you have 90 days to find a mate OR be turned into an animal.an animal of your choice at least. The staff at this hotel institute certain measure to facilitate the 'guests' to find mates. The film's tone is semi-dark and offbeat and all the color is heavily muted; lacking color saturation. There are some surreal moments and a fitting score while the story plays out at an methodical pace. The story tends to drag a little in act 2 but act 3 leaves many story points open ended with intrigue. The sub-message appears to hint at society's influence that people should strive for relationships/marriage and those who don't tend be treated as blacks sheep. Certainly worth a look for those seeking something anti- Transformers."

","This is a ""what did I just watch?"" type of film filled with dry humor on relationships.<br/><br/>David (Colin Farrell) loses his wife and goes to a rigidly run hotel to meet someone new and hopefully be able to be returned to the city. If he fails, he goes to the Transformation Room and is turned into an animal of his choosing, in his case a lobster. He is there with Bob, a dog who is his brother. Pairing is done rather oddly. One man gives himself nose bleeds so he can be judged compatible with a woman who suffers from nose bleeds. They pair and don't get turned into animals. Some humans resist being turned into animals and leave the hotel. They are called runners and are hunted by hotel guests to allot them extra time to pair up. David experiences life paired up, and then as a runner where he meets Rachel Weisz, a woman he truly loves. What he does for love will surprise you.<br/><br/>The film rates as an ""oddball"" which I might of found funny watching it with the right crowd instead of alone.

"jamesrupert2014","7","0","1","28 August 2017"," Offbeat, very black comedy – not for everyone
","In a dystopian world, where single people are required to find appropriate partners or be turned into animals, a counterculture of loners exist, where romantic relationships are punished by mutilation. Colin Ferrell's character, whose wife has left him, moves from one culture, in which he has decided to become a lobster if he cannot find a mate, to the other, where he falls in love with Rachel Weisz's character, and suffers the consequences. The movie is slow moving, dead-pan and surreal – whimsical in some places, coarse and brutal in others. Cryptic and metaphorical, the story takes place in three locations: 'the hotel', where you need to find a mate, 'the woods' where the loners roam, and 'the city' where couples live. Keeping with the premise that you need to find your match rather than an autonomous person, few of the characters have names, but rather are known by a 'characteristic' (e.g. girl with nose bleeds) that is the basis for initial pairing (if a singleton) or by their job (e.g. 'the maid). Funny at times, especially when the po-faced hotel management are explaining the system, but certainly not for all tastes."
"brando647","8","0","1","21 August 2017"," Surreal, Absurd, Endearing & Funny; THE LOBSTER is a Bizarre One I Highly Recommend
","The latest film I can obsessively recommend to my friends, knowing they'll probably never watch it, is THE LOBSTER. I think I first took notice of it when Cracked mentioned it in an article on (then) upcoming insane movies that weren't getting enough attention and the plot synopsis demanded I track down this movie and watch it as soon as I could. In THE LOBSTER, Colin Farrell is a man who is recently single and must attend a program wherein he has 45 days to find a new mate or he will be turned into an animal. He chooses as his potential future animal a lobster because of their long life, blue blood, and lifetime of fertility. The film, from Greek writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos, is set in a dystopian world where relationships are government- regulated and loners, those who manage to escape their transformative fate, are outcasts that live in the forests. People attending the resort in search of a mate can extend their time through a hunting ritual where they're released into the woods with tranquilizer guns to hunt the loners, garnering additional days for every loner they bring in for transformation. The film chronicles the desperation of our main character David (Farrell) as he does whatever he can to find a new connection before accepting more drastic measures and going the route of a fugitive loner, where he happens to meet a lovely woman (Rachel Weisz) who might in fact be his ideal mate, assuming they get out alive.<br/><br/>THE LOBSTER is a surreal gem of a film that I can't seem to shake from my mind for a while after watching it. There's just so much here to break down and examine. I'm obsessed with the strange world that Lanthimos and co- writer Efthymis Filippou have created. We've got this bizarre world where the government mandates that everyone must have a mate to the point where, if authorities see you wandering a city alone, they can demand to see your papers verifying your relationship status. There's a strange recurring theme where you can only exist as either end of a spectrum with no gray area in between. For example, in addition to the outright relationship vs. loner existence, there's a moment at the beginning of the film where David is partaking in the resort's entrance exam and he's asked his sexual orientation. He claims as heterosexual but then admits he had engaged in some experimentation at a point earlier in life and wanted to know if he could be labeled bisexual but, no, this isn't allowed (there is some mention that this had caused some complications within the program at some point in the past). Each society exists by a strict set of rules that operate as polar opposites; masturbation at the resort will get your hand mauled whereas making out in the loner tribe will scar you with the ""red kiss"". It's all so strange and infinitely interesting with a hint of vague social commentary on relationships within.<br/><br/>I find it difficult to make a case for people to check out THE LOBSTER. If you're not as intrigued by the strange world Lanthimos and Filippou have created as I am, you might find the movie dull. It's got a very dry sense of humor and all of the dialogue is delivered in a flat, matter-of-fact manner with little or no emotion with few exceptions. The characters are almost robotic in their behavior and the only ones who come across as near-human are David and Weisz's short-sighted woman. There's another strange element: Farrell's David is the only character in the entire movie with a name. Everyone else is defined by a trait. Weisz is short-sighted. John C. Reilly has a lisp. Ben Wishaw has a limp. The characters populating the world of THE LOBSTER define themselves by one outstanding trait and seek their mate based on that trait, to the point that some will even fake it just to avoid transformation; even when not trapped in the ""civilized"" world, David desperately seeks that shared trait with the short-sighted woman to feel secure in his affections for her. I find more to love about this quirky little film the more I mull it over in my mind and I'm sure there's an audience for this sort of oddity out there but I know it could very well be off-putting for a lot of people. It's surreal, absurd, funny, and endearing, and now I kind of want to watch it again."

","This movie illustrates the problems of social pressure that has to do with marriage and to choose to fit in in a group of others who are like you.

But it does succeed it carrying the deliberate meaning and making the viewer think about the subject again. The overall aura of the movie is dull and awkwardly calm. Not only the visuals, but even the way the characters speak is bland and abnormal. The dullness might make the movie tedious for some people, but it also adds to the effect of delivering its message. Although this movie is saying how the social pressure to conform is unnecessary and even ridiculous, it has an ironic ending, that although is a cliffhanger, leaves room for the viewers to think about it."

","Screenplay: the movie shows a society that treats relationships in a logical way which it's necessary to be in one (and if don't find someone who loves you, you'll be transformed in an animal) and you would only love someone if that person has the same characteristics or interests. It demonstrates how we are dependent of attention and love to a point where society demands that someone must be in love.<br/><br/>Acting: the acting is really dull and in some way robotic, but it fits for the theme of the movie. The people in this world behave in a logical way. They don't fall in love because of love (duh!) but because it's the only logical choice.<br/><br/>Scenario/Costume: I really like how the design of the Hotel tries to prove that couples are better than single persons as the former has access to superior levels of the hotel, yachts and cooler activities. The same can be said about the costume, the couples always wear suits, tuxedos and dresses, while the loners (the guild of the singles) look like hobbos.<br/><br/>Directing: the directing is really great (specially about the scenario part i said before) but what really bothers me is that the movie never explain why everyone in the Hotel wears the same clothes. I can't think of a reason why this would help the residents or the staff."

","This movie is as weird as a camel in a forest. It has you figuring out what's really going on, whether the people get interned in the hotel by choice or by law, for a long time. The polite service and the pretty surroundings of the hotel create a stark contrast with the many rules, mandatory activities, psychological abuse and draconian measures. The matter of fact proceedings and dialogues, the ready acceptance of horrible circumstances contrast with the insanity of the system and the mental anguish the people must feel. Expressions of emotions are usually deliberately subdued, which exacerbates the surreal experience for the audience. <br/><br/>Figuring out the world depicted in that movie is as much fun as trying to understand why it was constructed this way. Did Yorgos Lanthimos write the whole thing as a hyperbole to actual life? Is uncovering the hypocrisy of the hotel owners relationship a central message, is the mad search for a common ""defining"" characteristic something he really thinks is happening in the world or is it an analogy for something else? <br/><br/>If you watch this movie with an open mind, it will stay with you for a long time, which is one of the most valuable characteristics available.<br/><br/>The acting performances are universally great, although the absence of displayed emotion creates a slightly skewed measurement of course.<br/><br/>Heightened spoiler alert...<br/><br/>I'd love to give this movie more than 7/10, but I can't do that for two reasons. First one is unnecessary graphic violence. To show the still frame of a dog (that's actually a person) who has been kicked to death, for a perceived 5 seconds, is just bad taste, nothing else. Showing the bloody shin of the women is more than enough. It makes little to no sense for Lea Seydoux to have Rachel Weisz kill the former hotel maid. Driving home the point that the heartless woman has no heart can be done less painful than having a suicidal woman scream for an eternity while she bleeds to death. The second reason is the beginning and the ending. It's just too easy to let the audience hanging, I think in most movies an inconclusive ending is just a cheap shot at extending the previously mentioned effect of it sticking in your mind. The same goes for the unexplained and deliberately enigmatic beginning."

","I had heard reviews of The Lobster and, while sounding interesting, it also sounded odd enough to delay me in getting round to seeing it. Like many have said, the plot is weird; single people are sent to a hotel and given a period of time to find a match or else they will be turned into the creature of their choosing and released to the wild. Those struggling can add days to their stay by being successful on hunts for those singles who have broken free and live as collective individuals in the woods.<br/><br/>The concept is cleverly constructed so that it is weirdly convincing despite its utter absurdity. Within this the film satirizes relationships, singles – in particular the extremes of those two situations. The push for companionship, with its common ground, and its rituals, and the digs at elements of life such as children distracting from conflict. Perhaps it hit a bit too close to home with its regimented rituals, and awkward neediness. On the other side the extreme version of singlehood is also dug at once we are in the woods. It is not as clever as some would tell you, nor as smart, but it is certainly interesting, darkly funny, and pretty engaging throughout. It doesn't pull it off totally, but I enjoyed it from start to finish – its oddity runs through from the ideas, the performances, down into the specific dialogue. Having such a great cast helps, but the tightness of creative vision throughout is what holds it all together. As odd and slightly unsuccessful as it is, it is still well worth watching."

","One of 2016's most unique and bizarre films is the pitch-black comedy, ""The Lobster"". Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, an idiosyncratic Greek 'angry young man' filmmaker who had previously garnered both praise and excoriation with his 2009 Oscar-nominated ""Dogtooth"", this provocative and uncompromising surrealist masterpiece is set in a dystopian near-future in which only couples are allowed to survive. If any unfortunate citizen should become single through divorce or death, they are given 45 days to find a new mate to marry or are punished by being transformed into an animal and released into the woods. The one silver lining in this dark cloud is that each unsuccessful single gets to choose which animal. A lobster is the bizarre choice of our protagonist, an emotionally scarred architect named David, brilliantly played by Colin Farrell with a perennial deer-in-the-headlights expression. Rachel Weisz is the woman with whom he forms a bond in the film's second half when he fatefully falls into a group of rebels who have made it illegal to couple.<br/><br/>Almost universally lauded by critics for being a razor-sharp satire of societal templates examining sexual mores and the desperately sad world of single dating, ""The Lobster"" is also a moving if unconventional love story rooted in the theater of the absurd, a Kafkaesque fable that perfectly combines Swiftian wit with Mozartian elegance as, in the words of one critic, ""it opens (one's) eyes to a new way of storytelling."" It is rare cinematic caviar for both the eyes and the mind of the most discriminating. As to the film's fastidiously luxurious visual style, Lanthimos seems the successor to Stanley Kubrick -- but as if the director of ""A Clockwork Orange"" had mated with a scorpion.<br/><br/>Although it won the Jury Prize at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, many will not like this film. Samuel Beckett would have. I've seen it half a dozen times, each time loving it more. For the discerning few, this will be one of the most memorable cinematic experiences of recent years. For the rest, they can keep waiting for Godot."

","I had heard about this film on a film review programme, then again when Awards Season came along, I was obviously intrigued by the title, it had a good cast list, and the nominations got my interest, I was looking forward to it. Basically in an absurd near dystopian future, according to the laws of The City, single people will be arrested and transferred to The Hotel, a creepy place similar to an expensive spa. There people have 45 days to find a suitable partner, or they will be turned into an animal of their choosing, there they follow strict rules: masturbation is banned, sexual stimulation by the hotel maid is mandatory, and guests attend dances and watch propaganda explaining the advantages of partnership. David (Golden Globe nominated Colin Farrell) discovers his wife (Rosanna Hoult) has left him for another man, now single he is arrested and taken to The Hotel, his brother who became single has already been turned into a dog, the most common animal choice for people, David chooses to become a lobster, because of their cycle of life and his love for the sea. At the hotel, David makes acquaintances with a Limping Man (Ben Whishaw) and a Lisping Man (John C. Reilly), while many of the female residents try to persuade him to become their partner, including a Biscuit Woman (Ashley Jensen) and Nosebleed Woman (Jessica Barden). To have a compatible relationship, partners are required to have a distinguishing traits in common, and to extend their deadlines, residents can hunt and tranquillise single people hiding in the forest, a captured ""loner"" earns them a day. Many residents however are trying to end their stay at the hotel by faking traits, for example John constantly smashes his nose to to have nosebleeds like that of the female resident, the Hotel Manager (Olivia Colman) moves them to the couples section and gives them a month- long trial partnership, David decides to attempt a relationship with a notoriously Heartless Woman (Angeliki Papoulia), who has tranquillised more loners than anyone else. While in the couples' suite, David pretends to enjoy her cruel behaviour, including gaining her interest pretending to enjoy the biscuit- loving woman severely injuring herself jumping from a window, but he is broken-hearted when she finds she has kicked her brother (in dog form) to death, she decides they are not a match. The heartless woman drags him to the hotel manager to face punishment, to be turned into an animal no-one likes, but he is able to escape with the help of the sympathetic Maid (Ariane Labed), while his partner is tranquillised and transformed into an unspecified animal. Escaping the hotel, David finds the loners and their Leader (Skyfall's Léa Seydoux) in the woods, they themselves follow rules that contrast those of the hotel, masturbation is permitted, but romance is forbidden, with mouth mutilation as punishment, the maid is in fact a mole for the loners, aiding them to sabotage the hotel. Now joined with the loners, they launch a mini-raid on the hotel, during which David reveals to the nosebleed woman that John has been faking, the other loners hold the hotel manager and her husband at gunpoint, the husband is tricked into shooting his wife to save himself, but the gun is not loaded, the couple are left to face each other. David, who is shortsighted, finds a strong connection with loner member the Short Sighted Woman (Rachel Weisz), they begin a secret relationship, developing gestural code to communicate, but eventually their affections are discovered by the leader in the shortsighted woman's journal, as well as their plan to escape. The leader takes the shortsighted woman to the city, to have an operation to cure her shortsightedness, but this is in fact a punishment, she is blinded instead, in anger the woman accidentally kills the maid, thinking she is killing the leader. She tells David about her blindness, this means they no longer have anything in common, despite his efforts to find something, he says they will figure it out, and they will continue their plan to escape. David overpowers the leader, tying her up and leaving her to be eaten by dogs, he and the blind woman escape the city, stopping at a restaurant, David seeks to reestablish commonality, he prepares to blind himself in the bathroom with a steak knife, while the blind woman waits for him at the table. Also starring Michael Smiley as Loner Swimmer, Roger Ashton-Griffiths as Doctor and The Office's Ewen MacIntosh as Trainer Waiter - Shooting Range. The cast all give great performances, the story is wonderfully bizarre, a world where being a relationship is a matter of a life or death, many other fearsomely strange things are at foot as well, including characters speaking completely honestly about everything, including sex and desire, it is beautifully shot, and the script is fantastically sharp, funny and satirical, as a movie it is an acquired taste, but it is a most watchable and interesting dystopian science-fiction black comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best British Film. Good!"
"saccitygrl","6","0","1","20 February 2017"," A puzzle that may or may not be worth figuring out
","As everyone has clearly stated this film is weird. <br/><br/>I was not familiar with the film when it popped up on Amazon. I checked it out solely because I enjoy Rachel Weiss....how bad could it be?<br/><br/>Bad isn't the word for this film. Rather, confused. I think you spend the majority of the time during the initial watching trying to figure out WHY the heck the things you are watching are happening. Its a strange world and about 2/3s of the film feels like like watching a puzzle slowly take shape.<br/><br/>When you finally figure out the why, things get even odder. The motivations of the main characters become something of a complete mystery--why do they return to the hotel to torment their former 'friends'? Why do they feel the need to venture to town? Why does the lead character feel he must make the choice he faces in the mirror? Its a weird turn for someone who appears to have come to reject the rules of both communities represented in the film.<br/><br/>I guess the big theme the film wrangles with is how society forces a narrative on our lives and how people brainwash themselves to fit into those stories. An interesting twist is how whether one choose the mainstream story or the rebel/alternative story, either one requires an individual to brainwash and contort themself into an psychological pretzel. <br/><br/>The commentary about relationships embedded in the film is rather chilling but rings a bit true. Altbeit its a bit much to think of a world where being single is the most aberrant thing a person could opt for. <br/><br/>Perhaps a second watching may help with puzzling the whys out, but its a rather slow movie and I have yet to devote the time and attention to trying to sort out the subtle themes. I am not sure I will take a stab at it again, but its a curious enough film that I am tempted."

","The purpose of this film is not to tell a straight forward story or an well know or mediumly talked subject, or even to teach a social message.<br/><br/>This film is a description of a world that can be called extreme or fantasious by our actual standards (and im being soft because our actual world can be worst) but i think is not supposed to convince us that our world is like that, or should be like that. Of course, filmed in common scenario, including well know actors performing in real locations, can lead us to think that it telling us a story of today, but it isn't, and i think thats were some people didn't like it.<br/><br/>The best way to look at this movie is like seeing a duck decoy, of course, it doesn't cuack, it doesn't fly, it doesn't swim, because it is not supposed to be a real duck even if it looks like one; however, in the job of atraccting ducks by using a well crafted piece of wood and high skill painting, its wonderful and works great.<br/><br/>Finally and talking about the actors and goriness or if, i think that particular ingredients are the directors view of how to tell this particularly story, and in my opinion their impact is well fitted to the kind of story hes tryng to tell."

","When the movie begins, you'll quickly think: ""what am I seeing?"". But as you continue watching it, you will understand you are watching an incredible metaphor of the real world. You will have moments of silence, complemented with an original soundtrack, apparently moments of non-sense (you will realize later it totally makes sense) and Colin Farrell changing during the movie. After the movie, you will understand you are one of the characters everyday, when you wake up and go to work. It's a quite disturbing thought, as you will see the plot is quite twisted, but I would say it's an excellent portrait of nowadays and how the relationships are build. Highly recommended."

","It's not because I'm Greek, honestly, it's not. Or maybe it is, maybe there's something ingrained, some sort of deeply-rooted, ethnic support thing going on, I don't know.<br/><br/>I choose to believe that it's because I haven't watched such a well-made black comedy in years.<br/><br/>Because deadpan sarcasm speaks to me on a fundamental, primitive level.<br/><br/>Because hyperrealism is a powerful medium that, when used in the right way, can successfully create a dream-layered utopia where logic diminishes into nothing but an unwelcome afterthought after it has graciously offered its place to a fantastical world of boundless possibilities. And this is what Lanthimos did for me – it broke down the social limits as I know them and challenged me to think, not farther, but deeper into my own being.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the Lobster is an understated, dystopian love story that effortlessly made me laugh out loud while staring in its fun-house mirror of distortions — a claim not many movies can boast to have cast upon me.<br/><br/>And more to the crucial point, it's the one bloody film I didn't find myself needing bloody subtitles to understand Colin bloody Farrell's insane bloody dialect."
"framptonhollis","8","0","3","17 January 2017"," the first half was great, the second was just okay
","I am a huge fan of bizarre, black comedy, so the first half of this film was right up my ally. While the film's surreal sense of humor was still present in the second half of the film, it was not nearly as constant or even as funny as it had been. It's unfortunate that the second half of the film had to be so inferior, because I really wanted this movie to be great. However, after a while it got tedious and overly repetitive. Colin Farrell's character should have been developed a little more, the deadpan acting was very funny at first but became obnoxious by the end, and the 900th time the repetitive music score played I wanted to kill myself.<br/><br/>This film is hilarious, unique, and visually stunning. Many of the characters are very original and entertaining, and I cared about most of the conflict. However, the film really could have been better with some tweaks to the script, better performances, and a stronger second half. I also felt that the film would have genuinely worked better as a novel-I just got that sort of vibe from it. Perhaps this shouldn't be a movie in the first place, but a great sci-fi book by the likes of Kurt Vonnegut or Ray Bradbury."
"edge547","8","0","2","12 January 2017"," A totally fresh and original film
","Tired of seeing the same old boring drivel over and over again? Want to watch something new and original? Check out The Lobster. You will not be disappointed. This film feels totally fresh. It takes place in a world that looks similar to our own but which we soon discover is vastly different than anything any of us may have experienced. It's more like a strange dream or a nightmare, and every minute of it is full of fun.<br/><br/>The story—which deals with a divorced man who is staying at a hotel where single people hope to meet a significant other or else be turned into an animal of their choosing—is totally unpredictable and leaves us on the edge of our seat in nervous anticipation. Then, halfway through, just when we think we know what's going to happen next, it takes a huge turn and we're off on the next leg of our adventure. Then it takes another turn and then another. It builds in excitement and intensity—and insanity—right up until the end, and before we know it the two hours have gone by in what feels like half the time. And the ending is amazing. I didn't even see it coming until thirty seconds beforehand and I couldn't help but smile as it unfolded.<br/><br/>The characters and the story are bizarre and unreal, nothing like real life, but that's what is so good about it. Even their speech patterns are strange, which makes the voice-over narration all the more enjoyable and ridiculous. At first it feels like bad acting but then we get used to it and then we start to love it. But it's not by any means dumb comedy. On the contrary, it's very smart and deliberate in what it does. And this film has a spectacular sense of humor that is all its own and which stems from these bizarre and unique characters.<br/><br/>At one point, the character played by John C. Reilly in perhaps his finest role, stares in bewilderment at man who asks him if he's ever danced before. After several awkward seconds, Reilly replies, quite matter-of-factly and with a lisp, ""Yes,"" only to then be asked what kind of dancing he did. Frustrated and still confused, Reilly sighs and responds: ""It depends on the music."" It's hilarious because it's exactly what the character should say but not what we would ever expect him to say. And the film is full of wonderful moments such as this, all dry and all hilarious.<br/><br/>The writing and acting are exceptional and unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's been said that there are only seven or eight stories, each being told over and over again in different ways. But The Lobster seems to defy that statement. I can't think of any other movie or story to compare this to. This is truly a one-of-a-kind film and I feel it will develop a huge lasting legacy."

","This is a dark satire, set not so much in the future but in a kind of parallel present, in which being single is outlawed. Without a partner, you're either pray for hunters, or you have a chance to hook up with someone in a kind of institutional hotel. If you fail, you get taken to a transformation room, where you're turned into an animal.<br/><br/>The film maintains a deadpan tone throughout, in vibrant contrast to the horrible deeds perpetrated by and upon the characters. The cast, led by Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux and Olivia Colman, enact scene after outrageous scene with straight faces. Goodness knows how they did it.<br/><br/>It's merciless, often very funny, and as far as English-language movies are concerned there's really nothing like it that I'm aware of. A treat."
"Sergiodave","7","0","2","1 January 2017"," Insane but unmissable I think
","Set in a dystopian world in what feels like a 1960's/70's setting The Lobster is a unique movie about love. Described on IMDb as a comedy, It might be one of the blackest comedies I've seen, or alternatively, it is an idea of a bleak past/future. It is shot in a very stark and minimalist way, reminiscent of Fahrenheit 451, so the quality of the acting is essential, ergo, this is not a Hollywood production! Colin Farrell shows a surprising acting ability, by being a nobody, an uninteresting guy you wouldn't take a second glance at. Rachel Weisz as the female lead is her usual brilliant self (she is also the narrator of the tale) and Olivia Coleman as the Hotel Manageress is fantastic. I can't say you will love it but it definitely will be memorable. I enjoyed it ,I think!"
"warren-87235","7","0","2","30 December 2016"," Truly odd, but oddly fascinating
","Having watched The Lobster (oddly enough, following Batman Vs Superman... what a complete difference!), I can honestly say I found it a strangely compelling and enjoyable film. Don't get me wrong, it's truly odd and unusual, and won't be for everyone, but if you like quirky and strange films every bit as much as your blockbusters, you may find this quite enjoyable. Every few minutes, you will find yourself thinking ""What the...?!"" but in a good way.<br/><br/>I've read some of the one star reviews, and whilst I can't argue with a lot of what they say (it's trite, shallow, emperor's new clothes, etc.), I also think they're missing the point. If you want to look for some deep commentary that satirises modern relationships and gender politics, this is not it. If you look for that, and believe that's what the film is about, then you *will* find it shallow, and an ""Emperor's new clothes"" experience (If that's what the creators intended, then yes, they missed the mark).<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this isn't a film with any message; this is a dream that has been brought to life with actors. The logic and reality of this world makes no sense, until you place it in the context of a dream, and then everything makes sense, in the same way the strange and unusual does in your own dreams. I don't mean that as an excuse, where anything can be allowed ""because it's a dream"", but because the logic, script and reality of the film fit perfectly with how a dream works.<br/><br/>What The Lobster ultimately ends up being, is a truly unusual little romance. My one complaint would be the finale. It fails in the way that I think many horror films fail. Horror movie creators all-too-often think that because they're making a horror film, they have to have the protagonist/s almost win, then something bad happens in the very last moments and they lose, which is as clichéd, tired and predictable an ending as a horror movie can have. Likewise, 'art house' films like this, all-too-often have ambiguous ends, that want to 'leave it to the viewer' to decide what happens. Sometimes that can seem forced, just because they want to avoid a 'hollywood', but then they can end up being as predictable and clichéd (in their own right) as the ending they were trying to avoid.<br/><br/>The Lobster falls into that trap, at the very final moment, but is otherwise a very different film experience that can be enjoyed in its own context. Having said that, I can completely understand where people are coming from who do not enjoy it. You'll just have to decide for yourself."

And it was yet again a thoroughly stimulating absurd surrealistic dark comedy, unique to its core. Wrapped up with a violently emotive score unfolds a story about finding love against the clock in a concentration camp for loners or turned into a animal of choice.

So Basically this film directly makes fun of what society or how it treats people in the most stupidest way possible, the complications of love , relationship among others. It even takes a fair take on why is it always necessary to be together or how racial discrimination and that of against LGBT community is there. Apart from this the film is purely atmospheric only to be loved by some. The problem with this film is that the ways in which it shows us all this is creative full not fully explored .Towards the beginning it's actually wonderful but near its end it's impossible to sit through last 45 minutes without sleeping. I would not say much despite the fact if u want to watch this movie then watch it for its honest take on what freedom actually means. The premise is promising but not effective. I would not recommend to anyone but to those having high critical thinking or acquired taste. For such it will be a treat for others absolutely pointless.

I won't recap the plot. But I will say that I loved the deadpan dialogue that reminds us just how absurd life really is. And despite the laughs falling off in the second half of the film, that part is also important to the underlying thesis: human beings are mostly conformists to systems that they lock into place, for what start off as good reasons but are at odds with the complexity of human nature, at heart. <br/><br/>That's why the second half is crucial here.

In this dystopian version of life people who are single or cast out of relationships must follow protocol in order to regain the right to live within society again. In this world the main function of society is to create pairs, for if you have a partner you can better understand how life is supposed to be lived, or so the thinking is thought.<br/><br/>Once cast out of a relationship, or once one is found to be single they are directed to the hotel.

To show emotion is adverse or unnecessary, depending on which negative branch you believe in, in utilizing the process of matchmaking.

And as early as now, I am saying that the film did not disappoint me. <br/><br/>Frankly, upon seeing the opening scene, I did not have an idea on what the movie is going to be and I really love the fact that the story did not give hints on how it is going to end. In addition, I love how the writer incorporated symbolism in the story. <br/><br/>The film also reminds me of some Wes Anderson films as I have noticed in some of the movie's shots, framing and direction. However, I can definitely say that director has his own style making his craft. I was also impressed with the film's production design.

","I saw this at home on DVD from my public library. My wife quit after about 20 minutes, too absurd for her.<br/><br/>I added this movie to my watch list because of the actors, I like Farrell, Reilly, and Weisz. But I really knew nothing about the themes. I suppose if you look at the stories as indicators of real interpersonal relationships you might glean something about human nature. But it is scripted in such an unusual style, sort of like how it would sound if all the characters had Asperger's, everything direct and without humor or subtlety. <br/><br/>It is set in a universe that looks much like ours, or more specifically Ireland, but with very unusual customs. One is that if a person become single for some reason they are sent to a particular hotel, given a room, and they get 45 days to pair up with another person. If they don't then they get converted into an animal. Upon entry they get to choose which animal.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell is David, his wife left him and now he is here. He chooses to become a Lobster if he can't find a partner. Why? Because a lobster lives hundreds of years and remains sexually potent until very old age. Neglecting of course the possibility that he will be caught and eaten at a relatively young age.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly is part of the cast as Lisping Man. And Rachel Weisz is only known as Short Sighted Woman (short sighted is British for near- sighted vision). So all this plays out in an absurdist manner, everything is strange. It is not possible to write a simple synopsis but David and the Short Sighted Woman find they are compatible, both as runaways from the hotel, now living in the woods.<br/><br/>Several times I considered abandoning the movie but the absurdity of it all kept me watching. It definitely isn't a movie I'd watch again, or recommend to my friends, but I am glad I stuck with it. What an unusual movie!<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The end may be the whole point of the story. David and his new partner are in town in a restaurant, fugitives of sorts. She has been blinded by the authorities but he still has his sight. He says he loves her and wants to be like her. He asks the waiter for a fork and sharp knife, he goes into the men's room to put out his eyes, to become blind like she is. He looks in the mirror, he puts the point of the knife to his eyes, but the movie ends with her sitting at the table, waiting, waiting. It is ambiguous of course by my take is that he just couldn't go through with it, he couldn't blind himself, so he just went on his way and left her."

","The Lobster (2015): Dir: Yorgos Lanthimos / Cast: Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, John C. Reilly, Jessica Barden, Lea Seydoux: Strange science fiction comedy with a dark side. Colin Farrell stars as David who arrives at a strange hotel that deals with relationships in such a method that transforms guests into animals if they fail to find a partner within a set time. This is an amusing concept with images of exotic animals wandering about. He forms acquaintances with an insecure lisping man, played by John C. Reilly whose punishment for masturbating is having his hand burned in a toaster. David eventually attempts to cheat the system by pairing up with a heartless woman who ends up killing his dog. Jessica Barden plays a woman who has multiple nosebleeds and whose partner fakes nosebleeds to avoid animal transformation. David flees the hotel and encounters a group of loners in the forest whose rules forbid romantic relationship. Lea Seydoux plays the cold stare leader who demands that everyone dig their own graves. Rachel Weisz plays a short sighted woman whose relationship with David becomes hidden under gestures and signals. This leads to extreme consequences that involve her losing her sight. The ending is complicating and somewhat squeamish given the possible resolution to matching conditions. Nevertheless its theme of forceful relationships and social status is given a bizarre examination. Score: 8 / Writing: 66% / Themes: 66% / Acting: 100% / Directing: 100% / Visual: 100%"

","This odd movie was the one of the best things this year. Colin Farrell stars in this highly original movie that is an allegory for relationships. He is one of many single people who have 45 days at a hotel to make a match for marriage or they will be turned into whatever animal they choose. Our main character chooses a lobster. This is from the same awesome madman who directed ""Dogtooth"". The images are beautiful, the humor is dark and weird and the performances are great across the board. This is definitely a movie you will not know what is going to happen next. Oh how wonderful it is to still have those movies.. It's best to know next to nothing going on and I have given you very little. Enjoy."

","If you go on the website for The Lobster, it has a wonderfully clever way of introducing you to the film, as well as what the film is all about. As soon as you enter the site, it will ask you a series of questions that will determine what second-chance animal you should pick if you do not find love. At the end of the brief quiz, you will be given three choices based on your answers. From there, you have to pick one, and that's the animal you have to turn into if you do not find the right mate in forty-five days. From there, you can have a second- chance at love as a dog, cat, fish, flamingo, or whatever. My three animals I ended up with was a bison, gorilla, and horse. Of which one I decided to turn into, that is for you to find out.<br/><br/>This strange consideration of our sex life perfectly sums up everything talked about in the European satirical drama, The Lobster, with a call to revision on how an aristocratic society controls our path to satisfaction with a significant other.<br/><br/>What's shocking is that this dystopian world does not look far off from where we are now. Considering our high expectations surrounding sexual preference and gender roles, filmmakers in Europe knew that it was time to make a psychodrama like this to depict how our revision of sexual stimulation will change in the next few years.<br/><br/>Within this future, we are put in the shoes of David, a loner abandoned by his wife who has become numb over time to light and noise. In fact, neither he nor anyone else in his life show any hint of feeling at all. A calming narration by a mystery woman tells about how he is left to live in a hospital with restricting rules: he can't keep any of his personal belongings, he must wear one of their identical change of clothes, and within his forty-five day stay there, he must find love with another woman, or be turned into the animal of his choosing. In this case, he chose a lobster for its long lifespan. Whoever the narrator of this story is meant to be, by the film's final moments, the cruciality of the voice's identity will become clear.<br/><br/>In this unsettling world, change for healthy relationships is initiated as they teach the men that they must be dependent on a lover, and the women are taught how their safety is dependent on a man. The staff even goes as far as punishing secret masturbators with a toaster to the hand. If there are any loners hiding out in the moss-infested woods nearby, they are captured by patients with tranquilizer darts and sent to the well-maintained seaside hospital.<br/><br/>The surreal nature of this motion picture feels complete with a disruptive baroque musical, creating a haunting beat you will never remove from your memory. It evokes the lack of apparent fear, making the peacocks and camels seen wandering the woods feel expectant. The only change of thought the characters ever express is when a brother-turned-dog meets an unfortunate fate, and a girl's failed suicide attempt. It turns out though that creating a world without feeling generates all sorts of challenges for even the greatest of cinema artists.<br/><br/>While the characters certainly don't feel much, neither does the audience. A motion picture like this one ought to show master over orchestrating the audience to feel what the character's don't, which The Lobster does not fully succeed at. It gets harder to keep up with everything as well with the second half, when everything becomes practically a different type of movie with new characters and a new setting.<br/><br/>But it doesn't make The Lobster any less brilliant in its call to reconsideration of our own emotions. Director Yorgos Lanthimos makes it plainly clear how animals these days have a healthier concept of romance than we people do, as the turnaround of one man chained by unnecessary rules speaks to us."

","Months later I find I still can't get some of the images in this film out of my head: a figure standing on a distant scree so that it blends into the rock-face, a well-dressed couple walking down a deserted highway lined by hay bales, a dreary-sumptuous hotel interior destined to be as iconic as Kubrick's hexagon-covered Overlook. The Lobster is truly one of the best films of the decade in purely cinematographic terms: all praise to Thimios Bakatakis.<br/><br/>I've sat with the allegory—I won't spoil it—for those same months. I am feeling deeply uncertain about its merits. This is not a conventionally engaging film: because of its absurdities an audience will find it difficult to connect to the characters in and of themselves, and so, like the story of the ant and the grasshopper, neither of whom we yearn for or despise, the value of The Lobster must come from its protreptic meaning, what it makes us think about our own world, what lesson it draws us to.<br/><br/>That lesson seems to be no more than a string of ambivalent platitudes: love is greater than society, but society will win; there's no ""the one"" out there for you, but wouldn't it be nice if there were—well, maybe there is; human life is like a stay in a hotel, which is nice but also impermanent. I've been waiting for something more, something higher or at least something more original to crawl out of the chrysalis of this film, and now that summer has turned to autumn I've given up hope of new life. In terms of its content, The Lobster is almost irritatingly unmeaningful—not in the way great nihilist art can be, not in the way Fellini is—just grasping at a meaning far, far away from Yorgos Lanthimos' reach. <br/><br/>That said, it is well worth the VOD price—even better if it comes to a big screen near you—to experience the film's unique lens and the splendor of its setting. Just don't expect it to transcend the impermanent beauty of a rocky seaside resort."

","Yorgos Lanthimos is a very interesting filmmaker, what I've noticed about him is that he likes ambiguous endings and his story lines are weird. Yorgos Lanthimos directed a movie called Dogtooth back in 2009, that movie is just as weird as The Lobster. I believe if Yorgos Lanthimos keeps up his current track record of ""weirdo movies"", he'll either be discarded as an inexperienced filmmaker who can't tell a cohesive story, or he'll be admired as a brilliant unconventional filmmaker who goes against the ordinary way of story telling. <br/><br/>I like weird movies, but the movie has to make sense, and the movie has to have a cohesive story. <br/><br/>For me, The Lobster storyline not only makes sense but its execution is highly cohesive.<br/><br/>The Lobster is definitely a weird movie, its story execution is extremely bizarre, but the plot is not hard to follow. <br/><br/>I am of the belief that The Lobster is a contemporary piece about love and relationships.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell is fantastic in this movie; Farrel plays a man named David who is trying to find love, but the society that he lives in just wants him to find a suitable partner. Each character presented in this movie is forced to find a partner or be turned into an animal of their choosing. <br/><br/>The underlying theme presented here is just as real in our society, people want absolute love, people want to be with someone that they connect with, but sometimes people have to conform, and sometimes people have to settle for whatever is presented to them in order to survive.<br/><br/>The performances presented here are phenomenal all across the board. Ben Whishaw, John C. Reily, Léa Seydoux, and Rachel Weisz deliver exceptional performances in the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The directing choices are handled with craftsmanship, the wide angle shots are beautiful, and the deep focus shots play a huge part in telling the story.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is extremely bizarre, it's not conventional, it's abnormal, stunning, cohesive, underlying, and brilliant.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A"

","This was an odd experience, as I just recently ended a self-imposed 12-year moratorium on relationships, due to a couple of bad ones I had within a short period of time in the early 2000's. It was very intriguing to see a type of dystopia exist in which 'singledom' was so vilified to the point of actually being against the law. I would never have previously thought that such a state of events was possible, but recent trends in 'political correctedness' on the one hand and both religious and political radicalism on the other means that, sadly, nothing is impossible anymore. I thought it was a remarkable idea for a film, and both the soundtrack and cinematography were outstanding. The bizarre script and bold direction brought forth some of the best acting I have yet seen from Colin Ferrell, Rachel Weisz and John C.

","Sometimes the premise can just be weird, but nothing that I have ever seen is so lack of sense, purpose or necessity. Having said that, the clarity, vision, ambition for this non-sensical concept has to be appreciated along with a committed performance from its top stars. <br/><br/>In a future world where single people are taken to the 'Hotel' and given 45 days to find a suitable partner failing which they will be converted into an animal of their choice and sent off to the 'Woods'. David (Colin Farrell) has lost his wife recently after which he was moved to the 'Hotel'. Customary to the on-boarding process, the Guest has to decide which animal they would like to transform to in case they couldn't find a partner and David choose a 'Lobster'. <br/><br/>Colin Farrell was on the path to become an action superstar when he started his career with back to back box office hits until it got derailed spectacularly with Alexander. He is a terrifically talented actor and the duds allowed him to associate with movies of different genres without the necessity to alter scripts for mass appeal. 'The Lobster' is one such movie which is so offbeat, independent and full of experimentation. <br/><br/>The entire movie making process was structured, well edited, smartly produced and aptly cast. However the constant voice over to explain the proceedings shows a weak screenplay and the lack of purpose or necessity of the primary premise left me disconnected occasionally. There is also a rebellious group who fight to stay single (again without a purpose or a backstory) which again leaves you wondering about the motivation for any of their actions. The rebel leader's actions and why anyone would follow her also leaves you with more questions. Most of the unanswered questions doesn't feel like a meta narrative that lets the audience decide for themselves but as just incomplete.<br/><br/>While it is well made and acted, the disconnect & incompleteness of the primary premise didn't allow me indulge into its absurdity."

"avik-basu1889","9","0","3","12 August 2016"," Profundity in its most absurd form !!!
","Prior to watching this, I had already seen Lanthimos' 'Dogtooth'. So I was already somewhat familiar with his unconventional style of storytelling and I knew that 'The Lobster' was also going to be something weird. This is Lanthimos' first film in English. <br/><br/>The screenplay is written by Lanthimos and his screen writing collaborator Efthymis Filippou. Just like 'Dogtooth', the story creates this new world with new rules and regulations. Many reviewers have stated that the film is set in a dystopian future, but for me, this is a parallel universe. Lanthimos creates an alternate reality to satirise our own reality. This is a film of two halves. In the first half, he satirises the way relationships and marriage are viewed by society. In this film, if anyone is not in a genuine loving relationship with someone, he/she is supposed to be discriminated against. It is a commentary on our own society where so many people see marriage and relationships as the shortcut to happiness and it underlines how single middle aged people are deemed as 'losers' in our world. The film in its own absurd way shows how in this desperation to find a partner and be an ideal couple in the eyes of society, people tend to pretend to be someone else in order to find the perfect connection. By doing this they trade their own individuality for a fake and unstable relationship.<br/><br/>But the masterstroke in the writing and direction comes in the second half when the film starts undercutting it's own message and satire. The second half of the film shows how a society that completely rejects relationships can never be ideal too because this is also nothing short of dictatorship which smothers human choice. Lanthimos shows that no matter what, human beings still have a general need for companionship and relationship. So in a nutshell in the whole movie, Lanthimos and Filippou is neither advocating against relationships nor for them, all they are doing is making a statement against totalitarianism and upholding the individual's choice and his/her individualism which should never be compromised just to show everyone that you're with someone. The first half of the film critiques the establishment and the second half critiques uncontrolled anti-establishment tendencies. The ideal state of existence for Lanthimos and Filippou is the grey area that lies in the middle of these two extreme schools of thoughts, an area which encourages choice and I think the last shot of the film perfectly epitomises this idea. With the last shot, Lanthimos puts the eventual outcome of the story in the hands of the viewers and celebrates choice.<br/><br/>Lanthimos' direction and style of storytelling is extremely deadpan. The deadpan style of storytelling and line delivery by the actors actual adds to the comedy to the whole premise and elevates the absurdness that surrounds every inch of the film and makes it extremely funny. There are scenes where I couldn't help but laugh out loud. But then very quickly he will change the mood with something graphic and disturbing. Just like 'Dogtooth', Lanthimos makes the viewer laugh at the absurdness on show, but then feel a little troubled for finding something which should be disturbing, very funny. Although 'The Lobster' shares the darkly funny satirical tones of 'Dogtooth' as well as its criticism of totalitarianism, but the visual style of the two films are very different. While 'Dogtooth' was made to look intentionally bleak and visually dull, 'The Lobster' is shot beautifully. The shots in the hotel as well as in the forest really have a visual appeal to them. Lanthimos' framing and shot composition is meticulous. The deadpan nature of the film reminded me of Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' to some extent and the absurdness of Lanthimos' formalism is certainly reminiscent of Buñuel's works like 'Viridiana' and 'Belle de Jour'.<br/><br/>The acting remains very deadpan and non-demonstrative throughout the film. Colin Farrell is brilliant and really the best part of the film. Even with his deadpan demeanour, he manages to express his loneliness, his awkwardness and also manages to be very funny at the same time. Rachel Weisz's character is really likable. I really believed the connection between her and Farrell.<br/><br/>'The Lobster' is the kind of film that can't be recommended to everyone due to its idiosyncrasies. It is profound, but weird. It is funny, but disturbing. I loved the way in which the themes and ideas were explored here. This film made me want to explore other films that Lanthimos has made in the past. I will also be gladly waiting for his subsequent films in the future."

","'THE LOBSTER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>A very dark dystopian comedy-drama flick; about a world where single people are required to find romantic partners, within 45-days, or be turned into animals. The film was directed by Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos (in his English-language film debut) and it was written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou; the duo also performed the same duties on 2011's 'ALPS' and 2009's 'DOGTOOTH' (which is an outstanding flick). It stars Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux, John C. Reilly, Ben Whishaw, Olivia Colman, Jessica Barden and Angeliki Papoulia (who also costarred in 'DOGTOOTH'). The movie has been a critically praised indie hit, and I think it's a near masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film is set in a dystopian world; where single people are sent to a special hotel, once they become single, and they're required to find romantic partners there (within 45-days). If they fail to do so, they're turned into an animal, of their choice, and released into the woods. People who escape the hotel are known as loners; they live out in the woods, as their own community. Loners have similar strict rules (to the contrary); prohibiting any romantic (or sexual) relations. Single people are sent into the woods, to hunt the loners down; if they're successful, they're given an extra day to find a partner. The story revolves around David (Farrell); who was recently dumped by his wife, for another man, and he's sent to the hotel (as the movie begins). David is guided through this stressful process, by his brother; who's now a dog.<br/><br/>The film is extremely odd, and funny; but it's also very disturbing. It's shockingly brutal, and sexual, at times. It's also an excellent social commentary, on the world we now live in. That's what I like most about the film; it's definitely exaggerated (in a very dark satirical way), but it's also a great analysis of our society's obsession with not being single. Single people are often ostracized, and severely looked down upon (by the rest of society). This movie isn't really that far off, in the way it illustrates how couple's often harshly treat singles. It's also true that most people follow very strict (and severely superficial) guidelines, in finding romantic partners. Most relationships are formed out of desperation, necessity and drastic conformity. Genuine companionship, and true love, is extremely rare. That's why this movie is so brilliant; it's a nearly perfect examination on life (I'd say). It will be seen as far too weird, slow and harshly critical; for most viewers though.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois"

There is a constant threat of random violence, but because single people don't have emotions, they hardly notice.

","The Lobster, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and written by Lanthimos and a collaborator, Efthymis Fillippou, is not a film that you can easily forget if you're in the dating world at all. The setup is pretty simple. If you become single for any reason you're sent to a hotel out in the country where you have 45 days to couple up. The catch is that you're first subjected to a completely invasive strip search and indoctrination period as if you've committed some crime, and then you've got to select an animal which you will become if you don't find a partner. The film starts off with a scene of a woman walking up to a bovine in the woods and shooting it dead. Why? It was probably her ex- boyfriend. This hotel is not exactly going to be on anyone's vacation itinerary.<br/><br/>For the director, it is his first English language film. That is pretty impressive, because he's doing some kind of a deep dive in to the whole crazy world of online dating and modern relationships without going online or being in the modern world. The dialog is mostly delivered with a flat, emotionless tone, but the things the characters say are sometimes so bizarre you'll be wondering if you heard that right. You may have your laundry list of likes and dislikes or you may just be swiping left and right and figuring that stuff out later. Or not at all. Here at the hotel, people are coupling up if they share bloody noses or have a love of biscuits, and your perfect mate is waiting when you're both cold, mean and heartless.<br/><br/>The cast did a wonderful job with this odd piece of art-house fare. Colin Farrell with a belly plays the lead and was a great choice, showing he can play a role with very limited range but still make it believable. He's recently divorced and arrives at the hotel with his dog, which just happens to be his brother. We've also got Ben Wishaw as ""Limping Man"" and John C. Reilly as ""Lisping Man."" Reilly is always a pleasure to watch and he really brings the desperation as his days grow shorter, and he's the recipient of the hotel's painful penalty for masturbation, which is prohibited. Lea Seydoux coldly plays the leader of the loners in the woods. Are the woods a better place than the hotel? Everybody seems to be living by a set of rules that aren't exactly liberating. Heard mostly in voice-over is Rachel Weisz, and I kept wondering if I was mistaken in thinking she was going to be in the film. She finally does appear giving the film the closest thing to an identifiable human for the audience to connect with.<br/><br/>The film careens along its weird way for 90 minutes and I was just looking at every inch of the screen for clues to what was going to happen. I felt like it was a mix of Wes Anderson, Stanley Kubrick and a little bit of Ed Wood, in that I'd like to think that everyone working on this just loved doing it. The direction was solid with some odd touches of framing, and the set design and cinematography matched the dialog. However, I thought the pace slowed down in the final stretch after Farrell ""escapes"" the hotel and he and Weisz try to live like ""normal"" people. I guess this was a difficult concept because we really don't know what normal people are in this world. Eventually, things come to a close and just like any date, sometimes you walk away and you're just not sure there's going to be another one. Only in this case, there are some excruciatingly painful moments along the way. Still, I'm glad I went on this one."

And it's full of strange allegories about relationships that - to me - are really little and larger vignettes about relationship status' and existential angst, and a sort of cynical social commentary about anthropology and societal judgement. In some ways you can enter this movie as though you're about to watch a series of skits about ""coupling"" and it will work pretty fine. <br/><br/>I thought the ending made a lot of sense along the above lines. What connects two people really isn't the point. The point is that they are - and remain - connected."

",". . . in our increasingly anthropomorphic Society (""They're animals--just animals,"" to quote President-elect Trump). Imagine cramming all six seasons of LOST into a couple (admittedly commercial free) hours, and you get a pretty good idea of what LOBSTER is like. Exposition is kept to a minimum, as viewers are required to fill in an EXPENDABLES-outing worth of blanks for themselves. As best as I can make out, LOBSTER is meant to forecast America's Future under Trump Rules. These are a little bit more Fascist than CIDER HOUSE RULES, but probably something happened--like 50 shot dead in a Gay nightclub--which required The Authorities to adopt harsher measures than those championed by Bill, Hillary, and King Harald V. Apart from politics, LOBSTER is full of fascinating facts about Nature. Did you know that the title critter here has blue blood? I sure don't remember them that way, when I was forced to go on an annual cruise in Boston Harbor with all-you-can-eat lobster for a previous job. I guess you learn something new every movie."

","Please do not get clawstrophobic with my pun-filled review of the masterpiece independent film ""The Lobster"". I just don't sea, I mean see, a better movie coming out this year than ""The Lobster"". Director Yorgos Lanthimos has yorgone where few directors have gone to with his apex originality, creativity, and quirkiness of this gem of a film. ""The Lobster"" stars an excellent Colin Farrell as David. His wife has just left him, and has to go to a hotel where they provide you 45 days to find a new mate. The rules of this futuristic dystopian society is that if mating is not made within 45 days, then the guests are transformed into an animal of their choice. David selects a Lobster because he loves the sea, they live to more than 100 years old, they are blue-blooded like aristocrats, and they always remain fertile! I have been saying this for years!!! At the hotel, David befriends two other male guests; a lisping quasi-looney dude, and an abrasive limping man. There are unorthodox occurrences that occur in the hotel that will leave you flabbergasted; either with bitter disgust because of its unconventionality or with cinematic euphoria due to its originality; I was hit wit the latter. So yea, ""The Lobster"" is not for everyone to stomach. Rachel Weisz co-stars as the Short Sighted Woman, she is part of The Loners; a guerrilla-type group that guests in the hotel must hunt on. Consequently, David and the Short Sighted Woman meet and then the film becomes an insightful love story like you have never seen before; from near or far. Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou's screenplay of ""The Lobster"" was a clawsic case of delight! It's as inventive as they come! I will boil with anger if ""The Lobster"" screenplay is not nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar nomination during next year's award season! Moreover, Lanthimos also better land plenty of Best Director nominations for his phenomenal direction of the picture. Farrell has never been better, it is the best performance of his career with his perfect work as David. Also sensational was John C. Reilly as the Lisper and Ben Whishaw as the Limper. I also envision Weisz with much award accolade for her perfect performance as the short sighted woman. Other Lobster kudos acting feeds also go to Lea Seydoux as the Loner Leader, Angeliki Paupolia as the Heartless Woman, Ashley Jensen as the Biscuit Woman, Jessica Barden as the Nosebleed Woman, and Olivia Colman as the Hotel Manager. The Acting Lobsemble here is as good as it gets! So yes, I am a ""The Lobster"" lover, and it has clawed its way to my cinematic tops! ***** Excellent"

","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A partly successful mix of surreal satire with some very perceptive moments. <br/><br/>GRADE: B-<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: A man must choose his fate and form in a dystopian society obsessed with coupling. <br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: The Lobster takes an absurd comic premise and reworks it into a dark satire about love and relationships. Set in the not-to-distant future, David (Colin Farrell), a recently divorced Loner, has an urgent need to find a new partner. Why the deadline, you may ask? No, it's not due to his loneliness causing him to go directly into the dating pool to find another soulmate (although he is a sad and desperate man)...it's just that he must connect with another human being in order to survive. At least, in his present form. You see, this totalitarian government stipulates that unless he gets a girl, within 45 days, he will be turned into another species..a dog, a lion, a lobster...that, at least, will be his choice in this brave new world.<br/><br/>￼Director / Writer Yorgo Lanthimos creates a bizarre and compelling film, although he tests the patience of many moviegoers with his purposely ambiguous detours in his plot. The film is quite effective in its first half as David checks into a resort that prides itself on transformation and conformity. Irony is layered in its thick impasto strokes of surreal imagery and intellectual musings about society's obsession with coupling and partnership. Less successful is the film's second section which begins to meander and lose its way (just like its main character does). Yet the talented Mr. Lanthimos brings forth clever insights and a unique narrative to his Orwellian tale.<br/><br/>￼The international cast works within the limits of their unusual characters. Colin Farrell portrays David nicely as a pawn in the scheme of things while other fine actors, like Rachael Weisz, Ben Whishaw, John C. Reilly, Lea Seydoux, and Olivia Coleman bring solid support to this odd yet thought-provoking film.<br/><br/>￼But it is Lanthimos' screenplay (co-authored with Efthymis Filippou) that relies on the vague notion of obedient submissiveness that remains unclear from the start. The film lacks genuine pathos and subtle humor, never allowing its interesting subject to fully resonate. Characters remain one dimensional and their actions baffling and strange. Except for David, everyone is nameless...Nosebleed Woman, Lisping Man, Biscuit Woman, Limping Man, Short-Sighted Woman, etc. This may be an intentional decision by the filmmaker, but it does give a slight artsy silliness to the whole venture. And let's not even discuss the film's enigmatic and disappointing denouncement!<br/><br/>However, Lanthimos is a far better director than storyteller. His use of slow motion techniques, poetic voiceovers, and mix of classical and atonal music gives his film an eerie otherworldly sense of time and place. He has his actors deliver that lines with flat readings and very little emotion which somehow works to his advantage in creating a loveless universe. <br/><br/>￼The Lobster is the type of film that will garner critical praise but leave the average moviegoer questioning the film's overall effect. Its characters are a passive and soulless lot, even if this filmgoing experience rarely achieves its complex goal. <br/><br/>Still The Lobster is a noble effort by a gifted filmmaker worthy of one's attention.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"mahmoudimohsen","7","0","3","7 June 2016"," A good story but get boring
","This movie has several interesting features and I really enjoyed watching it. There was an imaginary condition described which little by little get the viewer involved. In the city just couples and children are allowed to live. If anyone get divorced or for any reason lose their partner they will have to pass a test in a hotel. They will either find a partner or will be transformed into an animal of their choice. They have a limited time for finding a partner or they can extend their time by hunting loners who have fled into wild. I like the emotionless face of hotel managers and all others. However, I think David's face was a good match to his character which at the end decide to make himself blind for his love. The movie have good symbols of modern life, but I think it had too many details and long that it gets boring for me at the end, and it make it hard to follow. I think it could be a better movie if after the hotel could have a fine ending."
"JBoushka","5","0","3","21 May 2016"," Vicious satire indeed
","This film is as ""vicious as it gets"" when it comes to dystopian social satire. Yes, it makes fun of the way an authoritarian society might treat single or childless people. Unfortunately, it also makes fun of autism or Asperger's (or the way society reacts to some people with autism) too. <br/><br/>The whole film is rather unpleasant to watch, a bit sickening, but it does ""teach the viewer"" a lesson. The natural scenery (set in Ireland) is quite breathtaking. The classical string quartet music score in stunning. The unfolding of the backstory in the fascist society was a bit confusing at times in the second half. <br/><br/>Could this film predict the direction of Putin's Russia?"

","full of unexpected yet meaningful and thought provoking events,you remain totally bound to the story.it is about modern society and how it pressures us into doing things we would not do otherwise.it is about desperation to find true love,and how society pushes us it to a artificial relationship,which we loath.it gives you hope,that if stay in this mess for long enough you would eventually be rewarded with true love.whether or not you can change your persona in this endeavor would decide the fate of your journey.this film does all this while remaining at the same time incredibly funny and filled with laughs.this film also makes you think about your attitude towards both misery and joy.i enjoyed it very much.you must see it to see your relationship from a different perspective."
"zoozersadd","9","0","3","18 April 2016"," Forget Exposition
","So minimal, and never lays out its exposition clearly. Some people are pegging this as a comedy, which doesn't make much sense to me. It's absurdist, for sure. Surreal, most definitely. Comedy? That's pushing it. It's an exploration of an alternate universe, almost. Nothing is shoved in your face. The performances, the camera, and the story all float gracefully. We're given puzzle pieces and then given the respect to assemble the puzzle ourselves. And I'm sure some people will assemble it differently from me, even. Lanthimos is doing work like no one else. It's bizarre, but never boring. It's high art, but never pretentious. Can't wait to see where he takes us next.<br/><br/>I'd go with a bat, most likely."
"tenyearreunion","7","0","4","28 February 2016"," What a cast. Bizarre Movie.
","Having literally just finished watching this. I really don't know what to make of it.<br/><br/>The cast list is epic, and everyone puts in a very constrained emotional performance that the plot requires. I really don't know how they managed to pull in such a cast for a movie such as this, they must have all loved the script.<br/><br/>I like the premise, I liked the dark humour but it broke one of my movie going rules and the ending was completely unsatisfactory and thus I leave myself questioning whether it was worth 2 hours of my viewing time.<br/><br/>Overall, yes, for the off the wall plot, I was never bored and everyone is putting in a quality acting shift. But it is so marginal I can only provide 7/10 as I am left unfulfilled.<br/><br/>I had a similar experience with Martha Marcy May Marlene.<br/><br/>A previous reviewer stated that if you are unimpressed with the first 20 mins then you are best not continuing. I think that is a cracking piece of advice."
"lounes","7","0","4","26 February 2016"," Really bizarre but quite good
","This is a pretty good piece of movie. It is the most bizarre movie I've ever seen in my life but it deserves to be watched. Everything is odd, the screenplay itself and also the characters. It seems like everything has no meaning yet with a straight basic outline.<br/><br/>I would rank this movie in the surrealistic genre because everything seems having no purpose at all. And the end scene confirms that thinking.<br/><br/>Therefore, this movie marked me psychologically unconsciously. Indeed, after watching that movie at 3AM, I had a quite peaceful night but with dreams as bizarre as this movie. Every actions the characters did I did them in my dreams. This was really odd. And that is partly the reason why I liked this movie."
"daniel-848-975122","10","0","4","22 February 2016"," The most original love story
","Definitely an excellent take on how society sees love, and probably the most original love story I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Set in a universe in which social rules are so far apart from ours, I couldn't avoid being drawn to it. But at the same time, everything in the movie makes you think about how we behave in our own social reality. A great metaphor of relationships, couples, singles, and many of the social conventions around it. The naive-sounding storytelling on top of that contributes to an almost fairy-tale feel of the movie.<br/><br/>Definitely, a movie for those who like out-of-the-ordinary films. It's full of surprises, and a showcase of creativity."
"leonblackwood","6","0","4","14 February 2016"," Weird but original! 6/10
","Review: This is one of the strangest movies I have seen this year. I really didn't know were the movie was going, right from the beginning and when the film started to get going, it just became more weird. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the originality of the film but it was really strange from one scene to the next. The strange laws that they had in the hotel and the forest, were mind blowing and the fact that this individuals were being punished for being single, made it intriguing and, a somewhat, weird experience. The scenes with the eyes went a bit to far and the ending did annoy me but on the whole, I would watch it again, because I didn't understand how David (Colin Farrell), ended up in such a predicament. It did seem like it was jumping from one scene to the next, without much explanation but the narrating all the way through the film did help matters. The acting is great from Farell, who put on a lot of weight for the role and his heartless wife (Rosanna Hoult) and new found love (Rachel Weisz), were great choices for this quirky movie. Personally, I have to watch the movie again to work out if I actually enjoyed it or I was more shocked with it, so I'll have to sit on the fence for this one. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Colin Farrell, 39, has starred in some mediocre movies lately which haven't really done that well at the box office, like the disappointing A New York Winter's Tale, the unknown Miss Julie alongside Jessica Chastain, Dead Man Down, Total Recall, Seven Psychopaths and Fright Night but he put in a great performance in Saving Mr. Banks, Horrible Bosses and the new True Detective series. I doubt that this movie will bring him back into the big leagues but it has definitely shown that he will take on any project and give it his all. This is the first major release from Greek born, Yorgos Lanthimos, who also wrote this original but strange script. It must have been hard to bring his vision to the big screen so I have to give him respect for that and the fact that Rachel Weisz, Colin Farrell, Olivia Colman and John C. Reilly came on board, proves that they saw something in this original in the script. As I didn't hear anything about the movie before, I really didn't know what to expect and now that I've watched it, I'm still in 2 minds about the outcome. <br/><br/>Budget: $4million Worldwide Gross: $5.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/romance/comedies starring Rachel Weisz, Colin Farrell, John C. Reilly, Olivia Colman, Rosanna Hoult, Michael Smiley and Roger Ashton-Griffiths. 6/10"
"legork","9","0","5","14 January 2016"," Identical mates
","This movie shows, in very grotesque and shocking images that humans are determined to be identical in every way possible to a member of the opposite sex, so that they can realize the urge to mate and procreate the species. Re-education is necessary for people who don't understand the importance of mating with someone who is identical to us and for people who think that one can masturbate instead of mating. Re-education takes place in an institution like a holiday resort conducted under strictly controlled conditions. One of the many requirements, on entering the institution is choosing an animal that one wants to be changed into if all else fails. The movie drives this point home by presenting the hero arriving at the institution with a dog, a cocker spaniel, which is actually his brother who was changed into a dog because he apparently failed to find a matching mate. The woman shooting the cow at the beginning of the movie is obviously demonstrating the characteristic of being a heartless person, because the mate she desires is heartless. Heartlessness is the characteristic she sets for herself and the man who wants to mate with her tries to demonstrate heartlessness also but fails when she shoots his brother, the cocker spaniel. Eventually our hero adapts to a woman in very shocking act. One could also say that this movie points a finger of criticism at the romantic idea of chivalry, such as a man showing his love for a woman by laying down his life for her."
"billcr12","7","0","7","20 December 2015"," Strange Movie
","Lorgos Lanthimos does it once again; although not as wacked out as his previous oddity; Dogtooth, he still remains as different a filmmaker as anyone out there. Colin Farrell is David, a man looking for a wife in a futuristic society which requires everyone have a partner or suffer the consequence of being turned into an animal. David has chosen a lobster, because, as he explains, they live for one hundred years and are fertile throughout their lives. He also enjoys the ocean. Lanthimos' script is hilarious, giving Farrell the funniest moments of the film. The main setting is a resort hotel where strangers meet and are encouraged to hook up with others of similar tastes. among those are David, who is ""short sighted"", a man who limps, a woman with constant nose bleeds and an assortment of other odd balls. It runs a bit long at almost two hours, but even so, The Lobster is worth the journey."
"moviescriticnet","5","0","8","15 November 2015"," Even if you are not a Lanthimos' fan you should check out this film but please do not expect to watch a masterpiece.
","Yorgos Lanthimos is the most classic representative of the so called ""Greek Weird Wave"" and I'm one of his huge fans. Dogtooth (his most well-known movie) explored the falsies in the modern family and the Lobster focuses on interpersonal, romantic and sexual relationships. Lanthimos' personal style is again easily recognizable and unique (it reminds me a bit a mixture of modern Danish cinema with Austrian and Scandinavian cinema). Nevertheless this movie by no means deserved three awards in Cannes film Festival. The first half of the movie is funny, sarcastic, innovative and bittersweet at the same time, but the second half of the movie is a lot weaker (symbolisms are there but the means to pass them through are less innovative) and should have been quite smaller. The ending is ambiguous and clever and Collin Farrell proves with his unforced performance that he really is a quality actor. Even if you are not a Lanthimos' fan you should check out this film but please do not expect to watch a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"
