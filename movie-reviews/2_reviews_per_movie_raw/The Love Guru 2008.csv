","Mike Myers can't seem to get enough of himself in The Love Guru. He's constantly giggling at his own jokes, and mugging for the camera as if he thinks his latest comedy creation is the funniest thing he's invented. I had a very different reaction. Pitka was born in America, and traveled to India to study under the cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudah (Ben Kingsley), who taught his students lessons by having them hit each other with urine-soaked mops. Pitka devotes his life and his teachings to helping other people out with their relationship troubles, and hopes his words of wisdom will become so popular, he'll wind up on Oprah.<br/><br/>This is information we learn early on in the film (after Pitka serenades us with a Bollywood-style musical number of Dolly Parton's Nine to Five during the opening credits), and I pretty much knew right there that The Love Guru was going to be a very long 90 minutes. The movie makes a grave miscalculation with its lead character. Guru Pitka is not funny or likable. It's simply Myers talking in a funny accent, and coming up with as many alternate ways for saying ""penis"" as he can without losing the film's PG-13 rating. Pitka is not even a real character. Myers plays him more as an experiment, as if he's still testing the character out, and we the audience are the guinea pigs being subjected to the experiment. It's been widely reported that the reason why Myers hasn't done a live action film in five years is because he's been fine tuning his Guru Pitka at various comedy clubs until he felt he was ready. He was not ready, and he probably should have spent another five years if the end result is any indication.<br/><br/>Pitka is approached by Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba), the owner of the struggling Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. Her star player, Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco), hasn't been performing up to the best of his abilities ever since his wife, Prudence (Meagan Good), left him for the goalie on the rival team - a French player named Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande (Justin Timberlake, embarrassing himself here) who is known for his over-sized ""manhood"" as much as he's known for his talent in the game. The character exists simply so that Myers and co-screenwriter Graham Gordy can have the characters say cock a lot more than humanly necessary. The Maple Leafs have a chance at winning the Stanley Cup, but not if Darren doesn't have his head in the game. The team's pint-sized coach (Verne Troyer) doubts that Pitka can turn the situation around, but the Guru is determined to help. He'll do this by finding a way to distract Darren from his problems (By forcing him to watch two elephants having sex, thereby taking his mind off of his problems with his wife. You figure it out.), and help him confront his over-bearing mother (Telma Hopkins), who has long cast a shadow over the star player.<br/><br/>The Love Guru is not a comedy, it is a cry of desperation on behalf of Myers and everyone involved. Comedy is funniest when it seems to come naturally out of the material, but everything seems so forced and strained here. It's almost like if they can't think of something funny to do, they'll throw in elephants humping each other, or light a midget on fire. And if that doesn't work, they'll throw in another couple references to male genitalia. If there's a bigger cry of comic desperation than limp innuendo humor, then it has to be out of the blue musical numbers that are not funny in themselves, the movie just expects us to laugh at the fact that the characters are suddenly singing for no reason. You know, I think I'm going to have to take that last statement back. There's an even more desperate form of comedy, and that would have to be building an entire scene around the fact that Guru Pitka has a different kind of food stuck in his beard each time we see him, building up to a sight gag where his entire beard is cotton candy. This movie has so many scenes of just plain wrong-headed desperation, you'd almost think it was intentional.<br/><br/>While Myers cackles and mugs his face with glee, pretending that he's having a great time, the rest of the cast kind of look like they wish they were somewhere else. Jessica Alba looks uncomfortable, and her scenes where she's supposed to be warming up to Pitka look more like she's hanging out with him out of pity more than anything else. It's not unusual in a comedy to have the supporting players stand in the background so the star can do his thing, but the cast here seem just as confused as I was as to what we were supposed to be watching Myers doing. <br/><br/>There is not a single laugh or moment of inspiration in The Love Guru. It's just a sad, depressing slog through material that's not funny to start with, taken by actors who seem to know it's not funny. It's bad enough when a comedy can't generate any laughs, but it gets even worse when you start feeling sorry for everyone up on the screen. You want to ask them and their agents what they were thinking when they signed up. You want to remind Myers of just how funny he can be, and why this material and character don't suit him. But most of all, you want to be able to somehow turn back time to before you gave the ticket counter your money, walk back out the door, and figure out another way to spend 90 minutes."
"dyl_gon","1","175","290","20 June 2008"," Bad karma or just bad movie-making? The Love Guru is a contender for worst film ever made
","I don't throw this statement around lightly. As someone who frequently reads reviews, I find that it is thrown around far too often, especially when there are so many bad movies out there. But I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that The Love Guru is the worst movie I've ever seen. It has officially dethroned classics such as Die Hard Dracula and Dark Harvest 2: The Maize. Those movies were made on minuscule budgets by no-talents. In comparison, The Love Guru was made on a huge budget by Mike Meyers, the creator of comedy classics Austin Powers and Wayne's World, which makes this train wreck of a film all the more painful to watch.<br/><br/>With The Love Guru, you can tell Meyers is trying to create another success along the lines of Austin Powers, but failing miserably. The thing about Austin Powers was despite being a dumb comedy, the movie had a likable, fun protagonist. In Meyer's latest outing, we get the Guru Pitka, a Charles Manson look-alike who has an obsession with penises. It's somewhat fitting that he resembles Charles Manson, a notorious cult leader, as by the movies end I had a strange urge to kill myself. Not only is the Guru creepy, he's also very unfunny. Whether he's making lame puns about ""life"" or talking about penises, he never manages to elicit any laughs whatsoever. It could be that his jokes are just bad. Certainly using jokes straight out of a children's joke book isn't a recipe for success. It could also be the fact that Meyers is so desperate for a laugh, he himself laughs at every joke and continuously looks at the audience, attempting to entice them to laugh along with him. You get the sense that he realizes the jokes are unfunny and the glances at the audience are his last failed attempts at getting a few laughs. Guru Pitka's character development just adds injury to the insult. One minute Pitka is being hailed as a spiritual healer who lives to help people and the next minute he's insulting a midget for no particular reason. There's no consistency to the character at all, which is what this movie is missing in comparison to Meyer's last few. Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers felt like real characters, where the Guru doesn't really have any character; he randomly does whatever moves the plot along forward.<br/><br/>Speaking of plot, the storyline is almost as ill-conceived as the title character. A stupid plot in a comedy is acceptable if it manages to be funny, but there's nothing amusing about a Guru's quest to go on the Oprah show. That's just plain stupid. It would help if the film wasn't filled with every cliché ever known to cinema-goers, but it is. The Guru has a self-revelation at the end and changes his greedy ways. The good guys triumph. And of course, Blur's ""Song 2"" plays during one of the hockey sequences, which has become the most commonly used (and groan-inducing) tune for any sports-related film.<br/><br/>Even if you can put aside the annoyingness of the Guru Pitka, the movie still fails to deliver anything remotely funny. The most common joke is to have a characters name resemble something vulgar, such as ""Dick Pants"" or some other Grade 3 level joke. The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of ""TM"" after one of his catchphrases. It wasn't funny the first time, what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth? There's also the repetition of jokes from Austin Powers, ranging from the plane to even the casting of Verne Troyer, the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the Powers films as Mini-Me. Finally, there are the gags that are just plain lame. These involve elephants humping each other, the Guru wearing a chastity belt, the Guru having a battle using mops soaked in urine, the Guru sticking his head up his own ass (which is actually far less funny than it sounds), the Guru getting punched in the groin, the Guru doing battle with a rooster and the Guru engaging in two very long song and dance numbers on the Sitar, one a rendition of Dolly Parton's ""9 to 5"", the other a ear-splitting variation on ""Space Cowboy"" by Steve Miller Band. Both are in there for no particular reason whatsoever (and I really do hope it wasn't for laughs).<br/><br/>The other actors are fairly bad, although they really don't have much to work with. Jessica Alba continues her tradition of playing practically the same exact character, giggling and acting ditsy. Justin Timberlake is atrocious as Jacque Grande, although to be fair, his character was a one-note joke about Quebecois people. I'm bemused that Meyers would think Americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny, especially when I didn't find it funny and I'm a Canadian. Verne Troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that he's a midget.<br/><br/>It really is hard to describe how utterly bad The Love Guru is. It's a stupid comedy, yes, but I'm a fan of those. I'm the guy who gave You Don't Mess With the Zohan a positive rating, so if anything this should be right up my alley. Instead, it's the worst movie of the year for sure (leaving Meet the Spartans way behind in its dust) and has reached it's place, for me at least, as the worst movie ever created. It's painfully unfunny and left me in a sour mood for a good hour after viewing. I'd rather wear a chastity belt for 30 years like the Guru rather than sit through this pile of crud."
"psypeterson","7","65","102","14 October 2008"," Not even a tenth as bad as others make it seem.
","To call this the worst movie of the year, or the worst movie ever shown in theaters, is sheer pompousness at its best.<br/><br/>That being said; this is by no means a great movie. It is hilariously crude, random, and quirky, but the humour is obviously not for everyone. The Love Guru uses a tried, but true, comedy formula and rarely strays from it. However; some of the off-the-wall jokes will have you laughing your face off, and will keep returning to your mind, making you laugh days after you watched the film. The acting is par, and Steven Colbert delivers the funniest performance I've seen in a long while.<br/><br/>Don't go into this film looking for genius or groundbreaking comedy mastery; go into this film expecting a decent laugh which you won't regret."
"megco-1","1","250","426","11 June 2008"," Self-indulgent mess
","It was heavy-handed, painful and endless. The opposite of funny. An excruciating bunch of penis jokes strung together with some gross-out scenes. Wow! Penises can be short! Penises can be long! Oh, hahaha! Oh, and who can forget the musical numbers. Did I mention that they were choreographed? Mike Myers has lost the charm he exhibited in the Austin Powers franchise. And it's clear that he picked an inexperienced director for this so he could control the shoot. And why does Jessica Alba keep doing crappy movies like this and ""Good Luck, Chuck""? Did someone tell her she was a comedienne? And Justin Timberlake -- well, no wonder he wears a wig and moustache throughout. Ironically, though the material is definitely for teen-aged boys, they probably won't go to see it because of the title. It'll maybe have one weekend, then go flaccid. Incidentally, the only truly memorable line in the entire mess is from Verne Troyer in an outtake run with the credits. But it's not worth watching the entire mess to hear it."
"mickeyiotov","8","64","101","22 June 2008"," GREAT....if you don't take it seriously
","OF COURSE this movie was going to be silly comedy. Its mike myers!!!! I entered this movie having no idea what was going to come out and maybe thats why i loved it. It was about random things but DID have an over all plot. The love guru tried to restore a couple while trying to find out about his own love. <br/><br/>Many people can relate to these jokes of religion and meditating and you may even learn a thing or too, but again don't take all things 100%. If you can carefully interpret what the movies motifs are then you will think it is a good move.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie of puns and if you like mike myers you will most probably enjoy this movie."
"kgz00","2","290","500","19 June 2008"," R.I.P. Mike Myers Career
","I saw this film last night in a advance screening. I can say without a doubt it is the worst movie I've ever seen in the theater. It is simply a terrible movie. For every joke that's funny (which are few) there is about dozen that are not. Then there's all the jokes we've seen in previous Myers films that aren't so funny the 4th time around when they appear in this flick. Many moments in this film will having you looking around the theater wondering if anyone else finds this movie as stupid as you do.<br/><br/>That's really the bottom line. This movie is stupid. Take every fear you've had watching the trailer, times it by 10 and you will get an idea of how bad this film is.<br/><br/>By the way, the hockey in this movie will leave any one who loves the game sick to there stomach. The hockey portrayal left me in tears. Its brutal ! The film is a HUGE slap in the face to hockey. Thanks Mike Myers ! <br/><br/>On a positive note though, Justin Timberlake and Stephen Colbert are hilarious. The only time i enjoyed the movie at all was when they were on screen. I never thought in a million years I would leave a movie saying "" Thank God Justin Timberlake was is it.""<br/><br/>In short : this movie is terrible ! Don't believe me ? Then throw your money away and see for yourself."
"pgstreby","3","116","195","20 June 2008"," An Opportunity Wasted by Self-Indulgence
","Mike Myers is a talented guy, but this vehicle is an embarrassment. The funniest parts are gleefully juvenile, but they are, unfortunately, outnumbered by gags that are simply juvenile or, worse yet, juvenile and mean-spirited. For example, some of the jokes directed at Verne Troyer's character sound like they were uttered by a 15-year-old classroom bully, not written by an intelligent man in his forties. I'm all in favor of offending PC sensibilities whenever possible, but do it right: cracks about Keebler elves show are just stupid and artistically lazy.<br/><br/>More scenes of young Pitka might have explained better how he grew into the adult he became, and Rajneesh could have been fleshed out a bit. I suspect that a lot of character development and back story were left on the cutting room floor. What should have been cut were the cameos that were either pointless or self-referential without being truly funny.<br/><br/>The plot wasn't exactly Citizen Kane quality, but it could have worked with better writing. After all, if anything cries out for satiric treatment, it's the self-help and New Age movements. With such target-rich subject matter, how did Myers manage to make such a dud? I think that it's a case of plain self-indulgence. Jim Carrey and Robin Williams are two other talented, over-the-top funny men who do some of their best work when they show restraint and don't play themselves. Someone should have reined in Myers on this one.<br/><br/>For his penance, I suggest that he lay off comedy for a while and do a few dramatic roles - including supporting ones - as he did (quite well) in ""54."" Williams and Carrey have shown other dimensions of themselves in dramatic roles, and I'm sure Myers can, too."
"deanbean317","1","137","236","22 June 2008"," Jumping the Shark is too kind a phrase for this mess!
","If you hate Mike Myers then this movie will be your holy grail...the one you hold high and proclaim loudly ""See, I told you this A-Hole wasn't funny!""<br/><br/>If you love Mike Myers (as I do, in a totally manly non-ancient-Greece type way) then you'll just have to hang your head and silently agree.<br/><br/>What in Krishna's name went wrong here? How could these people have sat in an editing room and watched this hundreds of times during the final cut and not said to themselves "" I have to save Mike Myers from himself!"" I only had to watch the first fifteen minutes ONCE before I was ready to walk out. <br/><br/>How do I hate thee, let me count the ways; BAD acting, BAD casting, BAD writing, BAD directing, BAD dialogue, BAD excuse for a hockey mask (What is this, 1975?)<br/><br/>Is there anything good in this movie? YES! Romany Malco (Weeds, The 40 Year Old Virgin) rises above the dreck by playing a real person in a comic book universe. He's funny, sympathetic and believable; in short, everything this movie IS NOT.<br/><br/>I did get some good laughs though, out of the previews for ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Hamlet II"". Do yourself a favor and miss this one (throwing up popcorn is a painful experience!)"

"Matttttttttttt","7","68","112","20 June 2008"," Surprisingly Funny ONLY If You Don't Mind Stupid Humor
","I can see this movie is being murdered by reviewers on this board. Well, I'll give you my point of view on the film that I saw last night. Going in with low expectations, I actually found myself laughing VERY hard at certain parts of the film.<br/><br/>Sure, most of the humor is stolen straight out of the Austin Powers series, but it's still funny. The performances by Mike Myers, Justin Timberlake, and Verne Troyer are hilarious. Mike Myers is great as always and Timberlake is surprisingly very funny. The interaction between Myers and Troyer (stolen straight from AP) is absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a deep, thought-provoking movie, you're going to be sadly disappointed. But if you can't tell that from the preview, then maybe you should get your head checked out. The movie is all about ""moments"" and plays out like a long SNL sketch. If you can leave your mind at the door and accept the toilet humor, you might find yourself enjoying it.<br/><br/>Most people reviewing the film 1/10 have probably not even bothered to see it. Others are coming on the board and marking high ratings as ""not useful"" and lower ratings as ""useful"". I will bet money that many people find review ""not useful"" by just looking at the 7 stars I gave it. There are many people just destined to see this movie fail because they think it looks stupid. See the movie for yourself and don't allow others who haven't even SEEN the film tell you that it's awful."
"inyourimage","7","56","92","20 June 2008"," It is what it is supposed to be! A Silly Parody!
","I read self-help books, I study religions and spirituality, and I thought this was a funny movie. Movies such as these teach us to not take life so seriously. It would seem that anyone who claims to have any sense of spirituality or enlightenment, and was offended by this movie, doesn't really understand Truth. To be pro the movie, or neutral to the movie is one thing, but to attack the movie, to be against the movie, would seem to be self-defeating. Attacking the movie gives energy (and publicity) to it, for which, I'm sure the makers are very grateful. I thought the headlines of certain people being 'outraged' by the movie were as humorous as the movie. Deepak knows...he took it in good fun."

It is filled with juvenile, pubescent humor and had my wife, 10-year old son, and me laughing the whole way through.<br/><br/>The movie is standard Hollywood formula, but they do it to perfection. Mike Meyers was right smack in his comfort zone. Ben Kingsley and Justin Timberlake were fantastically raucous. And Jessica Alba was.... well Jessica Alba was incredibly HOT! I absolutely recommend this movie to anyone wanting a light-hearted, albeit corny trip to the movies. There was a lot of sexual innuendo, but if you are sheltering your children from what awaits them in the real world, you are destined to be a young grandparent.<br/><br/>The Burke's give this movie to thumbs up."

And as for expecting the rest of it to be stupid, well, it went above and beyond: it was absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>Generally, I'm indifferent to Mike Myers' stupid (for lack of a better word) humor. There have been some genuinely funny moments in past movies, but you won't find more than two or maybe even three in this one.

"jaredmobarak","1","101","183","17 June 2008"," Mariska HargitayThe Love Guru
","I've always been told that if you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all. So, I have to tell you all the best parts of the new Michael Myers vehicle, The Love Guru. You've got one really funny joke about Guru Pitka's mom getting a job that kills even though it was in the trailer, Stephen Colbert finally hits one out of the park as a robot cyborg after failing three previous times to elicit any laughs, Jessica Alba is gorgeous as always if you overlook her atrocious acting abilities, and Justin Timberlake shows he has no shame and steals every single second of screen time he is given. If Jacques ""le coq"" Grande had his own film, I'd pay to see it. Being that he is included in one that relies on physical humor, asinine wordplay, sexual innuendo, and Myers making a complete idiot of himself as he kills the funny out of every only slightly funny gag he does, Timberlake becomes the only reason I can say it was worth going to a free preview. The Love Guru is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen and once I'm done writing this review I am going to crawl into bed and cry as I remember So I Married an Axe Murderer and the times when Myers could do no wrong (thanks for the Wayne's World callback Mike, you actually made me realize how inferior this film is more).<br/><br/>There is truly no point in describing a plot because there isn't one. The film exists as a series of set-pieces allowing Myers to act up his schtick and try to cause uproarious laughter in the audience. Besides some faint giggles at the fact that Myers himself smiles and winks at the camera, telling us he just told a joke, there is not too much to go on here. Sure there is a ton of uncomfortable laughter and gasps of awe at the wordplay""can't face"" said real fast to sound likeahemthat you are shocked to hear in a PG-13 film, but does that really make you think the this was a success? I mean, the main focus is supposed to be the idea that Pitka has been hired to get the star player on the Toronto Maple Leafs back with his ex-girlfriend so that his hockey skills will return and win his owner, the second generation of a cursed family, ""Stanley's Cup"". You almost believe this thread has some merit until the resolution is glossed over quickly and rectified without the bat of an eye. The thing is held together by concert interludes of Myers singing in his way over-the-top Indian accent for entire songs. Can you say filler? (Although I will admit, ""More Than Words"" was fantastic, especially the visual nods to the actual Extreme video.) I might be wrapping this review up quickly to rest. My neck has some pain from too much shaking out of embarrassment for those collecting their paychecks on the screen. You could literally see the ca-ching dollar signs popping out of their eyeballs with every awkward moment. Some of the sight gags were funny, the first time they were used. I enjoyed the motorized magic carpet, the utter stupidity of Verne Troyer's office being half size, and the ""Kelestrator"" of course, (I wonder why they didn't TM that one). Admittedly, though, this is not my kind of comedy. While I enjoy a good low-brow laughfest like the next guy, I still would rather have a somewhat decently constructed story, something this tale lacks completely. Had the gags been separated and shown on a TV skit show, I might be calling them genius, however, when you string them together with the only common denominator being that the same characters are used, it gets old fast. Unfortunately, this film will work for a good chuck of America, but I just can't condone the spending of millions of dollars on something so trite and unenjoyable as this packaged and sold mess.<br/><br/>Now I don't want to leave Timberlake as the only good thing here. That would be doing a disservice to Manu Narayan who played Myers' assistant. With spot-on timing and perfect facial expressions, it was good to see someone having fun playing off of the grotesque guru. A nice companion, he actually makes Pitka better each time they are doing a skit together. I'm not really sure what to say about Myers himself. On one hand, he totally commits to this character and must be given credit for that fact. The problem is, though, that the role itself is paper-thin and very, very tiresome. As for Romany Malco, our second leadalthough he got the shaft of no top-billinghe does well for what he has been given. Come on man, you were in the amazing 40-Year Old Virgin and have a hit TV show ""Weeds"" for which you are a big part of its success. Please take the time to do some work that has merit. I mean, wow, who'd have thought I'd be saying Get Smart might be your best movie option this weekend.<br/><br/>Oh, and Ben Kingsleycan I have a word? I am going to have to take away your knighthood. Yes, I know how much you like it and how hard you worked to achieve the title, but I can't allow someone with as little self respect as you keep the ""Sir"". Why, oh why, would you continue to do drivel like this? You are an Academy Award winning thespian. I can only hope The Wackness is as good as it seems so you may redeem a little bit of that respect in my eyes."

","I may be a bit generous with the star-rating system, true. But I do know what I was feeling after the credits started rolling. Disappointment. And don't get me wrong. I am a huge Mike Myers fan. I am a devout fan of Austin Powers, Wayne's World (where's #3 in the series???), and, actually, yes, I did enjoy Cat in the Hat, although it was not a piece of art. And I understand if fans of Mike Myers will still go to see this film. I did after all, even after reading the terrible reviews. Sadly, this time, the critics were correct. Mike knows better. The director should've known better. Mike Myers's return to live action comedy is more than disappointing. Even the character, Your Holiness the Guru Pitka, was unlikeable (which is a first for a Mike Myers character). He was so full of himself, so damn selfish, no one cared if he succeeded. His giggle-fits were too common to spark a slight giggle from the audience. And although the women in the film were pure eye-candy (Jessica Alba, Meagan Good, even Mariska Hargitay and Jessica Simpson made cameos), they became little more than that with such a flat script. Sorry Mike. Maybe next time. A fourth Austin Powers would be quite a way to get back in the game with your biggest fans:)"

","The Love Guru, when I saw the trailer, I wasn't exactly laughing, but it was Mike Myers, the clever man who has brought us Austin Powers and Wayne's World, I had to have hope. Well, Mike Myers, I have no choice, I really wanted to slap the heck out of him when I was watching this painful movie. Now I'm convinced that Mike must have some obsession with the penis, because there are so many penis jokes in this movie it just becomes painfully unfunny. Now there was a decent audience in the movie theater, like twenty something people, I did not hear one laugh, seriously, I even kept sighing, wondering when this movie was going to be over. Five people left early complaining, I wished I had joined them, but something inside me was just hoping that something would make me laugh, I was really pulling for Mike, but he has just made me so unhappy with this bad movie that was just his pathetic attempt of constantly reminding people of his good comedic days.<br/><br/>Guru Pitka is a self help guru who is very successful, but he is ranked as the number two self help guru of the world. The only way he feels like he can be successful is to be on Oprah. So he has to save a man, Darran, on a loosing hockey team in Canada to get him back with his ex girlfriend who is with this ""cocky"" winning goalie, Jacques Grande. Guru also meets the owner of the team, Jane, who he just falls for, so in order for him to get famous, he has to get Darran back with his girl and the team will start winning.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm serious, that's the ""plot"", sad, isn't it? I just seriously cannot believe how low Mike Myers has sunk, the cast was bad and the story was just, I don't think it was even existent. Now, I hate it when people call movies racist without even thinking what the movie is supposed to be, but you know what?! I was friggin' offended by this movie, it was just plan sad, Mike Myers has lost his game and cannot admit it. He should have just stuck to the animated voices, because his characters now are just lame. There is nothing I could say more than please just stay away from this film, I know I said this before, but this is just a painful and unfunny movie. Good luck to Mike Myers, he'll need it big time after more critics review this bad movie.<br/><br/>1/10"

","I went to see this movie hoping for lighthearted entertainment, because I have always loved Mike Meyers. I hoped the negative reviews were wrong. But they were oh-so-right. Don't waste your hard-earned money or time on this one.<br/><br/>The sight of Ben Kingsley playing a silly cross-eyed Indian guru (who has his apprentices fight with mops dipped in his bodily fluids) is very depressing indeed. To go from playing Gandhi to this is just so, so, so sad.<br/><br/>The presence of two gratuitous anti-gay jokes turned an otherwise innocuous movie into an unpleasant experience. Call me crazy, but I don't go to the expense of going to a theatre in order to be insulted. Do Mike Meyers and this film's makers think that gay audience members LIKE to be insulted as we sit there watching their movies? (which we PAID to see!!) I thought the Guru Pitka schtick might be fun, but it wasn't. The only bright spots were Justin Timberlake as a Lothario Quebecquer and the fairly fun Bollywood-style Indian dance number at the end of the movie. Otherwise it is just painfully unfunny and uninteresting."

His character is extremely funny and the film is focused on his adventure. Another one to watch out for here is Justin Timberlake who completely changed my opinion of him with his role here and his obvious ability to laugh at himself.

It's simple humor and cheap laughs that doesn't rely on overdone profanity and never takes itself seriously. Some people may prefer ""intelligent"" comedy, and I'm all for that... go rent a Woody Allen flick from the 70s. If you like simple sight gags and silly comedy you'll like this movie. Mike Myers may not have been as funny as he was as Wayne Campbell or Austin Powers, but he can still get laughs. I have been critical of Justin Timberlake in the past, but he finally seems to have found a movie style that fits him.<br/><br/>No, this movie will not be sweeping the awards shows or breaking any box office records, but if you're able to appreciate simply laughs you may want to check this movie out. While I found nothing offensive about the movie at all apparently some disagree. If you're easily offended then stay home or stay outside the theater holding a sign.<br/><br/>Funny cameos also make this film and Jessica Alba looks her best in a long time.

"survivorofakuze","7","6","8","9 November 2013"," The Slap-stick Swami
","I found this movie to be crude, but interesting. Mike Myers didn't exactly reach the same level of cultural achievement as George Harrison here, but still there was some interesting work on cultural stereotypes.<br/><br/>Basically it's a story of a white swami (Mike Myers) who helps a black hockey player (The 40-Year-Old-Virgin's Romany Malco) get his baby back. So in a way it's one of those white-guy-hangs-out-with-black-guy flicks, with the added layer that both of them have, I guess you could say, racially unstereotypical roles.<br/><br/>Actually the theme of breaking social barriers is something of a theme of the film. (And obviously this is also done by the rather cheap jokes, but I suppose you could look at that as the attempt to sell the unpopular.) Justin Timberlake plays the French Canadian hockey player who steals the black guy's wife, creating a sideplot of an interracial relationship. The love guru himself is a white American inheritor of thousands of years of Indian tradition. Possibly even more different, is that a black gentleman becomes a student of these Indian teachings. <br/><br/>To do this, he must confront his past, in the form of his mother, who is a very strident woman active in the black church (with his non-black non-Christian friend in tow). And then, to process this encounter, the pair repair back to a bar (where the hockey player, oddly enough, is the only non-white). More examples of this sort of playing with stereotypes could be multiplied, since it's essentially what the movie's about. In fact, I might guess at if it's relative lack of popularity might have something to do with the sense that it's not always very positive in its portrayal of the average hockey fan.... <br/><br/>Of course, the film's budget made the inclusion of a Beatles song out of the question, but it is interesting that they named the wife Prudence, which for me, at least, brings to mind the song ""Dear Prudence"", which John Lennon wrote while the band was visiting an ashram in India. <br/><br/>But of course all that doesn't make the film a *good* picture. The constant reaching for cheap laughs marks it as a film meant simply for laughing, perhaps, rather than a really insightful picture of daily life, which many comedies are. But it also doesn't deserve the sort of heartless vitriol which some comedies so easily attract to themselves from the perhaps pompous sort. It deserves to be seen as a movie with *some* merit. <br/><br/>(7/10)"

","I'm glad I wasn't in the UK's Celebrity Big Brother House this year. Not because I wouldn't have enjoyed meeting some of the others, but because at one stage fellow house mate Verne Troyer might have asked me about the last film he did with his best friend, and I wouldn't be comfortable lying to him and denying that I thought The Love Guru was a cinematic mutant mistakenly allowed to live and breathe rather than be put to a merciful sleep in the development stage.<br/><br/>Hey, I like Mike Myers. He has a measure of talent and charisma and likability, and I applaud his deserved financial and critical success with the Wayne's World and Austin Powers films (though he went one movie too far with Goldmember). Having said that, Myers, like his fellow SNL alumnus Will Ferrell, is like a kid wandering about a shop eating food off the shelves and generally behaving like someone in desperate need of supervision and guidance. Let's be honest, Ferrell's last decent leading role was in Anchorman (2004), and while he's been fine in supporting work like The Producers (2005), everything else that he's had a hand in has been a series of embarrassments of varying levels. And sadly, Myers can too easily fall into the same degree of arrested development.<br/><br/>People who know me know that I may go on about a lot of bad movies, but more often than not, I enjoyed watching them, and perversely can watch them again. This one, however, I'm ashamed that I ever wasted bandwidth getting it, let alone consider watching it again.<br/><br/>Myers' characters have always been one-note, with a limited appeal. But his latest Guru Pitka went too far when he thought of writing it down; in comparison, his Beatnik poet Charlie from So I Married An Axe Murderer (1993) was a character of multi-layered nuance, and more importantly, one that people would much rather watch. The very concept should have been seen as potentially execrable and insulting to Hindus. Yes, I know he tries to get around this in the movie by claiming that Pitka wasn't really a Hindu, but an American raised by Hindus, but like so much else in this movie, that attempt fails miserably given what passes for humor.<br/><br/>Hey, I like Dumb Humor  when it's done right. Dodgeball, Epic Movie, Jay and Silent Bob. But the gags in The Love Guru come in three flavors: racist, gross and infantile, and in various mixtures thereof. The racist names he came up with (Harenmahkeester, Satchabigknoba) is the sort of thing an ignorant ten-year-old kid would come up with to make the other ignorant ten-year-old kids in the playground laugh. Yes, isn't it hilarious that Indian people all have big long names? The rest of the atrocity is filled with other dodgy names like Coach Cherkov and Dick Pants, as well as alleged jokes about snot balls and nose hairs, humping elephants, food prepared to look like genitals, and buckets of urine  all of which probably would have sounded funny in 1988 in the writers' brainstorming sessions in the SNL offices at 3am when you're doped up on caffeine, but I honestly can't believe that a 45-year-old man wrote this crap down in 2008 and thought this would be funny in any other circumstances.<br/><br/>And the execution of these so-called gags is almost consistently accompanied by Myers with the same sort of mugging grin to the camera that he perfected with Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers  the difference here being that those other characters had moments where they really were humorous, but seeing Myers try it with Pitka is akin to watching an inept magician fail every trick, but still take a rehearsed bow after each one, oblivious to the negative reaction he's getting from his audience. And worse, he drives the jokes so deep into the ground, again and again, you expect them to bump into Hilary Swank piloting her subterranean machine around the Earth's Core.<br/><br/>And the storyline carrying these non-gags, like the sores on the back of a leper, is just as awful: a guru seeking fame and a spot on Oprah counsels a Canadian hockey player who wants to win back his wife from a rival, Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande, who apparently is well-endowed (Get it? Le Coq Grande?). Another lesson to learn, Mike: Sports Themes Aren't Funny. Canadian Sports Themes Aren't Funny, Cubed. It may give you the chance to hang about with your heroes, but it's a waste of time for the rest of us. Some have tried to point out the satire in Pitka's self-help philosophies, but satire only works when it makes a point, and doesn't just appear indistinguishable from the targets it's allegedly satirizing.<br/><br/>In case I haven't made it clear, this is a Bad Film. Not So Bad It's Good, like The Oxford Murders (2008). This is embarrassing on levels I haven't seen in ages. Some bad movies have people in it who can rise above the mediocrity, but this one is like quicksand, sucking people down and suffocating them. And I'm not talking about the likes of Verne Troyer, Jessica Alba and Justin Timberlake, who were basically employees who probably needed the money, or the cameos from Oprah and Val Kilmer. I'm talking about Ben F**king Kingsley.<br/><br/>How does a respected Oscar winner go from playing Gandhi to playing Guru Tugginmypudha?"
"thebackofmyhouse","7","13","22","10 July 2008"," Surprisingly funny
","Even before the movie was released, this movie had bad publicity. I myself thought this was going to be a crappy movie. From the trailer, it looks as if Mike Myers is recycling his old jokes for this movie.<br/><br/>So after The Love Guru was released, the critics ripped the movie apart, saying Mike Myers is a ""has been"" and has lost his comedic touch. They complained that he keeps doing the some jokes over and over again in his movies, and they have a point there.<br/><br/>So after watching it, I was surprised at how funny I found it. Sure he rehashes some of his old jokes, but the rehashes worked well in the movie. These jokes worked better in this movie than in his Austin Powers movies. In his Austin Powers movies, he kinds of over-do it with his jokes, it's like ""Yeah, I get the joke already"", but he keeps banging the joke on your head until it loses its funniness. It seems that he's learned from his mistakes and the jokes are done very well in this movie. He has learned when to stop.<br/><br/>Plus, compared to his previous movies, this movie is heavier on word-play jokes than physical jokes. And I like it like that."

After a very short time, it becomes very, very tiresome--like an Austin Powers movie without a single joke.<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes, it's all about Myers trying to reconcile a hockey player with his estranged wife....if anyone really cares. And, due to a huge number of Razzie awards and poor box office returns, no one did. Don't waste your time unless you are 100% obsessed with Mike Myers and want to watch nothing but what look like outtakes. How could a movie with this big a budget and this many guest appearances be this bad?! Crap."

","What a tragedy that Hollywood thinks that jokes about bodily functions, excrement and sexual dysfunction are the only kind that get any laughs these days. ""The Love Guru"" is by far one of the worst pieces of trash I've ever seen and certainly one of the worst movies ever to come out of Hollywood. I would not be surprised if this bomb sinks Mike Myer's career, any more movies like this certainly will. On top of the dreary, monotonous toilet humor, the C list celebrities, the stupid plot and the hammy, bad acting there is really nothing worthwhile in this stinker at all, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Knowing that there are people in America that will enjoy the toilet humor and mind-numbing story only confirms that the United States is being dumbed down and it's no surprise that Will Ferrell's movies are successful in middle America!"

Not having a huge desire to see the film I did end up watching it by default on a dinner date. I'm glad to say that the movie was much more entertaining and on par with most of Mike Myers past work. As the love Guru, Mike was true to the comical genius and work that fans of his have come to enjoy. Albeit not the greatest movie for 2008, I thought it was true to Mikes roots and had plenty of slapstick laughs. Even Jessica Alba's generally poor acting was well done here with her playing the unpopular owner of the Maple leafs. With the addition of Verne Troyer as the Maple leafs coach, Justin Timberlake as the antagonist and fellow upcoming popular actor Romany Malco, the movie had a good cast. I was pleased that there were no dry spots and the movie played consistent until the end. Overall I give the movie a 7 with it being decidedly funnier than this years long list of crappy comedy's.

","All I can say is, wow. Is it possible that a once talented showman became so suicidal that he managed to talk people into giving him 60 million dollars so he could make this career-ender? Masochism is a multi-layered thing. This movie is one long puerile penis joke. What was funny in the context of trailer park losers Wayne and Garth twenty years ago has become an insult to the public. Myers is nearly 50 years old, for heaven's sake, and the best he can come up with is two elephants copulating on the ice in game 7 of the Stanley Cup? Are people that venal to star in this POS? I understand Jessica Alba, like who knew it would be this bad, but the others? There's no excuse to compromise other people's careers if Myers has a death wish, which he apparently does. Penis jokes, testicle jokes, scrotum jokes, ass jokes, it's all too much. Not to mention racist, an insult to Indians, to Maple Leaf fans, to short people, to Jessica Alba fans, to everyone. I guess this is also a tribute to the Hollywood system, where Myers' inflated ego on the basis of the Shrek cash cow can actually convince real human beings to give him a gadzillion dollars. I won't even mention the starving Africans and Indians who could have used the money, it's an insult to them. Hell, building a sewage treatment plant with this money would have done humanity a major favour. Didn't anyone have the courage somewhere along the line to tell Myers to reign it in, to hire a decent scriptwriter if he no longer has it, or just perhaps to rest on his Shrek laurels and play golf? What's really disturbing isn't that this isn't funny (most things aren't), but that it's really mean-spirited. The only redeeming features are Justin Timberlake (who knew?) and a Verne Troyer outtake over the credits. The other 89 and a half minutes should be consigned to Heaven's Gate hell, and Myers should apologise to everyone involved."

"webtecht","9","8","14","2 January 2009"," *May contain spoilers*Where is the love?
","For the life of me I don't understand how reviewers have given Zohan and Get Smart better overall average star ratings than this movie. Of the three this flick has the most laughs. Of course the topic of this movie : new-age pseudo middle eastern self help spirituality is a big pill to swallow. I believe that this movie suffered bad reviews for several reasons that actually had nothing to do with whether it was well done or not.<br/><br/>In explanation of this I will offer several thoughts. 1)The main character is a white guy with obvious ethnic / cultural trappings.This I believe made it harder for audiences to relate to. We need to have lead characters clearly defined in their nationality and other aspects of their character. Guru Pitka admittedly was a bit ambiguous.Was he supposed to be East Indian? This ethnic group not nearly as ""cool""as being black or Hispanic,was not warmly embraced by north American audiences to be sure. As one friend asked me , ""Is he supposed to be East Indian?"" Ah no he is not.So for the majority of the public the character went right over their heads. This I believed is the source of the controversy that was stirred up when it was released. Is this a parody of East Indian culture? No it is not. On to my next point. 2)This movie due to its subject matter,a parody of pseudo psychology/mysticism that was so the rage in the early 90s. Unfortunately those who were into this pop phenomenon took it all to seriously.This is the problem , those who would ""get"" most of the jokes would not go to see this movie. With their politically correct spiritually righteous mentality,this movie might come across as an affront to their belief systems.<br/><br/>I was into some of the new age stuff in the day but never took it so serious as to let it erode my sense of humor. But in some ways unless you were into this scene a lot of the humor comes across as an bunch of ""inside jokes"" only some might get. You couldn't swing a dead cat in say 1995 without hitting some up and coming self help guru hawking their latest book. This is where the humor truly lies in this movie. The Love Guru stands up not only as a great parody of time past but also as a social satire with its roots in the last decade. <br/><br/>Of course it is a very typical Mike Myers as it has its fair share of goofy slapstick gags and crude humor. Their are some fantastic one liners that actually noticed only on subsequent viewings. I found Myers played the character with warmth and genuine love for the material. This often put over a lot of the more lame jokes as there certainly are more than a few. But hey isn't that what a Mike myers movie is supposed to be ? Jokes so inanely silly that that is what makes them roar out loud funny.Come on now Austin Powers,Shrek and Waynes World were the same style. Yet amazingly enough so many reviewers state that is what ruined this movie.Personally I love a comedy that uses the a joke so bad its funny approach,truly this being for me the charm of Mike Myers past efforts.<br/><br/>I am not sure what people expected. I personally wish it would have done better in the box office as I would love to see sequels. Hey maybe Guru Pitka can ""co-star"" with Austin Powers(you know help him get his mojo back)as the character is one of the finest Myers has created.I believe the character should get more mileage. But I think the nuances of Guru Pitka went over the average movie goers heads. This is sad as it doesn't reflect on the quality of the movie but more so on how far the average movie goers sense of humor has slipped.<br/><br/>I am thinking that had this movie been released ten years ago in 1998 it would have been a huge hit and critically praised. This movie's only crime being it is a bit behind the times topically speaking. I truly believe in the future this movie will be lauded as a unrecognized classic. Hey Deepak loved the movie and thought it was very entertaining.As for the majority of bad reviewers who stated this movie was nothing more than a string of penis jokes,I have to wonder if they even watched the same movie.Yes, granted there is the fair share of crude humor ,what comedy doesn't go that route these days. Like Jackass is high concept.<br/><br/>Justinb Timberlake as a french Canadian hockey player in love with Celine Dion was bust a gut hilarious. I think he should give up singing and concentrate on being a comedic actor,he was that good. Myers pulls out every type of joke from ""potty humor"" to the Vaudvillian style ""take my wife please"" variety. All in all this movie is near perfect goofy comedy and absolutely does not deserve the almost universal beat down it has received. I have bought this movie and probably seen it now 10 times and will probably enjoy 10 more."

The humor and style of the movie were very similar. Honestly for the life of me I wonder how Austin Powers could get great reviews then this one not get the same reviews. Maybe people don't like the middle eastern character with a goofy bready look....I can not believe peoples sense of humors changed so much. One thing for sure many of the reviews for this movie happened either before or shortly after this movie came out. Makes me wonder if people actually watched it.<br/><br/>My recommendation is that everyone who has seen and liked the Austin Powers movies to give this movie a chance. If you never even liked Austin Powers then skip this one. But don't come here and reject this movie off of the reviews on this site. This movie was a lot better than Zohan."

","They played this one on TV, and I happened to be in the room, pottering about on a Sunday evening. That is the only reason I decided to watch this, because it's been out for two years and one has to have been in an isolation tank not to have heard what a turkey 'The Love Guru' is. It almost made those rubbish Troma movies appear amusing, or at least on a par. On a par, in this case, with the belated 'comeback' effort of a formerly successful and well-liked comedy writer-director-actor whose career had bloomed in the 1990s and floundered in the 2000s. After revisiting his most successful creation (1960s spy-spoof 'Austin Powers') with a third trip to the well in 2002, Myers' live-action movie career stumbled with definitive misfire 'The Cat In The Hat' in 2003. For the next five years Myers remained off-screen, voicing the title character of the animated 'Shrek' movie franchise, until...'The Love Guru'. The movie's many faults are detailed by other posters, but what struck me was how truly sad an experience it was. A genuinely heart-sinking experience akin to watching an old dog trying to jump the fence one time too many. Myers' sense of comedy has gone seriously -and perhaps permanently- adrift, and he has effectively taken a mildly diverting two-minute TV show sketch and stretched it to micron-thinness over a motion picture frame. Look, shall we just do both Mike Myers and ourselves a favour and remember him as he was; i.e. cute and funny? This sad, sobering movie is like a chapter from 'Hollywood Babylon'."
"GrantKanigan","Null","11","21","24 August 2008"," Not As Bad As You Might Think
","Although this may be the worst film of Mike Myers career, it is definitely not the worst of the year. Yes the film is ridden with penis jokes. Yes there are bad puns. In the end however, The Love Guru doesn't fail to make you laugh many times. It does use Verne Troyer offensively as the butt of many jokes, and doesn't have much of a meaning, but when a film can make you laugh for most of the running time, there is something great about that. <br/><br/>Most of the jokes are hit and miss, but there are so many of them that at least a few will have you in stitches. In a time where ""Genre"" Spoof Movies are bringing in millions, the Love Guru is at least a little taste of originality. We all know that Myers can make us laugh, but we might not of known it would take so little.<br/><br/>My last comment is that the Love Guru is very similar to Leslie Neilsen's WRONGFULLY ACCUSED. A very funny film that is worth catching once, because of all the laughs you'll get, but watching it a second time is like cheese gratering your face. The Love Guru isn't that bad, but it has the same feel. Worth catching on TV or at the Video store if you want to turn your brain off and have a good laugh."
"the_Poppuns","8","13","26","20 June 2008"," I really enjoyed it
","I don't know what everyone is complaining about. I've seen that it's getting bad reviews and I don't know why.<br/><br/>Mike Myers plays Guru Pitka (""The Love Guru"") who is always playing second fiddle to Deepak Chopra. So in an attempt to get the recognition he seeks he takes on the task of helping the star of the Toronto Maple Leafs, played by Romany Malco, whose personal problems are effecting his game during the championships.<br/><br/>So the film mixes the kind of advice you'd get in all the self-help books from people like Deepak Chopra with jokes. So it's kinda making fun of it, but it isn't because it shows that the advice is pretty good, but it's still funny. I'm actually someone who has read a lot of those books and maybe you have to be to get how hilarious Guru Pitka is. But he's also Mike Myers and if you don't like Myers, you should probably know that by now, and shouldn't be seeing this movie. If you do like him however, I can't see a real reason why you wouldn't like it. Justin Timberlake has a small role as the opposing goalie, who is causing a great deal of Romany Malco's character's stress. Timberlake's sorta funny but kinda overdid it.<br/><br/>The film has some bathroom humor but not as much as you normally see in a Mike Myers film. It's much more about self-esteem and overcoming your baggage in order to succeed. I know it's a silly comedy but that stuff is in there. I guess people wouldn't want to take kids to it, because of some sexual humor, but otherwise I thought it was really funny and laughed throughout."

Maybe my opinion is a bit biased, considering just last week a show on TV called Iconoclasts aired. It is a documentary about Deepak Chopra and how much he's impacted Meyer's life. They go back and forth on how many of Chopra's principles are found in acting. Meyer's goes on to describe how and when he came up with Guru Pitka and then later reveals to the viewer that in basically all his movies, a deeper meaning is found for those who are really into their spirituality. So when I was watching the movie, it really got me thinking. For those of you who have seen it, if you can separate what the movie is trying to do on the forefront and concentrate on what's really going on, you'll find that there really is a lot of wisdom in the witty jokes that Meyer's spews.<br/><br/>I did sense a lack of plot, but the movie was entertaining and it a must-see just because of the many anagrams.

","I have been a Myers fan since his SNL days. But ever since he made that first sequel to Austin Powers, it's been a downhill tumble into low-brow jokes that pander to the crude and ignorant in the audience. This movie is him scraping the barrel: a string of bad dick and fart jokes mixed in with him giggling like a moronic school girl as he tries to stretch out jokes that get small titters and eye rolls at best.<br/><br/>Mike, you are a funny man, but playing the same gag over and over again is underestimating and abusing your audience. Remember the witty humor you did in Wayne's World? That is what audiences are craving again... we want sophisticated dick and fart jokes, if you must have them. Do yourself a favor: rent Superbad, Waiting, Knocked Up, Juno, and The 40 Year Old Virgin. Take notes... these are the comedies that people raved about over the past 5 years.<br/><br/>Report back when you have something worthwhile. And remember, don't underestimate your audience's level of comedic intelligence."

","In my quest to see the worst of the worst that Hollywood has to offer, I stumble upon this film. According to my younger brother, it was the worst film he has ever seen. I finally had the chance to see it and all I saw was: Horror, pain, misery and silence (I will explain that one later). <br/><br/>First my opinion about Mike Myers himself. He was a great actor and his rolls in Wayne's World, Austin Powers and the first two Shrek films are great. But than his popularity falls down in the around 2003, with film rolls like The cat in the hat. The Love Guru is seen as the exact point when Myers career committed Japanese ritual suicide.<br/><br/>I can say from the bottom of my heart that this is the worst comedy I have ever seen in my life. Say what you will about the Adam Sandler movies or the Friedberg and Seltzer movies (epic movie, disaster movie), at least they have some level of thought into it (not that it make these films good). This film is just an torture device.<br/><br/>First the story. It is about guru Pitca (Mike Myers), who is helping an ice-hockey player (Romany Malco) to face his fears, so he can win the ice-hockey game so Pitca can be at Oprah's talk show to become the world's greatest guru. The plot is bland, uninspired, very predictable and just stupid. The only things I can remember from this movie is the stupid and predictable love-triangle, and two elephants having sex on an ice-hockey field. I just became less intelligent after saying that last bit.<br/><br/>The characters are all bad. Myer's character was the worst one. He tries so hard to make the viewer's laugh, but fails miserably. The rest of the cast I can't remember a single thing except for the ridicules names. Like Justin Timberlake's character named Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande, guess why he is called that way. Than you have Dick Pants played by John Oliver. <br/><br/>The worst thing that can happen to a comedy is that the jokes make nobody laugh. Remember the silence I mentioned at the beginning of this review? That's what my brother remembers of watching this film at his school, because nobody makes a laugh, not even at the really bad stuff in this film. The comedy in this film can be summed up like this: Guru Pitca's ridicules face, bad sex jokes (like the one with the elephants), and about a million dick jokes, none of them are close to be funny.<br/><br/>There is no hope for Mike Myers. He will never make a good film ever again. To all of you, stay away from this thing."
"rama-28","7","17","38","14 June 2008"," Prepare to laugh... and be Enlightened : )
","A new Comedy movie by Mike Myers that will tickle your funny bones in a silly way. It won't make your side hurt from laughing too much but it's funny enough that you won't mind seeing it again just to be entertained. Not all the jokes hit the target but the humor in general is meant for those of us who are familiar with Mike Myers' type of comedy. In times when it seems like a comedy movie has to be vulgar or show genitalia just for the shock effect, it's cool to see something like this that has some suggestive sexual elements without being unnecessarily graphic about it.<br/><br/>I can understand why the Hindus and India people everywhere keep e-mailing me asking me to boycott this movie. THE LOVE GURU does contain some stuff that might offend certain ethnicities or beliefs. Especially how some names are made to sound like Indian but they mean something funny in English.<br/><br/>But I don't think it means to make fun of a culture if you notice carefully, I think the movie makes fun of Bollywood movies. I grew up watching Bollywood movies, so it cracks me up when Mike Myers and Jessica Alba start to spontaneously sing a silly song in the middle of a field, song that sounds just like the ones I've heard in Bollywood movies.<br/><br/>Not to mention this movie also features popular American songs accompanied with Indian musical style and instruments.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how Mike Myers does it, but he always seems to manage to get celebrities to do cameo in all his movies.<br/><br/>You'll notice some famous faces show up, not for the money, but for the surprise and for a chance to be in a gig with Mike the Myers.<br/><br/>I find it hilarious how the characters would greet one another by saying the name of a famous TV actress, Mariska Hargitay.<br/><br/>The special effects are okay, the best one is Mike Myer's character as a child.<br/><br/>The self-help storyline is very complimentary, it's not preachy and in fact, it's comical and profound at the same time it sure means a lot that this movie is approved by Deepak Chopra himself.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Jessica Alba's acting I think she needs to take lessons again, but I have to admit, she's never looked so gorgeous.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake's performance in this movie is rather annoying. When I saw the trailers months ago, I thought man, JT looks like he's going to to be hilarious. But in fact, his fake Canadian French accent and his mannerism and the whole joke centered around him being supposedly endowed are more irritating than amusing.<br/><br/>Ya know how some comedy movies would start out with a bang but then it dies down halfway through the end. This one kinda has some unfunny, dull moments in the middle, but then it picks up again and it ends with a joyous celebration literally The force that holds it together in the end is none other than Mike Myers himself who's got the charm, the wit, the outrageous facial expressions and the comedic timing that are all in harmony with the ultimate enlightenment that is THE LOVE GURU."

","I sat through this movie because I was (lucky) enough to get passes from a local radio station. I went in expecting this to be a good movie. I took my fiancé to see this and it has its really good funny parts. I could not believe that this movie received a pg-13 rating. How in the world do you give a movie this rating and have so much penis talk and all this stupid non-sense stuff. In my honest opinion this was the absolute worst movie I've ever witnessed in my life. This movie was one step below what The Mist was. There were people who actually got up and started leaving during this screening and complaining to the management. If you want to take your children to this, I do not recommend it. Too many sexual remarks and other stuff. Do not go see this. Justin Timberlake actually was pretty good in his role."

","Words cannot describe how close I was to walking out of the theater during the movie. However, I only stayed out of the hope that there would be a moment that was actually funny. It utterly failed to be another stupidly hilarious Mike myers comedy like Austin Powers or Wayne's World. There was absolutely no plot. It was really like the writers said, ""Hey, let's go get a hot girl, a bad pop star, a midget and all the bad sex jokes we can find and make a movie about nothing!"" This was truly disappointing.It was LOOOOOOOOOOONG too! By the end, it was getting painful to watch. I was appalled when I heard the couple behind me talking about how hilarious it was. (Pity their lack of taste). I would not suggest this movie to anyone! Good Lord, could it have gotten any worse??"
"raypdaley182","1","12","25","11 July 2008"," Awful & unoriginal!
","Take every bad idea from Austin Powers & Wayne's World, liberally mix them with ""The Guru"" (starring Jimi Mistry & Heather Graham, obviously where Myers stole the idea for this film) and you've got this excuse for a film. Most of the jokes (if you can call them that) are 1 laugh only, if that. Most of them are actually no laughs at all but that doesn't stop Myers jamming them down your throat with the vain hope you might find them funny if he repeats them often enough. A lot of this movie is recycled ideas from the various Austin Powers films and Myers' love of bad puns and word play (he might want to watch Ronnie Barker in ""The Two Ronnies"" who has been doing it longer, much better and without repeating himself).<br/><br/>Possibly the only funny moment in the film is when Pitka is being beaten up by 2 children in a bar fight. Worst moment would be the ""3 girls named Ann"" joke. Myers also managed to not only ruin my favourite song by Extreme but also missed a great opportunity for a good cameo (he could have had the Extreme lead singer playing the sitar). Most of the jokes in this film are funny if you are a boy of 12, sadly I'm not 12 any more and Myers is just trying too hard for the entire film. Most punchlines can be seen from a mile away. Verne Troyer has pretty much destroyed any credible career he might have ever had by agreeing to be in this garbage. And don't even mention the ""Elephants"" scene which is not only totally pointless but slows down the movie at exactly the wrong moment. Myers doing a cameo as himself is the ultimate in ego indulgence in a film, the eventual outcomes are way too obvious as well.<br/><br/>Roanoake wins The Stanley Cup, gets his girl back from Jacques Grande (played very badly by Justin Timberlake), stands up to his mother and Guru Pitka loses his chastity belt, gets the girl & thus is the rip-off of Jimi Mistry's ""The Guru"" complete, right down to the Bollywood version of a Western dance number at the end.<br/><br/>Sadly this was just a movie to indulge Mike Myers and his love of childish humour so he's made no progress as either a writer or an actor since he made Wayne's World. Anyone could have filled Jessica Alba's role as she's completely forgettable (Heather Graham was much better in ""The Guru"", far sexier, a better actress and she could actually sing & dance better too!) and not enough was made of Pitka's sidekick/manservant who deserved a much bigger part in the movie.<br/><br/>Not recommended to even the most hardcore Mike Myers fan. Avoid!"

","I wasn't very interested in the film from the previews, but I won a free screening ticket and I'm glad I did! It takes a while to ""get"" the film but it's really a tremendous parody on the whole spiritual guru business.<br/><br/>Just like Austin Powers was really unseen before in its originality, The Love Guru takes an entirely new concept and manages to balance being goofy enough to be funny but just serious enough that you still care about the characters. Mike Myers takes turns being the strange one and being the straight man, which is good because the film doesn't turn into a farce as a result.<br/><br/>The plot had quite a few good twists and there's a surprise ending (two of them) that had me tearing a little at the end with laughter. My only objection might be that they made fun of dwarfs in a rude manner, and the film takes a while for you to understand what they're aiming for.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley and Justin Timberlake win big big props for being willing to make fun of themselves on screen. Let's hope when they make Love Guru 2 they don't make the mistake they did with the Austin Powers films and make a cookie-cutter remake that parroted the first, killing off the creative.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- everyone, but only if you like bathroom humor"

It focused wholly on what people have found funny in the past, like farting, belching, small people. These are the three things that kept cropping up again and again and again. They kept forcing these jokes on the viewers with a pause afterwards to give people the chance to muster up a chuckle.<br/><br/>Really i think they should give the viewers a bit more respect.

","It's obvious when a comic knows they're bombing: they resort to the crutch of using dirty jokes or ethnic jokes for cheap, easy laughs. Love Guru is evidence that Mike Myers is dreadfully insecure about the future of his career.<br/><br/>Austin Powers (oh wait, that's the character being rehashed but not what they call him in this flop), learns Eastern Religion and a bad accent. His journey of enlightenment is apparently to insult people (usually with that familiar word that starts with ""f""). He chases women, gives advice on how to offend women and therefore get one, etc. There are no laughs, no memorable moments, no reasons to watch this whatsoever. In addition to Myers self-destructing, Jessica Alba continues her challenge to set a record for consecutive lousy performances in worthless movies. Her current run of these career-ending disasters is a number roughly equal to the number of miles that light travels in a year.<br/><br/>This rubbish isn't even good enough for ""straight to video"" release.

I didn't really see any redeeming points, but I suppose some would laugh at some of it, if you had a fairly sick mind. But, then, those people could just watch a sick movie online, rather than actually wasting gas and cash to go see a movie like this in theaters. But i suppose that many people do enjoy this kind of thing, maybe. It was sort of sad, seeing as Austin Powers was funny.

","An open letter to Mr. Michael Myers.<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Myers.<br/><br/>I am writing to inform you that it's the sign of the times and I think you should read and understand what it clearly means in regards to your....career. The years have come and go but unfortunately they have not been kind to cinema and society in general. The reason I'm writing this letter is because I feel that deep in my heart you should SERIOUSLY consider throwing in the towel and find something else worthwhile pursuing; maybe philanthropy perhaps? If you do that not only will people respect you more but it will also help wash away all memories of those years enduring your crap after crap after crap movies. Although I can't see how this can possibly happen overnight if fate and the universe persists, it will be a sigh of relief if it was all the more true.<br/><br/>Memories. Oh how profoundly fond those memories are and I recall watching ""Wayne's World"" when I was teeny-weeny with a more less jaded view of the world and then came ""Austin Powers"". Ahhh, the laughs those provided to help me drift away from the drudgery of life. Then a funny thing happened and the end result was a horrific turn as a pudgy, sex-innuendo laden feline several years ago. In my mind there's no denying that you should have realized that your career tanked at that point for someone once funny to even remotely consider such a perilous career move. The days of ""Austin Powers"" are gone, buddy. GROW UP AND BE A MAN!!!<br/><br/>Having read the news a while back of your latest endeavor, I hoped that you'll rebound after such a dog-pile-of-you-know-what of said movie. But alas, my hopes were shattered once again and as I left the theater after witnessing such a travesty of talentless vain proportions, the fragility of my mental state almost reached the breaking point when a good Samaritan saved me from what was, to be precise, an almost life-threatening ordeal. I thanked the good Samaritan of course as any sane individual would do and went our separate ways. But I will never, EVER, thank you for releasing such soul-shattering ineptness garbage that nearly killed me dared to be released for unsuspecting, innocent eyes!!!<br/><br/>So in conclusion, after clearing my head of the madness that I suffered, cleansed my spirit as well as my soul, I am now able to return to the outside world once again with the notion that no human being should ever go through such a horrific experience. Although I know that time doesn't heal all wounds but it is known that the human spirit is a remarkable thing that not even the likes of you and the evils of Hollywood inhabiting the blue and green world cannot comprehend. That special someone, that one individual who saved me from the madness you spewed fourth are moments like these that remind me of the good in the world. And for that, I'm grateful."

That said, this has to be one of the worst comedies ever made, it simply does not work on any level, all the jokes fall flat, the acting if you can call it that is atrocious and the script seemingly written by Mike when he was 8 years old. Everything that was good about the Austin Powers movies has the opposite effect here. The character is simply not interesting, likable or funny in any way, the plot makes no sense and you can see the jokes coming a mile away. A sad downturn in a good comedy career.

Kingsley is too bad for words; Alba is nothing; Timberlake is the only even-remotely funny thing.<br/><br/>Years ago Myers yelped a lot about how much money Adam Sandler made relative to his own paltry $10-12 million/ movie.

I had somewhat of a hope for it because of Romany Malco who did pretty well in 40-year old virgin, I liked his character and it's a shame he signed on to this crap-fest of a film. Hell, SuperHero Movie is funnier than this crap.<br/><br/>I also watched it for Jessica Alba because who's to argue that she's the hottest woman in the world. She was the only thing that kept me watching this movie. If she wasn't in it, I'd stop the movie after 5 minutes and return it to the video store for my money back. Luckily, I rented it.<br/><br/>Seriously, this is just another Austin Powers sequel with real normal characters in it. It's the same type of humor that Austin Powers had. Also, Ben Kingsley, a great actor signed on to this film, he just lost his credibility for that. I'm not surprised with Jessica starring in this movie, she'll do any kind of movie, cuz she's clearly in it for the money, but let's face it, you go to Hollywood to make money, because I love money too, I could care less about an academy award performance. I can't sell the trophy, it's not worth anything.<br/><br/>Anyway, 1/10 for being even more stupid than the Austin Powers series. At least those movies had Seth Green and the tent shadow scene. I wish I could rate it a -100/10. Don't buy this, and don't waste money on renting it either. This is clearly for the tweens and 8 year olds.

What saddens me most is the reek of missed opportunity  lampooning new-age spirituality has seemingly endless comic potential, and yet nothing but the absolute bare bones are mined here. There's little attempt to work the gags into any sort of structure; they're just tossed away, and most of them can be heard to drop with a resounding thud.<br/><br/>The same ramshackle approach applies to the main character, too; there appears to be little consistency or definable personality about Pitka, the one constant being that he dresses weird and has a beard (That rhyme is so lame I confess a slight sense of surprise that Myers didn't add that into the mix, too )<br/><br/>On this evidence, maybe Myers is doing the right thing by hawking himself out for other people's scripts with his forthcoming efforts.

"jts0405","1","10","21","24 June 2008"," R.I.P. to Mike Myers' Career
","OK so first of all many people out there know that Mike Myers was the star of Wayne's World 1 & 2, Austin Powers 1-3 and many other notable comedies. Some may also know him from Saturday Night Live back in the 90's when he did several skits with Ben Stiller, Chris Farley, Dana Carvey, etc. But anyway we go from all of these great achievements to the Love Guru. It normally works when Myers plays more than one character but in this movie when he plays Young Pitka, Teenage Pitka, Guru Pitka and himself it is just not as funny as when he played Dr. Evil, Austin Powers, Fat Bastard and Goldmember in previous Austin Powers movies. Mike also found success with the cartoon movie Shrek, which has really started to water down after part 3. I would even go out on a limb and say that Shrek the Third was better than The Love Guru and that was a bad movie. Myers really continues to try and be active out there and I respect him for that, but people want to see his memorable work. After all he left it open for an Austin Powers IV at the end of the third one. People wanted to see Austin Powers IV instead of a lackluster Love Guru movie. Plus why the hell are we watching Justin Timberlake crack incredibly terrible two bit jokes? The whole smuggling a schnauzer thing sounds like a rip off Austin Powers or Wayne's World joke. To all fans of Mike Myers it looks like we will never see another Austin Powers or possibly a Wayne's World reunion movie. Instead we will be treated to at least 15 more Shrek movies and possibly The Love Guru Part II. To all of Myers' fans, let's keep chanting Yeah Baby and Schwing, maybe he will hear us and give up this Shrek Love Guru nonsense."

","Less direct and raunchy than Adam Sandler's 'Zohan', not quite as epic as Austin Powers, but still plenty entertaining. I'd put this movie at the right thing to see when you're in the mood for something to put a smile on your face and to feel a little fuzzy inside.<br/><br/>It's definitely Mike Meyers, which means plenty of allusions and innuendos, and while I wouldn't call it his greatest work, Meyers' brand of more subtle humor always tickles my fancy, with Love Guru being no exception.<br/><br/>When my brother and I arrived in the theater, there were only four other people (early Sunday), and two of them left about 15 minutes into the film, so it was my brother and I along with two others. That seemed to be the optimal setting, as I think this movie actually suffers the larger the audience there is. Mostly I believe this because it seems like a perfect stay-at-home during a rainy day movie to get in a few laughs with a loved one or family, but in an open theater with a few dozen other people, I can certainly see how some would feel pressured to react offended or apathetic toward many of the jokes the film has to offer.<br/><br/>While I did find that Meyers' accent could have used a little work, it was adequate most of the time, and was probably the largest detraction, but as with Mike Meyers, most of the jokes are physical and are on-screen to laugh at anyways.<br/><br/>My brother (19 years old) was laughing at the jokes all the way through, and I found myself along with him more often than not (along with a few off-spots because I have a few Canadian friends - Justin swearing in Quebecois is priceless!).<br/><br/>So, overall, I'd say it's a good movie to own on DVD, and catch it in Theaters if you're a fan of Mike Meyers, but I would recommend off-times so that you can get that more intimate feeling which I think the film requires."

How can a cast of Ben Kingsley, Stephen Colbert, Jessica Alba, Mike Myers, Verne Troyer, Justin Timberlake, Jim Gaffigan, and many more very talented people be in such a deadly, poisonous piece of junk like The Love Guru? There's nothing funny about this movie. Nothing here is less than completely painful. It's like someone stabbing you in the back and then finishing you off by punching you in the groin. That's how much fun it is. It's quite possibly more painful than that. This movie deserves to be buried in the middle of nowhere. If there was a negative score on IMDb, I would rate it the lowest possible negative score. I'm not even going to go into the plot because I'm too mad reviewing this in the first place. Not a single funny moment in this whole movie, ever minute painful. Mike Meyers has become the anti-Christ of film makers. Never see this movie, even if yours or someone else's live(s) depends on it.

Mike Myers really needed to try something new, instead he took all his jokes that were popular from other films he's made (which we've all seen too many times anyway) and put them in this movie along with a lot of idiotic crap.

I actually found Verne Troyer to be quite funny in this one and not just because of his midgetness. He delivered some of the best lines. I also thought Stephen Colbert's portrayal of the insane sportscaster to be quite hilarious.

This movie didn't try to have an Oscar-winning script- it is just a fun, silly movie and was marketed as such. My fellow movie-goers and I were continually snickering and often burst out in laughter.

This movie is basically a bunch of little jokes he always wanted to do in his other huge movies but never got the opportunity.

Obviously I will not give out any names.<br/><br/>What it all comes down to is if you like Mike Myers, you like corny joke after corny joke, and you want it all in under 1hr and a half, then go see this movie!

Even bad movies I give a chance hoping to see some gleaming moment of humor, meaning, or purpose. I stopped caring about the movie 5 minutes in and regrettably stopped watching and left after about an hour. Oh the things I could have done in that hour- It is truly a shame that none of that could have been completed. This movie is not only juvenile, it is just plain stupid, slow, and humorless (unless you are an awkward 10 year old that found The Cat in the Hat a work of art) Myers once said in an interview that if he can make his wife laugh at his jokes, he knows they are good. Nobody laughed at this movie when I saw it, so I hope she isn't doing you the disservice of laughing at these ""jokes"" and ""gags""(uhggg I really hesitate calling them that). I hope Meyers sticks to the formulas for his most recent successes: Prewritten scripts for animated movies. I only hope he leaves the turn and burn movie platform (lower budget stupid movies to turn any profit) behind and re-establishes a witty persona more suited of his age.<br/><br/>Best of luck Meyers- I will wait for your next one on DVD too."

","This movie is simply painful to watch. I always enjoyed Mike Myers, but this movie was probably one of the worst i've seen. First off, the story isn't funny. There's maybe a few jokes that are laughable, but the rest are simply not funny. On a positive note, Mike Myers singing ""9 to 5"" and ""The Joker"" was quite good. Then there was Justin Timberlake role, the thing that really made me hate this movie. His role as a french Canadian (from Quebec) was way too over exaggerated. Using the word ""tabarnak"" (a french swear word) in every single lines he says just doesn't make it funny. The only good thing in this movie is Jessica Alba. She at least had a decent role.

","When you watch this movie its as if you're watching Austin Powers dressed up as an Indian with an Indian voice spewing all the jokes that worked in the original Austin Powers movie. Its the exact same jokes with the exact same delivery but the timing is flat, old, awkward, and boring.<br/><br/>If you trace back Mike Myers' career you will find the same awkward timing in The Spy Who Shagged me - the sequel to the first Austin Powers movie - he used all the best jokes and gags from the first Austin Powers and beat them to death over and over in the 2nd one with little comedic value. I'm sure it was a great time for the crew, but 5 minutes of Fat Bastard belching and farting does not work in a 90 minute film, it works as a SNL sketch - maybe. The first Austin Powers movie had all the same gags but it had a flair, a style, and deft comedic timing. Every movie he's made since then has been a series of sketches devoid of any narrative thread.<br/><br/>In the very first line of dialog this movie is lost. Mike Myers talks directly to the camera - a risky device for any actor, but one Myers has pulled off before - he rings off a list of Indian spiritual philosophies then qualifies it by saying 'or some other crap like that'. In other words, he undercuts his character's belief in the entire world he's created for this movie. No joke ever works. And maybe they wouldn't have anyway but they would have at least had a chance! All the penis jokes, sexual double entendres and flat out gross out humor have worked in his movies and many other movies before and will work again but this seismic shift at the very beginning sends this movie careening into disaster.<br/><br/>I think Mike Myers has lost himself in a Hollywood black hole; surrounded by yes-people and sycophants, everything he does is funny to the small orbit of people he interacts with, but he never gets in front of an audience. I heard he tested this character in front of audiences but to what extent and what context I don't know. One-liners spouted by a funny sounding Indian guy might make drunk people laugh at a night club but not people paying 12 bucks at the theater.<br/><br/>After Austin Powers and the success of Wayne's World, Mike Myers became too powerful for his own good. He isn't the first to fall victim to success but he's still young enough to come out of it if he's smart. He should allow himself to actually be directed by somebody and give up some control. He cannot be objective about what he's putting up on the screen.<br/><br/>With all that talent, if he shoots another movie where he stomps around the set making everybody's life miserable and writes every line of dialog, chooses every shot and then sits in the editing room making the final cut - he's doomed. He'll be lucky if producers will allow him one more real budget to make a big flop again - audiences will remember Love Guru and they won't give him a big opening weekend unless he deserves it. Good luck Mike."

He knows when to stop and when enough is enough. Mike Myers is clearly no Mel Brooksnot even close.<br/><br/>This movie from start to finish is a crass satirical pun on the whole guru movement and ""guru's"" everywhere. Interlaced with constant sexual innuendo, some more obvious and crass than others, Myers is attempting to make us laugh at the stupidity of people believing in guru's and the whole concept of the over marketed and under delivered shyster guru's that inundate our society. Whereas I do believe that guru's of all shapes and sizes have tended to prey on the weak emotions and psychological wants and needs to build their existences versus actually delivering quantifiable product, thereby giving continued credence to P.T. Barnum's statement ""There's a sucker born every minute!"" And clearly, Myers has capitalized on this lemming mentality as well in the crowds following the master guru's in his movie. But he does so with a dialog soaked in crass sexual innuendo.<br/><br/>Now, I like a good pun probably as much if not more than the next person and truth be told, there's a few really good lines and scenes in herebut way too fewand one of the best comes during the credits as a bloopernow that's really sad!

You can be ""dirty"" and still be very funny, but Myers consistently crosses the line and is just plain gross.<br/><br/>At least he did get me to laugh out loud a half dozen times. Stephen Colbert's character is downright stupid and provided no laughs. He's the ""Hockey Night In Canada"" announcer. (If you want to hear humorous lines from a TV sports commentator, check Fred Willard's job in ""Best In Show,"" not Colbert here.)<br/><br/>The other members of the cast are equally lame but the saddest thing is to see Ben Kingsley, a fine actor, participating in this farce by playing an idiotic cross-eyed guru. He must have no pride in whatever roles he takes. You expect cheap laughs from Myers or Colbert....but Kingsley? Just watch this film and it will demonstrate how little the status of ""knighthood"" apparently has become in Britian.<br/><br/>""Extremely immature"" might be the most apt description of this comedy, which is geared for 16-year-olds, and immature ones at that!"

","I got to see this movie for free at a preview. I usually avoid comedies these days -- I get tired of the premise after about 30 minutes. But this movie kept me laughing from beginning to end -- great setups for jokes, great sight gags, and likable characters. However, one warning, which you might consider a spoiler -- lots of penis, poop, and snot jokes. And if you are easily offended, you might want to avoid it. Otherwise it's the perfect movie for a bad day, and it's not a long movie -- you won't find yourself wondering when it's going to end. So if you're boss is driving you crazy, or your Economic Stimulus Payment was just enough to cover the cost of filling the gas tank, you might spend the money and go see this. It's a hoot."

","Yes it's a bit over indulgent (as Myers is a character comedian)and Myers has ensured his view on how the movie is made is engaged via an inexperienced director but in essence this is a comedy from the heart of Myers using the same formula as the powers franchise and even moments from Waynes World. His heart is in the right place with this one and when you enjoy it for it's watchability then you're not disappointed. It's only when you try and inject an air of believability in to it that you start to wander into the critic realms and forget that you are watching this for fun, myers has never professed to making believable movies and so this is one that should just be enjoyed for the basic easy going humour that we all enjoy as kids, as that is where I think He is heading with this one, please regress to your childhood and enjoy the giggle humour, Shakespeare it ain't!!!"

","I have been a big Mike Myers fan for a long time and I can officially say he peaked 10 years ago. Perhaps the mortgage melt down got to him and he needed to raise some scratch. It was forced comedy and really the whole story was just awful. It was so bad I actually asked for my money back and was denied because I was more than half way through the film. Here's a suggestion, they should have a warning flash in movies that alerts you when you are almost half way through a film. Everyone involved should feel ashamed for being part of this project. Mr Myers you owe me $14 for the movie, $6 for snacks, $6 for gas and 88 minutes of my life back. If anyone involved in this movie has ever received an Academy Award, you should return it."

It features very creative comedy and well put together words. this includes; ""liquor in the front, and poker in the back"". That was a fantastic line and only one of very many creative lines.

","I don't understand why everyone thinks this movie is bad. I didn't think it was as funny as Austin Powers but since Mike Myers played the Austin Powers role well and that all three movies were such big hits, I think that everyone believes that Mike Myers has to reach that level with every movie he makes. The Love Guru however is somewhat of a different approach in Myers career. The movie is not only about a Guru and the Toronto Maple Leafs, it also has a bit of a romantic storyline from two points of view but I won't ruin it if you intend on seeing it. Verne Troyer also adds to the humour with a number of hilarious acts he performs in the movie. I also found it interesting that Mike Myers was able to use the LA Kings, Toronto Maple Leafs and Hockey Night in Canada in the film. That was one aspect I found to allow like the film even more since I watch hockey on CBC. This film is also viewed as controversial due to the humorous aspects of the Guru. Films like Borat and Passion of the Christ are viewed as controversial and are some of the best films of all time so to give the Love Guru negative reviews due to the controversy involved does not really make sense. The Love Guru has a great storyline and even though it may be a bit far fetched at times, make your own decision and don't just listen to the reviews and the critics.<br/><br/>10/10"

I can't wait for Mike Myers to remake other bad movies such as ""Kazaam"", ""Freddy Got Fingered"" and ""From Justin to Kelly"".

","I m a fan of the Austin Powers movies, and so I was looking forward to seeing ""The Love Guru."" <br/><br/>Here's my opinion: The Love Guru is to Austin Powers what ""Hot Shots: Part Deux"" is to ""Airplane."" What I mean is that both movies want to achieve the same result and have similar formats and formulas, but one nails it and the other is a half-hearted attempt. <br/><br/>Let me try to say it a different way... If the Austin Powers movies are Mad Magazine quality. The Love Guru is ""Cracked"" magazine (remember that crappy rip-off of the Mad format?) <br/><br/>I miss the fresh double entendre of Austin Powers. What we get instead is a close-up of a BOOGER complete with NASAL HAIRS. Luckily I neglected to buy popcorn, or I would've retched! Same goes for the ""stinkmop"" scene. <br/><br/>I was amazed by the ""What is it you can't face?"" scene (look it up) that I saw in one of the trailers (the trailers included just about every other funny scene as well.) I thought it was brilliant wordplay. Then I went online and discovered it was ripped off from a comedy routine by Caroline Rhea and the movie ""The Sound Of Music!"" WTF?<br/><br/>Here's the part of the movie that really made me laugh (yes there was one.) While we are watching two elephants having sex (yes you read that right) the camera cuts to two obese people who kiss and say ""I love you."" That was funny. The other entertaining scene was a Bollywood flashback in which Myers and Jessica Alba sing in Indian complete with subtitles. It looked really retro complete with the 35mm film slipping off the projector gears. Nice fourth wall removal!<br/><br/>The rest of the movie seems really forced. Myers appears to be trying too hard. The Love Guru says ""When love goes wrong, nothing goes right."" Didn't Mike Myers recently (in 2006) divorce his long-time wife?<br/><br/>Hmmmmmmmm.."

That's not to say that this movie must be watched more than once in order to understand its 'hidden message', but that it is one that comes in under the radar.<br/><br/>This movie only recently popped back into my head and like I said, it's been a while, so I am essentially working off the essence that it left behind, hidden somewhere between my heart and my gut. However, it is through this essence that I realized that I loved this movie the first time that I saw it, even if I didn't understand why at the time.<br/><br/>This movie isn't making fun of people who are 'spiritual', 'religious' or even 'those who seek enlightenment through self-improvement movements'. What it does seem to be doing is gently mocking (whilst wearing a grin) our natural tendencies to attach ourselves to labels, images and ideas that we think will help to define us. This includes our quest to 'find' happiness.<br/><br/>What this movie is saying is that if you want to be happy then just be that. Be happy. It really is that simple and Mike Myer's character reflects this in everything he does on screen, not least of which is he himself being humbled.<br/><br/>Yes, even 'gurus' can make mistakes.

It was funny and well acted by most and I am glad to say that Jessica Simpson was only in it for 10 seconds or so and the part of the midget (I think that's the correct term) was also moderately small even though his character probably bought down the rating (Mostly Mike's Reaction annoyed me the most).\<br/><br/>Overall, it is a good film to see, it is funny MOST of the time and if you can get over the bad, you will be able to get the good and you will like this movie.

","I think the problem is not that the movie is ""juvenile"" or ""self indulgent"", but rather that so many of the reviewers here are! If you don't like comedy, then why the hell are you writing a review on a Mike Myers film? The point of ""The Love Guru"" is to make you laugh, not to win Academy Awards. If your goal in watching it is to laugh, then unless you have no sense of humo(u)r, you can't go wrong with the Love Guru. I was laughing so much I had to pause the DVD a few times -- it is absolutely hilarious, I found it much more consistently funny than any of the austin powers movies that all the amateur movie reviewers here probably fell over themselves trying to get to their iphones to type glowing reviews for. Furthermore, I'd say it's LESS self-indulgent and LESS potty humor oriented than austin powers (which isn't to say there isn't plenty of both -- there is - if you don't love scatological humor then why the hell would you watch Mike Myers??). The real problem is perhaps that it takes on ""spiritual"" subjects with hilarious results, which will perhaps hit people a bit too close to home...<br/><br/>There are so many hilarious references to sports, to the ""self improvement"" world, to Indian culture, there is a lot to like here. I think the movie is a bit ahead of it's time, it will perhaps be better liked in 5 years than now. But don't be dissuaded by bad reviews from people that don't really enjoy comedy or possess an actual sense of humor -- check it out for yourself!

","For the first time ever, I cannot muster the strength to write a quirky introductory sentence. After a long arduous thought-process of approximately 12 minutes after the credits rolled, I came to the conclusion that The Love Guru is the worst film I've ever had the misfortune of surviving. Yes, it is finally time for 'Movie 43' to pass the crown. So I'm sure you are all wondering ""what makes this film the worst?"". Quite simple really. Everything. Every single aspect, every single speck of dust, every God damn spoken word. Every-flipping-thing. I'm not even going to describe the plot. That's right, I'm breaking tradition for this one review.<br/><br/>As a fan of Myers' previous work, I was optimistic that this could've been atleast somewhat amusing, even in a silly parody way. But oh boy, I was wrong! I've never been so wrong in all my life. This film singlehandedly destroyed Myers' career, and he only has himself to blame. He co-wrote a screenplay that contains a record number of dick jokes. Visual dick jokes, audible dick jokes, imaginary dick jokes, abbreviated dick jokes, Hindu dick jokes, Justin ""Trousersnake"" Timberlake dick jokes and elephant dick jokes. There is not a single line of dialogue that is remotely funny. Just a colossal wave of crass outdated humour that has as much appeal as two elephants shagging on an ice hockey rink (which totally does happen...). A satire on Hinduism? Give me a break! There was no sign of genuine wit in this horrific script. And the worst part is that Myers thought he was actually being hilarious. ""Yes Mike, say wiener one more time? And fart? And repeat the same joke twelve more times? Cut! That's a wrap!"". Ben Kingsley, who I cannot believe agreed to be even remotely involved, was cross eyed for the entire film. Funny? No. Cringe-worthy? Definitely. Jessica Alba was only there for her dashing good looks so that Myers could pleasure himself between takes. Troyer makes a return, just so that we can all reminisce about 'Austin Powers'. Y'know, a time when Myers was comedically creative.<br/><br/>After the utter tripe of ice hockey, love advice, cock wrestling (rooster obviously, you dirty bugger) and celebrity cameos, the film concludes on a stereotypical Bollywood musical number that just leaves an incredibly sour taste in one's mouth. ""Oh but, they are writing a love letter to Bollywood films! Everything looks so colourful and musical and..."" STOP right there. You're telling me that Myers wrote this to show his appreciation for Bollywood flicks? Didn't think so. The worst crime is that they ""Bollywood-ised"" (Trade-frickin'-mark) Parton's '9 To 5', all in the first two minutes! I can't. Nope. I'm done. If a comedy is unfunny, unwatchable, uncharismatic and un-flipping-believably torturous, then it's a failure. No guru can advise me to watch this ever again."

Wish fulfillment on a $62 million dollar budget, this movie also features Jessica Alba as the love interest, Verne Troyer as an angry coach, John Oliver as a man named Dick Pants and Ben Kingsley of all people.<br/><br/>Between this and The Cat in the Hat, Myers earned a Golden Raspberry nomination for Worst Actor of the Decade.

","Mike Meyers makes an amusing (to some degree) but not really funny comedy that is far from the worst film of the year.<br/><br/>The plot has Meyers as Guru Picka who is second to Deepak Chopra. In a bid to be come number one (and get a shot at Oprah) he must get a hockey player back with his wife and his team to win the Stanley Cup.<br/><br/>Most of this movie doesn't have any laughs. Its not for trying, oh how they try, the problem is that most if not all of the humor is a retread of many other Mike Meyers films. There are songs (clever for a few seconds each), breaking the fourth wall, guest stars and other things which for the most part you've seen it all (especially when Meyers references himself). Its amusing and its clever at times but most of the jokes fall flat. It doesn't help that more than a good many of them consist of jokes involving bodily function, sex or the lowest common denominator, all of which are fine, so long as the punchline isn't painfully obvious which they are here (like most of the puns which we've seen before).<br/><br/>This isn't to say there are no laughs, Stephen Colbert is wickedly funny as a hockey announcer and much of the abuse Verne Troyer humor produce a chuckle or two at the very least. There are also a couple of genuine attempts at humor in the final moments that work, but mostly this is a misfire of a comedy.<br/><br/>Is it the worst film of the year? No. Frankly I think this will revive on cable and DVD when people realize that its not as bad as people have made it out to be. (Its certainly better than its lousy reputation). Actually I think once it hits cable where people don't have to pay for it will be the point it takes off. I was amused and I stayed to the end which says volumes especially at a post 10pm showing.<br/><br/>Just over 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>A word of warning- this should have been rated R.

This is the same over-the-top, unfunny direction Myers went in the third of his Austin Powers movies, which is the worst of those three films. Hopefully, moviegoers will reject this kind of infantile comedy. It shows a lack of imagination and a lack of intelligence. The PG-13 rating category has been a terrible idea; it's become just an excuse to dumb down the culture, including the minds of children and teenagers of all ages.

","If you like the Austin Powers films, and you are not Hindu or gay, and you do not have a hatred of the long-suffering Toronto Maple Leafs, then there is a very good chance you will enjoy The Love Guru. The hit Mike Meyers films, live action or animated, contain scatological humor. Let's face it. This isn't finger-to-cheek recognition of humorous intent over a cup of bitter tea. This is just plain fun and you can either laugh out loud at some cheap laughs mixed into a few expensive ones or not. Seeing Sir Ben Kingsley take on the low-brow role as the mentor of Pitka is a delight; anyone else in the role wouldn't have been as amusing. There are some off-the-cuff politically incorrect terms used for gay, which no doubt irk many film critics enough to pad their reviews with exaggerated pronouncements about the entertainment overall. Apart from those concerns, the experience of watching the film would be quite like watching Austin Powers except that the stakes are more on a personal Wayne's World level. I'm not a hockey fan, but I don't mind a movie about it so that shouldn't impede your enjoyment. It is interesting to see Hockey Night in Canada depicted with it's original theme song intact, even though this will date the film. The audience I saw it with in Toronto seemed to be with it and enjoy the sophomoric twists on self-help catch phrases. It is both paying tribute to a fad that was popular a few years ago and also being irreverent first and foremost."

"Robert_duder","6","5","12","6 July 2008"," Precisely as juvenile and ridiculous as you'd expect and yet somehow I did laugh...a lot
","I think by now anyone who sees a Mike Myers film can expect the same recipe that has made him billions, the Austin Powers recipe. How can you hate on The Love Guru when it is exactly everything that the Austin Powers films were? For all the terrible reviews and constant heckling about the content of this film after all was said and done I actually thought it wasn't half bad. Ridiculous? You better believe it. Childish? Completely. Making you laugh when you feel guilty about laughing at such stupidity? That's called Mike Myers. Some compare this film to the earlier Adam Sandler film You Don't Mess With The Zohan (see my review) and yet I can say in all honesty I thought The Love Guru was far more entertaining than Zohan in many ways. Maybe it's simply that Mike Myers can pull of childish humor better than any man...or comedian alive and that's what seems to make him tick. I'm not encouraging anyone to rush out and see this and I'm not telling you it's any great feat of film making by any means and it shouldn't be compared to anything really currently in theaters. All I am saying is for the expectations I had and for stupid humor it was watchable and even humorous at times.<br/><br/>Mike Myers is remarkably only one character...Guru Pitka, a white man who was raised in the traditions of Eastern religion and is now the world's second leading Guru (behind Deepak Chopra--a running gag in the film.) Myers is silly and funny and damn it he's having a good time and that's what makes this film insatiably watchable despite your better judgment. His character, like so many others he has created, is somehow lovable and fun to watch. His acting stinks but clearly he's doing an elongated skit and it's like the friend you have who always does stupid voices and makes you laugh. Jessica Alba sticks out like a hot sore thumb in this film. The last person you'd expect to see in this as a major leading character and somehow a romantic interest for Myers is Jessica Alba. She does alright although her strong suit is really standing there and looking hot and saying a few lines and she is really good at that. Romany Malco is decent enough as a troubled hockey player and the straight man to Myers jokes. Verne Troyer (yes Mini Me) plays the Maple Leafs coach and probably gives one of the best actual acting performances in the entire film. He's funny in an angry kind of way and just really does a great job. Finally the star of the show the entire reason to see this film...Justin Timberlake. I knew after he hosted Saturday Night Live this guy had comedic talent and he just blows you away as the well endowed Celine Dion obsessed French Canadian goalie for the Kings. He is hilarious and he is having a great time too clearly. It's not a role that requires anything but to have a good time and act like a goof and his is awesome. He outshines even Myers with his comedy. Also check out a substantial comedic cameo by none other than Sir Ben Kingsley as the cross eyed Guru Tugginmypudha. Also the film is chock full of Hollywood cameos including Deepak Chopra, Jessica Simpson, Kanye West, Rob Blake, Val Kilmer and a funny little cameo by Law and Order's Mariska Hargitay.<br/><br/>The movie is not a good movie case closed and it doesn't try to be. It's like going to a wild party for an hour and a half and I left and I actually felt good, still laughing at how stupid some of it was and yet isn't that exactly what they were trying to do? The sheer idea of Buddhists or any religion being upset about this film is ludicrous. It never once tries to take itself seriously or even take jabs at Indian culture. I've seen comedies and dramas that are far more ignorant to religions and cultures than this could ever be because it's like they are standing up and saying...this is not serious now have fun!! Toilet humor abounds, stupid jokes, eye rolling humor and yet somehow it's just fun. So if you think you might enjoy something like this then take this over Zohan any day because it's the dumbest thing in the theaters but you won't feel like you wasted your time or money. I'd even probably sit through it again for Justin Timberlake alone. This is director Marco Schnabel's debut and I think he probably just let Mike Myers have his way but this is what you should expect. 6/10"

Or perhaps just be unexposed to the off-America world Myers is referencing and spoofing.<br/><br/>Or maybe it helps to be Canadian, if only to have a taste for humane humour.<br/><br/>In any case, I think it is quite brilliant, laugh-a-minute fun and silliness. I admit Jessica Alba's acting is a bit wooden, but who cares. And the mop fight scene actually was pretty disgusting. <br/><br/>But Mike Myers has created a delightful character here. It is a great parody of the new-age/guru industry, without being actually denigrating. The humour is at times of the so-bad-it's-good genre, with the delivery lifting it from plain groaner to irrepressible guffaw. It's a run of gags and puns and double entendres all the way, and part of the fun is seeing how high he can stack them.<br/><br/>The production values are first-rate; it's lovely to watch. The Bollywood parodies make for multicultural novelty, and are a total romp.<br/><br/>There's plenty of star wattage. Justin Timberlake is perfect as the Quebecois blowhard goalie.

Since then my daughter (who was five in 2000) have gotten hooked on his Austin Powers films.<br/><br/>We both walked out of the theatre after viewing Guru and said, ""It wasn't very good and I really liked it.""

"outkastsker20","5","4","9","7 October 2008"," Very UnderRated
","I think this movie is highly underrated, it was really okay. The cast was well picked and everyone did a good job at making their characters' believable. The storyline of Mike Meyers character ""Guru Pitka"" did not veer off from the movie's title at all. Mike Meyers may have used the same approach of delivering his jokes as in past movies, but that's his style. It's like Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider being in the same movie a bunch of times, you know you're in for a boat load of the same comedy. All comedians have their own way of telling jokes and audiences will take it in differently. Most of the jokes told in this movie are more for the ""sick minded"" and those who aren't, will have a hard time understanding them."
"marimbadaddy","5","4","9","22 September 2008"," A decent 90 minute diversion
","Before seeing this movie I'd read a few scathing reviews. So, I went into this movie expecting the worst. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is fair, with several hysterical laugh out loud moments.<br/><br/>I do believe that there are too many emotional threads which may have lead to the generation of so many poor reviews. There are times where the movie struggles to have heart, but fails. Other instances the movie wants to have high action, which is decent. And further times where the film goes straight to potty humor, which is raunchy and pretty good. Some of the characters could have been given more depth. For example, Jessica Alba's character is fairly weak, as is Myer's side kick/assistant. Although entertaining, Myers' character is not very engaging or admirable. The main character's self realization is undercut by the lack of high quality writing coupled with the lack of character depth.<br/><br/>There are some pluses however. Justin Timberlake's character is great. Way over the top! There is some good physical comedy, and the elephant scene is hysterical. The interaction of Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan is excellent (reminded me of the sports commentators from Bedazzled-2000.) I like the fact that they used real NHL teams and such, Rob Blake appeared for his team, and that action looked fairly authentic. I was also surprised that Deepak Chopra himself appeared in the film.<br/><br/>It would seem that the script was one draft shy of finding success. However, having to satisfy the studio, NHL, and Deepak Chopra may have led to the weakness of the script. If you come to this movie with low expectations you will probably enjoy it. However, if you are coming to this movie expecting the next great film from Myers, you will no doubt be sorely disappointed. Take it for what it is worth, a 90 minute diversion from real life, brain candy, and all in fun."

","Really what were we expecting. I'm disappointed that so many people found this worthy of 1/10.

Come on guys....OK it's toilet humour....what did you expect. I certainly found this a lot funnier than Drillbit Taylor and most of the Jack Black latest releases. I don't think that his character is as strong as others he has created, but I think Justin Timberlake played an excellent part, I liked Jessica Alba and the two commentators were brilliant.

"screett","1","4","9","13 July 2008"," What a Waste
","What happened to Mike Myers????? This movie is just plain awful. I'm so glad I didn't pay to see it. Maybe Mike Myers needs to get out of the acting business. The dialog was awful, the acting was worse. I'm sorry I wasted 20 minutes of my life watching the beginning of it. What has happened to Hollywood? Movies are $10 now and the movies are just not quality movies anymore. I think Mike Myers should refund the money to people who DID pay to see this untalented piece of garbage. Don't see this movie! I saw this movie with a large group of people--and we all walked out of it. Those that paid to see it, demanded their money back. The manager was nice enough to refund some but not all."
"pmdawn","5","4","9","11 July 2008"," Myers does it again
","I remember when the first Austin Powers movie came out. I was a teenager back then and I just thought the movie was brilliant. I have rewatched it many times. To this day, me and my friends have inside jokes, like Dr Evil's ticks, much like today's kids have Borat. And hey, he was also in the Wayne's World movies and was funny in SNL. He couldn't do any wrong.<br/><br/>However, the sequel was a huge hit and Myers seems to have taken the wrong lesson from that movie's success. The things that made the first Austin Powers movie funny were NOT the fart jokes, they never were. The third movie was a complete disgrace, with Myers trying to imitate Eddie Murphy's bad habit of impersonating many characters and upping the ante with bad taste jokes. Perhaps more alarming was the distinct impression that he was the only one laughing at his jokes, to the point when it just got embarrassing.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that I'm someone who even likes Rob Schneider's comedies (except for The Animal) and virtually every parody movie I can get my hands on - including the equally-hated Meet The Spartans. I have high tolerance towards silly and stupid comedies.<br/><br/>Well, here Myers does it again. Guru ""Pitka"", his character, is a well-meaning but incompetent spiritual guru who wants to be more famous than Deepak Chopra. The problem is that his incompetence includes his joke-telling skills. You know it. When Myers tells a joke, then there's an uncomfortable moment, and then he explodes into laughter forcing the other person to laugh along so as not to make things even more uncomfortable. It's really telling and ironic that Myers himself did that exact thing as Dr. Evil, but back then it was funny. Now it's not.<br/><br/>Verne Troyer is here but now he's the head coach (!) of The Toronto Maple Leafs. All the main actors are okay, since the plot doesn't demand too much from them, and there are more than a few cameo appearances. However, there were two unexpected surprises: John Oliver of The Daily Show fame as the Guru's ""agent"" and the now legendary Stephen Colbert - he's hilarious in every scene he's in.<br/><br/>Myers sometimes uses clever inside jokes - some that hockey fans or Canadians will get, some that ""Wayne's World"" fans will get, and some that are so lame that nobody really gets.<br/><br/>To be fair though, this doesn't deserve the abysmal rating it's getting. There are a few laughs and the sheer absurdity of some scenes is hilarious. Unfortunately, though, the bulk of The Love Guru's jokes really concerns farts and uncomfortable moments.<br/><br/>As a comedy on a lazy day, I give it a 5/10. However I cannot really defend The Love Guru because I think it's time for Myers to stop doing movies like this and be funny again without resorting to lame plots and fart jokes. We've had enough of that."
"KINGJO4606-1","8","3","6","10 December 2014"," Has re-watch-ability value despite not liking it the first time
","I saw this movie the first time when I was still a senior in high school. The two male members of the household and I watched this movie because we expected Mike Myers to deliver. I will admit that I was disappointed when I watched this movie for the first time; in fact, it was my sibling who had enthusiastically wanted to watch this movie more than I did.<br/><br/>However, I am a person who gets bored with contemporary culture easily. I do not like modern movies and TV shows that much; I also lost my interest in video games. So I decided to buy this movie because it only sold for $3. To my surprise, I liked this movie a lot upon my second viewing. It made a lot of good philosophical and self-help points that especially seem relevant to the problems that a lot of young people my age tend to face. Despite the fact that the movie featured tasteless humor, I nevertheless did find it funny. The second time I watched it, I had not been grossed out as much because I was obviously more mature. I also like the music and the hockey in the film.<br/><br/>I have the suspicion that many do not like this movie due to the fact that it features dated humor. However, I find Mike Myers' 'dated' humor to be funnier than movies out now such as Horrible Bosses, Pineapple Express and the Hangover Part III. Even though Mike Myers may be making enough money from the Shrek sequels to opt out on acting, writing and directing for now, I still do miss his comedy and would like to see more of it. I, for instance, would like to see him star in a movie with Jim Carrey eventually; maybe they can do something like the Odd Couple.<br/><br/>I will conclude my review by stating how surprised I am that this movie received such low reviews. I, for instance, find this movie to be better than the original SpongeBob Squarepants' movie. I can obviously see how this movie received poor reviews from critics. I am also not surprised by the negative reception the movie got from the general populace, but I am surprised by comments that the movie is bad enough to have killed Mike Myers' career. Even if the movie does feature tasteless humor, I do not think anyone can deny that it manifests glimmers of Mike Myers' former brilliance. Finis.<br/><br/>8/10"

I especially like the 'Mariska Hargitay' joke, which is absolutely hilarious if you're a Law and Order fan like myself. There are a few very over the top films, but criticizing Mike Myers for being eccentric is like criticizing Quentin Tarantino for being overly dramatic.

","This is silly comedy at its' best. I thought it was hysterical. I am from Toronto so i was immediately drawn to this film just based on the fact that it's about the Toronto Maple Leafs and their quest for the cup. It's the story about Guru Pitka who is tired of being the second best Guru next to Deepak Chopra. He finds out that if he helps a player on the Leafs get back together with his wife, who is dating a rival NHL player, he will get on the show. Lots of very funny silly humour ensues. I love the tribute to the Leafs big run in 1993, by having the team they face be the LA Kings. Only real complaint about the hockey scenes was that Rob Blake took the face off in the final scene. He is a defencemen and am surprised they did that. Also loved how they used Hockey Night in Canada in the film. Would have loved it if Ron Maclean and Don Cherry were in it but oh well. Great film"

Just a silly movie! It's the kind of movie that you shouldn't watch if you're expecting something great, or if you're too much of a serious person.<br/><br/>It's great as just a light movie, if you just feel like watching something that's not serious at all, with a few laughs; but overall, when you ignore the lame jokes, there's that nice storyline: reuniting loved ones, making new friends, and learning how to be a better person and standing up for yourself etc.<br/><br/>I gave this movie an 8/10 because I loved laughing at the lame jokes and not having to think about dramatic stuff (Don't go thinking I can't love the serious movies, because I definitely can, but I don't write the silly movies off either). The whole Indian theme in the movie made it unique and funny as well - like it was trying to be some bollywood film. I loved the actors...

I am a fan of the Austin Powers series (except for the goldmember)and this to me was pretty much like an Austin Powers 4 (similar jokes and gags). Funnier than the third, not as good as the second.<br/><br/>The whole premise of this movie was retarded to begin with (not going to go too much into the plot). It started out kind of awkwardly and a lot of the scene transitions did not flow smoothly. Most of the movie was based on physical comedy with a couple of humorous jokes. There was a lot of toilet humor and penis jokes as well. I laughed maybe 5-6 times throughout the whole movie. The whole acronym thing gets old very fast. The theater did laugh more than I did but I think it was just to be polite to Mike Meyers/Justin Timberlake and the writers/producers/director of the film who were in the audience.<br/><br/>The one thing I very much enjoyed about this movie was the ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS Jessica Alba. She looked EXTREMELY hot in this movie, hotter than anything she has ever been in. I was just mesmerized watching her, especially when she was wearing the Indian saris (dresses) and doing the dances. Oh my. Cash Warren has to be the luckiest man in the world.<br/><br/>5/10"

","This movie is getting a severely bad wrap from people who just like to pile on and go with the masses. One if you don't like dick and fart jokes why did you pay 8 dollars to go see this movie. No wonder your angry and writing bad reviews. Boohoo you lost 8 bucks cause your to lazy to read a review. The humor in the movie is cheeky and sophomoric but that is part of what makes the movie so fun. This is a perfect relax movie, sit back and watch bad jokes and a contrived story. If you are going into this movie looking for smart humor from movies like clerks or the Austin powers series you wont find it. You will see some funny jokes, and some not, some good songs sung poorly with over the top dancing ala Austin Powers. If you aim low you will likely give this movie a 7 or above but if you are expecting another super bad Austin powers or even Napoleon dynamite you will likely give this a 3 or worse."

","Well, this movie is not soooo bad, as the most devastating critics said. It's a comedy OK. Not worse than zohan or yes man. You know, you have to watch this movie on a 3d degree level. I am sure that the subject, treating disrespectfully hinduism tru their gurus, can create a tsunami in these so called good consciences of stincky followers. But let me tell you that's good. You never heard a real guru. What myers do is just 0.5 percent of the fun or angriness ofa real guru. So don't be offended or laughing too much. I can feel this movie was calibrated, and they could have done much much more.. No guru should ever consider himself as important or useful. Yes, that seems contradictory to his so called job. But what is his job? Egoness, illusion and teaching of reality. We are here in a critic of famous TV gurus. Our Guru in the movie is so infatuated, he loves to receive attention, he loves to help others (what more egoistic than that) and he wants to be guru number one on oprah show. Then a woman and a coach contact him to help one of their player gain confidence. And he will...I found this movie touching, funny, non serious. And scratching the As s of these so called gurus who take advantage of people and their money, building vast usless ashrams or castles. There is rhythm in the movie and good ending. I left with a smile and wrote a letter to my parents telling them I love them. If it's not a proof. Well I know nobody will never read this review and the movie is out for a long time now. But I do what I want, the rest is not your D business."

"ttfreckleton","5","3","7","18 July 2008"," The Love Guru  An Alright Bad Film
","The Love Guru, directed by Marco Schnabel and co-written by and starring Mike Myers, is really just a bad movie that is good. I suppose that's like saying that a common cold is the best illness to have or that Scary Spice is the best Spice Girl because at the end of the day it's still a bad experience and something to forget.<br/><br/>Despite all the bad, make that very bad or even extremely bad, reviews for The Love Guru it's not as horrible as some people might think. For example, it's definitely better than Batman and Robin, Daddy Day Camp and Epic Movie (perhaps all put together) but worse than Semi-Pro, Jumper and You Don't Mess with the Zohan. And it is definitely worse than Austin Powers and Wayne's World by a long shot. The film does ask you the question throughout: should I be laughing with or at the jokes. The film certainly doesn't take itself seriously although at times some characters become thoughtful and for lack of a better word open up. Sometimes you don't know what you're doing, mainly what you're doing in the theater, but in the end you realize that it could be worse, much worse.<br/><br/>The plot centers around an American-Indian guru named Pitka (Mike Myers), the author of many self-help books and seminars, who dreams of making it big in America primarily through appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He gets his chance when the Toronto Maple Leafs ice hockey team owner Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) and the team's coach (Verne Troyer) seek Pitka's help in curing the team's star love-sick player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco). Roanoke's wife Prudence (Meagan Good) has recently left him for LA Kings goalkeeper Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake) who's ""talents"" are not limited to the ice rink. Pitka, aided by his Indian colleague Rajneesh (Manu Narayan), sees this as his one chance to hit the big time and appear on Oprah and ultimately emulate his idol Deepak Chopra.<br/><br/>Although on paper the plot seems quite involved and thought-out it's really just another failure in a long list. It's almost as if the film is merely a side project for all involved, something they shot on weekends, and that they have bigger and better things to do. Or is it that they are simply untalent and incapable in the first place. Verne Troyer is no Warwick Davis or Peter Dinklage and his role seems almost distasteful and offensive to his size. Jessica Alba again proves that although she might be a pretty face she cannot even delivery the most simplest of expression or emotion. The Love Guru adds yet another in a line of poor performances from her and sits soundly next to the likes of Fantastic Four, Good Luck Chuck, Honey and The Eye. It seems her only one good role to date was in Sin City, mainly because that film was directed by a credible and talented director in Robert Rodriquez. It really shows that good performances are usually in half due to the director guiding them. That's probably one of the reasons this film falls flat. Marco Schnabel has never directed a feature length movie and after this you'll wish he'd go back to school. After seeing The Love Guru you could say that one of the reasons Austin Powers was so good was because of its director Jay Roach, as it definitely takes more than a funny script to make a funny film. Some reviews have suggested that Justin Timberlake saves this film but my opinion is the opposite  he makes it worse. His comedic timing is terrible as is his accent. His Celine Dion-loving character is meant to be from Quebec (French-Canadian) but I'm not quite sure what he was trying to pull off  it was like a bad Borat impersonation that only your friends laugh at. That you can only asked yourself why one Sir Ben Kingsley, Knight of the Realm and more importantly Leading Actor Academy Award-winner is doing in this. I can only presume that perhaps he just felt like having a bit of fun. Also to mention, Rajneesh becomes incredibly annoying as Pitka's side-kick to such an extent that you feel like praying to the Devil himself that he be strike down. The supporting cast is quite good, mainly because they simply haven't got the screen time to affect them. These include Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan, John Oliver, and Romany Malco does a better than expected job making him one of the few unhurt from the cast.<br/><br/>In all the blame has to go to Mike Myers. He clearly a victim of his own success from the likes of Austin Powers and even Shrek as he probably believes that anything he touches will turn to box office and critical gold. The genitalia jokes in this film are endless so much so that it was almost like Myers' was dared by a friend to make a comedy made up entirely of crotch orientated gags. I knew from nearly every review I had read prior to seeing this film that it was full of them but never knew the extent until viewing it for myself. I found one part as a perfect example, although quite early on in the movie it sums up the entire 90mins. When John Oliver's character walks into the room to meet Pitka, Rajneesh announces that Richard Pants as arrived to which Pitka responds ""Ah yes, Dick Pants"". Myers' constant references to his home country and his favorite hockey team (which leads him to appearing as himself) tend to get over-cooked as well.<br/><br/>In all there are almost endless new release films to choose from, both at the cinemas and on DVD, so The Love Guru should really be at the bottom of many people's list. This film will leave some disappointed and some really, maybe even extremely, disappointed. But note the key word that remains there: disappointed."

When I see that people slam this movie I think that they just aren't into the stupid comedy type of movie, which is what this is.. a stupid comedy.

"curtis-8","3","4","11","3 July 2008"," Even Meyers doesn't get the Joke
","Apparently even Mike Meyers didn't understand the fluky success of the Austin Powers movies. This is because he has now tried to impose the kind of crude, hoary and often outright juvenile and bad jokes that worked in those films onto a new character. What Meyer's doesn't seem to understand is that what made the Powers movies as enjoyable as they were was that the fact the jokes the Austin Powers character spouted were dumb and in bad taste was much more funny that the actual jokes themselves. In other words, we were all laughing at how incredibly and sublimely stupid most of the jokes were, not at the jokes themselves. Powers was a clueless character who was stupid and emotional arrested enough to think that what he was saying and doing was clever and funnyhe was funny because he was so pathetic yet so joyful about it. Powers was the perfect character for the type of humor Myers used in those films. But the formula just doesn't translate to The Love Guru. Without the proper context, the dick and feces jokes seem imposed on the story instead of being part of the whole concept. Meyers seems to have forgotten that we were very definitely laughing AT Austin Powers, yet he seems to want us to laugh WITH the guru Pitka."
"nanook-19","8","4","11","30 June 2008"," The Love Guru
","I enjoyed the film. But then I enjoy the type of juvenile humor that is Mike Myers.

But overall it was fun, the midget managers office complete with midget furniture, the fake heart attack followed by defibrillator application scene, the killer guard cock, all good.<br/><br/>Conservative types or people who just won't allow themselves to enjoy the moment probably won't like it.

And, while I'll admit it does have it's flaws, I still really like it. And, based on the other reviews, I think I'm the only one who does. I'll start this review off by stating the bad things, and then I'll talk about the good things.<br/><br/>Guru Pitka singing 9 to 5 seemed pretty unnecessary, as was his rendition of Space Cowboy. I mean, I get that Pitka's first name is Maurice, but still. Not needed. Some of the jokes were a little immature, too. Half of the penis jokes, short jokes, ""I'm making diarrhea sounds with my cup"", and stuff like that. Some of the short jokes were funny, but I'll get to that later...Okay, it's later. On to the good things.<br/><br/>Stephen Colbert and that other guy who's name escapes me were the highlight of the film. They have the funniest scenes. Justin Timberlake was hilarious as his character, as well. Jessica Alba looked very pretty, like usual and John Oliver was great, too. And, even the most avid of Love Guru haters have to admit that the More Than Words sequence, while generally unneeded, was really pleasant to listen to. Whoever played Raj has a really good voice. Mike Myers also has some really funny scenes, as well. The Pitka vs Rooster scene was one of the funniest, to me.<br/><br/>This isn't Myers' best movie by any means, but it isn't his worst either. 7/10"

","I only recently discovered the Austin Powers movies, but I personally loved them. As such, I won't be the first to tell you that Mike Myers is a talented actor, director, and writer, and that he CAN have charisma on-screen.<br/><br/>I saw this movie as one of the ""Similar to"" movies that came up when you searched for Austin Powers, and I thought that it looked like classic Mike Myers antics. After watching this movie, I felt that it didn't live up to the expectations I had.<br/><br/>All throughout the movie, I felt like I was watching a movie that wanted to be like Austin Powers, but couldn't conjure up the comedic genius or the iconic protagonist. The Guru is annoying, cocky, crude (and not in the funny way), and overall forgettable. His backstory isn't interesting, the plot isn't intriguing, and the comedy just doesn't fill in the gaps. There's jokes that are funny, sure, but occasional jokes that make me blow air through my nostrils aren't enough to hold this movie up, especially when it's a comedy.<br/><br/>The acting feels particularly terrible as well. The Guru switches between having an Indian accent and a slightly-British accent? Everyone fawns over the Guru, but nothing feels genuine. Verne Troyer isn't even good, either.<br/><br/>This movie is supposed to be a parody, and parodies are fun! That's the reason I and everyone else love the Austin Powers series. But this feels like it's trying too hard to find things to parody. Comedy cannot be forced, but this movie really wants to try and shove it down your throat. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, you don't. All I can say is that if you wanted the same charm as Austin Powers, you'll be disappointed."

Jessica Alba and Megan Good kind of saved the movie and the acting. I think their were just way to many crude and mean scenes. They made fun of midgets in this movie and cross eyed people a lot. Their was a ton of sexual and crude humor. Everything thing that came out of Mike Myers mouth in this was either a phrase or something perverted. I guess he did deliver a few laughs here and there. For the most part though to stupid and dumb to be a good movie. It wasn't a horrible movie but not good either. It was overall just above average. Definitely not a movie I recommend to kids to go see. A lot more movies are getting more sexual and still getting pg-13 ratings. I think it was an original story and okay. For everything else though unoriginal and not to funny. The beginning started off slow and you find yourself waiting to see the outcome and it takes a while but it does.

The more you see it, the more you will realize what advice he is giving to humanity... (I don't want to write spoilers so please see it yourself - instead of concentrating on jokes try to concentrate on what is he actually saying in his gags) I was really astonished to see that this movie is so low rated, in my opinion it is unbelievably underrated.

Oh, hahaha! Oh, and who can forget the musical numbers. Did I mention that they were choreographed? Mike Myers has lost the charm he exhibited in the Austin Powers franchise. And it's clear that he picked an inexperienced director for this so he could control the shoot. And why does Jessica Alba keep doing crappy movies like this and ""Good Luck, Chuck""? Did someone tell her she was a comedienne? And Justin Timberlake -- well, no wonder he wears a wig and moustache throughout. Ironically, though the material is definitely for teen-aged boys, they probably won't go to see it because of the title. It'll maybe have one weekend, then go flaccid.

Or like a friend of mine who has a built in stereotype of comedies of this kind, anything with stupid or gross-out humor makes him forget about all other times the movie was funny. I'm not saying this, or movies of this kind are great by no means, but horrible and unwatchable they are not, and not deserving of a low ratting just for it's lower moments of comedy. OK, personnel venting out of the way, this is far from a great film. Funny at times but not enough, Jessica Alba's movie choices continue to make me wonder and after Justin Timberlake's fantastic work in both Alpha Dog and Black Snake Moan, this is a huge step back for him. Hell the fact that I just said Justin Timberlake and fantastic in the same sentence should be reason enough to keep him away from The Love Guru. Not that his character in this could have been way better, because it could have, I'm not sure if that's bad writing or bad directing. Honestly though, should anyone be even commenting on directing in a film like this, it's just one sketch scene after another with a little story to keep things moving.

","The Love Guru is a dreadful movie with a bunch of painfully unfunny jokes,and I'm pretty sure I didn't laugh once while watching this movie.U really like Mike Myers,I love Wayne's World,Austin Powers and Shrek and he's the only reason why I watched this movie,but he was the worst part of this movie.His character Guru Pitka was extremely annoying and possibly the most unlikeable character I've ever seen in any movie,and the scene where we see Young Pitka (a young boy with Mike Myers forty year old face edited on) is just disturbing.The entire movie is a big insult to comedy and I would recommend it to absolutely nobody.<br/><br/>The Guru Pitka (Mike Myers) heads back to America in order to help a hockey player with his love life in order to do well in the final game."
"anna-101-422772","4","2","5","11 July 2011"," what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth?
","Even if you can put aside the annoyingness of the Guru Pitka, the movie still fails to deliver anything remotely funny. The most common joke is to have a characters name resemble something vulgar, such as ""Dick Pants"" or some other Grade 3 level joke. The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of ""TM"" after one of his catchphrases. It wasn't funny the first time, what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth? There's also the repetition of jokes from Austin Powers, ranging from the plane to even the casting of Verne Troyer, the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the Powers films as Mini-Me. Finally, there are the gags that are just plain lame. These involve elephants humping each other, the Guru wearing a chastity belt, the Guru having a battle using mops soaked in urine, the Guru sticking his head up his own ass (which is actually far less funny than it sounds), the Guru getting punched in the groin, the Guru doing battle with a rooster and the Guru engaging in two very long song and dance numbers on the Sitar, one a rendition of Dolly Parton's ""9 to 5"", the other a ear-splitting variation on ""Space Cowboy"" by Steve Miller Band. Both are in there for no particular reason whatsoever (and I really do hope it wasn't for laughs).<br/><br/>The other actors are fairly bad, although they really don't have much to work with. Jessica Alba continues her tradition of playing practically the same exact character, giggling and acting ditsy. Justin Timberlake is atrocious as Jacque Grande, although to be fair, his character was a one-note joke about Quebecois people. I'm bemused that Meyers would think Americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny, especially when I didn't find it funny and I'm a Canadian. Verne Troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that he's a midget."
"Sandcooler","2","2","5","11 June 2011"," Painfully boring watered-down ""Austin Powers""
","Some comedians can build up an entire career by doing the same thing over and over again, but Mike Myers sure seems keen on proving that he isn't one of them. In my opinion his schtick already started getting kinda old about halfway through the second ""Austin Powers""-movie, maybe ""The Love Guru"" never really had a fighting chance to begin with. Guru Pitka may be a new character (actually even that's negotiable), but don't let that fool you: this is basically just a fourth ""Austin Powers""-movie. The jokes all seem like rejected material from previous efforts, and the obligatory sexual innuendo is somehow even more tiresome than the one in ""Goldmember"". To compensate for the fact that none of the jokes work, Myers had a rock-solid solution though: just have Jessica Alba's character crack up at everything. Seriously, I can't even remember any of her lines, just constant unconvincing laughter at absolutely nothing. The most painful role is for Ben Kingsley though, this movie makes you long for the days when he played bit parts in Uwe Boll movies. Even Jim Gaffigan is unfunny in this movie, how is that even done? This thing flopped for good reason. Now where did I put my ""Wayne's World""-DVD?"
"Floated2","2","2","5","29 September 2010"," Mike Myers hits a new low!
","The Love Guru is another stupid comedy written from Mike Myers. Although billed as a comedy, The Love Guru is more like a snuff movie as we watch Mike Myers, of Austin Powers fame, slowly but emphatically kill his career during 80 laugh-free minutes. This film is filled with so many braindead jokes it just becomes very tiresome and annoying. Not to mention a lot of sexual and penis jokes, and many continuity jokes such as spelling words into acronyms, Guru adding ""TM"" at the end of an acronym, annoying NHL commentators, etc.<br/><br/>The Love Guru plot is basically about Guru Pikta (Myers) whom wants to surpass Deepak Chopra in celebrity, so he takes an offer from the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba) to get star player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) back with his girl (Meagan Good), who has been swept away by rival Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande (Justin Timberlake) of the Los Angeles Kings. That seems pretty stupid and unrealistic even for a comedy.<br/><br/>One thing that was okay was Mike Myers performances. It seemed tat he tried and it was pretty entertaining. Though the supporting cast was pretty boring and dull. In general the Love Guru insultingly stupid, filled with embarrassingly bad jokes. The occasional guest star appearances is amusing, but the movie is just dreadful and badly written."

","THE LOVE GURU: another excuse for Mike Myers to act unutterably stupid - and get paid for it.<br/><br/>As the Guru Pitka, the usually brilliant Myers is in mediocre form, playing an Indian guru who is hired by Jane (talentless Jessica Alba) to help a recently-separated hockey player, Darren (Romany Malco, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN), find ""balance"" (i.e. get his game back on) after his wife leaves him for star player, Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande (Justin Timberlake).<br/><br/>Though Myers flounders with that wavering Indian accent and jokes that require him to laugh at them himself, and though Alba is still getting by on the smoothness of her ta-tas rather than acting ability, everyone else is in fine form, especially - surprisingly - Justin Timberlake.<br/><br/>He's fey, French, and fantastique in this broad comedic role that suits his style more than the unmanageable drama of BLACK SNAKE MOAN. His six-pack tatt speaks for him: The Man, The Legend; one arrow points up, one points down.<br/><br/>Nice to see Verne Troyer (you know, Mini-Me) in an actual speaking role - an asshole, no less - as the domineering, loudmouth hockey coach.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley reprises his Gandhi, albeit Gandhi for Imbeciles and, of course, nails that Indian accent.<br/><br/>Balance is almost restored - until everyone discovers Guru Pitka took a shortcut in ""curing"" Darren. And we kinda laugh at him laughing at his own jokes all the way to the Bollywood ending.<br/><br/>The one real laugh is when Pitka is surfing radio stations and - in a nod to WAYNE'S WORLD - flips past Bohemian Rhapsody and does a camera-take.<br/><br/>In the words of Freddie: ""Ooooh bay-beh / Can't do this to me, bay-beh / Just gotta get out / Just gotta get right out of here.""<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","Not bad, but also not good. I got really excited seeing this movie, we all have been waiting for years for another Austin Powers adventure to come so this one had to be a good substitute. Mike Myers plays on auto-pilot in this one, he himself is certainly funny (so I seem to think so) but the script is not really exciting with not many jokes or fun. Myers does the typical Austin Powers thing once again but the chemistry between him and Jessica Alba is not there. Alba is casted only for her good looks, her character is not very believable. The same goes for the rest of the cast. And Sir Ben Kingsley, I didn't think his role was very funny, except for his crossed eyes, but that's it. <br/><br/>Mike Myers was 'excellent' in Wayne's World 1-2, and Austin Powers 1-3, even in A View From The Top. Not a total loss, certainly worth checking out if you love those movies, but Love Guru 2 should never be made. Bring on another Austin Powers please..."
"neil-476","5","2","5","5 August 2008"," Myers can do better
","The Love Guru - or - Mike Myers turns Austin Powers into a cod Indian.<br/><br/>How can I describe this movie? There are several defining elements. One is Myers' constant shameless mugging to the camera - the fourth wall is so much rubble, and Myers' winsome coyness becomes - what's the expression? - damn irritating. Another is the fact that, not to put too fine a point on it, the movie is an endless succession of kn*b gags, with a couple of poo gags, a diarrhoea gag and, oh yes, an elephants sh*gging gag sprinkled among them. The third is that Jessica Alba wanders around looking, let's face it, a bit lost.<br/><br/>Yet for all that, I smiled a moderate amount and laughed a few times. The Mariska Hargitay gag, though overused, was amusing, and I'm ashamed to say that I laughed out loud at some of the appalling things Verne Troyer allowed himself to be put through, and I was entertained by the mock Bollywood musical numbers.<br/><br/>Certainly not Myers' finest hour - far too much staleness and repetition for that - but not as bad as it's made out to be in some quarters."

Go get laid or find Jesus people! I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good date night movie, or as a movie to enjoy between the guys or girls. I am not endorsing sexual behavior in underage kids, but I do think it is something teenagers would enjoy as a slumber party movie or something.

","Jack Sparrow, Ledger Joker, Guru Pitka<br/><br/>They were serious enough in their goals, but also they never took a path with the same seriousness. It is a very clear message, because Life is Hard. They all like to do tough jokes, even in difficult moments. This may look like foolishness, but maybe these characters realized that work is best done if people can refocus their concerns. If you recall, instead of receiving the best answer to an specific problem, they bring a very funny alternative that can make us free our worries. Was Guru Pitka's morbidity level high? Those were jokes! ""but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose"" as Eminem said."

","This movie I feel gets an unfair amount of hate directed at it. I'm going to start by saying this; is it the greatest comedy movie ever? Is is superior to Myers' Austin Powers franchise? No not by a long shot. Is it funny? Are there some good jokes that make you laugh or even just chuckle at? Yes. OK so Mike Myers plays Guru Maurice Pitka, the titular Love Guru, who is tired of being second best to Deepak Chopra but opportunity arises when he is approached to save the marriage of Toronto Maple Leafs hockey player Darren Roanoke and possibly get one up on Chopra. While helping Darren, Pitka learns the important age- old lesson of being himself instead of trying to be someone else. The film also stars Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Ben Kingsley and Verne Troyer with cameos from various celebrities. I first saw this movie after watching the Austin Powers movies from a mate who said this was another comedy from Mike Myers. He loaned it to me and I really enjoyed it, I thought it was very funny two of my favourite moments come from the meeting in Coach Cherkov's (Verne Troyer) office and when Pitka tells Darren he can fight anyone for any reason then proceeding to muck around with Cherkov. It's only in the past couple years I learnt that it didn't go down well with others. Of course I defend it. As I already stated it's by no means the best comedy movie ever but it's enjoyable nonetheless. The only thing that brings it down for me is the fact kanye west appears in it, granted it's a small cameo but still he's a sight I'm sure no-one wanted to see in the movie. Ideally when watching this movie you'll want to ignore what others have said about it and just not think too much, you'll find some of the jokes offensive granted and think ""wtf!?"" with some moments but the rest you'll smirk, chuckle and even full on laugh at"

The only problem with Meyers films is that he does not do enough of them. We need another Austin Powers movie. The Love Guru was pretty funny... unless you're a Grinch... at least in this movie Mike has good teeth. All what you might expect to see from a Mike Meyers film is there, sexual innuendos, conflict between good and bad...

Absolutely.<br/><br/>It seems like people take movies so seriously these days that they forget how to watch a movie just for the fun of it. Granted, this movie will probably appeal more to men than women, but there's plenty of naughty chuckles for everyone. This movie is an odd, twisted conglomeration of Canadian Hockey and Eastern Mysticism, which is merely a loose framework on which Myers strings joke after joke, gag after gag, often taking the oldest jokes in the book and giving them new meaning and zing.<br/><br/>I have hundreds of movies in my disc collection, and this is one of the very few that I can take out and watch over and over when I need a good laugh. I recommend taking a lazy afternoon to throw on this movie, particularly with a couple of good friends, pop open a beer and sit back for some extremely strange and goofy fun.

I'm a 34 year White male from England who enjoys both 'simple' comedy and more intelligent subtle stuff, if it matters. I've only said this as there is far too much talk of the reasons why people are rating this down but the movie itself is all the evidence you need to see why it's rated low.<br/><br/>Sadly I think the funny content from The Love Guru could have been condensed into a 5 minute SNL sketch and worked just as well (OK, would have worked better).<br/><br/>I felt the beginning was extremely rushed, the set up was poor and lazy. All the characters were lifeless drones and mostly arbitrary, I didn't know why I should care about anyone.<br/><br/>I felt Mike didn't make enough of his character, didn't develop him fully and it was to me a mix of 3 of his previous characters (Fat B******d, Dr Evil and Austin Powers) in one but not as funny or as strong as any of them, certainly not when it's just a single character trying to carry an entire film.<br/><br/>It was just weak all round, packed with overused/under-funny puns. There were one or two moments that were genuinely funny or amusing, but by about half way through I just gave up caring and found myself just not laughing anymore.<br/><br/>It didn't feel like a Mike Myers movie, it felt like someone had written/directed a movie that they THOUGHT captured the humour of Austin Powers but missed the mark badly. It was a 'by the numbers' attempt at the winning Austin Powers humour that just doesn't work with this set of characters and this plot. A very very thin plot I may add, even for a Mike Myers comedy.<br/><br/>On top of that you have the main cast who in my opinion were all miscast except for the main 'hockey player' character who was believable and did a decent job. Perhaps part of the problem though was that Mike Myers should have been playing these central characters himself to fully develop the humour in the film, then again maybe that's just wishful thinking given the terrible pacing and careless direction of the film.<br/><br/>I couldn't get a handle on just 'who' Guru Pitka 'was'. He was a mix of all MM's characters but none unique to the new character. It was just very hard to feel anything for GP as his persona seemed to change from scene to scene in the most haphazard/distracting way. A lack of consistency basically.<br/><br/>You could never accuse Dr Evil of fluctuating in character throughout a film to the point you give up believing in him or stop caring about his 'funny lines'. Essentially the main character of the Love Guru just isn't strong or compelling enough, maybe he'd be OK as a small character on an Austin Powers movie but he was dreadful as the lead (and only) Mike Myers character on an entire film.<br/><br/>Let's just hope they don't make 2 sequels to this terrible waste of talent and potential and with any luck they MAY realise just how special the Austin Powers films were and make some more of those instead of worrying about having to change for the sake of it. Change is good but only if you do better than before, Every single one of the Mike Myers characters that has appeared in an Austin Powers movie could have made a better lead character for a film or spin off than this totally unconvincing 'love guru'.<br/><br/>3/10 from me and that's only because of MM of whom I'm a big fan and appreciate for all of his previous, very very funny films."

He moves back to the U.S. to seek fame and fortune in the world of self-help and spirituality. His unorthodox methods are put to the test when he must settle a rift between Toronto Maple Leafs star hockey player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) and his estranged wife.<br/><br/>After the split, Roanoke's wife starts dating L.A.

"tomok97","5","2","9","2 July 2008"," Yuck
","Well, um.it's not as bad as it looks. But let's face it, it looks awful.<br/><br/>Myers portrays Guru Pitka, an American-born/Indian-raised new-age spiritualist. He strives to be the next Deepak Chopra. Chopra is his childhood friend and both Chopra and Pitka study under the same guru. In an early scene, Myers plays Pitka as a 12-year old in what has to be the creepiest usage of CGI since John Wayne was posthumously forced to shill for Coors. (But it could have been worseit could have been Coors Light.) Pitka is hired by the Toronto Maple Leafs' owner Jane Bullard (played by Jessica Alba) to help their lovelorn star player Darren Roanoke (played by Romany Malco) get his game face back so they can win the Stanley Cup. The rest of the movie exists primarily for Myers to riff on New Age platitudes and make dirty jokes.<br/><br/>Myers take on the Eastern-based philosophy is an interesting conundrum. He seems to simultaneously be making fun of it AND have a fondness/belief in it. The movie is a tad schizophrenic in this regard. It can be hard to tell whether Myers thinks this is all rubbish or if he has a deep abiding belief in material of this sort. Seeing as how the real Deepak Chopra makes a cameo in the film, I tend to think it's the latter. But if that's the case, the jokes undermining the philosophy seem out of place. And some of the jokes are actually quite biting. For instance, there is a running gag where Pitka has ""profound"" statements that spell out acronyms, all of which are quickly followed by a ""TM"" trademark. Surely Jesus, Allah and/or Buddah never trademarked their beliefs to ensure they profited from the spread of their message. So the implication in the joke is that Pitka (and his ilk) is/are hucksters. But that is certainly not the overriding message of the film. While his character is seeking the fame of an Oprah appearance, with the exception of a brief lapse of judgment in the third act, he seems to have a very real concern for the outcome of the people he helps. And even that ""lapse of judgment"" consists of him taking a shortcut when helping someone, not him being malicious or underhanded.<br/><br/>I imagine that this must be what it's like for people to watch ""Night At The Roxbury"" or ""The Ladies Man"" if they had never seen an episode of ""Saturday Night Live"". Mike Myers clearly spent a lot of time and effort developing this character. So much so that the jokes often feel like they are referencing things that we're already supposed to be fond of. And while it isn't the fiasco that the trailers make it look like, the best it can seem to muster is to be mildly amusing. The jokes can get so juvenile that when you do laugh, it's almost in spite of yourself. If it's a guilty pleasure, it's more ""guilty"" than ""pleasure"".<br/><br/>As for the supporting cast, Jessica Alba has virtually nothing to do in this movie except gaze lovingly at Myers. But, unless she's never seen any of his other films, this couldn't have been a shock. And to add insult to injury, Myers character has taken a vow of chastity so she can barely even achieve the level of ""love interest"" status. Romany Malco does a fine job but is essentially the straight man. He's there to set-up Myers and, of course, gaze lovingly at himin a ""manly"" way of course. Verne Troyer, of Mini-Me fame, plays the Maple Leafs' coach. And, while I'm sure he's happy to have the work, he seems to exist solely for Myers/Pitka to make ""midget"" jokes. Of course, that's got to be better than another a season of the ""Surreal Life""but not by much. On the upside, at no point in the film does Troyer have to gaze lovingly at Myers.<br/><br/>If there's anything movies like ""Superbad"" and ""Knocked Up"" have taught us, it's that a movie can be raunchy and still be smart. This movie has much of the desperate ""love me/laugh at me"" feel of later era Jerry Lewis films.<br/><br/>It's never a good sign when the biggest laugh in the film comes during the outtakes that roll during the credits. It's even worse when that outtake doesn't even have your star in the shot. This movie is not bad enough to be horrible but it's not good enough to be great (or even good for that matter).<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being ""Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery"" and 1 being ""Cat In The Hat"", ""The Love Guru"" gets a 5."

","The Love Guru is definitely one of the worst comedies I have ever been unfortunate enough to watch. If you can call it a comedy. I wish Mike Myers would step up and explain why he chose to be in this movie, as he is a funny actor and has proved this in other films. None of the obviously set up lines in this movie are remotely funny, nor are they creative. Most of them are repeats of earlier lines said at the beginning of the film, just worded differently. The acting is mediocre at best, although it is most likely worsened by the horrible script. I also believe that the plot was set up for the wrong reasons. Although Mike Myers was born in Toronto, the movie focuses much too obviously on Canada, and it seems to attempt to get a good feeling of pride out of the viewer, be it the Toronto Maple Leafs being the focus of the movie or Jessica Alba's lines displaying her pride of being Canadian. Instead it just made the movie seem even more pretentious. Overall The Love Guru was a terrible film that I wish could return the wasted time I spent watching it."

","I both love and hate this movie. My perspective may be atypical because I don't watch television, follow hockey or read People magazine. I had never heard of Deepak Chopra or Mariska Hargitay before seeing the film and wouldn't recognize Oprah Winfrey if I were seated across from her. Mike Myers's Guru Pitka character is not likable or sympathetic and the romantic angle is not credible in the least, although Jessica Alba seems entirely sincere. Many of the jokes are insipid, some of the homoerotic humor is cringeworthy and a few jokes are pushed too far. But the film offers an abundance of humor at various levels. Ten minutes of this film offers more gags than many comedies offer in their entire length. I especially enjoyed the pop tunes played out of context, the music/dance numbers, the parody of Bollywood films, Ben Kingsley, the sportscasters, Verne Troyer's office, the animal travel cages and the notion of Canadian hockey team dependent on a black superstar. Other parts were extremely stupid, such as the cotton candy, Judi Dench and yoga bits. But there are more than enough gags that hit the mark or reasonably close to overlook the enthusiastic and energetic efforts that fell flat."

","I have waited 6 years to watch this movie last night because EVERYONE said it was so terrible. And they were right, it is a complete mess and easy to see how the combination of this movie and Cat in the Hat ended his career. Myers loves to try and force musical numbers into his movies and even those make no sense here. To open he plays 9 to 5 on a sitar, HOW do you chose that song? It makes absolutely no sense, not ONE person in the entire movie has a regular job. Is that supposed to be ironic? Whatever, like almost everything in the movie, it falls completely flat. Very few laughs in this movie. Probably the funniest thing is remembering how hot Myers was at the time this movie was made, hence being able to get some decent celebrity cameos. If he asked Crewman #2 from an original Star Trek episode to be in his next movie now, he wouldn't even get a call back lol. Probably my favorite joke is using the name ""Mariska Hargitay"" as a greeting like they say in Arabic, then having her actually appear while they are saying it. Gaffigan and Colbert as the hockey announcers had some funny moments, purely on their own comedic abilities. Other than that, the list of failures is long and depressing. Making fun of French Canadians, the guru presentation and lessons, the cameos, little person abuse, Myer's accent and his annoying facial hair, the fight with the ""guard rooster"", and so on. If you love hockey and want to see a Bollywood song and dance number at the end, you might be able to tolerate this movie, but that is a MIGHT."

"MacAindrais","Null","1","5","29 July 2008"," Love and Comedy, I think not.
","The Love Guru (2008) *1/2<br/><br/>I enjoy Mike Myers' work very much. He has been more or less consistently funny throughout his career. Wayne's World and the Austin Powers films are noteworthy comedy classics. He's mastered the fine line between clever stupidity and just outright stupidity - or so you would have thought by now.<br/><br/>The Love Guru is almost devoid of any cleverness. Jokes fall flat, and I sadly rarely laughed. Even sadder, I rarely even grinned. The Love Guru may well be a terrible film, but I didn't hate it by any stretch. I was just supremely disappointed. I had low expectations to begin with, so maybe that is why I didn't hate it.<br/><br/>Myers is the Guru Pitka, in a surprisingly unfunny turn. He's hired by Jane Bullard (Alba), the Toronto Maple Leafs owner, to recoup their star player, Darren Roanoake. His wife has run off with Jaques Le Grande (Timberlake), and he is distraught. Myers and Alba develop a baffling relationship, and he is on a quest to remove his chastity belt. That's about it for the plot.<br/><br/>The jokes are crude, vulgar, and simply not funny most of the time. It's a bad sign when you have your characters laugh more at their jokes than the audience. Chuckles are far and few in between, and mostly come from supporting players. Timberlake has some good moments. His reference to Quebec Pizza had me in stitches, even in the previews. I suspect any other Canadians found this rather amusing, not because the Pizza in Quebec actually comes on poptarts, but because anyone who's ever eaten pizza in Quebec knows that it may as well. Stephen Colbert has a few moments as a commentator as well.<br/><br/>Asides out of the way, the film tries to make some attempts at inside pokes and humor regarding the Leafs history (ie, the Ballard curse), but it spends most of its time making penis jokes, which literally come at least once every 5 minutes.<br/><br/>I'm sure there is an immature and I assume young audience of teenage boys that will get a big kick out of the onslaught of lowbrow. There is nothing wrong with mindless comedy when its consistently funny, but The Love Guru just isn't. And that, I must confess, is sad for Myers et al."
"vip_ebriega","2","1","6","19 February 2010"," Myers has lost his mojo. Or does he call it his 'karma' now?
","My Take: Too much shock humor but not any real laughs; there's very little show of Myers talents here.<br/><br/>Although we all know him by name, we really got to know Mike Myers not from his name but from the name of the characters he plays. In fact, if his name wasn't so prominent in the credits, we would get to know him as the guy who played Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Wayne, as well as the voice of Shrek. Bu recently, the characters he plays are like retreads of his old acts. First there's THE CAT IN THE HAT, which didn't really go so well. And now here's THE LOVE GURU. Well, Myers is still the best thing about THE LOVE GURU, but he can't save it. Not only is his act unoriginal, Myers tries to throw in every single sex joke or gross-out humor and see which one sticks.<br/><br/>Myers plays his most forgettable character yet as Guru Pitka aka Maurice, who plays every single joke in the Mike Myers' book. From the witty word play and the funny accents, there's not much more original in this act that all he does is paint-by-numbers. I give credit, however, to Myers for doing whatever he can with the character and does score maybe a few puns. Now ask yourself how good those puns are compared to those that don't work? Guys hitting each other with mops covered in pee? Ben Kingsley being awful as Maurice's cross-eyed guru? An elephant sex scene? I'm beginning to wonder if I was watching a comedy or a test of endurance. It's as if the movie already wants you to leave by the 15-minute mark, and this movie is supposed to be mercifully short with an 87-minute running time.<br/><br/>Everyone else in the supporting cast is embarrassing; funny thing is they seem to enjoy doing so. Jessica Alba, who seems to like appearing in every bad film her agent gets her into, is your typical love interest. Justin Timberlake gives an awful performance in an awful excuse of a comical character. And the list goes on, with some truly unnecessary cameos by Stephen Colbert, Val Kilmer, Jessica Simpson, and Kanye West. Besides perhaps a few witty word puns and some shtick about a moving remote control pillow (hey, there's got to be one scene I laughed in, but I just can't recall), THE LOVE GURU is quite an unfunny disaster, but I don't want to bring down Myers' spirit. Mike Myers, you're still funny, just stop making these movies.<br/><br/>Rating: * out of 5."

The humor and set up are identical to the Austin movies. Unfortunately that means that most of the jokes are extremely low and juvenile. At best they are just about sex and mildly distasteful. At worst they are almost disgraceful and embarrassing for any above the age of five. It's a shame because Myers can be a good comedian at times, as is evident because a few jokes and puns are actually very good.<br/><br/>Mostly it is a movie that should be forgotten as soon as possible.

"Wizard-8","Null","1","6","27 October 2009"," Strange...
","I always make it a point to watch the movie that was voted as ""Worst movie of the year"" for the Razzie awards, and that's why I watched ""The Love Guru"" despite the horrendous reviews. While I don't think the movie is as bad as some people have portrayed it, I will admit that it isn't very good.<br/><br/>Where did it go wrong? Well, I think the first way is the way the central protagonist is portrayed. I read a review that stated that Meyers, when it came to Austin Powers, made that character likable despite stuff like his sex obsession - unlike the central character here. I have to agree. I won't say that the guru is hateful, but he comes across as a very weird individual with an unbelievable obsession for certain things that don't seem to be tempered by anything positive. At times you want him to be given a slap in the face to shake him out of his giggily mood and make him do something sensible.<br/><br/>Meyers in real life should have also been given a slap at the screenplay stage. It seems no one tried to stop his frequent infantile attempts at humor. Don't get me wrong, there are some attempts at humor that do succeed (the Bollywood parody being the movie's best gag), but other than isolated moments like those, the screenplay bombards the viewers with penis jokes and other ""naughty"" gags that seem to come from a 10 year old boy.<br/><br/>Combining that character and the infantile humor level, the end results are so strange that the movie almost makes it worth seeing to see such a unique kind of cinematic disaster. Note I said ""almost""."
"Electrified_Voltage","4","1","6","12 September 2009"," Not as terrible as I had suspected, but still a lousy, straight-faced excuse for a comedy
","In Mike Myers' career as a comedian, he has had a lot of success, with ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, the two Wayne's World movies, the Austin Powers trilogy, and the voice of the popular computer animated character, Shrek. However, there have also been low points in his career, most notably his starring role in the poor full-length adaptation of Dr. Seuss' ""The Cat in the Hat"", from 2003, and this 2008 flop, ""The Love Guru"". Unlike ""The Cat in the Hat"", Myers not only starred in this film, he was also a writer for it, just like he was with the Wayne's World and Austin Powers movies. Unlike the comedian's previous full-length writing efforts, this one isn't funny. I thought it would be worse, judging by how much criticism it had received, but like most people, I didn't laugh.<br/><br/>Maurice Pitka was born in America but raised in India, in the village of Harenmahkeester. At the age of twelve, he was given a chastity belt by Guru Tugginmypudha, forced to wear it until he found love in himself. He is now a guru, still wearing the belt, and dreaming of being the #1 guru and appearing on the ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"". He is called over to Toronto, Ontario, Canada by widely despised Toronto Maple Leafs owner Jane Bullard, to help Darren Roanoke, one of the hockey team's players. Roanoke has been troubled since his wife, Prudence, left him for French Canadian Los Angeles Kings goalie Jacques Grandé, which has been affecting his performance. Guru Pitka's job is to help the Leafs player with his troubles so he will play hockey as well as he used to. He attempts to get Roanoke back with his wife and get the troubled Leafs player to stand up to his aggressive mother.<br/><br/>Before I watched this comedy flop, I knew it was widely abhorred for its immature potty humour. While the lame gross-out humour isn't as extreme or consistent as I expected, you can be sure it's still there. There's more than one booger joke, plus excretion gags, such as an elephant defecating, the flashback with the ""stink mop"" (a mop soaked in urine) used for fight training, and Guru Pitka making diarrhea noises. In addition to the bathroom jokes, there are also very juvenile sex jokes, including elephant sex on the hockey rink! In addition to the crude physical gags, there are also verbal ones, which also happen to be weak. Many modern comedies show that sex and toilet humour can really be funny, but ""The Love Guru"" is one of many other modern comedies that show this kind of humour can also be really lame. Not only is Myers not funny in this movie, neither is Stephen Colbert as sex-crazed stoner hockey announcer Jay Kell, or anyone else in the cast who may try to be funny. After seeing the film, I'm also convinced that pop sensation Justin Timberlake, who plays Jacques Grandé here, can't act, which doesn't help the fact that I don't respect him as a singer, either.<br/><br/>All the hatred for this movie made me think that maybe Mike Myers had sunk to the level of Tom Green, another comedian from my country, but a much less talented one. Fortunately, it turns out he hasn't, but he's still going to have to come up with something funnier than this if he wants to recover his career. While watching ""The Love Guru"", I didn't laugh at all, and don't think I even smiled, even if there were parts where I came close, whether that was a good thing or not. I guess it takes a lot for a movie to REALLY disgust me, but I think I've made it clear that I'm still not impressed with this particular comedy. I'm not sure if it was worthy of beating ""Meet the Spartans"" and ""Disaster Movie"" at the Razzies (I haven't seen either of those films, but seeing Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer's previous project, ""Epic Movie"", was enough to tell me that the duo just might know the definition of unfunny better than anyone else in the history of comedy), but coming from a comedian who has talent, I'm sure this film has come as a shock to many people! If you love puerile adolescent humour, then maybe this film is for you. If not, then I suggest you skip it."

","When his wife left him for a particularly well-endowed rival, the Maple Leafs star hockey player Darren Roanoke's winning ways turn to rubbish and the team starts to suffer. Young and unpopular owner Jane Bullard turns to a relationship guru for help in fixing the problems that seem to be doing the harm. Guru Pitka takes the job with the aim of becoming the #1 guru in the country and claiming his rightful spot on the Oprah Winfrey Show, however the road to a solution where matters of the heart are involved are never straightforward.<br/><br/>You can sort of see what Myers was doing with his character because in a very, very broad sense there is some comedy to be had from taking the mick out of modern self-help experts with their slogans and trademarks. This is me being generous though because this potential doesn't even come close to being translated into being a good film. The plot of the film is just an excuse for a patchwork quilt of poor ""comedy"" moments and famous faces that are never actually that funny. That is the problem because any comedy can get over plotting issues if the audience is laughing most of the time, but rest assured you will not be here. The script is full of lazy gags, juvenile humour and basic mugging from all involved. A lot of the blame is on Meyers of course and in fairness to debut director Schnabel (who's limited resume on IMDb shows him coming up thanks partly to Meyers) but he was not going to take on ""star"" Meyers and say ""you know what  this just isn't working"".<br/><br/>The truth is though that somebody needs to because Meyers easy mugging is just lazy and unfunny, with a routine that once was fresh is now just lots of face pulling and ""pee-pee"" jokes. He seems totally unaware of this because he includes a musical reference to Wayne's World thinking it will be a funny in-joke as opposed to a sad reminder of when he was funny. What is truly mystifying though is why so many stars are involved. Alba is moving past the ""starlet of today"" stage and needs to get established before the next pretty young thing comes alone  she has done this well recently with award show hosting etc as well as solidly performing films but she REALLY needs to consider what her agent is doing to her  Good Luck Chuck was a job for a starlet and, while I understand from the names involved the Love Guru looked more attractive, reading the script should have been a clue. She tries to be light and funny but the film doesn't deserve her efforts. I can only assume that Timberlake did this because he wanted everyone to see that Southland Tales was not a failure because THIS is what a failure looks like. He tries and throws himself into a ridiculous accent and character that would have been great if it wasn't so silly. Troyer does his usual stuff yet again but far more excruciating is a terrible turn from Sir Kingsley who I can only assume really does need the money that badly or has completely lost any sense of judgement  his performance is pulling an cross-eyed face. End of story. Simpson, Kilmer, West and others line up to show their famous faces but what is more disappointing is to see two very funny and very clever men (Oliver and Colbert) taking part in this, although to his credit Colbert is one of the few slightly funny things in here.<br/><br/>So I'm saying what everyone has already said, but I gave up 90 minutes for this thing so I think I've earned my say! I'm not sure how Meyers can turn it around but certainly having free reign and seemingly thinking that just turning up, pulling faces and kicking a midget in the groin will do it has not helped him. Not sure why nobody told him what a mess this is or why so many people were willing to take part but ultimately what we the audience are left with is an unfunny shambles of a comedy that is silly but never actually funny. I have no issue with silly films but I do when they are unfunny, lazy and frankly an embarrassment for most of those involved."

"TOMNEL","2","1","8","6 July 2008"," Guru Pitka is a less likable version of Austin Powers.
","Of all things about this mess of a movie, the most surprising to me was the character of Guru Pitka. I thought he would be a silly character, but one who cared about others. He was surprisingly more crude and horny than Austin Powers, and the character, and Mike Meyers himself, just couldn't stay away from the wiener jokes. I took a count on how many male genital jokes were in this film, and I came up with 39, which means every 2 minutes there was a genital joke, which shows how far Mike Meyers was stretching for a script.<br/><br/>Guru Pitka (Mike Meyers) is a self help guru who focuses mainly on people's love lives, and gives stupid seminars in which he uses mnemonics for his multi-step programs that usually spell out dirty words. Pitka is living in the shadow of a rival guru Deepak Chopra, and more than anything, Pitka wants to get on Oprah so he can become a more respected guru. He tries to help a hockey player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco), who's marriage is on the rocks, to get publicity. The manager of the team died a few years back and his daughter Jane (Jessica Alba) is running the team now. Pitka both falls for her and wants to help her self esteem. Bad jokes ensue.<br/><br/>There are so many negatives to this film, and very few positives, but there are positives, and this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. In fact, this isn't even the worst of the year. Meet the Spartans was worse, and this was a treat compared to that. But nonetheless, I'll start with the negatives here. The characters are just awful. As I've said, Pitka was very unlikable and acted like an annoying 12 year old. Justin Timberlake was obnoxious as a rival hockey player who was dating Darren's wife. Every joke based around him has to do with the size of his privates...funny, huh!? Verne Troyer aka Mini Me plays the Hockey Coach and he was better when he didn't talk much. Steven Colbert is seen throughout as a hockey announcer, and though he can be funny, he needs the right material to play off of, and this is not it. Ben Kingsley plays my favorite character, who's name is so long I don't want to spell it out. He plays Pitka's mentor is flashbacks back in India, and though he's not funny, Kingsley just has a presence that no one else in this sorry picture could even try to emulate. His character is pretty similar to Mike Meyers in View from the Top, so he's really not bringing much new to the table, unfortunately. We also are treated to some really random cameos, like Jessica Simpson, Kanye West, Mariska Hargitay and the very random Val Kilmer. What an eclectic group they have. The direction is okay, but it doesn't really matter, because it's the writing that does this one in. Mike Meyers wanted to play Austin Powers again I guess, so he created an Indian carnation of him that manages to be a lot less funny, more crude, and dare I say, a character that's even more sex starved.<br/><br/>Onto the positives. There were a few moments where I laughed, and they were generally ones after long sustain periods of boredom, and the scenes caught me by surprise because they were mildly amusing. The acting isn't bad, the characters are, so the acting is a positive. I was mildly entertained at moments throughout, but overall this was just a horribly written mess that relied way too little on brain, and way too much on jokes about the male second brain. I found Pitka's appearance on the season finale of American idol funnier than anything in this movie.<br/><br/>My rating: * out of ****. 85 mins. PG-13 for sexual humor, drug use and language"

Granted there were some very funny part to this movie which made me and my friends laugh hard, but then there were parts to this movie that made us cringe at its stupidity and nastiness.

Learning alot about religions from throughout the world and history, and the spiritual paths that many people have chosen in life have given me an edge at the way one looks at life. And this movie gets it. Aside form the fact that it obviously pokes fun at how many people get grifted by televangelists and new age gurus the world over, it also tries to redeem the hearts of people to not lose sight of whatever might be most important to them. One does not need to follow the doctrine or life of another unless they want to risk losing themselves to obscurity and sorrow.

Without their love-life in alignment Darren is unable to play well in the hockey matches.<br/><br/>The laughs were scarce and far apart. I actually think that I laughed only a single time, and it was when Verne Troyer was defibrilated and was sent gliding along the ice arena.<br/><br/>While lacking laughs, then the movie was rich on colorful characters who were portrayed by an impressively array of acting talents. Most memorable in the entire movie was the guru Tugginmypudha played by Ben Kingsley.<br/><br/>""The Love Guru"" is not a memorable movie, and not one of Myers best moments. The movie is suitable for a viewing once or twice, but doesn't really holds enough contents to support multiple viewings.<br/><br/>I had expected more of a comedy from this movie.

","The Love Guru (2008): Dir: Marco Schnabel / Cast: Mike Myers, Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Ben Kingsley, Verne Troyer: Title speaks for itself as famous Guru Pitka is summoned from India to Canada to reunite a fallen hockey player with his ex-girlfriend. Not a bad setup but from there it is pretty straight forward. The outcome isn't surprising since it becomes rather pointless for Pitka when his goal is met with attitude shifted, but director Marco Schnabel is backed with colourful production that makes a good distraction from the shabby writing. Mike Myers has fun as Pitka whom often remembers his training and his yearning to get a spot on Oprah. Jessica Alba as the woman whom summoned him is basically eye candy. Justin Timberlake as a rival goalie is underused. He is screwing the hockey player's girlfriend and being a total jerk about it. Is it possible that he will meet his match when Pitka is done with his rival? Does this movie suck? Ben Kingsley steals scenes as the cross-eyed Guru trainer but the role is totally one-note. Verne Troyer work well with Myers as Mini-Mi in the Austin Powers films but here the magic is lost. Here is an example of an idea that might have worked since the concept wasn't bad, but it gets reduced to crude jokes and toilet humour worthy of a quick trip to the trash can.

It felt like Mike Myers had gone off into his own little Mike's World which bore little resemblance to what anyone else found funny.

","I had seen trailer for this film, and then I heard the negative opinions about it, including it winning a couple of awards at the Razzies, and seeing it was rated three out of five stars I was keen to see what I would think of both facts. Basically from Havemahkeeta in India, originally born in America, is Guru Maurice Pitka (National Movie Award and Razzie winning and nominated Mike Myers), who has established himself in both India and America as a spiritual healer with words and activities of wisdom for those who feel their self esteem disappearing. His latest client who is on a losing streak is Toronto Maple Leafs hockey player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco), who is feeling really down, because of having to stand up to his dominating mother Lillian (Telma Hopkins), but especially his recent separation with wife Prudence (Meagan Good), who is drawing her attention towards Jacques 'Le Coq' Grande (Justin Timberlake). These bad feelings inside of Darren cause him to shake badly, affecting his performance on the ice, so his assistant Jane Bullard (Razzie nominated Jessica Alba) has hired Guru Pitka to give the player words of encouragement, with his unusual techniques talking about love making and stuff. In the process Maurice finds himself falling in love with Jane, but he can never get close enough as he has a big secret he feels bad to reveal to her, he has taken a solemn oath of celibacy. In the end, Darren manages to find his sense of worth and gain back his confidence to play just in time for the big championship hockey game, and Maurice allows himself to let go of his oath to be with Jane. Also starring Razzie nominated Sir Ben Kingsley as Guru Tugginmypudha, Omid Djalili as Guru Satchabigknoba and Razzie nominated Verne Troyer as Coach Punch Cherkov, with the voice of Morgan Freeman, Mariska Hargitay (who the Guru says the name of to greet people), Val Kilmer, Myers as himself, Jessica Simpson and Kanye West. I can see what the critics mean that Myers is playing almost another Austin Powers with a beard, but he is slightly weirder, and sadly I can agree in parts that he deserved his Razzie, as for the film itself, there are some amusing sections, but overall I can't see myself ever finding this any funnier, I felt most (not all) of the way it was stupid, a not too terrible comedy. It was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Comedy, and it won the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated for Worst Director for Marco Schnabel. Okay!"

Please do not go back to Austin Powers, that series has been dried up and The Love Guru is just a rejected character from other ideas. Mike, you're a funny guy, let's see it eh?

I never thought I would actually ever say this but, I was happy to see Justin Timberlake in this. He had some good moments of comedy, a lot funnier then Myers. Mike, the former N*Sync boy toy just stole the film from you.<br/><br/>Myers uses same old material, recycled and coming from a different 'approach'. You know how Goldmember used the same jokes as The Spy Who Shagged Me? Same stuff here, just in a different format. More short jokes at mini-me, more sexual innuendos with names and a wink at the camera here and there. Same old stuff we've seen before.<br/><br/>The scenes where the characters are playing hockey aren't even that good. They don't represent the game in any sense of realism. Guys are spinning and flipping everywhere. Usually sport scenes are thrilling, this one was a joke.

","The Love guru is the latest comedy character created by Mike Myers. Myers was very successful with Austin Powers and this film is supposed to show that Myers can do more to make us laugh with new and original characters. Unfortunately for Myers his new character is not funny and the film he is placed in is very poor.<br/><br/>The basic plot for the love guru. Guru Pitka (Myers) is the second best love guru in the world, but dreams of being the best, which to him means going on Opera. He gets an opportunity to make himself the best through Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco).He is a hockey player who has been of his game since his wife left him for another player called Jacques ""Le Coq"" GrandÃ© (Justin Timberlake). The owner of the club, played by Jessica Alba wants the guru's help so he can help Darren Roanoke and make the team have a chance of winning the Stanley cup.<br/><br/>Now the plot is poor and very predictable and I found myself seeing how long was left till this peace of rubbish ended. None of the acting is any good. Jessica Alba does a great job of looking good, but that is about it. Justin Timberlake puts on a stupid accent which is meant to be funny but is not. Vearn Troyer( a.k.a. Mini me) just spends the film shouting and swearing. Not even Myers supplies one decent laugh in the film and the sad thing is you can tell he is trying so hard to make this material funny, but it just isn't. Also, his character is meant to have a crush on Jessica Alba's character, but there is no chemistry between the two. I would blame the writers for Myers poor material to work with, but Myers co wrote it meaning I can not stick up for him. In the whole film I raised a smile once which is why I am not giving this film a 1 out of 10 as a scene involving Vearn Troyer pretending to have a heart attack made me laugh for a few seconds. On the whole it is a rubbish comedy supplying maybe one funny scene, which is disappointing for comedy film fans, but more for Myers fans. I doubt there will be a sequel as this has stained Myers record of funny comedies. Myers carer is in jeopardy and he must give us a new character who is funny and give us a funny film or he will always be known as the voice of Shrek and we all know he is better then that."

","""The Love Guru"" is a cruel joke on our cinematic society and should be abolished in an executive manner. So I am being a bit of a ""Hate Guru"" on my opinions of Mike Myers' profound corny film ""The Love Guru"", but it was that repulsive. Myers stars as Guru Pitka, a Love Guru who craves to be the most popular guru in the love universe. His love quest is to reunite an African-American all-star hockey player named Darren Roanoake with his ex-wife Prudence; even though it was not prudent for ""The Love Guru"" filmmakers to insert this ridiculous flatline plot line. Roanaoke has been struggling in the hockey rink and the only way to get his ""mojo"" back (sound Myersly familiar?) is to get his Prudence back. If Pitka succeeds, then he could be claimed as the ""world's best guru"" on Oprah. Are you still with me? Or do I sound like a ""Bore Guru"" in describing the atrocious piece of work. Jessica Alba, looking ""albalicious"", plays the hockey team owner but her acting here was ""demolicious"". Verne Troyer, Mini-me himself, has a ""small"" part as the hockey coach but it would have served him better to be a mini-golf coach instead. Justin Timberlake did not bring his recently impressive acting back playing here a hockey goalie buffoon who is dating dear Prudence. And there is Myers! I did not like Mike here! Myers lost his mojo comedy acting power in ""The Love Guru"" by over-exhausting ourselves with way too many puns which most of Pitka's puns were quite pitiful! Even though I might be guilty of the same charge! Director Marco Schnabel and Screenwriters Graham Gordy & Myers himself should quickly visit a ""Film Guru"" in order to reconcile with the positive cinema society with their next project. However, I must state that I did enjoy the hilarious elephant sex scene with Chris Isaak's hit song ""Baby Did A Bad, Bad, Thing"" playing in the background. But the rest of ""The Love Guru"" was no doubt a very bad, bad thing! ** Needs Improvement"

"EUyeshima","3","0","6","22 October 2008"," Myers Flails as a Chopak Wannabe in a Comic Misfire
","Star and co-writer Mike Myers is far too clever to be dismissed entirely for a film burdened by his kitchen-sink approach to comedy. However, this 2008 film comes closest to making him downright intolerable despite a smattering of smart one-liners that barely save it from landing in the junk bin. The concept would seem ripe with possibilities as the film lampoons the commercial intentions of self-help gurus like Deepak Chopra, but Myers and his writing partner Graham Gordy appear more interested in bodily functions, gross-out humor, repetitive gags (""Mariska Hargitay""), Canadian in-jokes, and celebrity walk-ons rather than keep the satirical aspects focused enough to make a point. Unfortunately, first-time director Marco Schnabel simply lets the star and the rest of the lackluster cast flounder without lending a perspective that could have balanced the lowbrow shenanigans with the highbrow aspirations. As unsatisfying as the film is, I wonder if Judd Apatow could have saved this material.<br/><br/>The overextended plot revolves around self-help guru Maurice Pitka, who was born in America but raised in India. With his long hair and beard and traditional Hindu garb, Pitka is known as a second-rate Chopra, but he is aggressively looking for an opportunity to change that and get on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Enter Darren Roanoke, star player for the Toronto Maple Leafs, who goes into a scoring slump just as the team makes the Stanley Cup playoffs. Team owner Jane Bullard and coach Punch Cherkov seek out Pitka to help Roanoke reconcile with his wife Prudence, who has caused his beleaguered lack of self-esteem. She has decided to leave him for the conjugal joys to be had with Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande, the goalie for the opposing Los Angeles Kings known for his elephantine endowment. Pitka espouses his radical ""DRAMA"" method of enlightenment to alleviate Roanoke's stress and lead him on a journey toward self-love. Apparently that's the only chance that the Maple Leafs have in winning the Cup. At the same time, Pitka realizes his goal to usurp Chopak is a hollow one when he becomes romantically drawn to the comely Bullard.<br/><br/>Myers may have gone to the well one too many times with his smarmy, overly self-aware performance as Pitka. What goodwill he generated as Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers has almost evaporated here. As Bullard, Jessica Alba is a pretty but unavoidably wooden foil to Myers, and her character's attraction to Pitka remains one of the film's bigger mysteries. Somewhat better is Romany Malco as Roanoke and Justin Timberlake as Grande, though neither is imposing enough to be particularly believable as professional hockey players. As a more verbal version of Mini-Me, Verne Troyer plays Cherkov in constant foul-mouthed agitation. The most embarrassing performance, however, belongs to a cross-eyed Ben Kingsley as Pitka's spiritual mentor, Guru Tugginmypudha. I doubt if any other Oscar winner has taken quite as discreet a fall from grace. On the other hand, I have to admit I liked the sitar revamp of Dolly Parton's ""9 to 5"" as the irrelevant opening theme, as well as Stephen Colbert's funny bits with Jim Gaffigan as the play-by-play commentators. But that's about it.<br/><br/>The extras are abundant on the 2008 DVD if you care to view them. First, there is a standard making-of featurette, ""Mike Myers and The Love Guru - An Inside Look"" that runs ten minutes with comments from Myers, Alba, Troyer, and Schnabel. There is a six-minute short, ""One Helluva Elephant"", showing how special effects specialist Ron Stefaniuk built an animatronic elephant and ostrich for the movie. More interesting is ""Hockey Training for Actors"" which has sports coordinator Mark Ellis explaining how the actors learned to play hockey. Rounding out the extras are eleven deleted/extended scenes, a four-minute blooper reel, a separate five-minute compilation of deleted takes with Colbert and Gaffigan (the best of the extras and even better than the movie), ten minutes more of general outtakes, and the original theatrical trailer."

","I am 16 years of age and a really big fan of Mick Myers and Jessica Alba .....but for god sake i could have made a better movie with friends on my cell phone.Now don't get me wrong i have a wild sense of humor and taught some parts where funny but nearly all of it is just down wright stupid.I could even see the acting level and it was poor..i mean i have defiantly seen better acting in school plays and the timing of the jokes was way off.Its up to ye people what ye think of it but i taught the best part of the movie was been able to stand up and walk out.Now don't get me wrong or anything but Jesus Jessica what where you thinking at all when you read the script you couldn't have actually taught that it looked like a good movie to do.And i have being reading a lot of reviews about the film and a lot of people are saying that Justin Timberlake was the funniest but quite frankly i didn't even hear or see him do anything funny.And i don't think have a sock in your pants for most of the secens was at all funny"

","It's an unfunny movie, what looks like another bad SNL sketch stretched into a paper thin mess. I personally never thought Mike Myers was funny, and this movie really shows it. He looks like he's uncomfortable doing his own stupid lines and jokes, as does everyone else in the film. There's a lot of dead air in the movie as well, just a lot of quiet with not much happening but silly dialogue. The penis jokes got old fast, almost as if Mike Myers has a fetish. The including of Verne Troyer was a novelty that just didn't work. In fact most things in this movie just didn't work. The couple highlights: It was nice seeing current and former Daily Show players on here (Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, and even Samantha Bee for a second), too bad none of them were given anything funny to say. The scene with Mike Myers and Kanye West together at the game was an interesting idea, but was obviously tacked on, they didn't even say anything. And um, Jessica Alba is still hot. That's about it."

","Ah Myers has a beard in his new movie, so it's not as stupid as Waynes World I,II or the Austin Powers movies and it will including of course no Wienerjokes. Myers starts now with his Freud period. Wake up, yes not all the jokes are fresh or the story is more than 10 cents worth but its not important. Its the new Myers film, if you don't like Wienerjokes or Myke Myers who imitating Peters Selllers in ""the Party"" WHY YOU GO WATCHING THIS MOVIE AND WRITE ON IMDb ABOUT IT. The problem is not ""the love Guru"" its YOU. Is your Wiener not long enough to do it on your own? I dislike Adam Sandler he's probably the dullest comedian of all times, but American people love his stupidity and pay a lot for it, and this dumb Sparta movie. I hate that crap, so i don't watch it or write about. You want to write about every movie you don't like? Or with the Gurus own words. Stop writing about things you don't like. Why are you still writing about things you don't like. Stop it and play with your wiener.<br/><br/>If you like Myers Movies like Austin Powers check it out, it was funny but hes not a wise Guru. IF YOU DON'T LIKE AUSTIN POWERS JOKES, DON'T WATCH IT!"
