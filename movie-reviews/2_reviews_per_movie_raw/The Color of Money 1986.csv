"Cue-ball","7","42","45","11 February 2005"," Great performances in good movie
","Paul Newman reprised his role of Eddie Felson from ""The Hustler"" (1961), on all short lists of great movies, to star in ""The Color of Money"", a worthy sequel in the way ""Rocky II"" was to ""Rocky"" -- not a great movie, but very good.<br/><br/>Eddie, advancing in years, has apparently left the hustling circuit for a more respectable job as a liquor wholesalesman. On his route, he encounters a brash, obnoxious pool shark named Vincent (Tom Cruise) and his girlfriend (Mary Mastrantonio). Vincent has the talent, but not the brains or knowledge, to be another great hustler, so Eddie, his desire for the circuit reignited, offers to stake Vincent and teach him the ropes, in exchange for a substantial piece of the winnings. At first, Vincent's ego and obnoxiousness threaten his development, but he soon learns all of Eddie's tricks -- and a few of his own. By the time of the big tournament at the end of the movie, Eddie and Vince have split ways -- and find themselves on a collision course.<br/><br/>I just realized that ""The Color of Money"" is my favorite Tom Cruise movie, but not my favorite Paul Newman movie (which could well be ""The Hustler""). I re-viewed this movie recently after a long discussion with some friends about the difference between a movie star and an actor, and the few living legends that are both (besides Newman, I'd include Jack Nicholson and Robert de Niro). As always, Newman, even with such a huge public persona, disappears into the role of the middle-aged grifter, heartbroken how far his game has fallen in the days since he left the pool hall circuit. But he also makes the other performers around him shine. Cruise's trademark cockiness shines through in Vincent. Besides Mastrantonio, one of my favorite actresses Helen Shaver turns in a nice performance as Eddie's girlfriend, and Forest Whitaker first appeared on my radar in his short time on screen.<br/><br/>The other star of the movie is the game. While Scorsese didn't make his movie into the character study of ""The Hustler"", he uses the pool tables and balls as a medium for many artistic scenes. If you are someone who enjoys looking at beautiful movies, you won't be disappointed. And there might even be some real pool players -- you never know...<br/><br/>The story is good, not great. ""The Color of Money"" is not cut from the same felt as ""The Hustler"", and does not try to be. It is a movie about pool, not a character study. I don't think I would be up to repeated viewings as frequent as ""The Hustler"", but it's a fine way to spend an evening watching Newman and Cruise shoot pool."
"MovieAddict2016","8","66","85","28 April 2005"," Fast Eddie is back!
","People misunderstood ""The Color of Money,"" I think. There are a few things to keep in mind: <br/><br/>1) This was a Martin Scorsese film. Scorsese was fresh off ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" and other such successes from less than a decade before. People were expecting a lot.<br/><br/>2) It starred Paul Newman, returning to his character from ""The Hustler,"" in a sequel that was twenty-five years in the making. That's longer than the wait for the ""Phantom Menace"" prequel.<br/><br/>Perhaps for those two (very strong) reasons alone, when ""The Color of Money"" opened in 1986, the critics and audiences didn't think much of it. It garnered decent praise from both areas but most critics seemed to agree: it didn't hold a candle to ""The Hustler,"" and anyone other than Scorsese could have easily made the same picture.<br/><br/>After 19 years, I disagree. I think ""The Color of Money"" is not only an intelligent and amusing character piece, but an excellent continuation of a character we haven't seen for 25 years.<br/><br/>First of all, Scorsese's direction isn't his best, but it's still very good. And he's definitely got the same elements going on as ""After Hours"" from a few years before -- his cinematography is identical and the dark colors and grainy '80s vibe are present in every frame. Likewise he's using the quick-cuts and zooms and iconic panning shots that he's known for. The thing is, Scorsese's styles just changed a bit during the 1980s (they even carried on into ""GoodFellas"" -- the night-time shots carry the same foreboding look as ""After Hours"" and ""Color of Money""). I think now, looking back, since we've seen more of Scorsese's films, it's easier to notice that this is indeed a Martin Scorsese film. A man who is constantly changing his directorial approach. (Just look at ""The Aviator"" for goodness sake!) Newman deserved the Oscar more for ""The Hustler,"" of course, but for what it's worth, Fast Eddie Felson's evolution is handled with care in the script and it's very entertaining (for anyone who's seen the original) to note the change in his behavior. It's also interesting to see the new cocky pool hustler, Vince (Tom Cruise), filling in the shoes of Eddie from a few decades before.<br/><br/>If ""The Hustler"" was a great insight into the life of a troubled young man, then ""The Color of Money"" is a terrific insight into the evolution of this man, and the contrast between the young and the old. All adults tell us as children that they were just like us at one time, and we don't believe them. ""The Color of Money"" follows this principal -- in thirty years, we all know Vince will be just like Fast Eddie: wise and matured. And then he'll probably be coaching a young guy who thinks he's the king of the world. Will they make another sequel based on this continuation of the story? I doubt it. It's unnecessary, because as far as I'm concerned ""The Color of Money"" has already stressed the point. But you never know...<br/><br/>Overall this isn't a great movie and I won't pretend it is. But I do think it's one of the better films to come out of the 1980s and had a lot more going for it than some of the critics gave it credit for. Film buffs should see it, especially those who loved ""The Hustler."""

","""Twenty five years ago, my career ended before it had even really started,"" Eddie Felson tells Vince, a young pool shark. No longer the cocky man he was in ""The Hustler,"" Eddie (Paul Newman) in 1986 is retired from pool and a successful investor. When he spots hot-shot Vince (Tom Cruise), he decides to invest in him and take him on the road, with the goal of Vince winning a big pool tournament in Atlantic City. Along the way, Eddie confronts what he was and is no more and looks at the dreams he let die. When Vince is too foolish and strong-willed to take his advice, Eddie makes an important decision.<br/><br/>Though not as strong a film as ""The Hustler,"" ""The Color of Money"" is still an excellent film with a great cast led by Newman, at the peak of his ""older man"" good looks and the brilliant acting he's always had. And, as usual, he tells you everything you need to know about a character. It's clear that he was content with his life and his attractive girlfriend (Helen Shaver) until he saw Vince. Then the old restlessness and competitiveness came creeping back into his blood.<br/><br/>Seeing Tom Cruise in 1986 is startling since today, the lower half of his face has changed drastically due to plastic surgery. Here he conveys the raw, youthful energy that helped make him a star. Like many successful movie actors, he has a wonderful physical agility. His pompadoured Vince is a short-tempered, jealous, talented ingrate who can't help showing off. Cruise is very effective, as is Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio as his sultry, beautiful girlfriend in another role she made memorable in the '80s.<br/><br/>Beautifully directed by Scorcese, ""The Color of Money"" shows that it's never too late to follow your dreams and, with the right actors and the right script, you can do a good sequel even 25 years after the original."
"agraham83","Null","34","45","27 June 2001"," Scorsese's successful return to bigger budgets
","""The Color Of Money"" continues the story of pool player/hustler 'Fast Eddie' Felson (Paul Newman). He's 25 years old, and 25 years wiser as he's spent that time watching pool hustles and schemes and selling wine after his 'early' retirement from pool playing in the original.<br/><br/>But now he's got a new excitement and energy to the game, as he meets Vincent (Tom Cruise), a young, cocky but talented fresh player who's not well known around the low-level pool rooms Eddie has been frequenting. Eddie and Vincent's girlfriend, Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) see Vincent as a cash cow. Indeed, everybody uses everyone, and we're never quite sure the relationship between the three. That's the beauty of it.<br/><br/>Scorsese's never been more refined yet quietly flashy, dealing with a traditional 'old' Hollywood tale of a mentor and protege as small time hustlers playing each other and getting played.  The film is an underrated gem, truly downplayed in Scorsese's overall filmography.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended."
"bkoganbing","9","26","34","21 July 2007"," ""I Want Your Best Game""
","Although a lot of this plot is taken from the Richard Widmark rodeo film When the Legends Die, The Color of Money is still a worthy film and a good successor to the early Paul Newman classic, The Hustler.<br/><br/>I imagine that players like Paul Newman who create classic characters like Fast Eddie Felson must be bombarded with scripts or story ideas for sequels. Paul Newman is one of the most discriminating of players and up to this point he had only reprised his role in Harper with The Drowning Pool.<br/><br/>When he decided to do The Color of Money there was no need to age Newman twenty five years with makeup. Time had done a better job than any makeup man could have done. Time had also honed his acting abilities so that he could realistically recreate one of his classic characters in an older generation.<br/><br/>One thing about The Color of Money is that can and does stand independently of The Hustler. You do not have to have seen the earlier film to know what's happening here. Nevertheless in that earlier film, promising new pool player Eddie Felson does not take direction from mobsters who effectively end his career before he gets it firmly on track.<br/><br/>Fast forward from 1961 to 1986 and Paul Newman is now a liquor salesman who hangs around poolrooms in tank towns and dreams what might have been. A young kid with a 'sledgehammer break' gets Newman's attention and its Tom Cruise. He's got a girlfriend, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio with him and the three sort of adopt each other. <br/><br/>It's a complicated relationship between all three of them and all three of them manage to convey the many ups and downs of this triangle. Newman teaches Cruise the tricks of the trade including how to tank a game occasionally to bring up the betting odds. In many ways Cruise learns too well and Newman hanging around with him makes him realize just how much he's missed because of the gangland blackball.<br/><br/>Reportedly Newman and Cruise got along splendidly during the making of The Color of Money. Their joint interest in auto racing cemented a very good working relationship.<br/><br/>Paul Newman was also nominated during the eighties for Absence of Malice and The Verdict which are two of my favorites with him. Unfortunately in the first he was up against Henry Fonda who had been similarly snubbed for years by the Academy and was dying during the Oscar voting. The second time Ben Kingsley portrayal of the title role in the massive blockbuster Gandhi obscured what I think is Newman's finest performance in The Verdict.<br/><br/>Though the Oscar was an Oscar for lifetime of work, The Color of Money is a worthy sequel to The Hustler. Martin Scorsese got great performances out of the whole cast. And Paul Newman finally got a matching Oscar to go with the one Joanne Woodward won for The Three Faces of Eve for their mantelpiece."
"TOMASBBloodhound","8","19","24","18 November 2009"," Unnecessary? Sure. But very well filmed and acted.
","The Color of Money is a slick sequel to The Hustler where Paul Newman as a much younger man paid the price for hustling pool. Now, twenty some years later, his Fast Eddie Felson is driving around in a big fancy Cadillac selling liquor and stake-horsing younger pool players. One day, while romancing his bartender girlfriend, his young protégé (John Tuturro) gets whipped by this cocky kid named Vincent. Eddie Felson is immediately drawn to the flaky, loud-mouthed kid with the name ""Vince"" stenciled on his tee shirt. After some arm twisting and manipulating, Eddie, Vincent, and Vincent's streetwise girlfriend Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are making their way to Atlantic City where a 9 Ball pool tournament awaits. Along they way Eddie tries to teach them how to hustle pool. This will be a problem because of course the cocky youngster won't do as he's told. He has a gift and knows it. It is simply impossible for him to hold back and let someone beat him. Even when it could lead to a bigger payoff down the road. His girlfriend Carmen also seems to see both Vincent and Eddie as a way to make money for herself. She is clearly a woman with motives all her own. Of course this will all lead up to a climatic match in Atlantic City between the old master and the young protégé, won't it? Well, it appears to for a moment, until we learn that what we saw wasn't really what it appeared to be.<br/><br/>And that's the part of the film that seemed to really irk Roger Ebert in his review. He was expecting a masterpiece of a film for no other reason than Martin Scorcese is the director. But the film isn't a masterpiece. Its simply a very good film with some great performances, great music, and some gritty and authentic-looking locations. Who is the better pool player is the last thing this film is about. This is a film about people using other people. Be it for money, inspiration, comfort, you name it. Newman plays Felson here as a gruff, seasoned man who thinks he knows everything about the game, and those who play it. He finds out as the film moves along that is not always the case. Sometimes these younger players have new tricks up their sleeves, and if you let your guard down, they will hustle even the smartest old timer. There is a classic scene where Eddie, after a few too many drinks, allows a chubby and apparently dim-witted Forest Whitaker to take him for hundreds of dollars. The film is full of scenes that end in ways you don't quite expect.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where above all else, the casting was almost perfect. Newman is as watchable as ever. Mastrantonio steals a few scenes. Cruise is annoying of course, but he was supposed to be. Still, he looks kind of weak compared to the other actors. Great support from Helen Shaver and Bill Cobbs, too. Watch closely for an appearance from music icon Iggy Pop. During a montage, Cruise hustles him and then steals a shot of booze right out of his hand! The cinematography from Michael Ballhaus is great as always. In fact its too good! Some of the camera shots just look too stylish for such a film. Maybe that was Scorcese's way of trying to liven up a picture with so little violence! Overall, The Color of Money is worth your time. 8 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound"

","The Color of Money ain't about pool. The Color of Money isn't about young Vincent, or his girlfriend, Carmen. And believe it or not, The Color of Money isn't even about money. The Color of Money is about Paul Newman's character, Fast Eddie Felson, and his salvation to place meaning with significance to his trying lonely life as a pool hustler. Viewers lost in the glam of hustling pool or the action of 9-ball are missing out seeing the real beauty of this film of the story told. The story and life of Fast Eddie Felson that is. And credit to Paul Newman to go along with the brilliant character of course. Newman gives his grade A+ performance, one of the best I've ever seen, from Newman, or from anybody that is. Paul Newman is beautiful. The Color of Money is one truly exceptional character piece. The Color of Money, for my money, is better than The Hustler. It's an incredible sequel. It's an incredible feature. It's one of my more loved movies, mostly for Paul Newman's performance, but also very much for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Tom Cruise as well. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the main co-star here, and Tom Cruise takes on third role. I love the beautiful Mary Elizabeth. She's so good. She has such true acting abilities, which is rarer to find in Hollywood than one might think. Tom Cruise is great as Vincent, one of his more well acted roles to go along with Jerry Maguire and Rain Man, which is his best. Tom Cruise has some true acting talent too, just not like Newman or Mastrantonio, only because that they are two of the very best. Cruise has more star quality though. Don't get me wrong. The kid can act. I just love Tom Cruise. The best of the magic of The Color of Money happens between Newman and Mastrantonio as they quietly share a magnetic connection. The magnificent Martin Scorsese is a master of his trade, maybe the best in the business, and The Color of Money is one other misperceived, under-appreciated Scorsese classic, to go along with Casino and Gangs of New York, as well as but to a smaller scale, Shutter Island, The Aviator, Cape Fear, Bringing Out the Dead, and Mean Streets. The Color of Money is a 9 out of 10 ranking, an outstanding mark, nothing less. I hope I spelled Mary Elizabeth's last name right every time, Mastrantonio. It would be too entirely challenging to revise such a mishap. But I know that I did. Mastrantonio, God, that's a terrific name."
"tfrizzell","Null","22","34","3 July 2002"," Amazing Sequel That Was 25 Years in the Making.
","Near excellent sequel to ""The Hustler"" which returns Paul Newman (finally in an Oscar-winning role) as the old wise former hustler who decides to take young jerk Tom Cruise and his hot, but shady girlfriend (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in her Oscar-nominated role) on the road to take advantage of all pool table challengers. Newman's reprise of his greatest role is truly something to experience. He is at the top of his career in this one, playing a quiet and complicated role of a man who has been tortured by time, loss and missed dreams of total success. Martin Scorsese's subtle and focused direction stays on task throughout and he lets his three outstanding leads do the bulk of the work. Not quite as good as ""The Hustler"" due to a weaker screenplay and less suspense, but still a very memorable cinematic experience. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

At times, he plays him like a cartoon character. Luckily Paul Newman could bring the acting chops to this movie. When Paul's character loses to Amos (Forest Whitaker), you see a history of the man's failures. You felt his defeat emotionally. Martin Scorsese directs this. I wonder if Martin Scorsese held back a little. The violence and grittiness for which he's known for isn't all there.

","From the first part, this counterpart actually grips me more and takes me to a better understanding than the proceeding. I am not a Tom Cruise Fan, and I guess Paul did make it a lot better than a 'Tom movie', thank God. But This aging 'dinosaur', who is making a comeback on the pool-circuit has a new hotshot, in the picture, (that being Tom of course) that is great, but green as anything. Being and acting on the mind that he (Fellson) has...he pursues an idea to take and mentor this 'grandstander' who already has a lot of talent. If he can teach him. The jury isn't out yet on that one though. But I was in awe of this movie even before I took an interest in writing. The images of Newman, are so powerful to me, taking a hold of my mind with an encapsulating effectiveness. As I took new interest in a story that would have otherwise board me, I saw a man attempting to hold onto his own life in the process. He, a business man and a hustler, a sensitive lover and still a player, but faithful to all, how rare. <br/><br/>There was this since of him being strong and a fighter and yet at a moment in weakness, but also reflective wiseness, that came through. He was attempting to not lose his handle on a large piece of his life. A passion, and a honed Career-hobby all in one. <br/><br/>He loved his work, and struggled to reach a young upstart, named Vincent a rousing hot-head, with a propensity for blowing it, because of needed ego-strokes. A hard head with ability, but in need of mentoring to save him from himself. 'The Color of money' for me is a man trying not to lose himself in a vastly enveloping world. He is trying to stay alive. He's attempting to keep his life 'in play'. So that he doesn't die a career and identity 'self esteem' death on the side. The 'Color of Money' is a seminal work. It's brilliant and pleasing with a sense of accomplishment. If you haven't seen this one, find the DVD. <br/><br/>I rate it a 10 for excellence.(****)"

","25 years after casting his magic in The Hustler, Paul Newman returns again as Fast Eddie Felson, and the results are almost as good as the 1961 offering. Here he is older and wiser and carrying around a cue case full of cynicism, tho no longer involved in the game of pool he has his hunger for the game and the money it makes, rekindled by a meeting with dynamite hot shot Vincent and his beautiful girlfriend Carmen.<br/><br/>The story involves the three of them going on the road hustling and aiming for the big pay off that Vincent's talent can ultimately bring them, naturally it's not all sweetness and light tho.<br/><br/>It's a fine film when looking at it now, and I was amazed that it didn't feel like an 80s film as such, and this is down to the cracking direction of Martin Scorsese, it may be one of his most mainstream commercial offerings but his fine work is there for all to see. The camera glides around as if on air to create joyous results, shots that put the pool action right into the conscious of the viewer, it's a great effort. The film is further boosted by two wonderful performances from the leading men, Newman deserved his Oscar for putting such verve and honesty into the now grizzled Felson, there is a scene with Forest Whitaker that is Newman gold without him hardly having to say anything . Then there is Cruise, all big hair and a ball of adrenaline, a great ebullient show that is great fun to watch. I read somewhere that Newman praised Cruise for capturing the essence of a young Eddie Felson, well you can't say fairer than that. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio more than holds her own with the boys and fleshes out a smart and entertaining film that seems to get better with age, just like Felson funnily enough.<br/><br/>Oh he's back alright, 9/10."
"secondtake","7","11","16","10 April 2010"," A good ride, colorful shooting (camera and pool), but a bit thin overall, except Newman.
","The Color of Money (1986)<br/><br/>The reputation of this films rides partly on its director, a mainstream Martin Scorsese, and on the previous film it bounces off of (and makes vague reference to), The Hustler. Key to both films is the astonishing Paul Newman, who holds his end of the stick and then some. The rest of the cast is purely in canned and competent support roles, or in semi-star roles by two young actors with some screen presence but no great subtle skill to match Newman's. <br/><br/>I'm speaking not only of Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio, who is forced to play the slightly tough, slightly sexy, generally submissive girlfriend, but also of Tom Cruise, who is brilliant at being ""flakey"" partly because he is in real life, from all accounts. You give Scorsese credit here for using the young actor in a role that matches his natural persona, in contrast to others, including Spielberg, who seem to make more of the actor than there is, and a certain falseness gets in the way. But this film uses the awkwardness and naive, boyish qualities of Cruise as a sudden pool shark really well. <br/><br/>What holds it all back? I think basically plot. I mean, it's fun to see the big hustle at play, and to get stung once or twice when things aren't what they seem. But we sort of know going in that that's the general plan, and then it happens. And it takes a long time happening...there are no (no) complications here, beyond pool and hustling. The romances, for what they are worth, a completely thin, and didn't have to be. The settings, all these great (great) poolhalls and small town joints are terrific, populated a little too perfectly by locals of all different stripes. The camera-work makes some fairly cinema verite footage make sense in the scenes, but not with either edge or lyricism. <br/><br/>This all sounds a little like I'm working hard to point out the flaws, and I must go back to where I started about Newman, and the basic strength of the aging pool player facing a change in his personal scenery. It's a canned affair overall. Well done, sure, but without the richness of the best of Scorsese's work, or the best of Hollywood, for that matter, including the preceding The Hustler, which you might see in a pairing with this one."

Cruise seems to be playing himself as the cocky pool whiz and Newman could not have done a better job bringing the old school retired hustler ""Fast Eddie"" Felson back to the pool hall. Scorcese succinctly tells the tale of the hustler getting sucked back into the game, whether he likes it or not. Amazing pool shots made by great players makes you realize just how good the best of the best truly are. If after watching this movie you don't go to the local pool hall for a beer and saunter around the table humming ""Werewolves of London"", you just don't get it. Also have to note the unforgettable line uttered by Forrest Whitaker after embarrassingly beating the hustler at his own game; ""Hey Eddie, can i ask you a question? Do you think i need to lose some weight?"" Priceless. Four huge stars."

","It was 1961 when Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) was last seen racking them in pool halls. Then he was young, talented, and didn't know when to quit. Now, Eddie is an old sage playing the role as mentor to a young would be hustler by the name of Vincent (Tom Cruise). Vince is a brash, ostentatious pool player that is very good. He's too good and he knows it which hinders his ability to hustle. An adequate hustle requires taking a dive at the right time and Vince's ego prevents him from doing that. The relationship between Eddie and Vince is a complicated one that is further complicated by Vince's girlfriend, Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). Vince is very much raw material and both Eddie and Carmen want to mold him into the meal ticket he can be.<br/><br/>I actually liked this movie more than The Hustler. Eddie is more bearable as a character even if Vince is not. Vince, with all of his flare and attitude was still easy to read. He was simple. Eddie on the other hand was very quixotic. Once it seemed like you knew what motivated him you were once again lost. Eddie wasn't bad or good he was always shifting gears. Did he want money, did he want a thrill, did he want recognition, did he want to ride off into the sunset? It was never clear but his character was nonetheless intriguing."

Scorsese takes a different approach here and allows his art of a filmmaker to shine through during the pool scenes, which are handled fairly artistically through innovative angles and shots (no pun intended).

"classicsoncall","7","3","4","17 October 2009"," ""If you're too old to cut the mustard, you can lick the jar"".
","It's been a while now since I saw ""The Hustler"", but my memory suggests that it was substantially more grim and gritty than this much later sequel, if one could even call it that. That might owe to the earlier film's black and white photography adding a noirish feel to the smoke filled pool parlors and lounges where the young Eddie Felson used to ply his trade. With ""The Color of Money"", I couldn't get quite comfortable with where the picture was going or if we would ever get there. The basic plot is understood, the now older Eddie (Paul Newman) would take upstart newcomer Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise) under his wing, teach him how to read his opponents, stake him in his matches, and collect his share of the winnings. I never really got the sense though that Vincent was ever really along for that ride, since he almost never took Eddie's advice, allowing his ego to constantly get in the way of their shared goal.<br/><br/>What I got the biggest kick out of had to do with the musical lyrics set to various confrontations Vincent dealt with on the circuit. Eddie's warning about Moselle was comically echoed by Warren Zevon's line - 'You better stay away from him, He'll rip your lungs out Jim' - that was great. Later, as Grady Seasons runs the table, Vincent has to consider - 'Are you gonna fall for this'? <br/><br/>The other noteworthy moment watching the film today had to do with Paul Newman's character talking to Vincent early in the story, and explaining how he would teach him how to hustle. The discussion might have just as well turned on Newman giving pointers to Cruise on how to act at this early point in his career. That's not meant to be a put down, but you can definitely see the difference between the actor Cruise of today compared to two decades earlier. Just an observation.<br/><br/>I suppose my qualms about the picture have to do with it's pacing in the latter half, when the focus is on Fast Eddie's decision to compete again. There's that swimming pool dive that comes from nowhere, and the attendant visit to the optometrist when he realizes his sight is impaired. That just seemed to break the flow of the story enough to give it a disjointed feel. Later, Eddie's victory over Vincent in the tournament seemed tainted, and then of course, that's revealed to be true. I guess I was looking for the picture to end on some kind of message shedding light on the underlying decency of the principal players, but instead it looked like they both wound up behind an eight ball."

","25 years after throwing in the cue Fast Eddie Nelson (invariably played by Paul Newman) he now owns a pool hall and spends his time with some minor hustling. Until he comes across a guileless, but prodigally talented youngster with incessant bad hair days called Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise), who with ease and mirth dispatches the best pool player in his establishment. Enticed by the hapless youth Eddie soon ventures to take him and his girlfriend-manager Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) on the road to throw them into the world of pool hustling and then to finally bring them to the Atlantic City to compete on the big stage...<br/><br/>Paul Newman easily dominates proceedings with his restrained gentlemen charm residing somewhere on the verge of skewed morality - a place of pool cons made hard-earned money and just reward (fuly deserved Oscar winning role). Opposing him Cruise delivers a rather bland outing, in part due to attention subconsciously shifted north of his forehead to his 'dead beaver' hair-do. Thankfully however Cruise's character is essentially a counterpoint to Eddie - initially an uncouth naive jester under tutelage evolves into a self-conscience and money-orientated player, much in the mold of the hustler himself. Roles however change when Eddie rediscovers the joys of simply playing pool undercut by being hustled himself by a random Joe. As Vincent immerses further into the life, Eddie rediscover the pure joy of playing and enters the Atlantic City competition, thus basically completing a full circle (Vincent now the king of the world Eddie once was, whilst Eddie mature has now grown to appreciate the little things).<br/><br/>The story itself tries to indulge the viewer, but watching balls being struck rarely builds enthusiasm, whilst the moral ambiguity of proceedings shadows the film in both greyness as well as dullness. Though Eddie especially is vividly evoked, ""The Colour of Money"" drags along with an unflinching incapability to make thunderbolting racks into a thrilling watching experience, instead drenched in smoke, lethargy and morose build-up (not helped by dim grainy cinematography). As stated in the movie the 9-shot is essentially nonstrategic, based on luck, noisy, quick and essentially crass, making the whole experience feel like nonsubstantial style.Coupled with bumbling chemistry between the two leads and some drunkenly built dramaturgy pieces fail to emotionally fall into place (in some part owed to the self-evident premise, which makes proceedings overly predictable. Despite Newman's best efforts overall the limping dramatic side and marginally interesting subject matter cause Scorsese to fail to lift off the ground."

Newman either inspires, or allows everyone else to shine on their own; at least, that's what comes across on screen. Newman is a marvelous actor. Cruise wisely plays his part not as a younger version of Paul Newman, but as a unique, naive character, with similar pool table expertise. May Elizabeth Mastrantonio (as Carmen) has a choice role as Cruise's accompanying girlfriend. Watch for a great scene wherein Newman shows he understands women as well as he does pool.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't seem very realistic, after the three get going. The barrooms and pool halls are surprisingly smoke-free. Perhaps, director Martin Scorsese was portending a ""smoking ban"". The soundtrack music is too good, in most instances; sadly, there are no cheap jukeboxes playing awful oldies. Warren Zevon's ""Werewolves of London"" is an exception; it is a good song, and is used very well in the film. No balls jump off the table (or anywhere); it's a tight, professional picture.

"Lechuguilla","Null","5","10","31 January 2008"," Teacher And Student
","The teacher is has-been pool shark Eddie Felson (Paul Newman). The student is Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise), a cocky, overconfident kid who knows how to beat opponents but whose swaggering attitude gets in the way of being taken seriously by professional pool players. At face value, ""The Color Of Money"" is a character driven story of Felson's efforts to teach young Vincent the importance of psychology and subtlety, en route to the big-time pool tournaments in Atlantic City. At a slightly deeper level, the film is the story of how Felson, with his own personal agenda, uses Vincent as a means to an end.<br/><br/>For pool players the film offers lots of terrific pool playing. For everyone else, the story can seem dull and claustrophobic. Most of the film is set indoors, in dark pool halls. Except at the very beginning, there's a curious absence of cigarette smoke in these places, perhaps an oversight in production design. Camera ""takes"" are rather long at the film's beginning. And that gets the movie off to a slow start.<br/><br/>Pool playing is not real conducive to great cinema, as it is not particularly visual. Director Scorsese does his best to make the visuals interesting, through quick editing and camera dissolves, especially in the film's second half. And there's plenty of story conflict between Eddie and Vincent, even though one wonders how Vincent can be so mentally ... dense. Perhaps his ""attitude"" is more a character contrivance, to add interest to the relationship between him and Felson.<br/><br/>Despite wearing too much makeup, Paul Newman gives a fine performance. By contrast, Tom Cruise, with his big pompadour hairdo, is simply annoying. He struts his stuff, huffs and puffs on cue (pardon the pun), but otherwise lacks any sense of subtlety or refinement in emotional expression. I will credit both Newman and Cruise with skill in playing pool, as they made many of the shots themselves.<br/><br/>Overall, Newman's name and the story's connection to ""The Hustler"" (1961) are what carry this film. ""The Color Of Money"" is a rather dull, slightly depressing movie that's not nearly as good as the 1961 original, but one that will nevertheless appeal both to fans of Newman and to viewers who enjoy the game of pool."

One day in a bar, he notices Vincent Lauria(played by Tom Cruise) who has undeniable talent as a pool player but is far too overconfident, scaring away potential marks as a result. Vincent reminds Eddie of himself, so agrees to manage him, as long as he accepts his coaching without argument. Vincent also has a loyal girlfriend called Carmen(played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) who reminds Eddie of his doomed romance with Sarah... Events will collide in the big pool tournament at the end.

"mmallon4","10","2","3","24 October 2017"," The Rules of the Game
","I've never been more aroused by a film's editing and cinematography than that featured in The Color of Money, a film which I ultimately enjoyed more than it's predecessor The Hustler. It just so happens I first watched The Color of Money during my time as a film student and attempted to replicate many of the film's shots and edits for a music video (and an intentionally 80's music video at that) as I studied the cuts present in the film frame by frame. Needless to say, I was not entirely successful in my endeavour.<br/><br/>The Color of Money has the fast pace and rhythm of MTV music videos but still with a sense of old-school class and sophistication; right from the opening credits, I can tell this would be a movie dripping in atmosphere. A movie so snappy, fast-paced and full of quick edits, many of which come unexpectedly along with many unconventional camera movements yet it never feels disorientating or distracting as the scenes glide with such fluidity and ease. The cinematography on display here isn't that of a David Lean production, no this is a movie which largely takes place in bars and pool halls yet it still has a sense of majesty and scope even if the shot in question is a close up of a drinking glass. Really the only edit I can fault is the very cheesy freeze frame of Paul Newman jumping out of a swimming pool. On the other hand, nobody uses licensed soundtracks better than Martin Scorsese. I get the impression scenes in the film were shot with the music in mind and not as an afterthought. With the opening scene, it feels like Phil Collins' One More Night was specifically composed to fit the mood and tone of the scene.<br/><br/>The Color of Money however is not style over substance. I love the intriguing character triangle of a trio of hustlers as well as the harmony of two generations coming together. Tom Cruise is an actor I only like in certain parts but in roles such as Vincent, a cocky, male fantasy indulging character who embodies the entrepreneurial and capitalistic spirit of the 1980's (like his character in Risky Business), I simply revel in - as Eddie puts it ""a natural character"". Just as impressive are pool shots done by Cruise himself (he performed all but one of his own trick shots); makes me energised to play some pool myself."
"bobsgrock","Null","2","3","9 January 2011"," Newman shines, Cruise dazzles, Scorsese disappoints slightly.
","I understand why Martin Scorsese directed The Color of Money. I just wish this small-time genre picture had been made at a little higher quality. After an attempt to film The Last Temptation of Christ in 1983 failed, Scorsese turned to smaller pictures made at lower budgets in order to get clout with studios. In 1985, he released After Hours, a strange, weirdly entertaining film of one man's wild and crazy night in Soho, New York. The Color of Money couldn't be more different in tone or style, yet it isn't able to conjure up the same energy or driving force After Hours did.<br/><br/>What does work in The Color of Money is the acting. Paul Newman, a legend of the silver screen, reprises his role as ""Fast Eddie"" Felson who is now 25 years older and comes across a young pool player that revives the competitive spirit in him. The player is Vincent, an extremely cocky and self-aware young man with a gorgeous yet somewhat detached girlfriend, Carmen. Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as Vincent, able to capture every amount of arrogance and superiority a young, successful player would have. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is wonderful as well; beautiful, mysterious and with a subtle underside to her character that gives her more of an edge than the main characters.<br/><br/>This, in turn, becomes one of the main problems of the film. What the screenplay lacks is an intriguing setup between Newman and Cruise. Here we have two bonafide stars of the screen, yet it becomes rather obvious what is going to happen in nearly every single scene between them. The generation gap as well as the differing personalities creates such a predictable conflict that the film loses much of its suspense and edge. Another problem is the flashy photography and editing tricks Scorsese utilizes in the pool scenes. More often than not, it probably would have been more effective to simply shoot it straight instead of trying to dress it up with so many effects and techniques. I understand why Scorsese did it this way, to draw in the large audiences to maintain his status. In the end, however, the final result doesn't add up to much of a great entertainment. With all this talent on display, it leaves something to be desired."

","I agree with many things written here about direction, acting, pool shooting etc. What I don't get here is the plot. <br/><br/>The movie seems two consist of two parts which don't really connect, though you'd expect them to. <br/><br/>Fast Eddie took young Vince with him in order to teach him the tactics of losing and winning, with the final goal of betting on him against low odds and making big bucks for everyone. <br/><br/>After a series of hustling scenes, some involving Vince's girlfriend Carmen, Eddie falls for one himself. He becomes over-emotional about it in a way that totally doesn't fit his character so far. Then, against any sense, his frustration leads him to give up on Vince. He yells at Carmen and him to continue to Atlantic City on their own, as he can't teach Vince anything anymore. <br/><br/>At this point of the movie I was SURE that this dramatic move was a part of some big plan that Eddie had, and actually wondered how come Carmen and Vince bought it so easily. But as it turned out... there was no big plan. When they met in Atlantic City I was excepting something really interesting to happen and nothing did. <br/><br/>As the movie ended when Eddie and Vince matching, Eddie saying ""I'm back!"", I thought that perhaps the whole journey was a scam hiding the fact that Eddie was still in good shape. I came here assuming that the FAQ would answer my questions. But nothing? This is just it? Eddie financed the journey just to use Vince's talent for a short while and small money? And then Eddie decided to return playing? Is that all? Disappointed."

","Following on from ""The Hustler"" 1961, Paul Newman re-creates his role as ""Fast"" Eddie Felson, who now appears to be a successful Liquor salesmen after being forced to give up active playing in the first movie. He know is found hanging around Pool Halls staking talented players rather than playing, by all accounts comfortable in terms of earnings and career. Eddie returns as a retired Pool Hustler who finds his new protégé Tom Cruise one night by chance. The movie then speeds up showing the pair hitting the road to ""hustle"" on their way to a big tournament in Vegas. Tom Cruise character the young ""Vincent"" who is called a wonderful flake by Eddie in the movie then turns the tides and hustles his mentor during one of the final scenes. Great acting in this movie and Paul Newman, a quite accomplished player himself does most of his own pool shooting during the movie.<br/><br/>What makes this movie stand out, however, is not merely its tremendous cast, from the central trio to Helen Shaver (Eddie's girlfriend Janelle), John Turturro (Julian, the ""stake horse"" Vincent replaces in Eddie's favor), Scorsese's dog Zoe (credited as ""dog walk-by""!), Iggy Pop, and several top pool players, e.g. Steve ""The Miz"" Mizerak, Jimmy ""Pretty Boy Floyd"" Mataya (together with wife Eva also technical adviser) and Keith McCready (Vincent's nemesis Grady Seasons). Moreover, nobody could have captured the pool halls' dingy allure, a trick shot's swift precision and the balls' movement over the table quite like Michael Ballhaus - there's a reason they call him ""Hollywood's Eye."" And then there's the score, by the ""Band's"" ringleader Robbie Robertson; featuring contributions from a virtual who-is-who of rock and blues's all time greatest, including Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Don Henley, Warren Zevon, Phil Collins, Robert Palmer and Percy Sledge; pointedly framing all key scenes and doubling the edge of the cue balls' and characters' collisions alike. This is a classic acting lesson on how less is more, and I think you can tell from his own growth as an actor that Tom Cruise was either taking notes or has been watching this particular film more often than he has his blockbusters.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
"Magenta_Bob","7","1","1","12 February 2012"," Cool pool movie
","Martin Scorsese's follow-up of sorts to the 1959 film The Hustler finds him in a far less interesting state than usual, but it's a perfectly fine piece of entertainment all the same. Maybe it is hard to make a spectacular film about 9-ball, I don't know. Of course, the film is more about the people than the game.<br/><br/>The main trio in the film – the aging ""hustler"" Eddie Felson (Paul Newman), the hotheaded newcomer (Tom Cruise) and his tough girlfriend (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) – is a setup we have seen in a thousand movies, but they all play their parts as great as they possible could. Dramaturgically there's not much new going on either, except that the film might have an unusually long stretch of setbacks and people getting mad at each other. But despite Newman's arguments with the couple, the film never really hits a nerve or feels very exciting, possibly with the exception of a certain revelation in a hotel room.<br/><br/>Stylistically, The Color of Money is sort of a precursor to Goodfellas and Casino, inasmuch as a film about pool can be so. The camera hovers around pool halls, there are long tracking shots of billiard balls in which Paul Newman can see his mirror image, and there are fast cuts between cool breaks. And the smoky, jukeboxy soundtrack is definitely classic Scorsese ground (except less interesting). All in all, it's a solid film, and as a moderate fan of playing pool, I do derive some pleasure from seeing those cool breaks."
"ElMaruecan82","7","1","1","11 October 2011"," The movie works like ""Hustling"" but with reverse effects ...
","Paul Newman is back to the green table to win more and more green billets, but let me ask you something, do you really need colors to know what the color of money is? <br/><br/>Paul Newman was ""The Hustler"" in a masterpiece of character study, now he's the stake-horse and Tom Cruise's mentor in the sequel directed by Martin Scorsese. Why Scorsese? Well, Robert Rossen's film was a psychological introspection into the concepts of winning and losing, whose effects ultimately alienated Eddie's life. The thirst for victory was Eddie's obsession, and as many tragic antiheroes, it was only through after a tragedy that his soul could find redemption. In a way, ""The Hustler"" carried many Scorsesian undertones through this theme of guilt and redemption, so cherished by Marty, so it's only poetic justice if he directed the sequel.<br/><br/>But the question is 'did the movie ever need a sequel?' I'm not asking because I didn't like the story, but I liked it less as a sequel. As an independent film featuring Paul Newman and Tom Cruise in a mentor/disciple relationship, the film was OK in my book and provided many spectacular shots. The color of money was one thing, but these balls kicking each other kicked ass, and provided the artistic touch of the film. But as a sequel, a few things really connected this movie to its glorious predecessor, to the point I wondered why they felt the need to name Paul Newman's character Eddie Felson. After all, no reference to Bert Gordon, to Minnesota Fats, to SARAH for God's sake! All these characters sank into oblivion and any attempt to resurrect an ounce of the past vanished in favor of the plot that sinned by its unoriginality, not as a sequel time time, but as a Scorsese film.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is among my favorite directors, but I'm glad I'm not blinded enough not to differentiate between what I believe to be his great and his more average work. I think he was at the top of his game in the 80's with such powerful dramas as ""Raging Bull"", ""The King of Comedy"", ""After Hours"", with such a streak, ""The Color of Money"" should have been a winner, but a winner, it ain't. It' doesn't take a great director and actor to make a film, you need a story, and whatever the original intent was, I fail to see what the insights the movie was supposed to provide were, let alone on Felson whose story arc was satisfyingly closed, so I guess the central character was supposed to be Cruise as Vincent  why not? But as I was waiting for the coming-of-age aspect to finally redeem Vincent, the ending didn't give him much more depth. It's like Vincent embodied the pretentious premise of the film, that just because it's Newman, Scorsese, Cruise, Eddie Felson and pool, the mix would automatically work.<br/><br/>Take the game that was the basis of the plot, the 9-shot, nothing against it, but when you consider the rules, you realize how short and nonstrategic it feels, as stated in the opening sentence, its all about luck, right, even luck is art, but I didn't see that in the film. The whole thing was like ""Pool for Dummies"", quick, noisy, flamboyant, the film could have even been about bowling, all flash with no substance. And even the smallest attempt to rationalize and to see the film through the relationship between Eddie and Vincent doesn't work, Vince is too cocky and pretentious to make his appeal to Eddie believable, he's nothing like Eddie in ""The Hustler"" not even by the 80's standards, and I wonder if the film wouldn't have been more interesting with the character played by Forest Whitaker.<br/><br/>Eddie is so better than Vincent that it's not that we can't believe, we don't even want to believe. The movie tries to show Eddie as a character with some wound to conceal, but if it ever was the case, nothing came at the end to reward our patience. And it's a pity, because the actors did a fine job, and I want to mention the great performance by Mary Elizabeth Mastroianno, as the sexy manipulative girlfriend Carmen, now there was a character on the same caliber than Gordon, or Fats, but at the end, it's like her potential is underused, not even for a sentimental dilemma that exceeds the limits of the green table.<br/><br/>What was wrong with Marty? When you consider ""Raging Bull"", on the surface the movie is a repetition of the same behavior that gets so annoying it gets on our nerves, but it needed the performance of De Niro and the devouring torment of his jealousy to transcend the banality of his character and elevate it to the level of an iconic performance of anger and jealousy. Vince is simply too immature and Eddie too tired to reach that level of intensity, and if only Carmen could inspire a ""Did you (you know) my wife"" scene, I'm serious, this is the kind of savor that was cruelly missing in the film.<br/><br/>And to conclude, where was the final confrontation between Eddie and Vince, was it too much asking for? Even ""The Hustler"" didn't avoid this mandatory conclusion, because this is what we all expect, do we really need to accept Eddie's ""I'm back"" for granted? We know he's back but it's time for him to get back to the action, to be the player, not the thinker. That ending seemed too deliberately cool to be believable and makes the whole films look like a long passionless pool game, without even playing the black at the end. <br/><br/>Not a bad film, it had the atmosphere, the colors, the flash, the direction, but the film works like 'hustling', with reverse effects ..."

"nadiamente","6","1","1","9 April 2005"," Either you've seen ""The Hustler"" or you haven't
","There are two possible reviews that could be written about this film; two kinds, that is. One kind comes from somebody who's never seen ""The Hustler"" (1961), who's main character, Fast Eddie Felson, played by Paul Newman, is here reprised and replayed by the same actor, after 25 years has gone by, in a new script. I'm curious to read a review of this kind. I've seen ""The Hustler"" and rank it very high on my list of great films. So I can only write a review of this other kind. If you know the story from ""Hustler"" (and love it), how can you not be interested in what happens to Fast Eddie later in life? I was immediately aware of the extension of ideas (money, excellence, honor, pride, and deceit) from ""The Hustler"" and curious to see where Scorsese would take them. I think he's true to the time period: the clothing (and Vince's hair!), the music (very 80's), and the shift of values (as compared to 60s; e.g. cocaine replacing alcohol). Fast Eddie is also true to his age (and former excellence as a hustler). It feels like he's inherited a bit of Bert (from ""The Hustler), a festering bitterness and pride, which reemerges when he meets Vince. I actually liked Tom Cruise as the innocent Vince and thought he played him perfectly. I winced to see him lose that innocence, which is probably what the film means to do. Mastroantonio is also pretty fabulous and yet no where near as cognizant and complex as Piper Laurie's character in ""The Hustler."" In that respect, this film is not as ""cool"" as ""The Hustler."" To credit Scorsese, he avoids trying to make a film as cool or similar in look to the original. Also, this movie does not attempt to gloss over Fast Eddie's faults (indeed it focuses on them intensely), and it doesn't mean to have him come to some redemption (although he does return to some of his former glory as a pool player). For me, my interest in the development of the story hinges upon my knowledge of what happened in ""The Hustler."" There was no way I could separate this fact from my judgement of the movie. I was disappointed only in so far that I wasn't watching ""The Hustler"" instead; and that's unfair to this movie. So, I don't know how this movie stands on its own. Try to imagine a movie about Rick, reprised by Bogart, from ""Casablanca"" 25 years later, called ""The Taste of Defeat"" when he's living in Paris, bloated from drink and lamenting the loss of swing jazz and, alas, his only love,Ilsa, etc etc."

For the mavens in Tinseltown, it was getting a definitive answer to one of the most elusive mysteries in the biz -- can an actor well past his prime ""revisit"" one of his greatest roles (actually one of the greatest performances ever set to celluloid, period) after a lay-off of 25 years, and still deliver the goods? Recall (assuming you are a fight fan) that Ali could never, even after just a few years on the sidelines, bring back the speed and the snap he had BEFORE he was suspended. Frankly, you have to give Newman credit for even attempting to bring Fast Eddie back to life. Did he succeed? If you are looking for a definitive answer from me, I don't have one. I will say that the attempt, while on the one hand heroic, was at the very same time a serious cautionary tale for any actor thinking of trying the same stunt. The tone and direction were different. And the financial guys, the suits, did what they always do in this sort of situation, they threw in a younger guy as ""insurance"" to make sure the film didn't flop while waiting for the geriatrics to show up on the wheelchair ramp. (They needn't have bothered, this is possibly Tom Cruise's worst performance next to FAR AND AWAY and completely forgettable). If you are a film fan, and you have seen HUSTLER, oh, maybe six or twenty times, then you owe it to yourself to check our this longshot. Otherwise, give it a pass."

","Not a good movie. In the book, Fast Eddie gets Minnesota Fats to coach him in making his comeback. The Tom Cruise character did not exist (and was completely unnecessary). Jackie Gleason was still alive when they made this, but may have been too old to reprise his role as Fats.<br/><br/>The main problem is that Newman and Cruise do not connect. Cruise's acting is false and over-the-top and his character is just not credible. The pool sequences are well done but it is a lack-lustre movie overall.<br/><br/>While Paul Newman is good in the role, it is not an Oscar-worthy performance. The Academy must simply have decided that it was Newman's turn to get an Oscar.<br/><br/>So why did The Hustler work where this sequel does not? For a start, The Hustler had a much better screenplay, including some great quotable lines.

All of this information that i've just given sounds good. But really,to tell you the truth, it's kind of disappointing.<br/><br/>I never saw The Hustler. I'm sure it was better. I know it was nominated for Oscars, including best movie and best actor(Paul Newman,who won for the sequel). I'm sure the original was great,but the sequel is lacking something. Luckily, if you decide to see it without seeing the original, you won't be lost. But the point of my review is to tell you not to see it.<br/><br/>Newman plays Eddie,the hustler. He decides to take in an expert in pool(Tom Cruise) to what it seems is help become a success. But what Eddie really takes him in for is for his girlfriend.<br/><br/>That's all I got out of it. It's not that there's anything wrong with The Color of money. Except the fact that Tom Cruise is kind of annoying. But there's nothing exactly good about it either. Well, I misworded. There are a few problems.<br/><br/>For one, Tom Cruise, who's grown on me recently, gives an annoying performance. His girlfriend, I don't remember her name but she got a nomination for this film, is kind of annoying too. I also don't think there is anything too special about it.<br/><br/>You'd think that when you'd have three great people like Scorsese,Newman,and Cruise, then they'd make a good team. Wrong. The Color of money is a failure in my opinion. Newman is well,and they gave him the Oscar cause he didn't win it for the first film.<br/><br/>This is Scorsese's worst too. I mean it doesn't compare to Goodfellas, Casino, Raging bull, Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed, or even Shutter island(which I think is one of the best films of the year). Forgive and forget. That's what I always say.<br/><br/>Scorsese and the rest of the world have forgiven and forgotten about The Color of money. But at the end of The Color of money, you'l forget too. Lots of great directors have had a few bad movies. Such as Ang Lee(Hulk), Richard Attenbourough(Cry freedom), and in Scorsese's case, The Color of money.

Cruise is effective as a hot prospect with ""too much cojones' and not enough brains"", as is Mastrantonio in the role of Cruise's street-smart girlfriend. There are so many memorable scenes and lines from this one that just rattle around in my head years after the last time I've seen it. Excellent and lasting blues score.

Paul Newman is great and is the glue that holds this film together.
Tom Cruise not so much .

If he acted like that in real pool halls in the US ( or here in the UK) he'd more often than not find himself in deep trouble.<br/><br/>Another downside is that this has that mid 1980's look about it .

Cruise however doesnt wanna cheat at first, he just wants to win. He wants to show off that he is the very best at his game. And Tom Cruise's personality is perfectly casted for this role of a superficial, boisterous young pool talent. And he is great at being just that character. <br/><br/>Paul Newman is magnificent in his performance of an old desillusioned hussler at playing fixed pool games.

1. Manipulation. In order to make money in some professions people use manipulation. For example in this movie pool players when playing with opponent would on purpose lose a few times until they stake more and then they would win. So, like Newman said it is important to learn how to lose as well. 
Also he said since Tom Cruise acts very childishly, no one takes him seriously, so he can fool them even further.
2. Interesting quote from Newman, which basically says that if you do something very well then money will just come to you. (Glavnoe eto chto to umet, i ne prosto umet, a lucse vsex ostalnyx. Togda dengi ne problema, ix nuzhno tolko vziat.)"

","""The Color of Money"" stars Paul Newman as Fast Eddie Felson, an experienced snooker player who leads his protégé, Vincent Lauria, played by a young Tom Cruise, to the wonders of pool hustling. <br/><br/>Beware of your expectations. If it was directed by a newcomer or an unknown, this movie would pass as enjoyable and above-average. When one finds out, however, that Martin Scorsese is behind the cameras, that is not enough. Consequently, the overall result is a tad frustrating. Scorsese, here, is a victim of his own success.<br/><br/>Arguably, this is one of Scorsese's most conventional movies. For a start, the plot is disappointingly predictable. From the very beginning, we are able to foretell that Felson would pick Vincent as his protégé, that they would eventually split up, and that the two of them would have their final showdown. By the way, that last aspect is what keeps the audience invested through the whole movie. Precisely because of that, the ending is frustrating. Albeit Scorsese's intention is evident, I'm pretty sure the public would opt for a different finale.<br/><br/>Having said that, these downsides don't prevent the movie from being a pleasure ride and from leaving a good impression. Newman, Cruise, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (who plays Claire, Vincent's girlfriend) all deliver fascinating performances - especially Newman, whose work granted him his only Oscar.<br/><br/>The movie also benefits from a well-constructed character development, as all the main personalities include confidence, vulnerability, and reluctance. Felsen is a shrewd, charming, and strategist man, which contrasts with his late lack of confidence, frustration and lost of control. In turn, Vincent is at the same time tender, cocky, and impulsive - carpe diem seems to be his tacit motto. Finally, Mastrantonio's Claire is enigmatic and enticing, with a strong personality and an intriguing background. <br/><br/>The technical issues are also worth praising. Scorsese's good taste when it comes to music is there. The camera-work and editing are unsurprisingly excellent, as that's where lies more vividly the director's touch. <br/><br/>""The Color of Money"" doesn't rank among Scorsese's best works, but it is still worth watching. Apart from its predictability and the lack of a decent payoff, the movie offers great interpretations and riveting characters. <br/><br/>Vote: 7,5."

I think it's far from the best work of any of the talent involved, but it is an enjoyable movie. Newman deservedly won the Oscar and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio lights up the screen.

","With seven Academy Award nominations, it appeared that Paul Newman, at age 60, might end his career in the ranks of top Hollywood entertainers never to have won an Oscar. In his case, it included leading actor roles in six films and as director of one. Five of the acting roles and his only director nomination were up against stiff competition. But, he won the best actor Oscar for this 1986 film. Never mind that it was a year with not much competition for best actor. But for Ben Kingsley's ""Gandhi"" in 1982, Newman would have won an Oscar that year for his role in ""The Verdict.""<br/><br/>Newman is very good as Fast Eddie Felson. ""The Color of Money"" is very good but nowhere near great, as are some other films of 1986 – ""Platoon,"" ""The Mission,"" ""A Room with a View."" But only one actor from those top films was nominated for best actor (William Hurt, for ""Children of a Lesser God""). Except for Hurt's film, the others with best actor nominations were all lesser known films of the year. The performances by the best actor nominees probably was very good, but without any other big names from big films, this might just have been a year when the Academy made a sentimental choice. <br/><br/>The film also stars a very young Tom Cruise who, in just the past couple of years had scored a couple of blockbuster films. So, he clearly was on his way to stardom and top billing, very soon. The rest of the cast are fine in this film. It's a movie about pool shooting. It has some nice moments of drama, but otherwise drags a little in places. Naturally, there's a considerable amount of time showing pool games. Those who like to play pool or billiards should enjoy this film. Most of those who don't care for pool probably will find the movie slow or boring.<br/><br/>It's nice that Paul Newman won his Oscar for this film. He was a top entertainer for a few decades – though not one of the great actors, or best entertainers. He was one of the best humanitarians, and many fans appreciated him as much for his genuine charity and goodwill. <br/><br/>See this film if you like to shoot pool, or like Paul Newman or Tom Cruise.

The Color of Money kicks off with much more ballsy tone, really talking a lot about the game itself, and masterfully introducing the characters between the clacking of the balls and swooshing of the sticks. Scorsese goes very artsy with the camera angels and it gets a bit tiresome and feels a bit too intentional twisting and turning here and there, but overall the film is shot solid. Still, the biggest issue comes with the characters; you feel like you're almost there with Paul Newman, watching as he ""plays"" the kid and ""plays"" the girl, but it turns out that he's actually one step behind you in the end, which is a bit of a shame in the end. You'd want Paul to be the cleverest of them all, you'd want him beat that snotty annoying Cruise kid, but in the end, he is pleading for the last game and he gets hacked by Whitaker and he gets played by Cruise. Yes, he gets his say in the end, but still it doesn't feel somewhat satisfactory enough. Somehow, the characters end up in weird places and the development feels a bit off.

It's not just his music either - ALL the music in this movie is fantastic and strategically placed.<br/><br/>Fast Eddie Felson(Newman) notices Vince right away, ""that kids got a sledge-hammer break"".<br/><br/>Paul Newman is FANTASTIC in this movie. The writing, the music, the acting - all superb.<br/><br/>Those who never saw ""the Hustler"" can appreciate this film on it's own, but some of the subtleties and references to Fast Eddie Felson carry a little more weight(as does the ending) if you have. We don't need an explanation of what happened to Fast Eddie Felson from 1961 to 1985(we get the idea), but I think the entire meaning of this film is lost if the viewer doesn't understand the arc of Paul Newman's character from the ending of ""the Hustler"" to the ending of ""the Color of Money"". I think the single biggest reason that this film is scored where it is - is that the ending of this film is rather abrupt and anti-climactic. For that matter, so was the ending from ""The Hustler"", but ""the Hustler"" doesn't appear to suffer from it on IMDb. Another reason may be because of Tom Cruise. Cruise is amazing here, but Cruise has become the ""Dallas Cowboy"" of acting. The actor we love to hate. A lot of people snarl or misjudge a film solely because it stars Tom Cruise. The character of Vince is just as easy to dislike.<br/><br/>Just the fact that MI4:Ghost Protocol is scored higher on this website makes me cringe.<br/><br/>I don't think there was a better person for the role. One of my favorite lines of the film is when Eddie says, ""Don't change the shirt - it's a nice touch"".... or earlier when he says, ""you've got the flake, you've got that down pat, but can you flake on and flake off, I don't know"". The dialog here is superbly written and each actor is perfectly cast.<br/><br/>Eddie sees Vince as an opportunity. An opportunity to make money? Yes, but more like an opportunity to pick up where he(Eddie) left off so many years ago, when he was 'put out of the business' so-to-speak.<br/><br/>I just want this movie to keep going.<br/><br/>Each character is well-developed. John Turturro is great, and there are other strong supporting roles from a few lesser-known but no less talented actors like Helen Shaver and Bill Cobbs.<br/><br/>The shots in and around the poolhalls reek of realism, and all the betting and play is choreographed expertly.<br/><br/>While the ending is abrupt - it contains a nice little twist that is extremely effective and really dials into the meaning of this film.<br/><br/>Is this better than ""The Hustler""? No. Is it better than the 6.8 ranking here? Heck yea it is! I think that some people forget that this really is a sequel. How many films do this? Create a sequel 25 years later? An effective one at that? Anyone that has seen ""the Hustler"" and ""the Color of Money"" leaves this film with a really good idea of what happened to Fast Eddie over the last 25 years, and the next 25 to come.<br/><br/>Bill Cobbs(Orvis) says, ""Do you know who you have stake-horsing here for you - this here's Fast Eddie Felson"". You almost have to see ""the Hustler"" to have a true appreciation and under-standing of ""The Color of Money"".<br/><br/>UNDERRATED!<br/><br/>87/100<br/><br/>There's also a few shots in here that are absolutely mesmerzing - the kind you have to wonder how in the heck Martin pulled them off."
"The-Sarkologist","8","0","0","18 November 2011"," A character study of a pool shark
","This is a very interesting movie as it is a character study of a former pool shark named Eddie who has given up playing pool and has become a liquor salesman. He sees another very good pool player, Vince, and decides to mould him into what he once was. The problem is that Vince is a hot headed youth who is more concerned with showing off how great he is rather than listening to Eddie's advice.<br/><br/>The problem is that Eddie is trying to create a replica of himself and constantly becomes frustrated with the fact that Vince does not seem to listen to his advice. He struggles with this through the movie, almost giving up a number of times, and finally comes to the realisation that Vince is not him but another person. The final line is ""I'm back,"" which shows us that he has had his epiphany and has realised that he is the only one who can be him.<br/><br/>Eddie wants to use Vince's skills to make a lot of money for himself, as well as Vince. Though Vince wants to make the money, he is a hot headed youth who would rather show off his skills. We see this when Eddie tells him not to play this one guy as the guy is the best pool player in town, and those who beat this pool player will not play him. He does it and learns that he must leave town because this guy does not want to have somebody better than him around the place. Vince tries to follow Eddie's instructions, but every time he does he seems to do something wrong. This is not because he is failing, but rather because he is not Eddie. Instead, he is Vince and is his own personality.<br/><br/>The epiphany comes during the pool championships in Atlantic City. Vince looses to Eddie purposely because of the money that he would make. Eddie believes that he is better than Vince until Vince walks into his room and throws $8000 into Eddie's lap and tells him that he threw the game for this purpose. At this stage Eddie decided that his goal was not to train Vince to be like him but to beat Vince. This is to humble Vince and to show that he is not the greatest.<br/><br/>Vince also grows during the movie. He at first relies heavily on Eddie, but at one stage Eddie vanishes when Vince decides to throw a game because he is sympathetic towards one particular player. Vince learns here that even the most retched looking player is a sinister scoundrel that will rip him apart. He also learns that sympathy is not something that somebody has if they want to make money because even the most pathetic looking person is able to twist their opponents around to make them look susceptible.<br/><br/>Eddie learns this as well when he is playing a guy in another pool hall that claims that all of his winnings are due to luck. Eddie works on a system of throwing a few games and then reaping the rewards and he believes that he is the only person who does this until it is done on him. Eddie is old and realises that because of this he is out of touch. The first realisation occurs when he enters a pool hall that has closed a long time ago.<br/><br/>Eddie and Vince constantly grow during the movie showing a lot of thought going into this movie as it progresses. I felt that Casino was much better, but this movie has a lot more depth than does Casino. Scorsese seems to have a style that creates characters who venture into the world and learn to grow into it. This is not like Casino, but it is very much the focus of this movie. The movie has a very dingy and sleazy look to it, but the character slowly grow into people that they were not like at the beginning of the movie. Vince is a hot headed youth who wants to show off his skill but comes to learn that this earns him enmity rather than money. Eddie is an old man believing that his pool playing days are over, but realises that he must return to his old self to beat Vince.<br/><br/>This is a good movie. The characters have depth, personality, and most importantly growth. Vince grows up and Eddie learns that he cannot get around manipulating people, but rather must be sympathetic to their needs."
"mjneu59","6","0","0","12 November 2010"," stylish but unnecessary sequel
","Paul Newman slips comfortably into the familiar role of Fast Eddie Felson in this belated sequel to the 1961 pool room classic 'The Hustler'. Now older and wiser, Eddie begins grooming an arrogant, immature upstart (Tom Cruise, naturally) for pool hustling stardom, but is unwilling to pass the torch when his pupil's talent begins to eclipse his own. It all ends, of course, in a showdown between mentor and protégé at the championship games in Atlantic City, but the expected climax is missing, and the lack of peripheral characters leaves Newman and Cruise in a high profile vacuum. Martin Scorsese can be excused for attempting to bolster his commercial credentials by agreeing to direct this rather conventional surrogate father/son bonding drama, but at least he injects the film with enough style to make it consistently interesting. A lot of the credit properly belongs to ace cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, who does some amazing things with camera and cue ball."
"random_avenger","6","0","0","11 August 2010"," The Color of Money
","""Fast Eddie"" Felson (Paul Newman) is an aging liquor salesman and retired billiards professional who spots the talent of a cocky young player Vincent (Tom Cruise) and offers to teach him to be an even better player. With his girlfriend Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), Vincent accepts the offer and the trio begins a long road trip touring many pool halls across the country, with Vincent winning and losing intentionally to create a specific reputation and to hustle more money than he would gain otherwise. Eventually Eddie also finds his long lost knack for the game.<br/><br/>Paul Newman's natural charisma carries the film with ease, but the movie is not without its problems. Tom Cruise's overflowing energy and self-confidence are an intentional part of his character's style, sure, but I feel he is overdoing the cockiness to the point of being just irritating. The third main character Carmen is left more in the background but Mastrantonio looks rather fragile for such a role, as the vibe I was getting from her character was more rough and experienced than the innocent-looking actress could convey. The supporting actors do a good job though, such as Forest Whitaker as an unexpectedly good pool shark Amos and John Turturro as an antagonistic rival to Eddie and Vincent.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me about the film was the restless camera-work. There is a lot of movement: turning, zooming, tracking, some quick cuts – something I found distracting. In certain scenes it works fine though, such as during the spinning long take of Vincent's game against Moselle (Bruce A. Young). The other pool playing scenes are mostly well done too, especially during the finale at the big tournament.<br/><br/>The Color of Money may not be Scorsese's best film by a long shot, but it is entertaining alright and contains some exciting billiards scenes, so fans of the game ought to check it out. The drama, namely the development of the relationship between young Vincent and the father figure-like Eddie works well enough too. 'A decent film, but no masterpiece' is my verdict."
"mark-whait","10","0","0","31 December 2009"," Scorcese and Newman hustle pays off
","Film maestro Martin Scorcese will be remembered in years to come for his gangster films, but The Color Of Money is right up there with his best offerings and is a classic film. It centres on Paul Newman reprising his role of 'Fast' Eddie Felson that he originally undertook in 1961 for The Hustler. Only this time Felson has found a sensational new protégé in Vincent Lauria, played by Tom Cruise. Quite simply, the film is magnificent, especially the first half, with Newman in blistering, Oscar-winning form. Nobody plays boozy anti-heroes quite like Newman, only this time Felson is well off and affluent and is living a comfortable life as a liquor seller. Interestingly as well, Cruise is fabulous, and this is about the last movie he made before he became an overnight sensation and international megastar. But you can see his talent in every scene, and he bounces off Newman's brilliance with ease. Cruise's talent is that he makes his schoolboy-immature character of Vincent ultimately likable, displaying his vulnerabilities. Some of Newman's lines in the opening hour are classics, and Scorcese's constant use of zoom in close ups is beguiling rather than irritating. The film is also tremendously lit, and some of the seedy pool halls are gloriously presented. A masterclass from all concerned, and this film is one of the best movies ever made."
"alainenglish","7","0","0","3 April 2008"," Great, poignant sequel to ""The Hustler""
","The Eighties, in a trend that seems to be repeating itself this decade, saw a raft of sequels to hugely popular movies, one or two of which were to films made more than twenty years previously. One of was ""The Colour of Money"". It features an iconic film character in Fast Eddie Felson, is shot in colour where the original was shot in black and white and for both these reasons offers a very poignant portrayal of this character in showing him in a new light.<br/><br/>When we last saw Fast Eddie Felson (essayed once again by the great Paul Newman) he left the game after deciding that the ruthless business of big-time pool playing was simply not for him. Since then, he's gone into selling whisky and being the backer for one or two minor-league pool players. Despite this, he still hasn't picked up a cue in over twenty years. Eddie encounters Vincent (Tom Cruise), a young pool player who reminds him of what he used to be. Thinking he might be onto a good thing, he takes Vincent and his girlfriend Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) to a big-time pool competition in Atlantic City, coaching the young man on how to be the best. But watching Vincent in action rekindles Eddie's passion for pool, with dramatic consequences...<br/><br/>The drama is paced very differently this time out, and is brilliant in that it brings the character of Fast Eddie Felson full circle. You don't really have to be familiar with ""The Hustler"" to enjoy ""The Color of Money"" but if you are, it really enhances the viewing experience. It is interesting watching the conflicting triumvirate of Eddie, Vincent and Carmen as Eddie not only coaches Vincent but also coaches Carmen on how to coach Vincent.<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorcese seems to enjoy the pool playing parts of the movie even more than ""The Hustler"" director Robert Rossen, with the camera taking the view-point of both the cue-ball and the nine-ball, and delighting in the fast-moving action on the table. There are some terrific trick shots on show here, and the full-colour cinematography works better for the game of pool than black and white. The film has a fantastic soundtrack that captures the atmosphere of the pool halls and also the journey of Eddie himself.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is well-cast as the cocksure Vincent, even his incessant grinning becomes downright irritating at times. Mastrantonia is sexy and streetwise as his girlfriend Carmen, a woman far wiser than her boyfriend but sympathetic to his sweetness. There are some great supporting roles from John Turturro as the hapless player Julian, Keith McReady as the slimy pool champion Grady Seasons and a young Forest Whitaker as hustler Amos.<br/><br/>But the film belongs to Paul Newman as Fast Eddie, winning an Oscar for the role this time out (he was previously nominated for ""The Hustler""). He believably portrays the same man and the character's journey from manipulating Vincent for his own ends to playing him to regain his self-respect, is mesmerising. He's played Butch Cassidy, Hud and Cool Hand Luke but Fast Eddie is far and away his definitive signature role.<br/><br/>""The Color of Money"" is a great sequel and a fantastic sporting drama.<br/><br/>Recommended."

","First off I have not yet seen ""The Hustler"". But i'm told by fans of the Hustler that ""the Color of Money"" is a turd compared to that film. I was taken aback by this because I found ""color"" to be a freaking sweet movie loaded with awesome pool scenes, well done performances and bravo direction by martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>I will admit that I have a feeling that Paul Newman might have won sort of an 'apology Oscar' for this film because I get the feeling he was even better in the Hustler than he is here. I am not saying he wasn't Oscar worthy in ""color"", because he was. He makes a great pairing with Cruise and the film's best scenes are when Newman's teaching Cruise how to perfect his craft and become a champion like he used to be.<br/><br/>This sequel is the best kind of sequel there can be: energetic, engrossing, unpredictable at times, and most importantly an interesting story that stands on its own. Like I said, i haven't seen the Hustler yet and I loved this film as it is. Also featuring songs from Robie Robertson, Eric Clapton, mark knopher and Don Henley, ""the Color of Money"" is a fine film that didn't even need to be associated with The Hustler to be a good film. check it out."

Although, the pool hall settings and Scorsese's direction make it a whole lot cooler than a movie about bingo. <br/><br/>Scorsese's direction has never been better or more unselfconscious. The camera work is beautiful and intricate, but it never distract's your attention from the movie itself.<br/><br/>Frankly, this movie is just cool, very entertaining and highly re-watchable.

","My interpretation of this scene was that Forest Whitaker's character was referencing Minnesota Fats from the Hustler. I checked the other posts and didn't see any corroboration, so I was just wondering if anyone else thought the same. Am I just extrapolating too much or was there a relation? Fast Eddie Felson was probably quite a legend around pool halls and amongst hustlers so I thought the irony of the situation, assuming it was the intended meaning, was quite interesting. Also, I simply can't agree with some of the posts that say that Fast Eddie intentionally lost to Whitaker to get rid of Vince. That doesn't make any sense considering Eddie's need for glasses and his being quite out of practice, i.e. the whole montage that follows, as well as the ultimate theme of the film being Eddie's redemption and resumption of the game of which he was once the king. His anger and frustration at losing appeared too genuine and there wasn't anything in the film that suggested an alternative motive in losing. Thoughts??"

","The Color of Money profiles the business partnership between pool guru Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) and his protégé Vincent (Tom Cruise) as he learns the nuts and bolts of pool hustling. It's a beautifully written movie, with crisp and believable dialog, and a wonderfully entertaining premise. This is one of the best 80s movies in terms of intelligence and character balance, and Tom Cruise and Paul Newman play off of one another fabulously. Where most master-student movies are unabashedly sentimental after the tough guy veneer has been peeled back, the relationship between Vincent and Eddie remains Platonic and business-like, and lends to the believability of Newman's character. The scene in which Eddie and Carmen are in the hotel room in which he pretends to go after her, only to call her bluff, as she flaunts herself sexually is incredibly brilliant and offers a chance for Eddie to philosophize on the ""business,""--showing himself to be a classy hustler, if ever there was such a kind, not subject to the average man's appetites or common temptations. He is no washed up has-been. He is no down-on-his-luck self-pitying dreg. From Eddie's character, we see a complex optimist (without being campy) who is comfortable in the most banal of circumstances, and whose street education gives him the unique ability to see the potential in any situation. As far as character movies go, this one offers a great balance of development and story. Newman's performance is flawless. And the obnoxious, juvenile charm of Vincent is a benchmark of Tom Cruise's earlier film credits."

","Excellent film about a veteran pool hustler (Paul Newman) who eyes, mentors and develops a young but extremely talented hot-shot player (Tom Cruise).

Felson shows his young protégé the hustler credo: ""That money won is twice as sweet as money earned"".

","Truly, I haven't seen much of Martin Scorsese's filmography, but I have heard he's great and has never been recognized. One day I'll catch all of his directed films. In this ""catching"" process, I had the chance to watch ""The Color of Money"", which should be important for reasons as: the movie that gave Paul Newman's his first and only Academy Award; or the very good performances and character development.<br/><br/>As soon as the movie opens, there's a guy talking (Martin Scorsese, wow) about a game, but, for some reason, you can also sense he's talking about life. Paul Newman's performance is splendid. He creates a man that has lived too much, but enjoys life and just wants to live it until the end. We watch him: he seems like any other man. We listen to him: he knows things the rest doesn't. He has a normal job, but also invests; in excellence, we learn. When someone asks him about his excellence, he declares: ""I study people's character"".<br/><br/>Vincent's excellence is pool. 9-Ball, to be accurate. When he and Eddie (Newman) meet, he's just a player. A pure player who makes some money playing, but doesn't know he could make much more. There's a world he doesn't know. As Eddie invests in excellence, he wants to take Vincent on a tour. Cities, tournaments...Money. Maybe it's all about money. Eddie is, or was, a player, we realize, and we learn. He will try to teach Vincent the secrets of the game, how to do it.<br/><br/>And Carmen. Well, she is the center. She's Vincent girlfriend (""We've been together for a year""). She met him when she was robbing his house. Vincent loves her, and decides to join the tour because he's afraid of loosing her. Does Carmen love Vincent? Maybe. There's also the chance that she loves him for the money she can make with him. But she says good things about him all the time. I think they're both really in love, and that this journey tests their love.<br/><br/>This journey is about achieving the human sides of the people involved in it. It's great to hear a script talking about persons with pure knowledge about some special things. This is a character piece in every way and the greatest time you'll probably have it watching that part (if ""that"" isn't just the whole piece). Yes, it is also about the game, but not that much. Because first they have to reach a human level before they can get to the game.<br/><br/>Now, about the supporting performances (because there are other performances but not as deep and not as important). I like to think that there was a time when Tom Cruise could act, and wasn't much of an image. I mean, in the last years he did some good roles, but not that good; Come on! He has this habit; he screams when he's trying to show some emotion. It really works, or at least, worked here and in ""Jerry Maguire"" (probably his best performance). He's fine here, he was still an actor at that time, and chose good roles. The truth is I don't like him very much, but sometimes he can really work it out.<br/><br/>Mastrantonio is calmed in her role. Calmed and natural. An excellent performance. I would say that her character is rational and intelligent. She wants something more exciting, and she needs to find it.<br/><br/>I loved Forest Whitaker cameo as Amos, had to say it.<br/><br/>There's one scene, when Vincent is playing against a guy, and the camera starts to move in circles, showing Newman's face in a background, and also showing alternate faces of all the characters. The camera is looking for emotion.<br/><br/>That's character film-making."

""Money won is twice as sweet as money earned"" Oscar winner Paul Newman gives us yet another wonderful performance as Fast Eddie Felson back from his early retirement and thirsty for the feeling of youth the game brings back to him. He finds Young Vincent (Tom Cruise) in a bar and grabs hold of this young phenom in hopes it will get him back in action. He sees the gift he once had in the game, and brings Vincent the experience the years have giving him in return.

"oguk","Null","5","16","7 December 2003"," Good start but fizzles
","The film starts well, setting up the tension between Eddie, Vince and Carmen on several levels: age, sex, greed, love.  Eddie is the worldly-wise experienced ex-pool shark; Vince has brash talent and ""character""; Carmen has a bit of larceny in her recent past; all three have ambitions.  They hit the road to make the most of Vince's talent, aiming for a national tournament in Atlantic City, with Eddie supplying money and aiming to teach Vince how to work the game for the most payoff.  But the story fizzles after Eddie loses his own pool match with another player (played by Forrest Whittaker), prompting a personal crisis of motivation.  The rest of the movie loses focus as it follows Eddie and drops most of the interesting themes it had started with.  Paul Newman is always a consummate actor, no complaints here; and the young Tom Cruise is convincing as the hot-shot, naive, not-to-bright talent.  The movie doesn't make as good use of Mary Mastrantonio as it could have - again, it starts with some nice potential for her character but then abandons it.  Hard to put thumbs down entirely on this movie, but overall it was a disappointment.  Eventually I'll have to see The Hustler and see what that was all about."

The 2nd half was just as good as the 1st in my opinion, and I believe Newman truly deserved his Oscar here as he deserved it in The Hustler as well, plus him and Cruise had wonderful chemistry together. Some of the pool shots Cruise made blew me away, and while both Newman's and Cruise's characters were jerks, I just couldn't help but love them, plus Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is excellent as Cruise's girlfriend. The pool match between Newman and Cruise was excellent! and dare I say Cruise deserved an Oscar nomination??, plus this should be much higher then 6.8 in my opinion. I actually felt bad when Forest Whitaker's character hustled Eddie, and Martin Scorsese did a masterful job of directing as always, plus it's actually very unpredictable throughout, as I had no clue on what was going to happen next!.<br/><br/>This is one of Cruise's best performances, and I was so impressed with how Newman, was able to play Eddie so easily after not playing him since the 60's with the Hustler, plus I think this film is quite underrated myself!. For a sequel, you can't get much better then this, and all the characters were extremely likable, plus Cruise's likable cockiness was perfect for this part!. It's extremely well made and written, and I thought the dialog was awesome, plus it had some great emotional scenes as well. Newman's teaching tactics were a bit confusing at times, however they were still great, and while it can't quite match the suspense of The Hustler, it still had plenty of it, plus it would be really cool if they made a follow up to this! with Newman and Cruise attached to star. The music was great, and Newman's final line at he end put a big grin on my face! plus Cruise also had excellent chemistry with Mastrantonio!. This is not as good as the hustler, but still a top notch sequel in my opinion, with a fantastic story and brilliant performances, and I say Go see it now, if you loved The Hustler, you will most likely will love this, just go in with low expectations.<br/><br/>The Direction is masterful!. Martin Scorsese does a masterful job here as always, with wonderful camera work, and just keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace.<br/><br/>The Acting is indeed Oscar worthy in my opinion!. Paul Newman is incredible here, just like he was in The Hustler, he truly deserved his Oscar, just like he did in The Hustler also, and he is able to match his incredible performance, as well, he also had wonderful chemistry with Cruise, had some fantastic lines , had some brilliant scenes with Cruise, and while his character was a bit of a jerk I just couldn't help but love him, as he was extremely likable! (Newman Rules!!!!!!). Tom Cruise is amazing as always, and is also incredible here, he truly deserved at least an Oscar nomination,in my opinion, he also had wonderful chemistry with Newman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, was likably cocky, as always had loads of charisma, and made some pretty wicked shots!, and did wonderful in his emotional&anger scenes,and while his character was a jerk like Newman's I also couldn't help but love him! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!). Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was wonderful here, and while she may or may not have deserved her Oscar for best supporting actress, she was very sexy, and had wonderful chemistry with Cruise, I really liked her!. Helen Shaver is good as Newman's girlfriend I dug her. John Turturro is good as the dick Julian, and was convincing. Forest Whitaker is good in his cameo as Amos he was great. Rest of the cast do fine.<br/><br/>Overall Go see it immediately if you loved The Hustler like I did, you shouldn't regret it!, just go in with low expectations and don't expect the original. ***** out of 5"

This film was mildly amusing, had a fair run, and was quickly forgotten. This review was prompted by my having seen a revival of THE HUSTLER on TV and remembering just how lame this sequel was.

By working on a commercial project like this, Scorsese then had leeway to make his next film, the ultra-personal and controversial The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). Consequently, because this wasn't material he was fully passionate about, it's not so surprising that this isn't amongst his best work. That said it is still a good film. Scorsese still manages to employ much of his typical energetic style into the flow of things, making even the game of pool pretty dynamic to watch.<br/><br/>The film is maybe even better known for its acting though, with Paul Newman returning to play an older version of the character Fast Eddie Felson who last appeared in The Hustler twenty-five years previously. His character now manages young hustlers like he once was and, in doing so, takes a huge slice of their winnings. It's a role-reversal for the character and Newman is once again very good, although despite the Oscar win, he was even better in The Hustler. Tom Cruise plays off him as the cocky youngster in a type of role that we've seen him perform many times in fairness. He is good enough though and the two actors do work off each other well. The dynamic between them is reasonably predictable to an extent with a plot arc where their relationship starts off shaky, gets worse then finally clicks. But, off course, success breeds complications. Events do ultimately reach an unusual and ambiguous conclusion, which I wasn't too sure about personally but at least it ended things on a less obvious note."
"canuckteach","7","1","2","12 December 2013"," Great performances by Newman & Cruise.. but a bit 'uneven'
","If the performances were so great, why only rate it a 7 out of 10? To begin with, I watched this with my kids back in the 80's and we got hooked on 9-ball right away--we would play in this garage, and I would dominate until one of my younger kids dropped the 9-ball by accident, ending my streak. So, the film has sentimental value to me.<br/><br/>In the clear light of day, however, I re-watched it recently, and recalled what annoyed me the first time: Newman's reactions to Vince seem inconsistent and inexplicable. When Vince (Cruise) does what Newman (Eddie) tells him to do, Eddie is angry - when Vince does the opposite, Eddie gets mad (once, even driving off and leaving him). I didn't get it.<br/><br/>We are supposed to view Eddie as the mentor here, but, frequently, the roles reverse. For example, when Eddie decides to play a competitive game against a stranger (a young Forest Whittaker), he finds he is the victim of a clever con-artist -- he throws a hissy-fit, but Vince's reaction is the correct one: ""Forget it - we'll get this guy next time."" Eddie won't listen. Who is the impetuous protegé now?<br/><br/>There are some great pool sequences, however, and a glorious scene where Vince - armed with a totebox containing a world-class cue - encounters the Hall #1 player, who asks: ""What have you got there?"" ""Doom"", replies Vince with a big smile. Wish I had the game to say that.<br/><br/>So, if you can tolerate characters that react unevenly to situations, and aren't always likable, you might enjoy this unique film featuring Paul Newman's only Oscar-winning role (he shoulda won for Cool Hand Luke)."

","By far my favorite Newman movie. He's electric, returning as Fast Eddie. Cruise also shines in this film. Although Newman's acting was beyond approach in the ""Hustler"". The Color of Money is a completely honest sequel that is in some ways far better than the original.<br/><br/>Sometimes I watch this movie over and over again, trying to figure it out. Who is the hustler and who is really getting hustled. It's been years since I first saw it and I'm never be bored with it. It's not just about what's going on surface, which is obviously pool. There's so much more too it. Life lessons.<br/><br/>Some of the best lines you'll ever hear come out of this movie. I'll leave that for you to figure out. Cruise is one of my favorite actor's alive. I've never really seen a Cruise movie I didn't like. It really makes me sick what the media is doing to him lately. If you don't love this movie the first time you see it, just think about it.

"jzappa","8","1","2","9 December 2006"," The Last Play for the Envelope
","The characters in The Color of Money have a deep love for the game of pool, but what the movie shows us is the intricacies of hustling your opponent and making the proper haggle or deal. However, it's not quite a con film because as the audience, we're looking beyond the money and the hustles. What it seems for the first two acts to mainly be about is the generational divide between the three main characters. Humility comes naturally to the genuine old pro of a bygone generation of hot rods and guys in visors (he assumes Carmen doesn't work), but it doesn't come virtually impossible for the hot-blooded young Brat Pack generation stud (he can't conceive of how appearing to lose helps him win).<br/><br/>Played by Tom Cruise the same year he did Top Gun, Vincent is almost too broadly young-dumb-full-of-cum. ""Let's not make a federal production out of it!"" During the first half hour, we watch this extraordinarily impulsive guy and are pulled in mainly by the question of how on earth Eddie's going to whip him into some reserved, masterful grifter. The blustering after Eddie saves him from being pulverized by a bar full of angry hustlers, shouting he'll stick a cue down a guy's throat, blow them away with a cannon. What is he, 15? It may sound humdrum, like maybe there's going to be a love triangle that buds from Carmen's own very confidently commercial mind, but this cliché is deferred for the sake of the singular integrity of each of the three central characters. After Carmen sizes Eddie up, only beginning to work her womanly wiles on him before being patently discouraged, she knows she has to take him seriously. What the old man wants, he goes after with expertise, cunningand desperate hunger. And it's compelling to watch him scheme.<br/><br/>Scorsese is a master of momentum. Even he himself has expressed on many occasions that he doesn't understand sports, has little interest in them, yet this is his second sports-related film. With Raging Bull, he used that sport as metaphor. Here, he uses game as skill, as art. And the wild results of each situation lead to another set of dramatic circumstances and questions of what each character is intending to happen contrasted with how things play out. Michael Ballhaus' camera is as clever and careful about ""human moves"" regarding the characters in front of it as they are. We're pulled into the mental whirlwind of life on the hustle.<br/><br/>About 45 minutes in, Eddie shoots his first break in 35 years. Newman perfectly plays a guy who doesn't know if he's still got it, finds out he still does and plays like he already knew, all under a lifelong guise of veteran confidence. Scorsese shoots it perfectly. It's almost like sexual release, followed by the strutting elation that rubs off on Cruise and bonds the two. They're no longer just wise old guy schooling immature young guy. They're a pair of hustlers at the top of their game. But will the young one know how to take it in stride like the old man, or will his ego spin out of control? The dilemma becomes a matter of a jackpot by Eddie who reveals himself to have his own innate approach to the game: He just wants to play and show everyone he's the best. Why should Eddie want to break a horse that's already a champion? How far will he push this young man to recapture his own youth? Scorsese's real achievement here is not merely overcoming the challenge of a sports picture or a johnnie-come-lately sequel, but in pulling us into a character trifecta until the last 45 minutes, during which we see Eddie's quest has never been about Vincent, when there is a shift in the film's tone and atmosphere. Newman's character becomes a machine painstakingly observing a skill to astonishing precision, and that skill comes to be portrayed increasingly less like a hustling device and increasingly more like a reach for the big time."

","I thought Paul Newman is just an actor in this movie, but I realized he really play pool. He is amazing. Even if we don't know who finally won, I think Eddie is better than Vincent. Maybe Eddie was not so wise when he forfeited in the competition but his goal was to be among the best players again. The ""balabushka"" he kept is the proof he wanted to remain in top. When I saw the movie for the first time, I was just a kid and I wanted to be a very good hustler, but I still never played on a real pool table yet; just on the Internet. Maybe I will never fulfill my dream, but this movie will remind me every time how cute dreamer I used to be. I recommend this movie to anybody."

","In ""The Hustler"" talent didn't guarantee big money since ""the house"" not only took a cut but also decided who played and on what terms. Eddie walked away from ""the business,"" the best in the world, with little to show for it, because he didn't want to become, like Fats, a robot who could drink but not get drunk, skip sleep and not feel tired. In this sequel he is depicted as having learned to hustle money on his own terms, within the rules, but without playing pool. He hopes to get back into it vicariously, as a ""manager"", but realizes what he really needs is to play. But he has to face the harshest reality: getting old. Now, matched against the best young players, he really is ""a loser."" But this time, he has money.

"dylan-ransom","9","1","2","14 December 2005"," A Perfect Slow Burning Character Study
","I will start by saying I am a long-time avid pool player and gambler, and I hold movies of this genre to extremely high standards. The sole reason I cannot give it 10 stars is due to a huge number of inconsistencies as far as balls on the table changing positions during a scene, and a few examples of positional play that pros would never, ever make. The movie did highly disappoint in this aspect.<br/><br/>Nitpicking aside, this movie is a phenomenal character study, and VERY underrated. It is an absolute masterpiece so full of subtext that it deserves multiple viewings.<br/><br/>The basic plot is already well outlined in the other user comments, so I'll skip that. The performance by Paul Newman is probably his very best. Tom Cruise is perfect, Mastrantonio is perfect, and the supporting cast is perfect.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in all the pool halls is quite authentic- the actors and director certainly did their research. The various gambling scenarios and character reactions are very reasonable representations of what actually might happen.<br/><br/>Newman is controlled, prowling, and genuine- every line he delivers holds just enough back to make you realize there's more to what he's saying than the words. Watch his body language for a real lesson in acting. He keeps all the confidence from his role in The Hustler, tempered with wisdom of age and experience, and he is 100% believable. His transition from burned-out liquor hustler to rediscovering his passion for pool hustling is inevitable, calculated, saddening, and joyful all at once.<br/><br/>There's not much to say about the two lovers- they are perfectly convincing and masterful as well. No complaints. They are always there, always entertaining and filled with tension, but they let Fast Eddie steal the spotlight, because this movie is really about him.<br/><br/>I especially like the lighting and the camera angles. They capture the mood in just the right way without drawing away your attention.<br/><br/>It's hard to compare this with The Hustler, which I would also give 9/10. There are SO many unspoken nods to The Hustler that I was smiling all the time. Pay attention to The Hustler a couple times, and then watch this movie- you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>Watch it, and don't expect everything to be obvious. You have to engage this movie and listen carefully to really understand the characters. Vincent's character is pretty obvious, cause he's written as a pretty obvious guy, but everyone else is deep and not so easily revealed (unlike almost every other movie ever made).<br/><br/>Great stuff- check it out if you appreciate this type of film- it's the sleeper hit of the decade."
"ANewLeaf","10","1","2","10 April 2005"," As a pool player....
","As a competitive pool player I have a soft spot in my heart for a great pool movie that captures the pool scene and the personality of the game. As a pool player I also judge the movies about this sport based on how realistic they are to the real game and pool scene. There are only 2 great movies about pool, this is one of them and the other is it's predesesor ""The Hustler"".<br/><br/>***********SPOILERS**************** This movie is often misunderstood by many of the people who watch it, characters act in very real yet never well explained ways. The characters don't spell it out for the audience, they are made to think and that hurts this movie because most people don't want to have to think while watching a movie. Nevertheless this movie has many levels in it and many of the lines and happenings in the movie are very deep and not realized without very close attention and thought. Such questions as ""Did Eddie lose to Amos on purpose?"" or ""What does Vince mean when he says ""you used me""?"" or ""Why does Eddie quit the tournament at the end?"" are often asked and this is because the characters never spell out the answers to the audience, they instead act real and simply do what they would really do and say what they would really say in that situation rather then dialoging to the audience so they keep up with the plot.<br/><br/>Answers are there, The movie is entirely about Eddie, Vincent is simply a tool used by Eddie to get back onto the road and hustle, Vincent is a loud cocky decoy too keep the attention while the ""backer"" cleans up and makes a fortune on the side, this point is missed by most who watch the movie. Being a backer was NEVER Eddies intention, it was a guise to allow him to hustle as a money-man, no one expects the backer to be a pro and a former best player in the USA, years since Eddie showed his face in a pool hall only the very rare old timer will recognize him now and the young people are clueless marks. Amos snaps Eddies delusions of grandeur though on a night when Eddie himself is hustled and realizes that he is simply not good enough anymore to do what he did in his youth. He says it himself after loosing a fortune to Amos, in his youth he would have beaten Amos and turned the tables on the hustler, he fed off players like that. Eddie realizes he is no longer the hustler able to beat the top players, he is now the mark and prey for those top players. He cuts Vincent loose because the fact is Vincent is of no use as a decoy if Eddie cannot beat the people he planned to play. Vincent is simply now in the way of what Eddie needs to do, start again and be reborn into the game of pool, rise through the ranks and again take him place at the top.<br/><br/>Seriously HIGHLY underrated movie that is largely misunderstood and considered by most to be far more shallow then it is because they take it at face value and notice Tom Cruise doing cue tricks and bank shots and miss what is happening with the characters and Eddie. Then again the audience gets hustled into watching the young cocky kid while the old hustler does exactly what he always planned to do so maybe it is a little ironic that the movie is poorly judged by people that were hustled by Eddie right along with the characters. Highly recommend people watch this one again and realize that Eddie NEVER planned on being a backer, that was a guise to allow him to return to his hustling ways before he ever played Fats as can be seen in the opening scene of ""The Hustler"". Vincent was a lot like Charlie, there for an act. Only at least Cahrlie knew he was being used to allow Eddie to make money with his skills. Only later in the movie does Vincent realize he was a pawn and Eddies match against Amos and a thousand other matches like that was the real reason he was taken on the road"
"paul2001sw-1","8","1","2","5 June 2004"," Shoot pool, Fast Eddie!
","Line up Martin Scorcese to direct a sequel to the classic film 'The Hustler' and you might assume you'd be onto a winner.  But although  entertaining, 'The Color of Money' is merely a good, not a great film.  The world of film-making has changed since 1961 and compared to the original the newer film is, as you would expect, a lot slicker (the pool-playing scenes in particular are technically superb) and away from the table, the general dialogue is vastly improved.  But the contemporary pop music that plays in the background throughout the first half is truly dreadful (though hardly Scorcese's fault), while no-one has one liners as good as 'The Hustler's Jackie Gleason had.  More surprisingly, there's less tension (and a whole lot less atmosphere) in the pool matches themselves: Scorcese clearly did not want to make a ""sports"" movie, but in consequence, the footage of the actual games is entirely for show while the plot goes on elsewhere.<br/><br/>The world outside Hollywood has changed as well, and to be fair, 'The Color of Money' addresses this as one of its themes.  But in some ways, the newer world is less interesting than the old one.  Fast Eddie, Paul Newman's character in both films, was, as a young man, desperate to win: victory offered his only chance to be someone, to prove his worth to himself in the face of severe self-doubt.  The alternative, given his innate character flaws, was literally destitution.  While his main opponent, Minnesota Fats (Gleason), did not just shoot pool, he was pool, defining and defined by the world in which he lived.  But in the sequel, pool, to Fast Eddie, has become just another way of making money, while his annoying protege Vincent (a very young, and surprisingly chubby-faced Tom Cruise) has no fear of life and complete self-belief. However well it's done, it's hard to care too much about either of them. It's no coincidence that film picks up when Fast Eddie re-finds his love for the game.  For the first time, there's something really at stake (though at the same time, there's a little self-indulgence in the later stages of the plot).<br/><br/>'The Color of Money' is a fun movie to watch, especially if you've seen 'The Hustler' and are already on Fast Eddie's side.  But it's predecessor will be remembered when it has been forgotten."
"the_lost_artist","Null","1","2","3 January 2004"," The movie throws a lot of surprises by not being surprising.
","WARNING**SPOILERS** ALL THROUGHOUT<br/><br/>
The film is about pride more than anything else. PAUL NEWMAN'S CHARACTER<br/><br/>Newman's character is someone who was known to winning but someone 'made him retire' which means he was thinking so highly of himself that when he started losing to someone, he just quit the game. Also he claims to be the best liquor salesman in that region. He is someone who takes himself too seriously. His interest in the game is rekindled when he sees a cocky Cruise play and is reminded of his days as a champ on the pool circuit. I feel that the film actually makes fun of the trying to be 'the once upon a time main man', the hustler, Newman's character, Eddie. Demo scene of Newman's pride: Newman leaves the pool room when he is reminded that 'only one man can be the best' bye Cruise.<br/><br/>TOM CRUISE'S CHARACTER<br/><br/>Cruise is a toy store video game loving bloke who just wants to play and win. He is an immature simpleton when it comes to money. He cannot understand Newman's techniques of hustling other players and making them increase the bet and win the game. here's an example: Cruise is always thinking he's on some big mission, whereas Newman's goal is to make a few grands. Demo scene of Cruise's stupidity: Cruise makes his gal leave the pool place in the beginning which is filled with African Americans because he thinks it's going to be `dangerous'. Cruise is disappointing Newman who has spent some money and time trying to make use of Cruise's talent for his monetary gains.<br/><br/>MARY ELIZABETH MASTRANTONIO<br/><br/>Newman is thinking of himself as a horsebreeder, while Cruise's girl, Mastrantonio is the one 'who keeps him happy'. The horse being Cruise. Mastrantonio's role is basically the one between Cruise and Newman, shrewdness-wise. Mastrantonio's role is supporting the characters and was nominated for the Oscars. Why? I don't know.it was a good role, she was convincing as the girlfriend who is trying to make her stupid boyfriend more street-smart. Maybe she is using him, maybe she doesn't really love him. This film is not about them, so it rightly doesn't dwell in that sub-story.<br/><br/>The movie throws a lot of surprises by not being surprising. · As in it makes you feel that Newman and Mastrantonio are going to have some kind of affair, which never happens. · I thought it was going to be a sports film: where a senior player takes a younger one under his wings and grooms him, then the younger one is too big for the senior, there is separation and then coming back for the big game.<br/><br/>
This is far more realistic and unglamorous. The lighting is pretty dark. Lot of fluorescent lights used. The pool table scenes are good. Lot of Zoom-ins and Zoom-outs, something Scorsese doesn't do all the time. Lot of low-angle pool table shots. The background music is great and enhance the pool games.<br/><br/>
The ending scenes are at the Atlantic City Pool Championships, where all the big boys o pool are playing and which was their ultimate goal. Cruise shows his stupidity here: Newman taught him/ made him throw matches for money and then get back to winning when the stakes were high, and when Cruise threw the championship match against him, his pride was hurt and couldn't bear this fake victory."

The Colour of Money isn't a great movie but it is a good one. People who spend the weekend in pubs playing Pool will especially enjoy it as it contains some great Pool scenes and trick shots apparently pulled off mainly by the actors involved. Paul Newman is really good in this film and shows Cruise a thing or two. Tom's character is pretty annoying to be honest, it would have been better if they had made him just a little likeable. Still there are a lot worse films to watch and if this one is on the telly I usually end up watching it. Although I find the ending very unsatisfying. ***6/10***"

He was supposed to be obnoxious, annoying, and mostly immature.  He was.  It was supposed to bug Paul Newman to the ends of the earth, and it did.  Vincent was cocky, young and talented, just like Fast Eddie, but Eddie had wits and was beguiling, whereas Vincent is simply in your face brash.<br/><br/>The end result is that Eddie wants Vincent to ""become"" a reborn Fast Eddie Felson, but he simply isn't, and this provides quite a bit of excellent interaction between Cruise and Newman.<br/><br/>A thoroughly enjoyable picture, in my opinion.

Now you're probably thinking ""What is this guy getting at?"" or ""Who cares about these names?"".  That's because you DON'T know what I'm getting at.  These are the five actors who were in nomination for best actor in 1986 and the winner was Newman for ""The color of money"".  And he didn't just win because this was about his eighth nomination and he hadn't won yet so the voters decided he should win and voted for him.  No, he won because he was the best that year. <br/><br/>
  In 1961, Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) was trying to become the best pool-player around by beating Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason).  25 years later, he owns a small bar.  But one day, he hears some noises at the pool tables that only he knows because of his experience as a hustler.  When he turns, there he sees a kid who's about in his 20's and who has, as Felson says, ""a sledge-hammer break"".  He goes over to talk to him but since he's busy playing, he introduces himself to the kid's girlfriend, Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  He tries to see if the kid is a hustler by trying to hustle Carmen but at every offer he makes, she tells him he should talk to her boyfriend Vincent (Tom Cruise). <br/><br/>  Felson buys them a drink and then takes them to dinner.  At the restaurant, Eddie tells them that after having seen Vincent play, he thinks he could beat anyone and also, Eddie pulls a little magic trick on Vincent and his girlfriend.  The next day, Eddie goes to visit Vincent at work and he makes him a proposition in which he will take Vincent and Carmen on a trip to teach Vincent how to make big money hustling and then, take them to Atlantic City where he could compete in the annual pool championship and would probably win.  After the proposition, Vincent asks for a few days to talk it over with his girlfriend, but they eventually agree.<br/><br/>  Once they leave on the trip, the movie reaches its peak and Newman gives the performance of his career as he tries to teach Vincent the right way to hustle.  Scorsese's directing is indeed excellent.  The music and script are excellent as well and the supporting cast is excellent as well.  But Newman simply dominates the movie from start to finish.  He is twice as good as he was in ""The hustler"" and didn't only teach Vincent how to win as a hustler when he was playing Eddie Felson in the movie, but he probably taught Cruise a thing or two about acting since Cruise's childhood movie-star was Paul Newman.  The two of them make a great pair.  But Paul Newman is still one of the best and shows it to everybody in this movie.  You've got to see it."

The soundtrack, is as usual for Scorsese, brilliant, here he even makes Phil Collins sound great in the instantly arresting opening sequence. It's a relatively hollow experience compared to say, The King of Comedy, Raging Bull or even Bringing out the Dead, but it's sheer drive and energy makes it endlessly watchable."

","The Color of Money was not only the first R-rated movie I ever saw, it was my introduction to brilliant filmmaker Martin Scorsese. I have seen and enjoyed most of his films. This is among my favorite Scorsese films.<br/><br/>
The script by Richard Price (Clockers) is strong. Paul Newman reprises his role of Fast Eddie Felson from The Hustler. Tom Cruise plays Vincent, the talented young pool player who reminds Eddie of himself when he was younger. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was never sexier than she is in this movie.<br/><br/>The pool scenes are filmed nicely. The chemistry between Newman, Cruise and Mastrantonio is very good. Once again, Scorsese's choice of music is superb (particularly Eric Clapton's ""It's In The Way That You Use It""). Newman won a much-deserved Oscar for his role in this film. A strong effort from the talented people involved make this one of Scorsese's best, although it doesn't quite reach the level of masterpieces like Raging Bull, Goodfellas or Casino. 8/10"

","I wanted to like this movie. I really did. When I heard that it was a sequel to THE HUSTLER, one of my all-time favourite movies, and directed by Martin Scorsese, I had to see it. Sadly, the result was a disappointment, hardly a sequel in the truest sense of the word. Sure, its main character is a pool player named Eddie Felson and he is played by Paul Newman, just as in the first film. Okay, up to that point. But beyond that, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that young Eddie Felsen and the older, more mature Eddie Felsen is even the same person.<br/><br/>Too many background details from that first movie are either forgotten or ignored, not the least of which was his thrashing of Minnesota Fats, an expert pool player who remained undefeated for more than fifteen years, making him the man to be reckoned with. Surely that is the stuff of legend - at least among pool players who take the game seriously - yet no one seems to even be aware of it in the second movie. In fact, the name Minnesota Fats doesn't even enter the conversation.<br/><br/>Nor is it explained what turns Felson's life took after his acrimonious split with manager Bert Gordon (George C. Scott, in the original) who vowed that he would never shoot big-time pool again. And Eddie lives alone now. Does he ever have any regret about the shabby way he treated his girlfriend (Piper Laurie) who was driven to suicide and best friend (Myron McCormack) who he dumped along the way in his incessant drive to be the best?<br/><br/>Such questions deserve at least a nodding reference to suggest a continuation of the story, but none come into play and what we are left with is a fairly standard story of a liquor salesman (Newman) who occasionally plays pool and decides to mentor a young gun, Vincent (Tom Cruise), to hustle high-stakes games and split the take. Inevitably the two must square off to find out who is best.<br/><br/>Newman is okay here, though hardly the electrifying performer we have come to expect over the years. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is good as Carmen, Vincent's girlfriend who likes the excitement of being around him and around the pool halls. But Tom Cruise, as the young hotshot with the pool stick, quickly becomes annoying with his excessive brand of cockiness.<br/><br/>On its own, THE COLOR OF MONEY is well enough made and not without interest, but as a sequel it misses the mark by a wide margin."

There's 25 years between the original and this sequel but we never get much of an idea what Eddie's been doing this entire time except that he's in retirement and now owns his own pool hall.<br/><br/>The movie takes place over a couple of months, yet nothing particularly interesting happens that warrants us paying attention or caring for any of the characters.  Eddie is prodded out of retirement so that he can groom his new protege, the obnoxious, cocky, simple-minded Vincent (Tom Cruise, apparently reprising his meathead character from ""The Outsiders"") to become a hustler, just like he was so many years ago.  However, Vincent's over-the-top brashness grows thin after about 5 minutes and I couldn't believe for a second that Felson hadn't come across better players with more charisma in 25 years than a simpleton lightweight like Vincent.  None of the main characters (Felson, Vincent, and Vincent's girlfriend) were particularly sympathetic, and the ""big point"" of each scene had the subtlety of a jackhammer (SCENE 10: THE HUSTLER GETS HUSTLED....SCENE 15: THE STUDENT BECOMES THE MASTER....SCENE 19: THE HUSTLER REGAINS HIS LOVE OF THE PURE SPORT).  <br/><br/>This movie is basically just a mediocre episode of 'Fast' Eddie Felson's life, no more, no less."

The story, the theme, the characters, all were there eight years before. Bullet was a comedy/drama, with great action scenes and lines any script would die for. Color left out the humor, the action, the lines, along with hubris. Color is a showcase front for Newman and Cruise, nothing more. It captures nothing of the world of pool hustling, whereas Bullet is in the middle, down to the exact method of betting. In Bullet, a svelte and hilarious Michael Lerner almost steals the movie. In Color, the popcorn stole the show. Is there something redeeming about the Color? Well, we only have so many minutes in life, and I wouldn't recommend using any of them on this dog. Woof woof.

","Fast Eddie (Newman) takes top-gun pool player Vincent (Cruise) and his girlfriend Carmen (Mary Stuart Mastrantonio) out on a six week journey to Atlantic City to teach them how to hustle. On the way he struggles with the love of the game that he once had.<br/><br/>And that's about it, as a sequel to the Hustler, Colour of Money stands in the shadow of it's big brother as a lesser film. This deals with Eddie as an old man having given up pool for a quieter life. As a character study of Eddie it is quite good, you see his excitement when he's about to do his first hustle in years and his mood when his bitterness and disappointment come through again. The final lines are a little too twee for the film but do leave you with the feeling that you've followed this character as he's tried to come back to his first love. But this character study is not enough to carry the whole film.<br/><br/>The rest of the plot relies on Cruise and Mastrantonio to deliver and unfortunately they don't do as well as they could. Mastrantonio is pretty good but doesn't totally convince as someone driven by greed (shown by her robbery background and her partnership with Eddie), she seems 2-dimensional but not shallow. Cruise is too simplistic to play the role of Vincent - he merely bounces between cocky and angry in the role. He didn't have the subtlety needed to pull it off yet. Ultimately he is more annoying than anything else. Interest is held by other actors playing small roles (Iggy Pop, Forest Whitaker, John Turturro) but it's left to Fast Eddie to carry the show.<br/><br/>Scorsese piles the visual style on thick and it does help the film immensely. He generates such energy around the pool halls that you can't help but watch during the games (even if you don't fully understand the rules). This is very different from the smoky, shadowy feel of the Hustler but it is a real boost to this film to have him direct. Unfortunately you do feel like you just ate a very light meal afterwards - I got the style, but shouldn't there be more substance?<br/><br/>And that's the problem - you do feel that there should have been more. There's tonnes of flashy pool games, inventive camera shots and good music. There's even good character development in Fast Eddie, but you do feel that you've just watched Paul Newman give a great performance in a 2-hour pop music video.

Roger Ebert famously didn't like this movie, and I can understand his review, even though I love the movie and think it's a cult classic Ebert had some points I took into consideration.<br/><br/>A great follow up to the 60's classic, ""The Hustler"" and Scorsese's narration in the beginning and the story just makes it the even more compelling. This film was commercially successful back in 1986, although critics Siskel and Ebert thought the story was so predictable, other critics seemed to enjoy it, with 89% on Rotten Tomatoes and an Oscar for Paul Newman's performance, the movie received fairly well criticism.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a fun pool-table movie with some swear words and mature storytelling, you will enjoy this film.

","I deliberately watched this after ""The Hustler"" and it probably didn't help my appreciation of ""The Color Of Money"". In fact I'd say that if the principals here were movie directors that only the been-there-and-lived-it Eddie Felson could have directed ""The Hustler"", while it would take someone like a brash, flashy Vincent Lauria to come up with ""The Color Of Money"".<br/><br/>There's lots of technique in Scorsese's feature with countless showy examples of imaginative editing and camera set-ups but the film is weak on story and characterisation and no amount of stylised high-end cinematography can mask or change that. The film really is a more of a homage to Newman who finally won his lead actor Oscar on his sixth nomination for his work here but the great man isn't much more than a show-horse.<br/><br/>Cruise is okay as the young hustler Newman takes under his wing, all nervous energy and callowness but of course watching him work you're reminded of Newman's own performance when he was the new kid on the block twenty five years before and there's little comparison. Scorcese tries to work the women into the narrative but both Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Helen Shaver only come off as peripheral. Elsewhere, you'll see Iggy Pop in a pointless cameo which could only have been inserted for some wannabe street-cred.<br/><br/>The soundtrack produced by Robbie Robertson, late of The Band, for whom Scorsese of course made ""The Last Waltz"" ten years before, likewise comes over as incongruous and mannered with a blues-heavy selection of tunes and background music which again only heightens the artificiality of the overall film.<br/><br/>There's no real emotional core or climax to the film and certainly not the tension that Robert Rossen created in black and white, in fact it seems to me that the narrative got lost somewhere in between some deliberately Oscar-baiting acting and show-off direction. I wanted to like this movie but it came across ultimately as empty and pointless.<br/><br/>This was the second of Scorcese's two big-budget, high-profile remakes of classic black and white Hollywood features of the early 60's, the other being ""Cape Fear"" but here again he comes off second best compared to the originals.<br/><br/>A bit of a miscue all round for this one unfortunately."

But the original is so much better; there's tension and drama rather than comic relief jokes. Tom Cruise plays the younger version of Paul Newman, but he's not as likable as his predecessor.

"JamesHitchcock","7","0","2","22 April 2015"," The Tricks of the Game
","""The Color of Money"" is a delayed sequel to ""The Hustler"" from 1961 which provided Paul Newman with one of his best-known early roles as the pool hustler Fast Eddie Felson. Fast Eddie then disappeared from the screen for a quarter of a century, but in 1984 Walter Tevis, the author of the novel on which the earlier film had been based, published a sequel, and Newman was persuaded to return when this was itself adapted for the cinema. Jackie Gleason's character Minnesota Fats is, however, absent, as it was felt that he would not fit in well with the story. <br/><br/>As the film opens, the now middle-aged Fast Eddie has retired from playing pool and is working as a liquor salesman, until one night he meets Vincent Lauria, a young up-and-coming pool player who reminds him of his younger self. Eddie persuades Vincent and his girlfriend Carmen to go on the road with him. The deal is that Eddie will teach Vincent all the tricks of the game and in return Vincent will give him a cut of his winnings. By ""tricks of the game"" Eddie does not just mean formal pool-playing skills- Vincent is already a formidably good player- but also the scams and dodges (some of them very ethically dubious) which Vincent will need to be a successful hustler. Eddie's nickname does not just refer to the speed with which he can clear a pool table; he is also ""fast"" in the sense of slippery or dishonest. His creed is that ""pool excellence is not about excellent pool""- it's more about successful gambling. His protégé's success encourages Eddie to make a return to the game himself, and he and Vincent find themselves playing in the same tournament. <br/><br/>Together with Henry Fonda's win for ""On Golden Pond"" from five years earlier, Newman's ""Best Actor"" Academy Award for this film is often cited as the prime example of an Oscar given for sentimental reasons rather than on merit. (Ironically Newman, nominated for ""Absence of Malice"", was one of the actors who lost out to Fonda in 1981). Neither actor had previously won an Oscar, and these films were seen as their ""last chance"" to win one. In Fonda's case this was quite literally true- ""On Golden Pond"" was his very last film and he died not long after receiving his award- but Newman made a number of films after 1986, his last, ""Road to Perdition"", coming as late as 2002. Newman's performance here is certainly good, but I would not rank it alongside the truly great ones he had earlier given in films like ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""Hombre"", ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""The Sting"", or the one he was later to give in ""Road to Perdition"", all of which were overlooked by the Academy. The award of a sentimental Oscar would not have mattered much had 1986 been a weak year in the cinema, but in fact it was a very strong one, the year of films as good as ""Children of a Lesser God"", ""The Mission"" and ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", all of which contained at least one performance at least as good as Newman's. <br/><br/>The brash, cocky, up-and-coming young Vincent is played by an up-and- coming young actor named Tom Cruise, and in the eighties nobody could do brash and cocky like Cruise. This is not really one of his best performances- he was not to emerge as a great actor until ""Rain Man"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July"" a few years later- but at least he is not as annoying here as he was in other films from the period like ""Risky Business"" or ""Cocktail"". <br/><br/>The film was described by some critics as an inferior follow-up to ""The Hustler"", but as it's a long time since I saw that film I won't attempt a direct comparison. It is reasonably well made and acted, but I can't say it's a great favourite of mine, even though I'm normally a big admirer of Martin Scorsese. Part of the reason is that (like most Britons) I know very little about pool. (""A sort of American version of snooker?"") This is not, however, the main reason; after all, I don't know much about baseball either, and that has never prevented me from loving films like ""Eight Men Out"" or ""Field of Dreams"". I think that the real reason is that it's all a bit passionless, with no tension and no characters with whom the audience can identify. There is never any real dramatic conflict between Eddie and Vincent because they are no more than older and younger versions of the same not very attractive character, and we never really care about who wins their big match. It's not a bad film, but it's not one of Scorsese's masterpieces in the class of ""Taxi Driver"", ""King of Comedy"" or ""The Aviator"". 7/10"

Eddie Felson, a billiards phenom in his younger days who had been used and tossed away by an unscrupulous gambler, is older and wiser and now acts as the unscrupulous gambler by bankrolling young pool sharks . . . Huh? Did Eddie learn nothing from his earlier experience. A rather unbelievable character flaw considering where Eddie was at the end of ""The Hustler""<br/><br/>Eddie decides to go on the road with a hotshot young pool player named Vincent (Tom Cruise) who is crazily cocky, dumb as a box of rocks, and presented in a smarmy way-over-the-top manner by Cruise. Vince has a girlfriend named Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) who early on reveals that she has no scruples herself. Uh, wait a minute. In ""The Hustler"" Eddie got involved with a girl, took her on a pool/gambling road trip with his evil gambler mentor and, without giving away the twists of that much better movie, lets just say it ended very badly. Wow, it seems Eddie has contracted a real bad case of memory loss which causes him to make every mistake he has made before. Who's is writing this dreck?<br/><br/>The implausibility's get worse. Eddie gives Vince a very valuable cue stick, sort of a gift to convince him to become his protégé. Then he tells Vince to not use it when he plays - any savvy pool player will see it and immediately identify Vince as a hustler. Okay, so why give it to the brash and volatile young Vincent? Of course Vince goes out without Eddie and takes the cue and mucks up Eddie's gambling game plan. Eddie gets mad and drives his car away, with Vince trying to chase him down like a jilted girlfriend. Then Vince gets mad and Eddie gets in his car and chases down Vince, like an older jilted girlfriend. Meanwhile Carmen is disrobing in front of Eddie every chance she gets. Then they all make up. Then the wise, sage pool hustler Eddie Felson devises a con job which involves putting his grubby old guy hands all over Carmen, knowing full well how jealous and insecure Vince is about his relationship with Carmen. This leads to a cringe-worthy scene after the con job in which Vince acts like the immature teenager he obviously is while Carmen and Eddie try to placate his anger by saying, ""We were just acting!"" It made me feel a little dirty, watching the great Paul Newman explaining how actors who kiss in movies don't really mean it. Who put these words in his mouth?<br/><br/>There's more, including one of Scorcesese's most gratuitous camera spins, doing 360's around Newman like some drunk teenager doing donuts in his souped-up Chevy in a supermarket parking lot, but why continue? This is simply a bad movie, all the more embarrassing because it almost taints the memory of its superior predecessor . . . almost.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Newman looks great, MEM is very sexy, and Forrest Whitaker turns up in a great cameo as a slightly crazy pool hustler. His character was more interesting during his brief screen time than anything Newman and Cruise could muster. <br/><br/>The rotten cherry on top of this melted pile of ice cream is the fact that THIS is the film for which Newman won his only Oscar. My advice for Newman fans (of which I am definitely one) is to avoid ""The Color of Money"" and remember the legendary actor for all his other great performances."

It's a great idea with a ton of potential, but Martin Scorese's film fumbles the ball in bringing that idea to the screen.<br/><br/>The thing that made The Hustler work was that it wasn't a movie about pool at all; with barely any actual pool scenes in the 120+ minute film, it made it clear that it was a character drama first and foremost. It dove into the head of Fast Eddie Felson and his roller coaster ride from the opening game to the final one, peeling away the layers of this character and letting Paul Newman bring the house down with a tour de force performance.<br/><br/>The Color of Money's first mistake is a simple one; way too much pool. The plot centers around Felson grooming a young player named Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise) to essentially be his successor, a tale as old as time. I liked the setup of Felson as the kind of character that George C. Scott portrayed in Hustler, but they very quickly drove away from that aspect of it and into some bizarre love triangle world with Lauria's girlfriend Carmen (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).<br/><br/>The character dynamics felt off almost immediately and it only became worse and more forced as it went along. Newman and Cruise don't have much chemistry at all, thanks mostly to Cruise's appalling performance. I generally don't let the aesthetics of a character get in the way of my appreciation of a film, especially in the '80s, but Cruise's hair made it almost impossible for me to take this clown seriously and the actor himself followed in suit by portraying Lauria as the biggest dork in the business, the kind of guy that Eddie Felson would never even give the time of day to.<br/><br/>A lot of the film moves along with no real grasp on it's characters and for the majority of it I couldn't find a way to understand the motivations of these characters at all. This probably stems from the fact that Richard Price's script builds itself entirely around actual pool playing instead of working on it's characters (which is ironic given the film's fantastic ending) and Scorsese is more focused on trying (and failing) to make slick and exciting montages of balls going into pockets instead of looking into the character's motivations.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the film builds itself up as one thing for the entire first hour and then, with no natural progression at all, transforms itself into something completely different. It's practically two separate films that they tried to glue into one and the pieces don't go together at all. Mastrantonio gives an effectively seductive performance, but she looks bored half of the time, and it seems like the only person here who is really doing their job properly is Newman.<br/><br/>He (finally) won an Oscar for his performance and it's easy to see why; Newman fits right back into the shoes of Felson as if he never left them, making you believe firmly that this guy had existed all of those twenty-five years between the time we last saw him and now. There's a lifetime of emotions and experiences buried in those eyes, and it's one of the rare performances that Newman turns his charm completely off, instead of utilizing it in one way or another. He's a very broken soul, as we can tell even before he can acknowledge it within himself, and it's the only thing that's working properly in this mess of a production."

","This film brings together the classic American actor, Paul Newman, with a popular stud of the time, Tom Cruise. With a notable cameo of Forest Whitaker as Amos the hustler.<br/><br/>How to judge this film? It is not as great as Newman's original time around as Fast Eddie (""The Hustler""), but still a great film just the same. And it hardly ranks as one of Cruise's best, though he gets that craziness out of him here (with a bare minimum of running). Scorsese has done better, much better, but he was working within a framework here and I think as far as sequels go, this one is pretty great.<br/><br/>A must-see film, not so much because it is one of the better films, but because it has three great giants of film together in one place.

Eddie takes Vincent and Carmen on the road, teaching Vincent the true art of hustling, ""Money Won Is Twice As Sweet As Money Earned"".

Do not miss this film! It is true art in the making. Cruise performed most of his own pool playing, and the late great Paul Newman scored his first and only Oscar for his great work here.Newman was truly a great actor...I can't think of too many that have won an Oscar for playing the same character years later and winning an Oscar for it."
"jboothmillard","7","0","6","9 January 2008"," The Color of Money
","If you have seen The Hustler, then you would know that this is the sequel from director Martin Scorsese (GoodFellas, The Departed), and apparently the flashier film. Paul Newman reprises his role as pool shark and ""hustler"" 'Fast Eddie Felson, and won an Oscar (and was nominated the Golden Globe). Basically Eddie has been forced into retirement, and he enters a relationship with promising young pool player Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise), along with his girlfriend Carmen (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). In this relationship Eddy finds himself, self-respect and redemption, and as they travel he realises how much he lost, but he can see history beginning to repeat itself. Vincent has a habit of showing off his talent, and by doing so is losing players/opponents and money. In an effort to avert tragedy, Eddy ends the relationship, and returns to his love of pool. Finally, in a big Atlantic City tournament, Vincent returns the favour by teaching the final lesson to Eddy allowing him to finish his quest for rediscovery. Also starring Helen Shaver as Janelle, John Turturro as Julian, Bill Cobbs as Orvis, Robert Agins as Earl at Chalkie's, Keith McCready as Grady Seasons, Carol Messing as Casino Bar Band Singer/Julian's Flirt, Steve Mizerak as Duke, Eddie's First Opponent, Alvin Anastasia as Kennedy, Joe Guastaferro as Chuck the Bartender, then little known Forest Whitaker as Amos and Iggy Pop Skinny Player on Road. The pool games are interesting to watch, both Newman and Cruise have their moments in their roles, and good direction from Scorcese, a good film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. Tom Cruise was number 32, and Paul Newman number 16 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Cruise was also number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons.

","I know that calling Color of Money the finest film by American legend Martin Scorcese is controversial. A lot of people think it's one of his lesser works. But from the opening scene of this beautiful film we're treated to a masterpiece of American cinema which surpasses the Hustler in every way.<br/><br/>Twenty years after he had ""the breaks put on"" his pool career, Fast Eddie Felson is a successful liquor salesman wholesaling alcohol to bars in an unnamed Northern city. He's wealthy enough and happy enough with a his steady girlfriend. Then one day he meets an up and coming pool player Vincent, and his con-woman girlfriend Carmen.<br/><br/>Eddies life is transformed. He remembers that ""money won is twice as sweet as money earned."" He takes Vincent and Carmen under his wing, volunteering to fund and train them as they hit the road and play every pool hall between them and the pool championships in Atlantic City.<br/><br/>Paul Newman is masterful in this film. He gives us an Eddie who has transformed into the Bert/George C Scott character from The Hustler. He's a man who sees all the angles and who tries to train Vincent in how to earn money through pool hustling. Tom Cruise is brilliant as naive, cocky, headstrong Vincent, a phenomenal pool talent who can't seem to see the big money payout which Eddie wants him to go for. Vincent just wants to play great pool. Along the way they both go through transformations, especially Eddie who realizes that the life he thought he wanted wasn't what he actually wanted.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant film by an American master and it has a lot to say about ambition, desire, competition, and the lies we tell ourselves. Here we have three film giants: Scorcese, Newman, and Cruise each performing at the top of their game. Do yourself a favor and rent The Color of Money."

","There seems to be some surprise that THE COLOR OF MONEY has only achieved an average vote of 6.8 ( I rounded my vote up to 7 ) since it has a legendary Hollywood actor reprising a role that made him famous with an up and coming Hollywood legend in a supporting role , in a movie that has yet another legend as director . Ask yourself this : How regarded would this flick be if it didn't feature Newman , Cruise and Scorsese ? <br/><br/>There's two problems involved <br/><br/>1 ) It's a sequel to another highly regarded movie which brings prejudice to opinion <br/><br/>2 ) The source novel by Walter Tevis does not lend itself to cinema . That's probably the main problem . People sit around in smoky pool halls talking , nothing much happens plot wise , it's low concept and most obvious of all is that the climax is spectacularly anti climatic <br/><br/>Scorsese and screenwriter Richard Price do have a go at making cinema out of an uncinematic story . Ignore the fact that it's about 9 ball pool a curiously American game that you don't see in British pubs and look upon it as a metaphor for hope and dreams . If it featured a manager trying to get a singer a record contract you'd still have the same story . Newman is good ( Though I think Bob Hoskins deserved the Oscar that year ) as is Mastrantonio but Cruise is superb and I can't help thinking that this and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY are his career highlights , when he has to act all aggressive and angry he actually convinces <br/><br/>But at the end of the day people go to the cinema to watch a cinematic movie and despite the plus points THE COLOR OF MONEY probably belongs on the written page"

","The Color of Money is without a doubt, a pool lover's movie. You couldn't watch this movie unless you loved billiards or Tom Cruise. If you have pool on the mind, this movie will not help you get rid of it.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Vincent, an amateur pool player who has a strange look on the game. The professional Eddie (Paul Newman), shows Vince the ropes and dopes of hustling, which help him to become one of the best. Seeing as Vince is independent, his attitude gets in the way of his mission and love life. 'Fast Eddie' will have to keep an eye on Vince 24/7 to keep him from screwing up this risky life.<br/><br/>7 out of 10. For being a pool movie, there wasn't enough good matches going on. Half the movie was actual hustling/pool playing, the other half was Vince's cockiness towards others and himself. Ms. Mastrantonio is gorgeous, watch it for her!"
"TxMike","Null","0","2","30 June 2005"," ""Money won is twice as sweet as money earned."" (Fast Eddie)
","The more of his movies I see, the more I think that Paul Newman may be the best actor of modern times. Here he is Fast Eddie Felson, a well-off liquor salesman, a former pool hustler, was one of the best. As he explained to young Vincent (Tom Cruise, 23), ""Money won is twice as sweet as money earned"", and that is what this movie is about. Although by his own admission he ""has quit"", Eddie misses the action and sees an opportunity to get back in by teaching the hustling game to brash, fiery, and talented Vincent, when he witnesses Vincent demoralizing one of the hustlers by beating him so easily. But Vince is a tough case, he is so competitive that he can't lose for the sake of suckering in a mark. By Eddie's accounting, if you lose a few hundred then you might win a few thousand when other hustlers think you are an easy mark. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is Carmen, Vincent's girlfriend. Helen Shaver is Janelle, Eddie's girlfriend. Good movie, especially for Newman and Cruise.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise made this movie around the same time as ""Top Gun"".<br/><br/>SPOILERS. The movie ends at Atlantic City during the big 9-ball tournament. When Vince and Eddie split, Eddie began training again, got new eye glasses, entered the tournament, determined to get his form back. ""Money earned"" was not good enough anymore. As luck would have it, Vince and Eddie met in the elimination bracket and, in a very close match Eddie won. He appeared at the height of his skill. But later Vince came to his room and gave Eddie $8000, his share of a hustle. Turns out he purposely lost to Eddie, to set up a bigger take. Eddie had taught him well, but was so distraught he forfeited his next match, he hadn't earned it. The movie ends with Eddie challenging Vince to a game, vowing to play him as long as it takes to beat him."
"nakiannu","5","0","6","5 May 2005"," what a letdown
","Paul Newman? He is a master of creating mystery and intrigue. This movie is a jewel, I am so thoroughly enjoying it! and Tom looks young! this must have been made right around the Top Gun/ Cocktail era.<br/><br/>This movie is like finding gold buried in your backyard the chemistry of the story and the exceptional performances by Newman and Cruise are the best mentor/prodigy story I can remember seeing. I can see why Cruise rocketed to super stardom; he was such a loose cannon, just a super magnet of charm and success. And he's now a Scientologist, right? Hmmmmm.<br/><br/>Why do I get the feeling that this movie was some sort of passing of the torch? I haven't seen really any Paul Newman movies, but I bet he was damn near the coolest guy on the block for many years (probably sharing status with Clint Eastwood, etc), and this movie seems like everything came together for an up and coming director at the time (Scorsese) to film that magic moment when a former top dog chooses and mentors his prodigy. This is just beautiful, although probably much more interesting to males than females.<br/><br/>The Atlantic City 9 ball tournament isn't set up very well, there isn't a clearcut thing to root for. Tom comes off way too over confident when claiming to have dropped a game to Newman, and then the absolutely worst ending I've seen in a long time.. build it up and build it up and build it up and then just LEAVE the audience hanging. F*** YOU MARTIN SCORSESE! This movie went from an A+ to a C, all because F****** Scorsese couldn't keep a good thing going. Sorry, who am I to criticize the ""Great Scorsese""? Tell me that wasn't a phenomenal letdown of an ending."

Eddie then takes a liking to Vincent and his street-smart ex-con girlfriend Carmen(Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio who should had been or still could be a much bigger star despite her talents) to dinner and then they take a liking to him. Eddie visits Vincent at his dead end job as a toy store clerk to go on the road with him. He is reluctant but seemingly through his girlfriend, he does as Eddie gives him a new pool stick. They go on the road for Vincent to get experience as a pool player playing against tough opponents. Then Eddie splits up with Vincent & his girlfriend for them to grow up and for Vincent to become a more better pool player without Eddie's help as he runs out of advice as well as ideas. Eddie then gets back in the game that he starts out slow but then he becomes more of the younger Eddie he was before. In the end, he and Vincent, who seems more grown-up and a better pool player without Eddie, face off against one another. With three stars it should had been good.

"davehirni-1","Null","0","3","16 January 2005"," Gratuitous remake with too many defects
","Given the general nature of the material and the highly dramatic conclusion of the HUSTLER there was simply no room for a sequel--nothing else to say. Besides, didn't Bert Gordon warn Eddie not to ever walk into a big time pool again?<br/><br/>The defects of COLOR are many and varied but we can begin with the flippant quality of almost all the pool shooting scenes. The Hustler's were completely believable and dripping with authenticity. Fats and fast Eddie were pool players who took tremendous pride in their game and comported themselves with great dignity. The fact that Eddie got drunk and made an ass of himself while losing all his money to Fats was used, quite accurately, to demonstrate a major character flaw. The viewer is actually embarrassed for this giggling fool who a moment before was taking Minnesota Fats apart.<br/><br/>In COLOR, the kibitzers are frequently overly boisterous and sometimes seemingly crowding the players. In one scene, Cruise actually sets a beer on the table--an act that would result in a prompt and severe admonishment if not ejection in any decent pool room. All that Samurai stuff with the pool cue would likely have gotten his head taken off. The only character who actually slithered around the table and looked like a shooter was Grady, who showed all the grace of an actual hustler. Everyone else, including Newman and Cruise, basically resemble characters out of the game at the local YMCA. A wasted cameo by Steve Mizerak serves for emphasis.<br/><br/>There is no chemistry between Newman and Cruise or between Cruise and the young lady. At no time, despite the major premise of the movie, did I feel that these characters were even vaguely interested in one another. The ability of Paul Newman to play a driven, desperate character is central to most of his great roles, (Hombre, Hud, CH Luke) but by the time he made this movie his voice and general delivery were considerably diminished. Not that it would have mattered given this material. <br/><br/>Finally, there is always a fine line when it comes to what is honorable hustling and what is an out and out scam. No one is expected to display his best stick from the beginning of the evening, and some gamesmanship is certainly acceptable in any money game, but I found it unlikely that a man who could introduce the ""two brothers and a stranger"" ruse could actually be offended by Vincent's subsequent insistent that he accept half the payoff money from Vincent's dive he took in the match between them. (By the way, wouldn't handing that envelope to Vinny after forfeiting the match sort of make the poor guy a marked man?) <br/><br/>The final shot left room for another sequel, thank God that is unlikely to happen at this point"

","You know, as a young boy, I was not allowed to watch ""The Hustler"" for obvious reasons.  The life that Newman led as ""Fast Eddie"" Felsen took a turn of events that was not suitable for children.<br/><br/>But, as an adult and a fan of Tom Cruise (sort of), I found ""The Hustler"" on cable one night and watched it after seeing ""The Color of Money"" years ago in theaters.  To re-create a role after so many years does take talent! And Newman is loaded with it!<br/><br/>Eddie is a liquor vendor, pushing his wares in bars and pool halls.  When he meets Cruise, his blood starts to boil for the pool table like it did so many years ago until Minnesota Fats put him away.  Through Cruise's girlfriend (Mastrantonio), Newman convinces Cruise to go out and make a living off shooting pool and hustling people.  The only problem is that Cruise does not want to hustle people, he just wants to win...<br/><br/>This film takes a few twists and turns that were kind of unexpected.  The relationship between Newman and Mastrantonio was a rarely-found touch because of the different styles of the actors, themselves.  Cruise, sometimes, it seemed, was left out in the dark, playing someone who had no idea what it was all about until someone had to take a baseball bat and beat it into his head.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave this movie a six, because, although it was a good movie, there was not much to it.  When I was younger, I hardly got what Newman was trying to get across, but now I'm a little older and I realize that it was not about pool, it was about money.<br/><br/>The only thing I now find myself hoping for is that Cruise does not come out in 15 years and even attempt to put himself in Newman's shoes, trying to pass on his knowledge, because, in my mind, he didn't learn a thing!"
