","***SPOILER ALERT - I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS MOVIE! ***<br/><br/>It's a shame that this film was promoted as a ""hot"" erotic thriller. Kubrick would not have allowed that marketing campaign to go forward had he been alive.  Sure there's a lot of eroticism in this movie, but those who go to it looking for sexual thrills are going to be (and were) sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>The events in this movie are triggered by the protagonist's wife's revelation that she almost slept with another man.  This kicks off a range of emotions and prompts him to re-evaluate his sexual relationship with her, subsequently leading to a trip through his sexual SUBconscious.  This is the critical point that all too many viewers miss, though it's so overtly surreal I don't see how one could miss it.  None of this is real!  It's called Eyes Wide SHUT for a reason!<br/><br/>All of our protagonists' ""encounters"" represent manifestations of his sexual fantasies and fears.  His fantasies include group sex, sex with a teenager, sex with a prostitute, sex without strings.  His fears include disease, homosexuality (notice the brutal and brief encounter with the gay-bashing gang), and most of all: discovery.  Discovery of his hidden fantasies, which might reveal his true nature to the world.  Discovery that he is really a pretender, doesn't really belong, and is not worthy after all.  This latter is probably universal, and in his case while it has sexual dimensions it is not purely sexual.  In the end he realizes that his fantasies are just fantasies, at least some of his fears are legitimate, and that instead of just fantasizing about sex he should actually have sex with his wife.  Not rocket science here, but plenty of people need reminding of this from time to time, and it's a well-told story.<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to first see this movie in theaters overseas, and was spared the atrocity of digital editing to make things less explicit. David Lynch did the same thing more recently in Mulholland Drive, and I hope that this is not the beginning of a trend.  Given all of the explicit gore and brutality in movies, the level of sexual explicitness that triggers the censors is simply laughable.  Frankly, having seen the un-edited version, I didn't think it was a big deal.<br/><br/>One can't dismiss criticisms that the nudity was all female and many of the women were depicted as sexual objects, but this movie is quite pointedly a trip through a fairly conventional man's sexual unconscious and necessarily told from a male point of view.  So none of these things should be a surprise.  It would be very interesting to see a comparable exploration of the female sexual subconscious by an accomplished woman director, though I'm not holding my breath that the Hollywood establishment will allow that to happen soon."
"niteman","9","412","526","17 July 1999"," An impressive film with a bad marketing campaign
","Eyes Wide Shut is ill-suited for the summer movie corridor.  It has no explosions, no running, shouting, or a single gunshot.  What it has are long scenes in which characters talk to one another.  Slowly and carefully.  The problem is that the film is marketed as having white-hot sex scenes and plenty of gratuitous nudity, while it has neither.  There is plenty of naked flesh, don't get me wrong, but in exactly the opposite way that the ads make it appear.  This is not a movie about being sexy and naked -- it's a movie about how flesh is just another part of being human, so what is all the fuss about?  The marketing campaign is misleading, and led to disappointment in the audience that I saw the movie with, who were just looking for some skin.<br/><br/>The tension in the plot and the issues that the film discusses aren't telegraphed to the audience, they're hinted at in the dialog.  There is no neat resolution at the end, life simply goes on.   You may watch the whole film and think ""that wasn't about anything!"" Then think about what you've seen and realize it has a great deal to say.<br/><br/>The film is a meditation on sexuality and how it relates to marriage, death, and money.  It's a fascinating commentary on modern life, and a rare movie that dares to examine sex as impassionately as any other issue.<br/><br/>The directing and cinematography alone would be worth the price of admission without the social commentary.  The sets are an integral part of the movie; they breathe and glow and live.  Kubrick was a master director, and he uses long shots and dissolves to great effect.  Cruise and Kidman are at their best, and the supporting cast is also strong.  It's Kubrick's magic work with the camera that holds the film together.<br/><br/>All in all, definitely worth seeing for the un-uptight.  It's possible to watch this film and actually think about it for hours afterward.  That's something you won't get with the Wild, Wild West."

"Skywise-4","10","299","389","17 July 1999"," A fitting completion to Kubrick's study of humanity
","I managed to swallow my expectations before the film, setting myself to judge it on its own without judging it as a Kubrick film. No need, no need! This film IS a Kubrick film, without any doubt, and as all Kubrick films are it was absolutely stunning. Absolutely. Visually it is brilliant, though I should warn that this isn't quite as visual a film as most other Kubrick works. A lot of the film focuses on the characters, on human interaction, something rather new to this director. Of course, all the Kubrick trademarks are there, cold analytical gazes, sharp introspection. Tom Cruise seems like Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining' and even Malcolm MacDowell in 'A Clockwork Orange' at times, a rather striking fact considering that this is Tom Cruise. The performances were excellent all around, even from places not expected. Again, this is typical for Kubrick. He wasn't much of a people director, but he still knew how to direct people.<br/><br/>Almost every moment of this film was flawless, perfect and pristine. The dialog is predictable, but in some solemn and holy fateful sort of way, as though the words and the moments are matched so essentially that nothing else could possibly fit. Beyond that the sounds and images all fit together beautifully, creating an almost unblemished whole. The only part that didn't seem right was the sequence that had been digitally altered. While the alterations were not nearly so obtrusive as I had feared (not knowing about them one probably wouldn't notice them) they do grow a bit noticeable for redundancy (you see a lot more backs than you'd expect, and always in the same places). Unfortunately these came right in the middle of one of the most visually amazing pieces of the film (one of the most amazing pieces of cinema as a whole, in my opinion), a very unwelcome distraction.<br/><br/>Is this movie about sex? Yes, it is, but more importantly it is about people. The sex part is simply a product thereof. This is one of the most disturbingly honest portraits of human behavior and motivations ever made. The most honest I've ever seen, at least. To be put simply: It is about sex because people are about sex.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to sort through this movie. It's been a good twelve hours since I saw it, and I can still feel it, hard and definite, rotating in my stomach. The film itself seems mostly void of opinion (not entirely, but mostly), serving more as a general statement and commentary than any specific moral warning, but the questions it inspires are very strong indeed. The film, being objective, provides no answers, no justification for humanity. There is no redemption, either, none whatsoever. The film's final word sums it (it being the film and humanity) up pretty well, for better or for worse. I guess that depends on you.<br/><br/>A common thread in Kubrick's films since 2001 has been the contemplation and examination of human intentions, the essence of human behavior. Motivations. He's shown us violence and madness and everything else, all tracking the path back to the dawn of man. I think he finally figured it out with this film, however anticlimactic the discovery might have been. At least he did finally figure it out. That's something.<br/><br/>I am one of many. I never had the privilege to know Stanley Kubrick. I don't even know that privilege is the right word. I do know his films, though, and while I am in no position to say that I will miss him as a person, I can say, without doubt or hesitation, that I will miss him as a filmmaker."
"JFHunt","10","560","752","25 September 2005"," Kubrick's Gift to us all. ""I have seen one or two things in my life but never, never anything like this.""
","I'm sitting here trying to come up with a clever comment about this movie to make you want to see it. When in reality it doesn't matter what I say. As Stallone would say ""I'm at least half a bum."" The truth to it is, it kind of makes me sad that I'll probably never see another movie that affects so much. Never experience a film that 6 years after it's release, I still can not forget.<br/><br/>To say the most, it's a powerful film. The directing is world class. The camera work is haunting and the soundtrack gives me chills. It's Cruise at his finest. He is so convincing that one might actually believe that this guy is Doctor Bill Harford and this really did happen to him. And that my friends is the definition of acting. The seriousness of the situation fades away with a stern smile as the plot thickens.<br/><br/>To say the least it is one of those movies you could watch over and over again. To be honest with you, I didn't buy it the first time I saw it. I thought it was good, but not great. Then one day I was bored, so I decided to see it again. And that's when it happened. Kubrick came alive. I became infected by his genius and captivated by Cruise's portrayal. His realization and his detail.<br/><br/>It's hard to pick my favorite scene in the movie. I couldn't pretend if I tried. I particularly love the opening party scene. That leads to a ""Baby did a bad bad thing"". Cruise being assaulted on the street being so eloquently called a fag. The prostitute. From the piano bar to the costume shop. And finally, the unionized orgy party, that I find hard to believe doesn't really exist. Maybe only guys like Kubrick or Cruise will ever really know if they do or not.<br/><br/>Many people might disagree with me when I say Eyes Wide Shut is one of the greatest films. But how come I think it is every time I watch it? To me, it's more than a beautiful work of art. More than a visceral painted picture or a haunting melody. It's a masterpiece that should be treasured."

","Stanley Kubrick's final film is perhaps the first of its kind: it is the only film I have watched that exists within the state of death itself. It's no surprise; Stanley Kubrick died 4 days after submitting the final print into Warner Bros., Sydney Pollock died in 2008 and my grandparents, who saw this film at a screening in 1999, are dead. However, these aren't merely the reasons this film evokes a death-like state, this film evokes a death-like state throughout Bill Harford's sexual odyssey. During the Masonic orgy, which is arguably the film's center-piece, women are used and discarded as corpses who are only valued for their material gain. This film is shroud in ultra-violet blue, especially at the end of the film where it accentuates the characters' trembling flesh and vulnerable humanity, and the powerful red which contrasts against this blue reflects one of Kubrick's favorite themes: dominance. Perhaps it's inexplicable that Eyes Wide Shut evokes a man's dying thoughts. Ironically, this film feels more fresh and timeless than many of its contemporaries, only reaffirming the inestimable value of Kubrick's contributions to cinema and a decade of a cinematic drought aptly followed his death. It was fashionable to deride Stanley Kubrick's final film during its theatrical run, regardless of the fact that he considered it his personal favorite. It seems that the audience expected Kubrick to inundate them with gratuitous eroticism as opposed to ideas. Yet, Eyes Wide Shut has outsmarted time and the film industry itself. It was almost incongruously released a week before American Pie and the abysmal Will Smith star vehicle Wild Wild West. It continues to hold a mere 7.2/10 on IMDb in contrast to escapist science-fiction film The Matrix which holds an 8.7/10 rating and is listed in the top 30 films of all time, above Kubrick's more cerebral science-fiction classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. All of this may be due to the fact that Kubrick argued that 'Observancy is a dying art' and Eyes Wide Shut requires an attention to detail and an attention span that transcends the average summer blockbuster; it's easy to get lost in the terrifying labyrinth of Kubrick's musings. Though, unlike other films, Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut refutes the transcendent imagery and magic that is featured in the majority of Kubrick's films, even in Eyes Wide Shut itself, and strips humanity down to its fragile human core, figuratively speaking; Kubrick comes to the conclusion that when man is confronted with the cold and harsh reality, he favors comforting self-delusion and blissful ignorance.<br/><br/>Sydney Pollock's Ziegler argues, during his amazing final monologue, that the Masonic orgies are practiced by society's elite which excludes Bill. Bill spends the duration of the film's first half attempting to engage in infidelity after his wife reveals that she was willing to choose one night with a naval officer over their future. Naturally, this enrages Bill and he spends the night attempting to fulfill his personal need to subjugate his feelings of impotence, sexual and otherwise. Even in the very beginning, when Bill walks with two models, his short stature implicitly denotes his lack of power. Bill is convinced that he has been subjected to a life of domesticity and his wife is responsible; he vows to reaffirm his masculinity. Kubrick paints long shots of New York at midnight which is designed to inspire the viewer with dread. Almost every single beautiful shot capturing the very essence of soft, warm colors in the beginning soon descends into the dark and strong colors that reflect the very dream-state many describe when they watch this film. Yet, to me, it evokes a foreboding death-like state which suggests impending doom. <br/><br/>Bill's quest for reaffirmation of his masculinity only renders him emasculated when he enters a Masonic orgy and is rendered socially powerless by a group of the masked elite. Bill's journey neither leads him towards enlightenment nor satisfaction but humiliation and understanding that he has been domesticated by the higher classes. Ironically, his quest for sexual empowerment only led him to the understanding of social domesticity; Bill is not as influential or elite as he had initially anticipated. Not unlike the elite's perception of women; they use the high-class prostitutes as objects valued for their material value which reflects their perception of the masses that are responsible for their success. As in the beginning, when Ziegler needs Bill to revive a dying woman who almost overdoses on a combination of cocaine and heroin, Ziegler values Bill for his medical expertise which prevented trouble with the law rather than his personality. Kubrick's film argues that we live in ignorance of others perceptions of us and this is the ultimate existential fear of Harford; the elite have seen Harford unmasked, vulnerable and exposed. Pollock says 'If you knew who was there, you wouldn't sleep so well.' Kubrick has finally exposed man for who he really is; vulnerable and ignorant of the mysterious forces which govern him. The final and most playfully complex of cinema's closing lines concludes that Bill and Alice Harford have learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. They refuse to acknowledge their social impotence and would prefer for their eyes to remain wide shut, ignorant to the mysterious forces that govern them. On a more optimistic note, however, perhaps Bill's odyssey only made him aware of his vulnerability, and Kubrick evokes this through the dark imagery that recreates the sense of subjective paranoia that Bill is experiencing. Bill realizes what ultimately matters: love and family, as opposed to the power which he initially craved but only realized he was at the mercy of others' application of such social power. I'm open to many interpretations of this film, because Kubrick wanted the audience's eyes to remain wide open soon after they finished experiencing this masterpiece."
"weezer-5","10","178","240","18 July 1999"," A haunting dream of sexual obsession.
","I admit that I'm part of the Kubrick cult(people that follow his movies like a religion), and I was first in line to see this movie.  Being a huge movie fan I've seen a wide variety of movies, and have walked away from them with a wide variety of emotions.  This was the first movie to put me in a trance, or dream, like state.  The way the movie was shot, lighted, and so on gave the feel of a dream (to me at least).  I believe that this feel is just what was needed and what Kubrick wanted.  Everyone has to admit to thinking about the dark side of sex, and I believe that in this movie we see that a person can explore the buried desires of their sexual id and still come away a good person.<br/><br/>I'm guessing that this was a very personal movie for Kubrick.  He seemed to take Cruise's character to places that he, personally, wished he could explore.  Places, like a prostitute or an orgy, that he'd like to visit, but not want to stay at very long.<br/><br/>Praise has to go to Cruise and Kidman for their performances.  Cruise was able to strip away his movie star veneer that seems to protect him in all of his other movies, and bring through the clouded, tormented, and unsure heart of a jealous man.  Kidman must have known that part of her role was to be eye candy, but she fought through that and gave the movie's best performance.<br/><br/>To anyone out there thinking about seeing the movie.....I say go.  Some will hate it and others will love it, but half the fun of the movie lies in the discussions that will blossom from this great movie experience."
"Jaime N. Christley","9","254","355","16 July 1999"," Remarkable finale to a long, glorious career
","The thing a lot of folks haven't liked about Stanley Kubrick's films is the fact that he always seemed to think the audience needed some points driven home a little harder than others.  Very little is left for debate; most everything is spelled out, pressed hard, and dwelled upon.  His critics have compared the long waits between his films to the long periods of waiting that occur while watching his films.<br/><br/>Personally, I like the long, slow scenes in his films.  When they're filled with something:  music, movement, thought, memory of a previous scene, dread, or any other emotion, they can never really be said to be empty.  I like them because, with Kubrick, I can be sure that they're absolutely essential to his ultimate vision.  He could have put out a six-hour documentary on tissue manufacturing; at least I'll know that not one minute of screen time is wasted.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" isn't as vacuous as, say, ""Barry Lyndon"" or ""The Shining."" Compared to those two, this one scoots along like a person trying to get to his car in the rain.  It'll try a lot of folks' patience, I'm sure -- even his most loyal fans will be bothered by the incessant piano ""bell tolls"" in the soundtrack of some scenes, or the constant reminders (in imaginary flashbacks) that Cruise's character is bothered by his wife's near-infidelity.  I know I was.<br/><br/>Despite that, it's an apt final film for the long, glorious career of a man who has done more for the cinema, with less movies, than can ever be catalogued.  To try and cite influences for this particular work is futile. Though one might draw parallels to Lindsay Anderson's ""O Lucky Man!"" or Martin Scorsese's ""After Hours,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is no less than a complete work from the cold heart and brilliant mind of Stanley Kubrick alone. It's also a furiously ingenious piece of filmmaking, one that works less on the emotions than on the senses and on the mind.  Unlike most of Kubrick's earlier work, however, it does have an emotional subtext, which is used to devastating effect.<br/><br/>Cruise, by the way, does an outstanding job, not as a trained, camera-conscious film actor, but as a mature, seasoned performer.  Here he uses his ""Top Gun""/""Jerry Maguire"" suavity to malicious effect; like Ryan O'Neal's Barry Lyndon before him, he's an egotistical cad.  Unlike Lyndon, he gains our sympathy -- that's key to keeping us from disowning his character and thus negating the entire film.<br/><br/>Kidman is given less screen time, but it matters little.  She's mostly seen in the beginning, and she has brief (but crucial) scenes throughout, and a masterful one at the end.  It is safe to say that this is her best performance to date, and those of us who have been ignoring her treasured abilities up until now (the Academy, critics, myself) will be astounded to see how far she's come since ""Dead Calm.""  Her high points:  the argument with her husband that ends by setting the film's plot in motion perfectly captures the way women lure men into arguments when the cause for one is nonexistent (and on Cruise's part, how men can't think fast enough to do anything about it), and her dream confession scene, in which she wakes laughing but becomes tearful during recollection.<br/><br/>On a technical level, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" displays Kubrick's trademark perfectionism.  Recreating Vietnam in rural England for ""Full Metal Jacket"" must have been nearly impossible, but the unrelenting accuracy in recreating uptown and downtown New York City is absolutely stunning.  Right down to the diners and the newspaper stands; I shake my head in awe when I remind myself that Kubrick (a native Brooklynite) hasn't been to NYC in decades.  The lighting and photography is impeccable, also, as it is in every one of his films.<br/><br/>This is the sort of film one sees more than once.  Once is good to cleanse the palate, to clear out all the residual toxins left from other recent films.  See it again, perhaps a third time, and get to appreciate the graceful, nearly unblemished finale of a man who took the art of cinema seriously.  It's a sobering experience."
"Holden-17","9","502","732","18 July 1999"," Be prepared to think
","There is no denying that Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live.  He may not have made many films, but every single one of them is a masterpiece.  That is not something that can be said about many other directors.  He is a true artist.  And it is because of that word, ""art"", that his work is often misunderstood.  Rather than create films which reveal everything that the audience needs to know through the dialogue or the action, Kubrick layers his films with meaning.  He does this through all aspects of the film.. the music, the images, the dialogue, and expressions. And by the end of the film, nothing is left clear, because he wants you to think about what you have seen, and come up with your own meaning for the film.  The problem with this is that most people don't go to see films to think, they just want to see the next ""Armageddon"" or ""Waterboy"".  So, if ""Eyes Wide Shut"" fails at the box-office, or is badly criticized by movie-goers, it has nothing to do with the film itself, but is more reflective of the movie-goers, and their inability to see further than what is presented to them on the screen.  Life experience and a philosophical mind is also required to fully understand and enjoy this film.  If you have ever thought of what role sex plays in your relationship, and what love and commitment really mean, you will understand this film.  If you have ever considered what the difference between love and sex is, you will understand this film.  If you have ever truly felt lust, you will understand this film.  Be prepared to think."
"SKG-2","10","144","212","19 July 1999"," Kubrick's final masterpiece
","After three years of waiting, EYES WIDE SHUT has finally come out.  So now after all this time, the delays, the rumors, the teases, the sad death of its director, Stanley Kubrick, we finally get to answer the question, Does it live up to the hype?  For the first time this year, the answer to that question is a resounding yes.  This is, so far, the best film I've seen this year, and it deserves its place among other Kubrick masterpieces like DR. STRANGELOVE, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.<br/><br/>Although I had been looking forward to this film, I must admit I was unsure about it at first.  After all, since CLOCKWORK, Kubrick's films(BARRY LYNDON, THE SHINING, and FULL METAL JACKET), while having some good parts, have all been somewhat flawed, particularly THE SHINING.  But my misgivings were quickly put to rest within the opening scenes, where we get a glimpse of both what's right on the surface(nine happy years of marriage, wealth, a healthy 7 year old daughter, both husband and wife with jobs) and the possibility of storms that lurk underneath(the practiced way they get ready for the party, hardly looking at each other), and I stayed enthralled throughout.<br/><br/>Now I'd like to use this forum to deflect some of the criticisms I've read of the movie so far.  One, of course, is that this is not really New York City, but a soundstage in England.  I've lived in New York City and visited several times, and the surface details seem right, but more importantly, this is set in the ""rich"" area of Manhattan, which has always been idealized in movies(particularly the Woody Allen ones), and thus it's appropriate in a dream-like movie to play to the fantasy of the city, rather than the reality.<br/><br/>Secondly, we are given no hint that this is a dream Cruise's character may be walking in, since it looks so real(yes, that's inconsistent with the criticism up above, but to be fair, I've only seen a couple of reviews which make that mistake).  First of all, dreams rarely look like they were designed by Salvador Dali(at least, my dreams).  Secondly, if the whole nighttime sequence looked like a dream and nothing else, we would laugh when Cruise goes back to the various places he visited at night; how would he know to go back to them if they weren't real?  Finally, in the way the narrative unspools, it's played like a dream, complete with scene where he might be awakening(the scene with Domino(Vinessa Shaw), the prostitute, where his cell phone rings and Kidman is on the phone right before he can do any damage).<br/><br/>Thirdly, that Kidman is only in the film for 40 minutes of its 2 hour, 40 minute running length.  Now granted, that is all of her screen time, but when Cruise enters his ""dream state"", she is always in back of his mind, not just in the flashback scenes(when he imagines her having sex with the sailor she had fantasies about), but in the fact that all the other women he comes across are meant to make him think of Kidman.  And her performance is certainly strong enough(especially in her monologues) to linger in the mind.<br/><br/>Fourth, that Cruise is completely flat here.  Again, at least in the dreams I've had and read about, often in dreams we react to events, not provoke them, and that's what his character does.  Secondly, Kubrick and Cruise play off of his image, to make him the object of desire of everyone he meets, and not just women(I like to think the scenes where he's harassed by a group of teenage thugs who think he's gay, and where hotel concierge Alan Cumming seems to be coming on to him, are Kubrick's way of joking about the rumors of Cruise being gay which have dogged him).  For all of that, I think he plays it exactly right.<br/><br/>Finally, that the film is flat and not really sexy.  Once again, unless it's a nightmare, dreams aren't played at MTV speed.  Secondly, contrary to what we heard at first about the film, this isn't about sex.  Rather, this is about sexual obsession, so it's not supposed to be about sex the act.  It may seem like the film cheats a little by asking us to play off our expectations of Cruise and Kidman as a couple, so we just picture in our heads them having sex, rather than us seeing it, but isn't it good that some things are left to our imagination?  Besides, it's only on the surface that things look good, as I said before.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to read DREAM STORY, the novella this is based on, and so have no answer to those who claim this is a poor adaptation(though what some have called stilted dialogue I think adds to the dreamlike quality, and I'm normally on the lookout for flat dialogue), and that may be true.  But this is an excellent film, a fitting epitaph for Kubrick, and proof once again that Cruise can act when he's teamed with a real director."

","Remember the Wizard of Oz? Dorothy travels to somewhere over the rainbow, follows the yellow brick road and meets the Wizard. He's a fearsome figure with a mask...but behind the mask is a fragile little man who is hiding behind his fake persona.<br/><br/>Now...let's apply that idea to marriage. We all wear masks, don't we? We put on a persona and we hide the truth. The wife asks if you've ever been attracted to other women and you deny it. You pretend not to notice anyone else, to spare her feelings.<br/><br/>So Stanley Kubrick wants to look at this idea of honesty in marriage and relationships. People naked, having sex, yet wearing masks to hide their faces, their true identities, their thoughts. What a clever image! It's a complete mirror image opposite of what we see in the world, people with bodies covered and faces exposed. Is he saying we are at our least honest when we have sex?<br/><br/>When Alice Harford opens up to her husband, when she ""unmasks"" and reveals her fantasies about another man, it stuns Dr. Bill Harford to the very core. Her honesty is too much for him. Kubrick let's us know we're in an adult Wizard of Oz. Two girls tell Bill they are taking him to ""where the rainbow ends"". Rainbow colored Christmas tree lights are in almost every shot and Bill gets a mask from ""Rainbow costumes"". And yellow...the color of that brick road, is all about. A yellow cab takes Bill on his journey to the orgy of masked, yet otherwise naked, bodies.<br/><br/>When Bill finally goes home, he finds his mask on his wife's pillow. It seems Alice has got his number. He too ""unmasks"" and confesses. Kubrick seems to be suggesting that temptation is dangerous and that the wisest and safest thing a man can do is go home to his wife and get honest with her. Take off the mask, have the courage to expose the fragile man behind the false persona.<br/><br/>The other nice thing is the final moment where Alice tells Bill they need to have sex as soon as possible. Sex is an act and perhaps Kubrick is also suggesting people should do it rather than talk about it if they want a happy marriage.<br/><br/>As a metaphor of human psychology, Eyes Wide Shut seems to be a film about the value of marriage and family life, and perhaps a film which encourages honestly between men and women, too. As a piece of film making, it's typically outstanding work for the meticulous Mr.Kubrick. It's also a very positive and optimistic film, suggesting that love, marriage and family can resist temptation and the dangers that temptation might bring. All in all, a superb motion picture from a true master of the movies.<br/><br/>A final word about Cruise and Kidman. Both worked long and hard, more than a year of shooting, with Stanley Kubrick and their efforts are deserving of appreciation. They both do some of their finest ever work."
"murtaza_mma","10","81","129","8 December 2009"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Kubrick's swan song, and arguably his greatest
","Stanley Kubrick is unarguably Anglo-American cinema's most potent reply to the 'Fellinis', the 'Bunuels', the 'Bergmans', the 'Kurosawas', the 'Rays', and the 'Tarkovskys' of the world. Ubiquitously known for his inexorable yearning for perfection and uncanny innovation, Kubrick had managed to hold millions of viewers worldwide in a transfixion through his brilliant works for well over four decades. Regarded by Kubrick as his very best, Eyes Wide Shut is incredibly brilliant and sui generis. It's an elixir for the sore eyes; a panacea for the perturbed souls; a surreally psychedelic pleasure. Like most of his avant-garde works, Eyes Wide Shut is open to speculation and can be interpreted in a number of ways. <br/><br/>Despite being rife with nudity, Eyes Wide Shut cannot be stigmatized or snubbed on the account of eroticism. On the contrary, it is aesthetic as well as thought-provoking. The movie incredibly manages to have a tremendous impact on the intellect as well as the viscera, asking incessant questions of the viewer while simultaneously haunting his thoughts and refining his imagination. The story revolves around a New York based doctor whose wife's confession of ephemeral infidelity perplexes him. Consequently, his chagrin and dudgeon drives him into a night of debauchery where he gets a lesson on sexual and moral enlightenment, which inexplicably saves him from an incipient turmoil. The cinematography is awe-inspiring to say the least and is well complemented by the plaintively haunting background score. The orgy scene, which is treated with contempt by many, is undoubtedly one of the most vivid scenes ever visualized or choreographed in the history of cinema. In fact, it is Kubrick's brilliant showmanship that makes it so very special. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is absolutely brilliant and convincing in the challenging portrayal of Dr. Harford and succeeds in having an enormous impact on the viewers and also manages to evoke their empathy. The nocturnal odyssey being rife with debauchery and decadence, ironically serves as a lesson of moral reformation. Nicole Kidman is ravishingly scintillating in her portrayal. The couple has incredibly managed to mirror their real life chemistry and tension on screen. <br/><br/>The movie is a quintessence of cinematic excellence and can only be relished by discarding bigotry, conservatism and prejudice. The movie is a delectable feast and a must watch for patient viewers and lovers of avant-garde cinema. 10/10<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
"pooch-8","Null","94","156","19 July 1999"," Compelling, complex observation of fidelities and fantasies
","With the exception of a late-occurring scene of deadening over-explanation wholly unnecessary to the film on every level (and rather unusual for Kubrick), Eyes Wide Shut is utterly sensational, and represents another gleaming jewel in the master filmmaker's already studded crown.  Cruise and Kidman surpass all of their previous work, turning in spectacular performances infused with nuances only hinted at prior to this outing. Their real-life union appears to bring every bit of unique tension Kubrick intended, as the movie wholly depends on the verisimilitude of the central couple's relationship.  Kubrick's tone fulfills all the promise of the title, consistently delivering an elevated texture of almost uncanny imagination perpetually hovering between fantasy and reality.  The director additionally mines many of his familiar thematic concerns, including deceit, paranoia, and blinding frustration.  Eyes Wide Shut is certain to be as closely scrutinized as many of Kubrick's other films (particularly because it is his final work), and its thoughtful and challenging treatment of such lightning-rod topics as marital honesty, sexual jealousy, and the perceived risks of disclosing one's fantasies (even to the single person you trust more than any other) is sure to draw some people in while pushing others away."

","I admire the work of Stanley Kubrick very much.  All his films remain in my mind with a vitality far beyond most of the other work I see, even though the details of the films are often boring or inscrutable.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is no exception - there were many times in the movie where I could find no meaning or interest in an individual moment, but the overall experience is a lingering one with a deep impact - maybe Kubrick works the magic of making the spectator really _feel_ the characters turmoil and inner struggles by including so much of the mundane and seemingly unrelated incidents of ""real life"".<br/><br/>A fine conclusion to an excellent career.<br/><br/>p.s., being in Canada I had to put up with the ""edited"" version, which was certainly not subtle in its censorship.  Oddly enough the couple beside me walked out from boredom, not sexual squeamishness.  Should have digitally added some gunfights."

","I remember when Kubrick passed away. I read it in the morning newspaper, and was struck with deep sadness I couldn't explain. Mind you, I was not even 12 years old at the time and had barely seen any of his films. <br/><br/>So I went to see ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999) at the cinema. I credit it, along with Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998), as an experience that ignited my interest in film, since they were both films like I had never seen before. Sure, there's that one reason why a young lad might be interested in this, but I was so struck by its atmosphere and narrative flow that I had to read Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle"". And how disappointed I was in how unalike they were. The film was in a world of its own that had a sense of time that was its own, a sense of colour that was its own, a sense of light that was its own. Every movement was languid, every word deliberate.<br/><br/>I never really thought about the connection between this and Malick's film until now, but really, they both move in the realm of dreams and memories and projected, subjective realities – between something that did happen (to someone) and something that might have happened. There's ellipsis, ambiguity, metaphor. Both work their magic in visual terms. I'm soaked in that light from the ball even by recalling the images in my mind as I'm writing this.<br/><br/>Fidelio – enter."

","WARNING: Below are character and plot revelations, and the liberal use of the F-word in all its Anglo-Saxon glory. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK:<br/><br/>-- Do they 'do' it?  No.<br/><br/>-- Does he 'do' it? No. <br/><br/>-- Does anyone actually DO *anything* at all, ever? No. {thereby wasting two and a half hours of perfectly good time that could have been spent filing my nails. Which reminds me of a really good JAP joke, but... never mind.}<br/><br/>Bias going in: Expecting, hoping, maybe even needing to worship at the feet of the Master. <br/><br/>In no particular order:<br/><br/>Casting:<br/><br/>Bummer. Cruise is about a hundred years too young for the part. The book (and film it 'inspired'... a direct quote from the closing credits) calls for a man approaching young middle age, life-philosophy and habits set in the stone of an already closed mind. In other words, a jaded man as complacent as any white male at the pinnacle of a societally-valued career can be -- and who is about to have the core of his smug little being shaken to its roots. An Everyman, yes -- but a man, not a boy.<br/><br/>
Kidman: Eye-candy disguised as a window-dressing plot device. A pun on the title that's only too apt, I'm afraid. She has no career, no goals, no... I was about to say 'dreams and desires' but that would be only figuratively true. She has them 'literally' so Cruise can play off them, but in the sense they exist at all, they exist for him alone, as do all the other women in the film. What she does have, however, is a great butt. To-Die-For great. ==cough, cough=> Kidman/Cruise, as couple and chemistry: More interesting, because it was both good and bad. I can see the attraction for Kubrick; the ready-made comfort level that would allow him to make the first scene (her taking a casual pee while Cruise responds to her 'how do I look?' with 'great, as always') work. But. That same level of unstrived-for coupleness that comes after ten years of marriage is also... boring. I don't mean the sort of boring-for-the-sake-of-him-kicking-over-the-traces banality that would incite a viewer to wonder what lay beneath the calluses, but a real been-there, done-that quality that came through *despite* Kubrick's intentions. <br/><br/>Given all the above, the cynic in me wonders (and will never know) if the only way to get Her marvelously sculpted butt was to hire His cute little manicured face.<br/><br/>Script:<br/><br/>Think of a primer on writing that warns against 'on-the-nose' dialogue by giving examples. This entire script could be used to fill it. Right down to the 50-point type, front page, carefully-placed-to-look-like-a-throwaway newspaper headline that screams the film's message: LUCKY TO BE ALIVE!  And entire speeches revealing motive and mindset have been lifted in their entirety from the book and plunked here---a mere seventy-three years and a galaxy far, far, away---later. There's more---lots more---but I'm depressed just thinking about it.<br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>-- Kidman almost has a late afternoon zipless f**k... but doesn't.<br/><br/>-- Cruise almost has two early evening super-models super f**ks... but doesn't.<br/><br/>-- Kidman almost goes off with an aging Hungarian lothario... but doesn't.<br/><br/>-- Cruise almost sleeps with a hooker... but doesn't.<br/><br/>-- Cruise learns that he almost slept with a hooker... with AIDS... and is glad he hadn't.<br/><br/>-- Cruise almost kisses a dead woman... but doesn't.<br/><br/>-- Cruise almost gives in to irrational sexual jealousy... but doesn't.<br/><br/>-- Cruise almost gets laid at an orgy... but doesn't.<br/><br/>-- Cruise almost gets in trouble at an orgy... but doesn't.<br/><br/>-- Cruise almost has to strip at an orgy... but doesn't.<br/><br/>-- Cruise almost has his comfy little apple cart of a life upset... and I sincerely wish it had been.<br/><br/>Shall I go on, or have I laid bare the bones of a film that was overheard in the bathroom afterward as: ""Too slooow, and jeez, nothing ever happened.""<br/><br/>Visuals: The orgy was just silly and overlong, as were most of the other scenes. The use of color: red for sexuality and blue for emotion (I think; they just blurred after a while) has been done before, and better in films like Jou Dou, Raise High the Red Lantern and especially TC,TT,HWAHL.<br/><br/>
Pace: Glacial, which would be forgiven if there were a pay-off. And even so, thirty minutes could easily be cut with no loss to anyone.<br/><br/>Concept:<br/><br/>Mind-blowing news just discovered by the original writer of the novella and the otherwise brilliant director of the movie: women *like* to f**k!<br/><br/>
--  Film at eleven.<br/><br/>Sigh. This was by far the film's most egregious fault: it was made at least thirty years too late. <br/><br/>Kubrick's widow said that he became obsessed with the book (which she wisely refused to read, feeling that all that 'psychological conversation' was boringly passe, and Schnitzler's failed attempt to overlay new-fangled Freudian theory on old-fashioned Burghers, lame) in 1968. Maybe... a big maybe... if Kubrick had made the film then, transforming fin de siecle Vienna into an insight on the so-called sexual revolution taking place in middle-class America, it might have worked. But now? <br/><br/>Aside from the fact that there was nothing in that 'orgy' (ridiculous R, or NC-17 version) that isn't seen nightly on Spice channel *ads* -- the film destroyed the book's main conceit: That middle-class matrons so longed to be f**ked silly (an impossible 'dream' at a time and place where, according to Schnitzler, woman married just to lose their virginity in a societally approved way), and middle-class men so longed to be freed (if only for a few hours, and only anonymously) of their Madonna/Whore complex -- that a if-you-reveal-our-secret-you-die club flourished in the shadows. A club where otherwise sexually repressed men could live out their frightening Freudian fantasies and even more repressed women could give in to their penis envy by engulfing a few dozen at a time, and where getting caught could mean expulsion from decent society, loss of children, or worse. What a titillating idea... then.  <br/><br/>In Eyes Wide Shut however, aging, wealthy men pay to be serviced by young, beautiful hookers with great tits and no sags, blemishes, untrimmed bikini lines or cellulite. Wow -- is that a nouveau concept, or what? Oh, and despite the fact that it's the *man* who's supposedly being stripped bare (it's Cruise's movie all the way) there's no male nudity of course, blemished or otherwise -- except for two unclothed, sort of heaving, chests. Worse: by not tackling what is true of marriage today -- that in a society which encourages us to experiment in every possible way with our bodies, but never our hearts, minds and souls, keeping the sexual frisson alive while married to the same person for even ten years is damn difficult -- Kubrick missed his chance to bring his genius to bear on his vision.<br/><br/>
And so that which in 1926 might have been erotic, is today laughable. Cruise is jealous because of Kidman's unrealized *fantasy* (after ten years of faithful marriage, no less)? Hell, what long-married couple doesn't *use* those fantasies as the over-the-counter equivalent of Viagra? Along with visual aids and toys from the neighborhood sex shop. Hotel guest and Cabana boy (Mad About You), anyone? Master and Maid? Liddy and Bob play Doctor and the Drugstore? Well, you get the point. <br/><br/>Tension:<br/><br/>Over what -- that rich, powerful men in masks pay for group sex and might be discovered doing it? Booking a spot on Letterman and bragging about being a club member is more like it. Kidman feeling like Cruise is taking her for granted? Tune in to Oprah. Kidman's sobbing in *terror* and *shame* while recounting a dream in which she'd been willingly f**ked by countless men? Puh-lease. I swear, D.H. is standing in the wings, laughing himself silly and wondering when the remake of Lady Chatterly will be done, and which part Adam Sandler will play. In fact, the only real tension in nearly three hours was unintentional. At the very end, when Kidman and Cruise are patting each other's backs for being such lucky ducks and staying safely married despite the wicked temptations around them, all I could think about was their young daughter, who'd been left to wander alone in what looked like F.A.O. Schwartz for an interminable time -- long enough to be grabbed by some really dangerous modern character and spirited away -- and all I wanted to do was yell 'go find your child, you insufferable clods!'  A sign, I suppose, that I wasn't exactly moved by either of them, or their 'plight'.<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary."
"jrp3313","Null","22","34","13 July 2004"," Bill's Dream
","Spoiler Alert I saw Eyes Wide Shut for the fifth time this weekend. The first time I saw it at the theater, I was not really that impressed with it. Tom Cruise was out of his league on this film. The crying scene was unbelievable. I did not buy it!<br/><br/>The next time I saw it, I looked past the acting and the content was fascinating. Is cheating in your heart/dream/wish etc. the same as the actual physical act of cheating? I kept thinking about the line from former President Carter when he said he had ""lusted in his heart."" I was in high shool at the time and I thought it was way too much information for anyone over 40 let alone the President of the United States. <br/><br/>How you view this movie depends on where you are in your life. But this is no great revelation to anyone who is an Eyes Wide Shut or Kubrick groupie.<br/><br/>I just wanted to make one point that I thought of upon this viewing of the movie. In the past, I have always been mind-boggled by the plot repetition among characters, Alice as a sect member, etc. This time, I saw that maybe the entire movie may be Bill's dream. I have never understood why Alice would or even admit to giving up her child for one night with the stranger. This began my thinking that the entire point of view is that of a man, Bill.<br/><br/>He is the one who fantasizes about his wife with another man. He is the viewer and commentator on all sexual situations. He judges Victor Ziegler on his world of cultish sex but it is he who infiltrated this world to satisfy his own purient interests. Bill turns down the advances of a sick patient's daughter after he has just died, again passing judgment on his wife's confession of a similar situation just a few moments earlier. Tom Later calls the daughter when he is looking for sex only to have her fiancé answer the phone. Twice his interludes with a prostitute are interrupted, once by a call from his wife and then by a positive hiv test.<br/><br/>Bill's adventure into the world of sex orgies, prostitutes and sexual confessions of a wife read like the dreams of a middle-aged man not sexually satisfied. Keys that make me think it is a dream are 1) Alice admission that she would give up her daughter for sex with a stranger, 2) even the street names are fictitious, i.e. Wren Street, 3) if he were on a mission to have sex, in one night don't you think Bill could get some in New York, 4) Bill's continuing to investigate the organization and he has been warned and his family may be in danger and finally when Alice said at the end of the film that they need to fu--!<br/><br/>All these issue lead me to believe that this is a dream of Bill's where he contemplates how sex with his wife and another man stimulates him. Alice's confessions inspire him to begin his sexual adventures without repercussion. Kind of, you cheated on me now I can cheat on you. If there was an Eyes Wide Shut 2, I believe that Bill may not have the need to explore sexual liaisons outside his marriage once he awakens from his eyes wide shut."
"Rogue-4","1","188","356","20 September 1999"," Limp story-telling wrapped up as semi-intellectual nonsense
","And so the last chapter of the Kubrick enigma is written. Trouble is, the real enigma is why anyone thought there was one to start with.<br/><br/>There is a danger that Eyes Wide Shut will become, as Kubrick's last movie and the one he died making, some sort of cinematic Holy Grail, immune to all criticism. But it deserves to be said: this is a bad film. Story is glossed over with ambiguity and characterisation eliminated for, well, nothing in particular. <br/><br/>The primary problem is that it is a film lacking in any direction whatsoever - by the mid-way point it could have turned into an excellent thriller, or gone in another direction and been an equally compelling look at the two main character's relationship with each other. Indeed, it spent two hours building up both of these plots, but failed to deliver on either. Instead, it wandered off for the last hour in no particular direction and consistently failed to expand any of its ideas into anything resembling a plot-line, ending with a insultingly limp coda where everything was forgotten, forgiven and plastered over. It is as if halfway through, Kubrick changed his mind about what the film was about and then changed it back again for the last half hour, leaving neither element explored to any great degree.<br/><br/>Like most of Kubrick's films, the characters are bland, narrow and un-engaging; Tom Cruise's character bumbles from one unrelated event to the next, purely on the motivation that he feels the need to cheat on his marriage because he misjudged his wife's ability to fantasise. There is no structure to his movements through the film. It's all rather aimless. It's all rather pointless. His breakdown at the end is all the more ridiculous because he didn't actually do anything except spend a hideous amount of money not doing it. If this is an accurate analysis of relationships in the nineties, heaven help us all.<br/><br/>The one sub-plot that actually promises to engage any interest - a piano player friend has a job at a party that Cruise contrives to sneak into - is presented in a manner worthy of Hitchcock. The resulting party is suitably weird and has a darkly threatening conclusion. Another twenty minutes are spent turning the screws up a notch or two further. You reach a point where you are genuinely on the edge of your seat and then the whole thing fizzles out, to be left with the feeling that surely that can't be all there is to it? Maybe you have to tune in again next week for the second part...<br/><br/>What we are left with is an hour in the middle of the film that was completely unnecessary to the relationship of the two main protagonists, which seems to have been the main point of the film. All it serves is to inject a little weirdness into what would otherwise have been a rather banal story about the sexual jealousies of two spoiled middle-class New Yorkers. But even this isn't taken anywhere really interesting. Instead of seeing the characters under a microscope, you feel as if you watching them from the wrong end of a pair of binoculars. Any interest comes from your own desperate attempts to bring the various plot points together in some sort of cohesion.<br/><br/>Most frustratingly, the film is littered with well-rounded, interesting characters and ideas and, like all Kubrick films, is beautifully shot. But this simply isn't enough to make it a compelling piece of cinema. Like 2001, A Clockwork Orange and the second half of Full Metal Jacket, there is no emotional attachment to the subject - everything is presented rather coldly and clinically; even the griminess of the hooker's apartment doesn't feel that grimy. It may as well have been a documentary on fungal nail infection. The wonderful and intriguing characters - the Hungarian playboy, the neurotic and repressed daughter of one of Cruise's patients - are discarded after a single scene each. They are not taken any further. It's all a bit of a cheat, really.<br/><br/>Like Peter Selllars in Dr Strangelove, Jack Nicholson in The Shining, or Vincent D'Onforio in Full Metal Jacket, this film needed an actor with enough personal charisma and confidence in himself to still shine through after Kubrick's relentless directorial hammering. Instead, the entire cast go through the motions like clockwork, like someone who has said the same word over and over so many times that it no longer has any relation to its meaning. Two performances leave an impression: Alan Cummings, who has played his role so often he can slip into it effortlessly; the other is from Rade Serbedzija, who hams it up wonderfully. The rest, most disappointingly Sidney Pollack, simply glide through the film, leaving no trace of their passing. <br/><br/>It is human nature to try to make sense of something so pointless - let's face it, you've paid your money and you want to know what you've spent it on. The danger is that this excruciatingly blank canvas will become painted over with a lot of semi-intellectual twaddle, as self-appointed interpreters of the film preach to the countless poor souls who sat for two hours wondering when the film was going to start and the third hour in the sinking realisation that it was almost over. To say that you ""get what you put in"", or that ""the pointlessness *is* the point""  is a pathetic apology for a film with no idea what it wants to be."
"Ben_hanson111","10","26","43","26 September 2005"," Unique, truly extraordinary
","This is one of my favourite films. I love the tense and psychological atmosphere throughout and every scene was fascinating in its own way. This film was not meant to be particularly sexy as many viewers were expecting. Kubrick would not have allowed it to be marketed in such a way. Many of the characters Bill meets are purely symbolic so people should not complain that they are implausible or caricatured. I would not argue with people who complain of the film's slow pace but it didn't bother me personally. Brief outline: The first part of the film sets the scene and introduces the main characters: Bill and Alice, Nick Nightingale and Ziegler. Bill and Alice's marital situation becomes clear and then her confession sets off a chain of events forming the main subject of the film. Bill has several near sexual encounters with various strangers before Nightingale points him to the mysterious masked orgy at the mansion. I found this to be one of the most sinister and haunting scenes in movie history. Bill discovers that this society is extremely private and that intruders are dealt with severely. He is spared after a woman at the orgy appears to sacrifice herself.<br/><br/>During the rest of the film Bill struggles to come to terms with what he has seen and remains curious, especially of what became of Nick. The film retains a strong element of mystery and only ever shows what Bill sees. Ziegler, revealed as a member of the orgy attempts to explain things to Bill and reassure him that nothing sinister went on. Can he be believed? I loved the way the film was shot and the sets were exceptional. All the characters were perfect for their role in the film and the mystery kept me interested throughout. This is a serious film but everything that happens shouldn't be taken at face value. There are many things that aren't explained and seem implausible. e.g The mask appearing on the pillow. It is not made clear that the events are imagined but they are often symbolic and should be taken allegorically. Eyes Wide Shut is flawed, the mystery could have been resolved better, perhaps with Ziegler's explanation being discredited. It remains a great film because its the brilliance that went before that sticks in the mind."

"Koth-3","1","75","145","10 March 2000"," ""They did a bad, bad thing!""
","This is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through.  It was definitely the worst Kubrick film.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine a film with this many beautiful women in it (especially Nicole Kidman) as being a waste of time, but it is.  The plot could be accomplished in about 30 minutes if all of the meaningless things had been left out.  You can skip the first half-hour and not be lost at all in the story.  The entire segment with the costume store clerk adds NOTHING to the plot of the movie.  What's more, all of the dialog and action feels like your watching the movie in slow motion.  (Hit your FF button and you'll notice that most characters appear to be moving at normal speed!)  Lead characters do not seem to change at all through out the film.  They react to things in one way, then, when those things change, the characters are still reacting the same way, as if the changes had not occurred.<br/><br/>The worst part?  The story is completely anti-climactic!  Do sit waiting the ending that will make all the convoluted items come together because you're not going to get one.<br/><br/>The most annoying part for me was this nasty habit that all the characters seemed to have:  One character would say a line, only to have it immediately repeated, as a question, by the other character.  Example: Character one says: ""You can't do that!""  Character two says: ""I can't do that?""  This little bit of abrasion occurs about 1000 times in an already exasperating film. I never tell people not to watch a film.  You need to make you're own assessment.  Just don't say that you weren't warned."
"Lloyd-23","1","103","206","30 September 1999"," A very unusually bad film.
","By writing this, I am hoping that I will save people a lot of time and money.  Last night I went with a friend to see Eyes Wide Shut, Stanley Kubrick's final masterpiece.  Supposedly, he had wanted to make this film for twenty-seven years, and spent sixty-seven weeks shooting it, an incredible amount of time for a commercial film.  Being the sort of mug film buff that I am, I thought that I should go to see a film made by an acknowledged master, who had  spent so much time getting it just right.<br/><br/>When the film finally ground to a halt, the audience in the cinema stood up and as one started muttering things like ""Is that it?"",  ""Thank goodness that's over"" ""Well, you can see why there are only two showings per day"", ""What a pile of ****"".  I have never heard a cinema audience respond so negatively to a film before.  We talked about it, and we had not a single kind word to say about it.  I have thought about it since, and find it void of redeeming features.<br/><br/>It is badly photographed. The sets are often unconvincing. The acting is mediocre. The continuity is poor. The lighting is awful. The picture quality is poor.  It looks as though it was shot on 16mm, and the prints were made at Boots. Hardly anything happens which is believable. There are gaping holes in the plot. Worse than all the above, it is  incredibly  slow.  At no point does the pace quicken.  It is wildly too long. Every single conversation happens at a snail's pace.  Almost every conversation is punctuated by very long awkward pauses.  It seems as though Stanley thought about every scene so much in isolation, that each scene took on great significance, and to get the importance of what was happening across, he dwelt on every word and action.  Every scene could be halved in length and lose nothing and gain much.<br/><br/>I was expecting a film in which Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise play roughly equally large parts.  The film is almost entirely about the Tom Cruise character.  I was expecting an intelligent exploration of jealousy and relationships and the like.  Instead we get half way to a thriller, but not all the way, not enough to make it interesting, and there is no intelligent comment on human nature, nor, so far as I can tell, on anything.<br/><br/>This film takes itself so amazingly seriously, and yet is transparently ludicrous from start to finish.  Human beings don't behave like that. Nothing made sense.  Characters kept acting on information which they didn't have.  The various parts of the world were not using the same clock.  The sun kept rising and falling at odd times, and characters would go back to somewhere they'd been the day before, to find that no one there had moved, changed clothes, or even finished what they were saying.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a bit of nudity in it, but this is presented in scenes of such unnecessary length, and such little incident, that you just wish they'd get on with the next scene.<br/><br/>Having more recently spoken to several other people who saw it, I have encountered near-uniform condemnation of this shamefully bad film.  One person fell asleep during it several times.  One had to apologise to the five people who went with her to see it, who all hated it (it had been her idea to go to see it).  Only two people reportedly enjoyed it, but they enjoyed it solely because they thought that it was so bad that it was funny. I say that it is too dull and slow to be found entertaining that way.<br/><br/>I would thoroughly recommend this film to people I intensely dislike."

","Kubrick is hard for me to get, and this film in particular. From my research, it seems as if he is one of those filmmakers who sees himself as a storyteller, with little desire to explore the limits of film as film. That's common enough and at root not very interesting. But Kubrick tries to be an innovator within that relatively narrow context by examining novel ways of telling his story.<br/><br/>Here we have a relatively simple device. A married couple both dream of infidelities. In both cases, their unconsummated fantasies turn into highly threatening situations. Kubrick's trick is to have the husband's dream presented as if it were `real.' What follows is an experiment in inserting surreal dream dynamics into seemingly solid time. Kubrick employs a few otherwise inexplicable elements, like the title and the mask on the pillow.<br/><br/>It works, but the result produces no great dramatic effect, no exciting narrative perspective.<br/><br/>A side note. I continue to be amazed at the extra content of DVDs, Why would actors agree to be interviewed in such a way that it makes them appear so incredibly dumb?"
"Michael Kenmore","4","19","32","15 March 2000"," Sadly overrated tripe
","I cannot understand for the life of me the critics heaping praises on a film called Eyes Wide Shut. I suspect the critics who gave a film the utmost positive reviews did so out of respect for its dead co-writer and director Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is an excruciatingly tedious and overlong movie that is more like the test of endurance than a thought-provoking philosophical movie such as Terrence Malick's flawed masterpiece The Thin Red Line. I was warned by an aunt that Eyes Wide Shut is really, in her own word, a ""sucko"". I cannot form my opinion unless I have seen the particular movie with my own eyes and judge the film based on its technical and artistic merits, among others such as logic, intelligence and content. I'm not easily offended as people might think (I consider Election one of the best movies of last year -- the sheer brilliance of the direction and screenplay blew me away -- though The Iron Giant takes the prize as my favorite movie of 1999).<br/><br/>What irritates me most are not only the deliberately slow pace and Nicole Kidman's terrible acting (watch the long sequence in which she was spaced out and accuses her husband of cheating, then eventually confessed) but the shallow script that have no redeeming value whatsoever -- no story, no plot, nothing. The dialogues are so contrived in the first hour that I thought Kubrick and his co-writer were fantasizing what the characters' conversations and interactions are like. The fatal flaw of the movie is its glaring emotional detachment. I felt nothing for the characters, and because of that fact, I do not care about the characters at all, regardless of the situations they face.<br/><br/>The infamous orgy sequence -- in its censored form -- was literally laughable, not because of the obviously computerized Austin Powers figures placed to avoid the dreadful NC-17 rating. There is no explanation or point about the supposed secrecy of the ritual comprising of the members wearing cloaks and masks and participating in copulation and orgy. It's an enigma why the ridiculous plot point is essential to the film -- not just the orgy but the whole idea that the secret society exists. This is simply to serve Kubrick's internal fantasies. I find it completely pointless and trivial.<br/><br/>The only things I like about the film are the decent acting by Tom Cruise and Sidney Pollack and amazing cinematography. I thought Eyes Wide Shut is truly a mediocre film. I did not like 2001: A Space Odyssey the first time I saw it, but I appreciated that film over time. Eyes Wide Shut might as well have the same effect, but its lack of emotional distinction and absurdity (witness the weird and laughable ending) are the reasons I did not like the film.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick tortured his actors and film crew during the making of Eyes Wide Shut for three years, and the final effort is not well worth it. Kubrick only wants to test the sanity of the audience sitting through the meandering and plodding two hours and 40 minutes movie."

","When this film was released there was a small minority of critics who did not like this film. But like many Kubrick films Eyes Wide Shut is ahead of its time in terms of artistic impression and thought-provocation.<br/><br/>First I will like to talk about some of the criticisms many had about this film when it was first released. The slow pace at the beginning and the seemingly ""staged atmosphere"" is believed to have been created to convey a ""dream-like"" ambiance. I don't know whether everyone will find this film compelling but I think the ambiguity of the plot creates everything open to interpretation. <br/><br/>After his wife Alice(Kidman) confesses a near act of infidelity, the ""good-doctor"" Bill Harbord(Cruise) goes on an odyssey-like walk through the empty streets on New York (Its suppose to symbolize his spiritual emptiness), in a vindictive pursuit to prove his character as a man. When meeting his friend Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), he learns of an underground society that indulges in group sex. Realizing this is the opportunity to reassure himself he ventures into the society only to be revealed as an intruder and cast out. He then tries to retrace his steps in true Kubrick fashion.<br/><br/>This film like most of Kubrick's films is artsy and rigorous picture that is just simply not designed for everyone to like because contrary to what you might think it is unique and unconventional. Can you name a film that resembles Eyes Wide Shut in terms of the density of the storyline, emotionally intense, psychologically compelling and strangely thought-provoking? You likely can't because it is a anomaly in a bland and rigid film industry.<br/><br/>If you did not like this film, I suggest that you watch this film again and think about what I said and OPEN-UP to it. Take it for what it is trying to put forth. I've heard many people say that the first time they saw this film they did not understand it, but later came to enjoy it. And this is the case for many Kubrick films. In fact when I first saw A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, as well as Dr. Strangelove I could not understand why the academy considers them classics, but they grew on me as well.<br/><br/>In the end, Eyes Wide Shut like 2001: A Space Odyssey will be a film that was misunderstood by many people when it came out but inevitably will be widely considered as another landmark in the career of the greatest film-maker of all-time.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10 A Kubrick Classic"

","I saw this movie in a popular Los Angeles cinema on its opening day.  I've never heard more yawning, himming and hawning, and shifting in theater seats like I heard during this movie.  And there's good reason:  this movie was bad.<br/><br/>If you liked this movie, then you are just one of those bandwagon fans who doesn't have a mind of his own.  You probably liked Malick's joke-of-a-war-movie ""The Thin Red Line.""  Remember how everybody pulled the ol' ""emperor's new clothes"" bit with that guy?  Hollywood was afraid to say that this was one of the worst war movies ever made because they put so much money into his work.  And this is exactly the same response to Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.  This by far was one of the most boring films I've ever seen in my life of going to the cinema.  I feel embarrassed for anybody who says it was good.  I challenge those people to sit through it again. I'd rather go to the dentist.  And how bad was that score?  That horrific pounding of the single note from a piano was such a bad joke to anybody who knows how to score films.  Movie goers were laughing every time that single note pounded into our brains.  It failed in building suspense, and in fact, pulled me out of the scene all together.  And how laughable was that orgy scene?  Half the theater was laughing during that scene too.  And gee, we suffered so much because we couldn't actually see the actors simulating sex up close and personal.  As if that would've saved this bad movie.<br/><br/>The only positive I can offer is that Tom and Nicole did a fantastic job with such bad material, and dare I say, such bad direction.  That's right, Stanley blew it with his direction.  And let's be honest, any guy who does 70 takes per setup per scene isn't a genius.  He's obsessive compulsive and sadly over-rated in his ability to work with actors.  Again, it's like Terrance Malick.  If you shoot 1.2 million feet of film in your movie, you're bound to come up with enough good shots to make yourself look good despite all your shortcomings.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this bad bad movie."

"CinemaClown","Null","16","27","22 November 2015"," The Final Masterpiece From The Greatest Filmmaker Of All Time
","From the director behind influential masterpieces like The Killing, Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining & Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut marks the final entry in the decades-spanning, unprecedented & extraordinary filmmaking career of Stanley Kubrick. And just like all of his reappraised works, is a classic that unveils more of its intricate layers on multiple viewings.<br/><br/>Set in New York City, Eyes Wide Shut tells the story of Dr. William ""Bill"" Harford whose life spirals out of control when his wife tells him about an erotic fantasy she had about another man which shatters his faith in her. Unable to get the image of his wife & the other man out of his head, he embarks on a night-long adventure during which he comes extremely close to cheating on his wife & also infiltrates a quasi-religious sexual ritual at a country mansion after learning about it from a friend.<br/><br/>Co-written, produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick, Eyes Wide Shut is a film about sexual desires that's jam-packed with symbolism & metaphorical elements. The entire film exhibits a sexually charged atmosphere and every single character inhabiting it has nothing but sex on his or her mind. Kubrick's direction makes efficient use of all his trademarks and just like before, he manages to push forward the existing boundaries of the medium while adding a few innovative tricks into the filmmaking manual in the process.<br/><br/>The screenplay smears the plot with multitudes of themes & insinuations, the story unfolds in a slow, methodical manner, the leading characters have an in-depth complexity which is wonderfully illustrated by the master storyteller, each sequence is meticulously detailed & technically refined, and it has a lot to say about sex, infidelity, physical relations, desires & fantasies. However, dialogue isn't one of its strengths for every time anyone says anything, the other character repeats the same as a question which becomes annoying after a while.<br/><br/>The technical aspects always score very high marks in Kubrick films and Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. The set pieces are gorgeously rendered, extensively detailed & beautifully lit. Cinematography encapsulates the entire picture with a bizarre, dream-like ambiance which goes on to further amplify the overall experience while also intensifying its erotic attributes. The use of colours is noteworthy while lighting here is a work of perfection. Its 159 minutes of runtime & deliberately slow pace may feel like a challenging ordeal but it never becomes an issue once the drama sets in.<br/><br/>The incorporation of classical songs to compliment the unfolding drama continues in Eyes Wide Shut and all the musical arrangements are wisely chosen & carefully infused into the storyline. Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, Marie Richardson & Todd Field. Even though both Cruise & Kidman put in commendable effort into their respective roles of Mr. & Mrs. Harford, it's actually their on- spot chemistry that makes them click so well, and while there are no definite stand-outs, the contribution by its entire cast only works in the film's favour.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut may not be as pathbreaking as most of his masterpieces but it's nonetheless a deeply fascinating meditation on sexual relations and despite its cynical tone, manages to be an erotic, enthralling & engaging thriller. While the plot is heavy & explicit in sexual content, approaching it as a sex-romp cinema won't do enough justice for Kubrick digs much deeper into the primordial aspects of human nature to put up an exquisite looking tale that's aesthetic, artistic & unlike anything before or since. It may not be Kubrick's greatest, but it's still a genre masterpiece. Thoroughly recommended. Multiple viewings advised."

","Eyes Wide Shut must be one of the most under-appreciated films in the history of film. A true masterpiece that only a genius like Kubrick could create.<br/><br/>To me, the film is mostly about the different masks that we wear, (The personas or even disguises that we take on) throughout our relationships with people and society. As well as the fact that we sometimes have to close our eyes to certain aspects of reality or occurrence, a basic necessity for us to function with some sense of sanity. Coming to terms with accepting the reality of human imperfection is part of an undeniable theme here. This aspect is hammered home in the final scene.<br/><br/>It is clear with Kubrick's final work that he is the true master of sight, sound and storytelling on film. This film plays like a sonic and visual orchestra for the senses, while the subject matter swirls and pokes at the heart and mind in the most haunting and intimate of ways.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut may just be the most open minded study of relationships and the human experience in the history of the cinema. Only the Italian master Fellini seems to even compare to Kubrick on this level of fearlessness and visionary depth.<br/><br/>Like most of Kubrick's works, this is a film that can easily be watched over and over again because of it's visual beauty, exquisite detail, and deep rooted themes. In my view, this film in it's own bizarre way is as good of a film as any that have ever been made.<br/><br/>As much of a loss as it is to lose such a great artist. Kubrick's masterful storytelling, extraordinary visions, and hauntingly honest reflections of the world live on through a collection of films that in my view, HAS NO EQUAL.<br/><br/>10/10"

","""I know I would like to make a contemporary story that finally gave a feeling of the times, psychologically, sexually, politically and personally. I would like to make this more than anything else, and it's probably going to be the hardest film to make."" - Stanley Kubrick <br/><br/>Far from being the ""hermetic"" and ""old fashioned"" film critics labelled it, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is part of a burst of similar films released between 1998 and 2001. These films - which include ""The Matrix"", ""Vanilla Sky"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Dark City"", ""ExistenZ"", ""Mulholland Drive"", ""The Truman Show"", ""Fight Club"" and ""A History of Violence"" - all portray reality as a hyper-real simulation in possession of a dark and violent underside. In the case of ""Eyes Wide Shut"", this dark underside is itself a charade.<br/><br/>In larger terms, these films can be seen as symptomatic expressions of the traumatic transition from the irrational exuberance of techno capitalism to post 9/11 distrust. If the 90s were a great simulation, American living the Capitalist dream, these films anticipate a dark ""exterior"" suddenly and violently intruding into the US's simulated ""interiority"". History's sad joke is that 9/11 was itself a hyper-real event, an unreal horror which played out more like a Hollywood movie than any real catastrophe. Thus, while 9/11 should be read as an ""intrusion of the Real"" into a ""simulation"" (the truth of capitalist logic revealed, the heart of Western finance exploding), it was actually swallowed by the simulation, absorbed and swiftly incorporated so that it became just another empty signifier, all truth blurred, all symbolic meaning swept away. You might say that 9/11 was the first work of post-modern terrorist art, quickly chopped up, split apart and stripped of its historical context and meaning.<br/><br/>And so, on one level, these cyberpunk and conspiracy films are attempts to map the unthinkable Thing that is postmodern capital. As Mark de Rozario wrote in his seminal essay on ""Eyes Wide Shut"": ""During the bubble economy of the late 90s, capital itself seemed more than ever to correspond with Marx's famous description, as it melted ""all that is solid into air"". Marx thought that capital - the engine of social reality - would inevitably migrate from the realm of material goods into the ""etherworld"" of speculative finance. With the dot-com boom we had businesses that were composed, as near as possible, of nothing but ether. Aren't the 90s films expressions of anxieties about this apparent derealization - this sense that everything is a simulation whose existence is dependent upon our continuing to believe in it? But the opposite was the case: our belief was dependent upon capital's maintenance of the simulation. During the 90s boom, capital manufactured belief, giving rise to ""New Era Thinking"", the delusion that normal economic laws were suspended and that the economy was entering a New Era of uninterrupted, perpetual expansion. Such a belief structure was necessary for capital in the 90s, but was obsolesced once capital flipped into a new phase, signalled by the near-synchronised popping of the 90s bubble and the fall of the Twin Towers. Now, the belief in expansion without limits is revealed to be ""just a dream"" (a dream that, like many dreams, had concrete effects). ""Eyes Wide Shut"", with its treatment of the relationship between fantasy and capital, and its re-exploration of the conspiracy narrative, coincided with, and expressed, our waking up from the 90s ""dream"".""<br/><br/>Unlike ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (and Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive), however, most films within this micro-genre use technology and computer generated wizardry to generate their illusory realities. ""The Matrix"", ""Dark City"", ""Existenz"" and ""The Truman Show"" are all old-fashioned parables of political resistance: they remind us that seductive images can be used to repress us and that, while we can enjoy those images to the full, we must also understand how they're actually made.<br/><br/>This contemporary hunger for spectacle, for CGI trickery, for hyper-aesthetics, and our increasing reliance on mediated rather than real experience, marks what philosopher Jean Baudrillard terms the ""ecstasy of communication"" that defines postmodern life and culture. This is the age of simulations and the simulacra, of mediated representations and reproductions, images and signs gradually taking up the place of objects and commodities. Like Kubrick's Dr Bill (Dollar Bill), this is a world in which reproductions are separated from their original time and space, commodities endlessly circulating inside the simulational model of communication. In the age of hyper-reality, the essence of the post modern moment is the admittance of the bankruptcy of the Real.<br/><br/>In an era of generalised simulations, in which technology is increasingly able to capture or fake the real, an opposition between the real and simulation can no longer be maintained. The Real is elusive, constantly morphing into the hyper-real.<br/><br/>But films like ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Matrix"" are locked at what Baudrillard calls the level of the first order of simulacra. They remain at the pre-industrial phase of ""suspicion"", quaintly convinced that there is a ""real world"" behind and beyond the circulation of simulacra. But we no longer live in the age of the spectacle. Spectacle subjected us to images, now we ourselves become images, participating in the cool hypermedia matrix, which everywhere demands participation. And so what ""Eyes Wide Shut"" realises is that reality is already hyper-real. There is now no meaningful distinction between reality and simulation, Real and Image, money and Bill.<br/><br/>9.5/10 - Note: This is less a review of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" than an examination of it's place within a micro-genre of similar films released in the late 90s and early 00s."

"macchiato_y","8","16","28","26 October 2009"," a demanding movie
","Although the title is ""Eyes wide shut"", when watching this film, you have to keep your eyes wide open. This film is base on the novella 《Traumnovelle》 (Dream Story), written by Arthur Schnitzler, who Freud claimed had such an intimate affinity with. Kubrick had spent decades of time adapted the novella to the motion picture. With joint effort of two greatest minds, the film is among the most profound ones, so that requires great effort to interpret. In the very beginning of the film, Bill walked from the living room, through the bedroom, towards bathroom. This move provides us a clear establishment inside this New York couple's house. The view is clearly described by Tim Kreider as, ""The paintings that cover the Harfords' walls from floor to ceiling (painted by Kubrick's wife Christiane) almost all depict flowers or food, making explicit the function of art in their environment as mere decor-art for consumption."" Then followed, Alice, who just finished using the bathroom stand up, made her first frontal appearance. This obvious continuity between the paintings and Alice, combining the starting scene which displayed her naked back, implied that our main female character was also an art work that the main male character had collected. When Alice asked Bill why he wasn't jealous, the answer Bill gave is ""Because you are my wife and the mother of my child."" What he had in mind was that Alice was something he owned rather than the person he shared a life with. Alice talked about her fantasy to Bill that she was ready to give up every thing, including her family and her child just because of the glance of the naval officer. She was saying that in order to protest the Bill's ownership. This revealed more of the submissive position where Alice stood --- Always leading by the male. Her appearance was always associated with the mirror. As analysis in Lacan's theory:""The mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential libidinal relationship with the body image"" Alice constantly behavior of checking the mirror indicates of her loss of self-identification. She was familiar with being a wife and a mother---the ego characteristics required by the society. Alice looked like a serious person, wearing glasses, hardly smile. Not until she was on alcohol, pot or during dreaming, did the relax expression appeared on her face. From this we would know she repressed lots of her own desires, hide the tension, the anxiety deep down, so as to meet the demand of her husband and the society. However, when she was unconscious, she couldn't control of the desires and just let it out. The night, Bill came home from the orgy party, found her giggling during her sleep. But when woke up, she look very terrified. The transition from sleep to awaken is analog with the transition form unconscious to conscious. The four step of dream interpretation ""secondary revision"" could be applied to the dramatic attitude changing from being satisfied to being terrified. She feels guilty about dream cheating of her husband so she forced herself as remembering the dream as a horrific nightmare.<br/><br/>Bill maintained his dominant poison, identified himself as the role of the saver, using money to control people such as costume shop owner, the taxi driver and ultimately since he was the only financial support of the family, using money to control Alice. When he wanted to do something that considered as immoral or transgression, he start to searching through the unconscious to find the excuses to keep him away from being guilty. The fantasies of his wife making love with the naval officer occurring three times, each followed by the action of searching other women to fulfill his sexual needs, hooking up with the prostitute, calling his late patient's daughter who expressed her desires for him before and going to the orgy party. He needed the reason for the self gratification. And the idea of revenge to his wife's fantasized infidelity severed him well. From this we can indicate that Bill indeed is a very hypocritical person. He spared no effort finding ways to satisfy his id desires while his wife Alice tried really hard to repress it. I think the scene which he found that the mask lying on his pillow implied that he, not his wife, is the person who cheated and disguised as an honest man. Every detail in this film is carefully designed. The name of prostitute the ""domino"" is actually a kind of mask, which predicted the following masque in held in the Somerton. The password of the party is ""Fidelio"", which was the Italian for faithful. It's severs as an irony because using such word as engaging into an orgy. Also, Fidelio is Beethoven' opera telling the story of how a wife risked her life to save her husband in prison from death. It predicted the result that in the end Mandy sacrificed herself to protect Bill's life. It also was using stairs as a metaphor for social class and the dirt inside the upper ones. The higher you climb, the more bodies you might discovered in their closets. Just as the saying goes: ""There is nothing accidental in Kubrick's film."" Because of the films contains numerous hidden meanings and great complexity. People who watch the film at the first time often found it very confusing. Also, during the promotion, it marketed as an erotic thriller, therefore, for people who just want to watch celebrities couple having hot steamy sex on screen would be really disappointed. It's much more sophisticated and you would notice something new when you watch it again and again."

Then there was the annoying single-note piano playing. Piano soundtracks have worked with other Cruise films, but in this one, it was just plain irritating.<br/><br/>We get to see a lot of Nicole Kidman in the nude, but there is really very little sex. Yes, there's an orgy scene, but they've edited the film to place other people in strategic spots so you can't see anything. Some people want to see ""Tom and Nicole together."" Forget it. The one 'teaser' scene you see in the previews is all you're going to get. You see them with their tops off, and he starts to kiss her neck. Then she gets p***ed off and that's the end of that. You never see Tom have sex with *anyone*.<br/><br/>Another irritating point is when Nicole is smoking pot. She (the actress) must have never smoked, because her reaction is totally wrong. She seems to talk even slower than she did before, and then starts getting angry. 'Tom' comments ""It's just the pot making you aggressive.""  What is this, an ad from the PDFA? *Alcohol* makes you aggressive, not pot.<br/><br/>
All in all it was extremely disappointing and LONG. Way too long."

Whether it's the pauses without dialogue or the traditional Kubrick Long Shots, EWS is one of the best visually executed movies though it should also be praised due to the last work of the genius of Stanley Kubrick, from the signature end credits to the notable cuts of black , this film reads like contemporary Sade on the upper East Side. Eyes wide Shut was based on a psychological dream novel and is a clever adaptation in modern society it's something eerie and strange about it that just makes it one of many visual stunning works in the Kubrick pantheon.

"ficklingsp","8","5","7","31 May 2012"," A deeply thoughtful, multi-layered, meaningful and visually beautiful cinematic work
","One film which I have watched on multiple occasions is Eyes Wide Shut. This was Stanley Kubrick's final film. It is one of the most challenging, underrated, misunderstood and complex cinematic works I have ever seen. Ever since it's release it's been given variegated reviews. The flawless visuals, deep themes, slow pace and eerie almost dreamlike atmosphere all captivate the viewer.<br/><br/>The premise itself is the story of a doctor named Bill Harford played by Tom Cruise and his wife Alice played by Nicole Kidman. A wealthy and privileged couple who reside in New York with their young daughter Helena. After Alice unveils a mysterious sexual fantasy she had with another man Bill becomes distressed. A thoughtful Bill embarks on a late night sexual odyssey where he counters temptation, lust and infidelity. Before attending an outlandish orgy held by the rich and powerful of an underground cult. There he witnesses the darker side of sex and how dehumanizing and frigid it can be. After being exposed as an outsider Bill's livelihood and family become endangered causing Bill to resolve the aftermath even though he was given terse instructions not to by the cult. Rousing more thought-provocation, confusion and mystery to flow.<br/><br/>In the end the film remains ambiguous and puzzling yet nevertheless fascinating. There are many themes to study such as jealousy, intrigue, fear, sexuality, fantasy, reality and dreams amongst a host of others such as psychology, sociology, human nature, society and so on. It's also an fascinating message on how sex has transformed into a technology e.g. the obsession with money. Many stress it to be an artistic film as well. Personally I don't think it's Kubrick's best film however it's still in there with his best. A symbolic, important and serious work. The title of the film is metaphorically relevant to the context of the film in that our eyes are literally wide shut to the truth. As the ending is quite ambiguous interpretations are left open in that the viewer can decide whether or not it has either an optimistic or pessimistic outcome. I would maturely recommend it"

"quixoboy","Null","5","7","6 September 2003"," The perfect end to a perfect filmmaker's career
","I don't care what anyone else says. Sure, most of them say that Steven Spielberg is the greatest, most successful director of all time (which is true to a certain extent), I will always consider Stanley Kubrick to be the quintessential image of that; he is my all-time favourite filmmaker, with a style and interpretation that resonated with me from the first few seconds I saw of ""The Shining"" (1980), my first-ever Kubrick viewing. He is a director of unequaled talent, persistence, and vision, whose fascinating persona has been notoriously publicized in tabloid news around the globe for decades. He's been labelled ""reclusive"", ""eccentric"", a ""tyrant"", a ""perfectionist"", etc. ...Call him what you will, but you cannot deny the illustrious career he's made out of creating some of the most significant motion pictures ever.<br/><br/>That career was tragically shattered upon his death in March of 1999 - just a few months before the release of his now-final film: ""Eyes Wide Shut"", a gloomy, subdued, but hypnotic study of the human condition.<br/><br/>Like all the rest of Kubrick's films, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" of course boasts a stunning visual style that ends up making every frame look almost like a work of art. The soft, colourful palettes used throughout the film give an eerie, surreal, almost dreamy look to it. It matches the wildly dysfunctional mood of most scenes, and really lends some first-class cinematography to the proceedings.<br/><br/>When ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was released in the summer of 1999, I, unfortunately, was not able to see it. Of course, at the time, I still wasn't fully aware of just how unparalleled a genius Mr. Kubrick was, and I had yet to be fully appreciative of his unique body of work. A few years down the line...I finally caught an uncut television broadcast of the nearly three-hour film (since it was on TV it was over three hours, but that's besides the point). The reactions, emotions, and feelings simmering through me as I journeyed through this bizarre masterpiece cannot be fully expressed in words; I was captivated every minute, watching the horrific and sad tribulations faced by the film's lead couple - then-married ""mega-stars"" Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. I must say, for all the flak this film received about the acting when it was released, I was actually surprised at how ABOVE-average and well-done the performances were (as well as supporting roles). It clearly couldn't be easy for a real-life married celebrity couple (much less a non-couple) to pull it off with such uncomfortable, heavy subject matter. Forcing these two leads to question their own lives, the film does a remarkable job of presenting the psychological twists and turns of each spouse's state - and, of course, the famous, digitally-altered orgy cult sequence didn't fail to give me some nightmares with that chillingly simplistic piano score.<br/><br/>There is also a number of other memorable and haunting moments to be had, obviously...and the equally talked-about ending historically concludes with the perfect one-word statement before cutting to black and having the last Kubrick credits roll.<br/><br/>For all the legendary ""porno movie"" hype surrounding the more low-key end result, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was apparently a gigantic disappointment to many critics and fans...but in the end, it proved that after an often-turbulent film career, one could still come out on top before abruptly leaving this world.<br/><br/>The perfect end to a perfect filmmaker's career. Stanley Kubrick, you will forever be missed."

"PogoNeo","2","8","13","10 April 2017"," A masterpiece? Of self indulgence maybe
","How in just a few words presents itself the very last work of the supposed master of the cinema art, Mr. Stanley Kubrick? Plot holes; numerous. Rachitic and repetitive music, to the point of being annoying. Comedic thus completely out of place first of the two scenes at the costume shop. Very, very bad cheesy conversation with the masked woman at the orgy. Lack of proper pace and stretched scenes resulting in a completely unnecessary long screening time. To sum up: a failed movie. It is not like everything in it is bad, but overall it is a weak one<br/><br/>Some positive reviews say that all plot holes or artificial look of (staged) New York are to be a supposed hints at the dream nature of the events. But such claims are of equal value as those in regards to for example the bad lightning in ""The Godfather"" (1972), saying that it was done on purpose to underline the shady nature of Corleone family. But one of the actually good things in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is Nicole Kidman. Unfortunately, she only has the supporting part while Tom Cruise on the other hand in his lead acting reverts way to often to that characteristic rascally wicked grin of his- a gimmick performed by him in probably half of his movies. And if you want to count as goodies ""great tits"" (to quote the movie), we do get to see a lot of them. But then again, the orgy itself does not go all the way and so does not hers sailor fantasy. there are both important and yet not fully utilized, thus this picture it a sexed up drama but with not enough sex in it. And also on the sexuality note: what was the purpose of that out of the blue scene of pedestrians shouting some homophobic slurs at the main character and that other later scene with a male hotel desk clerk clearly hitting on him? It is not explored further and probably only time will tell if that was the director laughing at gossips about Cruse's supposed homosexuality or was this the director shoveling them in the actor's face; or was this just another inconsistency of ""Eyes Wide Shut""<br/><br/>The side of the movie dealing with the mystery of that whole orgy society instead of evolving into a full thriller just fizzled out with almost nothing. We do see some investigative work and some threats, but nothing really happens; while the paste continuous to be extremely slow. As for the marriage-adultery portion of the movie, it ends up with a confrontation / confession that the viewers do not actually get to see- contrary to what Tom Cruise says to his on screen and then also real life wife (""I'll tell you everything""). It is as if after two and a half hours of already edited up footage, Kubrick finally came to his senses and realized that the film is way too long; and so he decided to speed things up from that point, by cutting to the aftermath of this conversation. And that is truly disappointing, because the argument of the protagonist couple near the beginning had some real acting value in it. And also because it is a clear sign of laziness in script writing (just how many times do we see in movies, especially in comedies, a bold defiant statement that should be followed by extremely entertaining / interesting scene, but instead of that the filmmakers diffuse problems of difficult / sophisticated execution of it by simply jumping over it?)<br/><br/>To sum up: calling ""Eyes Wide Shut"" a masterpiece is a total misunderstanding. But if you do want to see a great piece of cinema work by Stanley Kubrick, then please go see his ""Paths Of Glory"" (1957) or the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968); but that other one only to the point when the s-f ends and that colorful rambling begins. Because let us be honest- not everything what Kubrick did was extraordinary / important / engaging. And his last picture is an example of a painfully bad end to a long and profound career; seeing this movie for the second time, at least 15 years after the first screening, only made the boredom experience twice as hard to bear"

"cathyyoung1","4","8","13","14 May 2000"," An illustrious career ends, sadly, with a dud
","Last night I finally saw ""Eyes Wide Shut.""  The only good thing I can say is that it is often visually stunning (though nowhere near ""A Clockwork Orange"").  The story, moving at a glacial pace, was peculiarly uninvolving. The attempt to convey a sense of nightmarish, hallucinatory dread ended up being merely ponderous and ludicrous (especially in the infamous orgy scene; Kubrick seems to have had a most peculiar idea of forbidden sexual adventure in 1990s New York).  The dialogue, much of the time, was banal beyond belief, and the acting was mediocre at best -- with Sydney Pollack as Victor Ziegler and Marie Richardson as Marion the only two exceptions.  I've never thought much of Tom Cruise as an actor, but he was far better in ""The Firm"" -- here, you never for a moment forget that you're looking at Tom Cruise pretending to be a doctor.  Nicole Kidman was better, but in the key scene where she confesses to having lusted for another man, her delivery was somehow very unconvincing.<br/><br/>The basic concept -- a husband and wife rediscovering their passionate erotic connection through (unconsummated) sexual experimentation outside their marriage -- is interesting enough.  But for it to work, the viewer must care for the protagonists and for their marriage (which EWS fails to achieve), and there must be real onscreen chemistry between them (which is completely absent here).  There is, in fact, no eroticism in the film at all, extramarital or marital; of course, Kubrick has always been a very cold and anti-sensual director (post-""Lolita,"" at least), so maybe this just wasn't the right film for him to make.<br/><br/>Kubrick has made some of this century's true cinematic masterpieces -- ""Paths of Glory,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""A Clockwork Orange"" -- and other superb films such as ""Lolita"" and ""Full Metal Jacket.""  (I've never cared much for ""The Shining."") This is not the film he will be remembered by."
"Hermit C-2","2","8","13","20 August 1999"," The disappointment of a lifetime.
","I don't think I ever anticipated a film so much in my life, seeing as how I think Kubrick is the greatest of all directors and it had been twelve long years since his last feature. Imagine my surprise--make that shock--after two-and-a-half hours in a dark theatre, stunned to find out that 'Eyes Wide Shut' was not only a disappointment, but a total failure as a film.<br/><br/>What's more, the depth and breadth of this fiasco is amazing. Virtually none of the elements that made Kubrick's films such a joy to watch in the past are present here. In his greatest films, almost every shot gave the viewer something glorious, or at least interesting, to watch. There's none of that in this film. Kubrick's use of music in his other movies has always been smart, and sometimes even revolutionary. Here it's just one more mediocre element in an at best mundane production, epitomized by the single, hammered piano note that is so ineffectively used in scenes to supposedly denote tension. The slow, deliberate pace of his movies that had served him so well before just invites boredom here.<br/><br/>The most offending elements, though, are the story and script.  Perhaps Arthur Schnitzler's story 'Traumnovelle' said something relevant to its audience earlier in the century; I don't know, I haven't read it. But this adaptation doesn't have much relevance at all to an audience at the end of that century. What's worse is the script, co-written by the great man himself. The dialog here is so trite and mediocre at times that I believe most first-year film students would have rejected it as just too hackneyed. (""You must leave at once! You are in great danger!"" Did I really hear that?)<br/><br/>Trouble signs appeared to me early on. After the party scene where a suddenly inebriated Nicloe Kidman inexplicably almost falls for some man about 30 years older than her using hoary pick-up lines, she and husband Tom Cruise go home and have a conversation/argument about jealousy, desire and fidelity. She tells him dramatically about how she almost threw away her marriage and family just to satisfy a momentary lust. By the time these two scenes are over we've been listening to Kidman drawl out her lines for about 45 minutes and I came to the awful realization that this confessional was supposed to be the impetus for the rest of the action. This scene also contains an embarrassingly phony laughing fit by Kidman. I would accuse her of bad acting, but given the knowledge of the way Kubrick worked, this must be the way he wanted the scene to go.<br/><br/>Driven by a jealous vision of his wife making love to another man, Cruise sets out on an ""odyssey"" that takes him all over New York for a series of meaningless encounters with various characters in which virtually nothing happens. If there was a point to all this empty activity, that would have been one thing, but this story is too weak to support any kind of a moral. A reference to HIV which comes late in the movie is jarring, because it has some relation to the real world which, up to that point, had been almost totally lacking. Of course, there was no danger of anyone contracting it, since there is little sex or passion in this film about sexual obsession. Even the notorious ""orgy"" scene (for lack of a better word) will not raise an eyebrow of most viewers in 1999, a sign that Kubrick was out of touch with his audience and their level of sophistication after being isolated for so many years. In his defense, it may be that the scene would have been more effective if it had been shown the way he originally shot it.<br/><br/>So what happened? Well, as just noted, perhaps Kubrick had simply been away from filmmaking too long and his instincts weren't sharp anymore. Also it's doubtful that anyone would suggest to this acknowledged genius that something just wasn't working this time around. Whatever the reason I found this a sad ending to a brilliant career, but one that won't tarnish the overall legacy of the man. It's often been said that if Kubrick had only directed '2001: A Space Odyssey,' he'd still be remembered as a genius. Now I believe it can be said that Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaking genius even though he directed 'Eyes Wide Shut.'"

","I'm a fan of Stanley Kubrick but I have to admit that I can't stand Eyes Wide Shut. The film moves at a snail's pace for no apparent reason. It's not suspenseful and long periods of time go by where barely anything happens. <br/><br/>The plot is extremely hard to follow as well. As Bill tries to piece everything together the audience is left with increasingly more questions, leading up to a completely anticlimactic and unbelievable conversation at the end in which Ziegler magically explains everything. When I spend the whole movie expecting Bill to dramatically uncover the truth, the last thing I want is a half-assed ""oh, by the way, here are all the answers,"" right before the end. <br/><br/>To top it all off, Nicole Kidman's acting job is subpar."

Kubrick was by the time he made this film, an old guy, possibly tired and lacking inspiration.<br/><br/>Viewing this film realised my worst fears. Yes, Kubrick blotted his copybook in old age and produced a turkey. Eyes Wide Shut is Kubrick's worst film. Despite the desperate excuses of Kubrick fans this film goes nowhere, it has nothing new to say and employs dull cinematography.<br/><br/>I also think Tom Cruise is too lightweight to be taken seriously in a dark role such as this and his wife Nicole Kidman is underused, merely appearing as a dumb housewife.

Although I enjoy erotica such as Cronenberg's ""Crash"", Eyes Wide Shut went absolutely nowhere, leaving me bored and unfulfilled.<br/><br/>You will enjoy the odd flashes of nudity but the story is pointless.

It takes an 2 1/2 hours to get delve into a marriage and come up with absolutely no insights whatsoever.

In her two key scenes she is apparently smashed on champagne and later weirded out on dope. She doesn't seem believable in either scenario. The film itself however is definitely watchable and many of the Kubrick touches are here. Over lit scenes, long set pieces, weird characters, slowly creeping tracking shots all the trademarks of a Kubrick movie can be found. Cruise stumbles upon the uber wealthy engaging in nefarious sexual practices. There are far reaching consequences for this discovery. Pretty harrowing stuff.

","This is not a film that can be done in one sitting, but is also so immersive that it is almost a disservice to break it into separate viewings. Doctor (as he so vigorously reminds people) Bill Hartford's (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman) wander through their own repressed sexual feelings in a series of unfulfilling and scandalous rendezvous. The protagonists are unerringly narcissistic, but in such an innocent animalistic way that I do not feel shame or disgust for their behavior, rather a detached understanding of their motives. It is almost a relief that the promised and foreshadowed tardy sex scenes never manifest on screen, as it retains the sense of purity in the exploration. The pacing is excruciatingly slow, and meticulous in showing Bills raw emotional journey, and must be approached with a patient mindset."
"davidmvining","10","2","2","26 November 2019"," An underrated exploration of dreams
","This might be the best approximation to the experience of a dream in film. Dreams are hard to realize because they don't follow a lot of the basic rules of logic and storytelling we're used to. The only other movie I can think of that works this successfully at building the illogic of a dream is Dario Argento's Suspiria.<br/><br/>Bill Harford is a doctor in Manhattan whose clientele includes some very rich people. One of these millionaires, Victor, invites him and his wife Alice to a swanky Christmas party in Victor's large Manhattan mansion. There both husband and wife are presented with opportunities for infidelity. Bill is approached by two models who instantly try to seduce him, dragging him away from the party with implied promises of a threesome while Alice dances with a charming older Hungarian man who makes it very plain that he wants to sleep with her. Alice, despite her drunken state, turns him down, but Bill seems to be on the edge of saying yes (or possibly no) when he's pulled away by Victor's man to deal with a crisis. Victor had taken a prostitute upstairs who took a bad combination of heroin and cocaine before passing out. Bill coaxes her back to the land of the living in a very professional manner, taking seemingly no notice of the attractive body before him.<br/><br/>The next night, Bill and Alice put their daughter to bed and get a little high. Alice goes on a tirade about Bill's view of women and sexuality, attacking his preconceived notions of the depths of her fidelity to him when she reveals a fantasy she had about an attractive naval officer the year before. He receives a call about a patient who just died and uses the excuse to leave the house. Consumed with images dancing in his head of Alice romping with the officer, Bill starts a journey that extends well into the night that puts him up against several different forms of temptation.<br/><br/>First is the grieving daughter, engaged to another man, who throws herself at Bill in the midst of her sadness. He's there in his professional capacity and lets her down gently. Second is a streetwalker who gets Bill into her apartment with the understanding that he's going to pay her $150 for sex. A call from Alice on Bill's cell phone ends his desire for the romp, he pays the girl for her time, and leaves without more than a chaste kiss. Bill then runs into an old friend, Nick Nightingale, who is a jazz pianist and tells Bill about some crazy shindig he's got lined up in a couple of hours. Bill just has to follow, which he does after he procures a tuxedo, cloak, and mask from a closed costume shop.<br/><br/>The shindig is the famous orgy in the house. What fascinates me most about this isn't the orgy itself, it's the fact that it comes in just about halfway through the movie and that the orgy itself is so cloaked in ritual as to border on the profane. Okay, it doesn't border on the profane, it reaches out and grabs the profane with both hands and squeezes as tightly as possible. The music is from a mass played backwards, even. The other part of the ritualistic nature of the orgy is the masks. They never come off and we often seen people kissing each other through the masks. The act of sex is an intimate act, but the masks strip the intimacy completely. Bill's journey has gone from his wife, to someone he knows, to a prostitute, to completely anonymous sex. It's a descent through sex in its different forms until it's nothing more than ritualized and animalistic. Bill gets found out, embarrassed, threatened, and let go after one of the women sacrifices herself to protect him. At home, Alice feeds Bill's sense of jealousy by detailing a dream he just woke her from where she was having sex with a multitude of other men in front of him, mirroring the orgy he just witnessed to a certain degree.<br/><br/>The next day, Bill tries to reclaim the images from the night. It's like he's trying to reconstitute a dream after he's waken up. He tries to find Nick, but he's missing and the hotel clerk tells a strange story of Nick getting forcefully led away. He returns the cloak and tuxedo (having lost the mask) to find that the raucous scene he had interrupted the night before is now calm. He tries to find the prostitute only to discover that she's left and her roommate lets him know that she had just that morning received blood test results that showed her to be HIV+. He then goes back out to the mansion where the orgy took place and receives a written threat to stay away.<br/><br/>That night, he reads of the death of a beauty queen and uses his status as a doctor to look at her corpse, the thought that she is the woman who saved him at the orgy dancing in his head. She was masked, so he can't quite identify her, but he obviously thinks it's her. He then gets called to Victor who lays out that he knows about Bill at the orgy, for he was there as well. He goes back and forth about whether the threats to Bill's life were real, offering different takes on Nick's disappearance and the woman's death than Bill had come up with. Nothing can be verified, so I don't know how much to trust him, but Bill leaves Victor's and his dream ultimately comes to an end. He finds his missing mask from the orgy resting on his pillow next to Alice and he breaks down. He tells her everything of his journey, she's obviously deeply wounded by it, and they decide to try and continue on with the memory of their near infidelities and temptations behind them instead of in front of them.<br/><br/>The Odyssean journey that Bill goes through, as I wrote before, seems to wonderfully capture the logic of a dream. Every stage of a long dream has its own internal logic. The centerpiece for that kind of logic is the costume shop to me. It starts normally with Bill talking through an intercom to the owner of the shop only to find out that it's not whom he expects. The man is shaggy bearded with a long robe and lets him into the place that's darkly lit and filled with mannequins demonstrating certain costumes (this being a Kubrick film, the costumes are mostly of the Napoleonic era). Then the rules of the encounter change when a bump introduces a new element, two Japanese men romping with the costumer's underaged daughter. The costumer locks up the Japanese men and then proceeds with the transaction, getting Bill his tux, cloak, and mask. It's such a weird progression of events and it captures rather perfectly that effervescent feeling of the dream world.<br/><br/>On top of that feel we have a fascinating exploration of the intersection of love and lust. Where does trust end within an established relationship. Bill and Alice have been married for nine years. Should they be comfortable with that fact or should they still worry about not only their spouse's fidelity but their own in the face of a sea of temptations? Bill walks through literal orgies and comes out without having succumbed to temptation, but was presenting himself with the temptation to begin with damaging to the relationship he has with Alice? She sure does seem broken up by it when he admits to it. It's a wonderful exploration that leaves with a sense of hope that things may just end up working out.<br/><br/>The movie is as well really well filmed. Kubrick continues using his Steadicam in much the same way that he did in The Shining, implying an other world that doesn't conform to the rules of our own. A small side note, but there's a small bit in the movie Filmworker about Leon Vitali, Kubrick's personal assistant, where Vitali describes one of Kubrick's outbursts and he used the example of lens flares in Eyes Wide Shut. I think I saw all of them this time through after seeing Vitali mention it.<br/><br/>But yeah, I find the movie completely enrapturing. It's a descent into dream logic and another world while also touching on themes that are extraordinarily grounded. I think it's an underrated work from one of the greatest of filmmakers."

","I have to say that is the most disappointing film that I have ever seen - yes even more so than Blame It On The Bellboy!  It rates only second to The Blair Witch Project as far as overhyping goes.  The plot was shaky and extraordinarily slow moving (if not non-existent), the characters unbelievable, the acting hammy and laughable and the soundtrack/score (normally very good for Kubrick) a little lacklustre.  It seemed to me to be a vehicle for attractive naked people, which was the only enjoyable aspect of the film.

","Don't get me wrong, I like Kubrick.  Clockwork Orange is one of the best movies ever made, Full Metal Jacket is awesome, the Shining is great too. Unfortunately, this is about as bad as 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br/><br/>When this came out, I was relatively excited.  I thought that Kubrick was going to pull out all the stops in his last film, that it was going to top everything else he ever did.  I was very, very disappointed.<br/><br/>The only way I can really see this movie is an excuse to film a bunch of naked people.  And since nudity never advances any plot points or gives us deep insight into a character's soul, filming 200 naked people seems pointless (unless you just wanted to catch a porn movie starring Tom Cruise, because that's all this is).  If this sounds like the perfect way to spend a few hours, watch it.  I'll just check Dr. Stangelove out again."

This film is *awful*. Terrible plot, bad acting - even the picture and sound quality were bad. Kubrick must have needed to money. And Cruise and Kidman must have felt like making a dirty film together (not an uncommon thing for married couples to do). Even the sex was bad. I fell asleep during the orgy scene.

"GratefulJBG","10","16","32","6 January 2008"," Watch it again (and again)
","If you don't understand why this film is on par with Kubrick's best, I strongly recommend you watch it over and over until you get it. Rob Ager's wonderful analysis, parts of which can be found on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj7Hw6OnbH8), will clue you in as to why you owe it to yourself to do so.<br/><br/>In my opinion  and 2001 is the greatest film I have ever seen  Eyes Wide Shut is on the level of 2001 in terms of its calling us to question the nature of our humanity. The dumbstruck critical reaction to EWS was not due simply to some botched marketing campaign  although expectations of some kind of soft-core porn will surely leave you disappointed if you can't shake that preconception. Rather, the underrating of EWS is a factor of one's viewing the film as a film. It is decidedly beyond just a film. It is a laser beam through your third eye. It is a journey down into the rotting bowels of your subconscious.<br/><br/>Certainly, and perhaps particularly if you are an American, parts of it should make you very disgusted with yourself. Whether there is some redemption in EWS is up to you, but I don't think there is. On the surface of the film we are shown how venal transactions and the objectification of women cut through all strata of society, varying only in the level of grotesque and willful disregard for the human soul. We see an idle rich aspirant get a wake-up call about his place in society. We see a married couple come clean about their dark fantasies and ambivalence. But this is truly just the beginning. Once the phone rings in the Harfords' bedroom, the real voyage begins  in us, through Bill Harford's adventures (be they real, a vision of the collective unconscious, or a lucid dream somehow unfolding in real time in both husband and wife).<br/><br/>In EWS, the questions we are urged to ask ourselves relate more to our fears and desires and the foundations of society as opposed to our evolutionary history and trajectory. However, nearly every shot in EWS is so saturated with images, objects, penetrating (if sometimes sparse) dialogue, inside jokes, etc., that I would argue that with respect to set design and mise en scene, and even costuming, it trumps 2001. I can only imagine trying to catch all of what is going on by watching the film in slow motion. Just try to keep up with the textual objects in the film (e.g. signs) and you'll have to be on your toes! If it is true that the studio edited Kubrick's final cut, or that he did not have time to ""polish"" his final work, then this is truly a shame. Yet, the film remains a masterpiece. I hope someday it will be able to be seen in whatever version Stanley intended, because not only does EWS turn a mirror onto ourselves, but it allows, as do his films in general, a fearless and honest glimpse into the very heart and soul of one of the greatest artists of the 20th century."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","13","25","1 May 2008"," ""Soshall we?""
","I have a feeling that Kubrick's stunningly masterful visual exploration of human sexuality will be overshadowed by the major amount of nudity in it, and the graphic sex scenes. It seems that the movie is more well-known because Nicole Kidman is fully nude in it (and Tom Cruise, conspicuously, is heavily covered, even his hands, throughout), despite the fact that she was fully nude in Billy Bathgate back in 1991 but no one cares much about that. Maybe she wasn't famous enough back then. At any rate, she is nude within literally about the first 5 seconds of the film, when we meet her and her husband Dr. Bill Harford. <br/><br/>They have been invited to a classy dinner party which illustrates their place in society, and we meet them as they are getting ready to go out. Clearly, they live a very good life, seemingly much more than even a doctor could afford, given that they live in New York in a sizable mansion. They have been married and faithful to each other for 9 years, have a beautiful 7- year-old daughter, and a very comfortable home. Life is secure, but even in this opening scene, there is an undercurrent of something missing, almost as though they are just going through the motions of their marriage. Alice (Kidman) laments that Bill blandly tells her she looks great without even looking at her, and Bill isn't too excited about the party at all.<br/><br/>But the real problem with their marriage is presented in a way that only Kubrick could come up with. Cruise and Kidman are beautiful people, so it's easy to accept a classy older man being extremely direct with his interest in a romp with Alice (""then and there,"" as she explains later), and that two stunningly beautiful women will attempt to seduce Bill, all at about the same time. Neither is unfaithful, but this event sets off a chain reaction that leads them down an alarming road. <br/><br/>Later, when Alice asks Bill if he had sex with those two women (in much more colorful language than I am allowed here), he sort of laughs it off and assures her that he did not. What he doesn't notice at first is that she doesn't seem the least bit upset or worried when she asks him this, she seems blithely interested, even curious, as though part of her hopes that he did, which would allow her to form some kind of justification in her own mind about being unfaithful herself, something that she has clearly thought about. When she hears that he didn't, she's not very happy, and she lashes out at him with a story that creeps into his mind and turns his life upside down. She has always been faithful to him, but she tells him a story of something that happened that might have been even worse.<br/><br/>A lot of people criticize the movie for how slow it is in a sad misunderstanding of one of the movie's greatest strengths. It has a strange, dream-like quality that derives from its pacing, and this is not an accident, nor is it meant just to make the movie run as long as it is. And it is not about sex, either. This should be obvious, I think. Sex happens in the movie, but it's not about sex, but sexuality. The difference is bigger than you think. It's about the fact that humans are essentially animals with very primal physical needs, but we lift ourselves above beasts by controlling those desires and channeling them into meaningful relationships. This, the movie seems to suggest, is one of the reasons why an unfaithful spouse is such a crippling blow to someone. The most moral and sacred pact of the marriage has been broken.<br/><br/>More specifically, it seems to suggest a human desire (amidst both males and females) for anonymous sex, in the sequence where Bill manages to get into the mansion and witness this taking place, and the vicious threats that he receives when he is discovered. A lot of people have called this a dream sequence, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me, since it is so clearly not. It's bizarre, yes, but I didn't notice anything that would suggest very strongly that it's a dream, outside of the allowance for this possibility. It may have just been left open to that possibility to provoke discussion, but it works better as a real experience than as a dream. Later, Alice confesses a real dream, which is disturbingly close to what Bill saw at that house, and it is a tremendous blow to him.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the movie goes to great lengths to explore the trust in a marriage, and both parties are desperately hurt by what the other has said or done, yet neither of them were ever unfaithful to the other. The performances are phenomenal throughout, and made better by an astonishingly well-written script. You may notice, as the movies nears the end, that remarkably little actually happens in it, and yet the movie says so much. It makes a striking comment about the role of sex in a relationship, and yet never exploits it. <br/><br/>Sadly, a lot of moviegoers are too shortsighted or narrow-minded to understand the film, which is why you get people saying it's the worst thing that Kubrick has ever come out with. It is very normal for a person to condemn as ridiculous something that they can't understand, and this will happen with this movie. But make no mistake, the movie is brilliant, and more than a worthy addition to Kubrick's short but powerful iconography"

","As an aspiring filmmaker, I've often dissected movies to see what makes them great. Other times I'll watch a movie, know that it's great, but can't form a sentence to say why I have such thoughts. Eyes Wide Shut is one of those movies where I can both dissect it and other times I can just let it move me. And since I've already written a cerebral review before, I'll stick to the emotions for this one.<br/><br/>I think the fact that of any movie I've ever reviewed this movie alone has made me want to make two separate reviews tells me something about the power it has. I could go on for hours about what I thought made it great, but I already did that in the other review. I wrote that review after seeing the movie once. Here is how I felt after seeing it twice:<br/><br/>Thank god for directors like Kubrick. I was so glad to see a movie that had a different pacing than most movies today. The movie took its time to unfold and in the end, even if every single incident isn't examined, it helps to create atmosphere. It helped draw me into the film. The vivid imagery and odd happenings were then more acceptable. I viewed certain events with humor, with apprehension, with interest, but never with disbelief.<br/><br/>The acting was dead-on target. I think Kidman deserved an academy award simply for her speech about infidelity. She also plays an inebriated woman quite well. Too bad her role became smaller as Cruise's got bigger. And Cruise was perfect as a normally rational man who internalizes his feelings and is suddenly given information that he does not know how to deal with. He made me believe that what he was going through was genuine and often quite painful.<br/><br/>And, in the end, I think I really love this movie because when I see it I get a feeling deep in my gut. This feeling can't be explained, but I get the feeling when I watch something that is, in my opinion, a truly great piece of cinema. It's that feeling that inspires me. It's what makes me aspire to be a filmmaker. And the fact that I get it when I watch Eyes Wide Shut tells me that even if it's misunderstood, even if there is nothing to understand, Kubrick's final film was one of tremendous importance and validity.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."
"zakso999","10","7","12","16 January 2012"," Kubrick's Curtain Call and one of the Very Few Films to Change My Life
","Kubrick's film career is quite an impressive one. He can do no wrong. Every single movie he has made has gotten largely positive reviews and now withstand the test of time. Even if one of his movies meets with mixed reviews, it later goes on to get largely positive reviews later (The Shining is a prime example). Kubrick has contributed to nearly every genre of film, even comedy (Dr. Strangelove). Now let's talk about Eyes Wide Shut. <br/><br/>This film is often regarded as Kubrick's one mistake. I say otherwise. While I will agree that the film was very long and some scenes were unbearably slow (take the final scene with Tom Cruise and Sydney Pollack for example), the film has some very sincere messages about sexual jealousy, and what it truly means to be committed, the directing is absolutely brilliant, the writing is tremendous. As for the acting, they probably could've done better.<br/><br/>Now one thing that I want to bring up is the controversy over the film's erotic content. Yes, the film is erotic and contains some sex and nudity, it is an erotic movie. However, it is NOT meant to titillate or arouse. The film suffered from a very bad marketing campaign that implied that the film was a sexual exploitation film. This film is sorely misunderstood.<br/><br/>This film actually helped strengthen my relationships and really affected me emotionally, and mentally. I actually felt myself become wiser because of this movie. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: I believe that, if you love Kubrick films, and can sit through a 2 and a 1/2 hour film with a bit of jabber, you will enjoy Kubrick's final masterpiece.<br/><br/>**** and a half out of *****"
"ColtSeavers","10","10","19","1 October 2006"," We're awake now
","I saw this movie a couple of times, and each time I was more impressed by how carefully it is construed. With this movie, Kubrick once again lived up to his reputation of being a perfectionist. But the reason why I love this movie so much is not its amazing technical finesse, but its content: We as humans are not in control of our sexual desires, nor are we made for monogamy. Temptation is everywhere. Thus, even a ""straight A-marriage"" like the Harford's can never be the whole truth. When Mrs. Harford, under the influence of Marihuana, confesses her fantasy of adultery to her husband, their naive illusion of perfect harmony is shattered, never to be restored. Instead, Bill goes on a journey into his own (and more importantly, OUR) hidden wishes and imaginations, and is increasingly overwhelmed by the power of sexuality (it doesn't matter if all this really happens or is just a dream of his). In the end, there's desperation, a confession, and tears, but at least: ""We are awake now"". The Harfords have matured by accepting an inconvenient truth about what it means to be human. And there's the stunning realization, that there can STILL be love. Maybe not forever (""let's not use that word - it frightens me""), but at least for the moment. And so, after all, there's one thing the two of them are going to do as soon as possible...<br/><br/>What an insightful, liberating and important movie !"

","Just after we watched ""Eyes Wide Shut"" a few years ago, I told my wife that it was very much a ""man's movie"". This is not intended to be a sexist comment, but I believe that in order to appreciate the several typically Kubrikian nuances in the film, one has to watch it through Tom Cruise's eyes and one can only do this effectively if one is a man....like Cruise. With Kubrick, the sum of the parts does not always make an effective whole, but it somehow does so in this film. The direction is very much ""in the face"" as it always is with Kubrick and the various supporting characters - like the shopowner's nubile Lolita-like daughter - somehow convey a hidden message that is for receptive ears only. But to my mind, the best scene in the film is the early morning street sequence after the party where Cruise realises that he is being followed by the bald man. There is a hidden menace in the air that can only be appreciated if you put yourself in Cruise's shoes. For this and several other sequences, this is a very unusual film that needs to be seen and enjoyed in the right mood, preferably on one's own."

"diand_","10","11","22","22 February 2005"," Beyond perfection: Sculpting in light
","Kubrick experimented with styles and changes in styles in the narrative. Here he changes the standpoint in the narrative from a movie about relationships to a thriller and then changes once again to more philosophical issues. Inside these major styles there are smaller changes in storytelling, introducing sub-layers in the story. Furthermore, the movie repeatedly questions its own existence and portrayal of events.<br/><br/>Camera-work is once again amazing. Every shot is perfect, it feels like sculpting in light. A wide variety of lenses and color scheme's is used. Take for example the wonderful scene in the pool room that is pivotal in the movie and took so much time. (Note also the congruity in that scene between the change in the actor's positions and the change in the story). Colors are also used to code the whole movie (with a crazy amount of detail: even the fence is blue).<br/><br/>After these aspects, there's the story. Eyes Wide Shut explores the other side of a faithful life: Bill Harford enters an unfamiliar world where he doesn't know the rules. But there's also commentary about these worlds: the masks, the shabby apartment, the daughter prostitute. The character of Alice(!) suggesting the mystery.<br/><br/>Kubrick thought of this movie as his best ever. It is. It is probably the best movie ever made. In a few years time it will (as usual with him) be heralded as a masterpiece."

","I've been reading a lot of the users' reviews about this film and I have noticed that all of them revolve either around the cinematography aspects or the symbolic aspects of sexualism in the film, however anyone wishes to interpret them. I hate to break it to you people, but this film is more real than you want to believe. The question you should start asking yourself is why did the great master Stanley Kubrick choose his last film, and his greatest as he called it, to have this particular theme, and I mean the theme of secret, all-powerfull, societies? The obvious answer, which is the true one in this case, is because he deemed it to be an issue of extreme importance, probably of utter importance. Secretive cults, which use sophisticated and brutal mind programming techniques to control its members, starting from when they are infants and continuing throughout their whole lives are here, are real and are extremely widespread. They have their Manchurian Candidates all over our most important institutions and in the highest levels of government all over the world. They have a very concise plan to take over the world and they are meticulously working towards their sinister goal. You don't need to believe me, because who am I anyway? You can start by reading the works of brave individuals, such as Professor of psychology in the University Of Utah Hospital Dr. D. Corydon Hammond, who after working for years with patients who were trying to escape from the ""family"" decided to disclose everything to his colleagues in a conference. He never spoke about it again. You can read testimonies of very brave and lucky survivors (lucky as Dr William in the film --remember the scene where he starts reading a newspaper with a huge front-page title saying ""LUCKY TO BE ALIVE""? is a very good web resource about all this). By the way, Kubrick himself died suddenly before the film's official release. We are not even sure we watched what he wanted us to watch.
Don't forget to also check out another revealing film with the same theme, ""The Brotherhood of the Bell"", as well as the rare Discovery Channel documentary ""Conspiracy of Silence"". I also suggest the documentary film ""From JFK to 9/11, everything is a rich man's trick"" available (after continuous efforts to silence it) in YouTube. As the great Kubrick himself says to all of us with our eyes wide shut people, WAKE UP!"
"tangietangerine","9","5","8","28 June 2014"," Fidelio
","Kubrick's last film couldn't have gone by without a fair share of critical backlash and general controversy, similar to what happened to mostly all of his movies. Also, similar to other movies of his, is the feeling of doubt and suspicion we feel after it's over. Like the final scene in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", we're not quite sure what the hell we've just watched, but we're certainly left intrigued with many different perspectives and the need to reflect about the meaning of all that. Because with Kubrick, and anyone who is/once was an assiduous viewer of his films would agree, nothing is incidental. It seems that every little thing is in its determined little place to make the wheel spin, so to speak.<br/><br/>There are a number of conspiracy theories revolving around Eyes Wide Shut (like there was with The Shining and 2001, etc.), which we'll never be able to confirm or discard completely. But it's nevertheless interesting because it only shows how much we're affected by how he manipulates us throughout the story. Leaving the conspiratorial bit out for a while, what is left is an ambiguous story seen from Tom Cruise's character point of view...what in his nocturnal adventures were real? what's real? just because things happened inside one's head, it doesn't mean they weren't real, does it? His mind plays perverse tricks with him. From the point when his wife, in a provocative monologue, dangles the possibility of cheating on him, just about everything he comes across has an undertone that relates to that matter. And it's so subtle, from the bunch of bullies who question his ""manhood"" in the streets, to the unexpected encounter with the Russian guy's daughter, it all seems to echo what's going on inside his mind. Would his wife really betray him if she was given the chance? would he be able to do the same? In the middle of all this, he comes across some sort of bizarre ritual, both sacred and profane, and even though he's wearing the same costume and behaving like the others, he fails to blend in and people soon notice he should not be there. Did those people also realize he didn't have what it takes to be a part of the ""cult""? in other words, to have sex with a stranger and to desire to do so.<br/><br/>It's hard to talk about this scene and not mention what a beautiful piece of film it is. I guess it's one of the times where Kubrick succeed best in creating a perfect mood that completely immerses us. All of the elements work, the atmosphere created by the score, the costumes (especially the one who nods to Bill from up the balcony) and the general feeling of strangeness, as we've entered another dimension apart from our world, apart from Bill's repressed middle-class life.<br/><br/>One part which was left unanswered to me was the next scene, when he comes home and Nicole Kidman's character mysteriously has had a nightmare very similar to what he just went through. It could be some sort of subconscious transmission, almost psychic, but there's just something about it that doesn't fit. Later on, Bill's friend tries to clear all this mystery to him, saying there was nothing to it, it was all an act, fake, meant to scare him away. But who would do such a thing? Picking up the pieces, for a few moments I even believed Alice could be involved in the farce...because of the nightmare's timing, and the mask found on the bed beside her.<br/><br/>This is just a tiny little analysis compared to the whole richness of the movie, but it's where it got me thinking. And I'm sure that's what Kubrick wanted in the first place. It's not so fun when an explanation is thrust upon us, like a game of questions and answers, because there is so much more to a story and a character than a filmmaker would be able to synthesize in one last scene. That is one of the reasons why I hold Stanley Kubrick's films so dear, because the genius of him is to never give easy way outs or shortcuts, and to turn each one of his movies into a vast universe where anything is possible."
"Vartiainen","Null","5","8","17 January 2014"," Dream-like sexual weirdness
","Stanley Kubrick's last film before his death. A film that blurs the borders of dreaming and challenges us to question the differences between reality, dreams, fantasies and nightmares. Sometimes it's just as weird to be awake as it is to dream.<br/><br/>Dr. William Harford - played brilliant here by Tom Cruise in a role that might very well be the best he has ever done - flees from his house after hearing a jarring confession from his wife. And thus begins the long night that would haunt him forever.<br/><br/>What makes this film so perfect is Kubrick's vision. The pace is so agonizingly slow, the plot so nonsensical, that had it not had one of the best directors of all time at the steering wheel, it would fallen straight to that pile of artsy borefests that only film majors ever watch. But it doesn't. Yes, it's slow, yes it makes no sense whatsoever, but yet it works. I remember glancing at the clock after the film had been going on for a while and I remember asking ""Has it really been two hours already?"" Because it didn't feel like it had. The film is hypnotizing. It pulls you in and as Harford wanders around New York, you remain strangely calm about the whole situation. You don't question, why was that character there, why did that scene happen. It just does, it's cool.<br/><br/>Part of that calmness comes from the technical side of this film. Kubrick didn't want to use any studio lighting, so instead the crew relied mostly on the various Christmas decorations that they places strategically all over the sets. This gives the film a slightly blurred, soft and ethereal quality, not unlike if you were dreaming the whole time. The soundtrack is also amazingly powerful, underlining each scene with a heavy hand, but never in a way that feels forced. One of the few films where I noticed the sound cues and didn't hate them.<br/><br/>I already praised Tom Cruise, but it's also worth noticing that despite this film having huge piles of gratuitous nudity, despite the infamous orgy scene, despite all these weird sexual situations Harford finds himself in, the sexiest thing in the entire film is his wife (Nicole Kidman) leaning against the doorframe in her nightclothes or peering over her glasses. That's talent on Kidman's part and the fact is helped alone by her and Cruise's marriage at the time. They have fantastic chemistry together and Kidman provides us with the needed reality and anchorage.<br/><br/>Pretty much the only thing keeping this film from becoming one of my personal favourites is the fact that the ending drags. Not a huge amount, but it does. At that point the musical cues have begun to grow on your nerves, the slow scenes have slipped back into being agonizing and you just want the film to give you its final words and leave you to ponder its mysteries. Instead we get one final conversation before the ending scene between Cruise and Kidman. It doesn't ruin the film for me, but it's a shame that such a great film falters just before the finish line.<br/><br/>Still, it's an amazing film. Heavily sexual, but not in a sexy way, it's a journey like you've never taken before. Riddled with phenomenal acting performances, with fantastic production values, ironhand directing and unforgettable scenes, it's a film you're going to remember. May it haunt your fantasies and deepest nightmares."

","From the first scene itself when the camera moves seductively over the naked body of Nicole Kidman, you know you are in throes of a legendary director. Kubrick, who passed away one week after completing the edit on this movie, makes one of his best flicks here. Based on a 1926 book called Dream Story, this tells about a doctor, played quite well by Tom Cruise, who goes on a night of sexual discovery after learning that his wife, played by Kidman who was his real wife at that time, almost cheated on him once. He meets a motley of characters and his interactions with them are written and directed superbly by Kubrick. There is the unforgettable scene in the castle which will send shivers down the spine. In the acting department, Kidman easily bests Cruise even though she has a much smaller role. The background score is superb. There are scenes which depict orgies and they understandably are explicit. The scenes are set up and executed so beautifully. Kubrick was in a class of his own. This is his final movie and the touch never waned. 4 out of 5 for this masterpiece. It is nearly 155 minutes long but did not drag even once and that is the hallmark of a great director."
"Kubris","9","5","8","3 June 2012"," Kubrick's legend
","Well, this is it. After two months I've seen every Kubrick film in order, from Fear and Desire to Eyes Wide Shut. And while I was a bit nervous about how then- 70 year old Kubrick would handle the topic of sex with Hollywood stars after a decade off from directing, I have to applaud this absolutely wonderful surprise of film, horribly underrated on this site, the IMDb.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut channels much of Kubrick's previous work, such as A Clockwork Orange and 2001 while crafting its own unique identity. If you've ever wondered how directors from previous eras would fair in this generation, look no further: this film shows evolution. It's impossible to believe that this was made by the same man who made The Killing. But don't believe that this film is great because of its director or his past work: the score reflects my opinion of the film on its own.<br/><br/>Summarizing Eyes Wide Shut is difficult: the plot consists of a couple fighting and he walks into a series of events causing an awakening. Is it romantic? Nope. Thriller, or a mystery? Yep, and a bit scary in places too. But for the the entire 2.5+ hour runtime its engaging, and constantly interesting. You'll wonder what happens next and how it all plays out, and there's a sense of wonder throughout: movie magic. <br/><br/>I wonder if Kubrick knew this was going to be his last film, because he references so much of his previous work, something I haven't noticed him to do much. Notably from Clockwork and Lolita is the content. From 2001 there is a sense of realization. Such as learning about the moment we evolved into what we are today, Eyes Wide Shut ironically opens our eyes to aspects of life we tend to pass over. A revolution.<br/><br/>And from Barry Lyndon and Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut draws beauty. This film is beautiful to see, with extravagant upper class parties and a living city. I was shocked to learn this was all filmed in England.<br/><br/>From this film I appreciate Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman more as actors. Working with Kubrick was never easy, especially on this film's long shoot. Both leads perform excellently, and are perfect for the characters. They were up to the challenges and demands of the film, and the offscreen parallels don't hurt either.<br/><br/>I can't believe this is a 7.2. Maybe it's the hype, or maybe some just didn't like the length. But everything serves its purpose in Eyes Wide Shut, like the greatest films. Eyes Wide Shut is an excellent film, a great swan song from the greatest director of all time who left my eyes wide open. 8.7/10"
"ericl-2","Null","5","8","22 July 1999"," This movie is NOT about sex!
","Kubrick's last film has been getting some unjustified negative press (slow, ill-matched mix of ponderous and comic, Cruise can't act, etc). There are some inconsistencies in editing, color quality, sound mix, but these don't take away much from one of the defining American films of the decade. Biggest complaint seems to be that the sex isn't very, well, sexy. But when was the last time Kubrick made a movie in which sex was fun (A Clockwork Orange? George C. Scott and his girlfriend at the beginning of Dr. Strangelove?)? And anyway, sex isn't what EWS (or any other Kubrick film) is about. Like Schnitzler's novel, it's really about the deeper insecurities of a young couple on their way up the social ladder. They had such people in turn-of-the-century Vienna, too, which is why this was such good material for an update to the nouveau riche '90s, especially for a cold fish like ol' Stanley.<br/><br/>Schnitzler wrote about bourgeois up-and-comers fascinated and repelled by the decadent world of the aristocracy - however real or imaginary that decadence turned out to be. Same thing here - our young couple don't know why the mysterious Victor keeps inviting them to his Christmas parties, but they're dazzled and drawn into his world, which makes theirs look suddenly boring. Tom and Nicole, with their unshakeable image as Hollywood's young naifs, are perfectly cast. And it doesn't matter that their performances aren't especially impressive: Cruise, who reacts to everything with the same clenched, defensive grin, IS Bill Harford, the doctor out of his depth in the weird world of the super-rich. Kubrick wickedly uses the truths and rumors about these two stars to add dimensions to the film, even throwing in a scene where a bunch of frat-kids gay-bash Bill.<br/><br/>Wife Alice's fascination confines itself to her dreams; husband goes out on the town. He doesn't have sex with the hooker who picks him up, because sex isn't really what he's after -- it's adventure, something to take him out of his narrow existence. What's all that money he's making for, anyway?<br/><br/>Sure, the much-derided orgy-in-a-mansion scene is ludicrous, but it's probably just the kind of fantasy a guy like Bill Harford would dream up if you asked him to think decadent. (What's dream and what's reality? consider that the one-night stand that's Alice's fantasy is pretty tame compared to what Bill ""actually"" sees - yet he didn't have sex, and in her dream, she does.) Think of it as wish-fulfillment: Bill gets exactly the kind of outre experience he was looking for, and in the end gets exactly the lesson he probably knew was coming all along: don't meddle with things you don't understand. The ending confirms one of the defining truths about the middle class of either 1900 or the 1990s: that when confronted with such advice, they will take it, circle the wagons, defend their immediate material world, and let the mysterious remain the mysterious. Yes, life is elsewhere; it'll just have to stay there. The title is perfect: Eyes wide open - but only for an instant. Then shut tight again, probably for good. Fine film, and a most timely note on which to end an extraordinary moviemaking career."

","To be completely honest, I love to read all of the reviews people give films like this. Pseudo-intellectual film school students pulling meaning and subtext from hollow, meaningless films. It's quite amusing, actually. You see, if it wasn't for the fact that this film was a Kubrick film, it would be completely knocked by the film going public and critics alike. No one could possibly like a film like this, because it's bad. Bad in every respect of the word, not a single frame in this film is anything but dreadful.<br/><br/>Why, you might ask, is it rated so well... Easy, I respond. Many people who want to feel as if they're intelligent try append meaning to the meaningless, and pull some form of artistic integrity out of a film like this. So, if you liked this film, you're one of two things. 1. A thirteen year old boy (for the nudity, of course). 2. A pseudo-intellectual, self-praising poser. Now, stop and think which group you fit into...<br/><br/>Now, Kubrick has never been a genius, not close. His films are boring garbage, plain and simple. The only thing Kubrick did in his career is '2001' and that's only due to the fact that '2001' was so far ahead of it's time. The rest of the Kubrick catalog is littered with hollow rubbish.<br/><br/>
This film, in particular, is by far the worst. It looks bad, it looks like a bad blow up from a 16mm print. The sets are pitiful, the lighting is horrid... nothing in the film is good. Even the acting is sub-par, which is surprising. I'm not a Cruise or Kidman fan at all, but I would have to say that, with the exception of 'Eyes Wide Shut', they've been able to churn out some descent performances.<br/><br/>The script, even though re-written many, many times is inane. Whatever possibilities this film had were lost. Maybe if someone other than Kubrick would've been helming this project it could've came off as something good, but the way it turned out is rediculous.<br/><br/>Here's my advice... Save your money, see something else. You'll be happy that you did."

(by Kubrick) a full four days before his death, though the score and some special effects (computer generated people during the orgy scene) were not finalized.<br/><br/>I have never got into this movie, it just left me cold the other two times I watched it. Watching it now, I still don't think it works. It does it surprise me that I don't love this movies though. Spartacus, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket aside, I do not enjoy Kubrick movies. I just never understood the praise lavished upon his movies. <br/><br/>It is uncomfortable to watch, and it does have a good sense of creepy atmosphere, and the score is particularly eerie too. This is probably the least colourful Cruise performance in quite some time. (I'd go back to Far & Away) sometimes he is good, but other times less so. Kidman, on the other hand, is excellent. This is her best performance she has given in a Crusie movie (her final one) and is definitely a sign of what a great actress she is!! And what a fine bum she had too. Vinessa Shaw, Todd Field, Marie Richardson, Alan Cumming and Leelee Sobieski (an actress I always liked, and thought was destined for big things) all stand out in supporting or small roles. <br/><br/>This was the first Stanley Kubrick movie to open at number one in the U.S (it was Cruise's sixth consecutive chart topper) but it was not a hit at the box office. It only grossed $55 million to end 1999 the 42nd highest grossing movie of the year. Cruises worst performing movie since Legend in 1986."

This movie gets started in one direction, and then proceeds to dance around in place while nothing important happens.<br/><br/>I felt that I could have left the movie, walked around the lobby for an hour, returned and have missed nothing at all.<br/><br/>The movie opens at a party hosted by Victor Ziegler (Sydney  Pollack). Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) and Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) are introduced as a couple who in the company  of others who are a bit more affluent then themselves.   Apparently, Bill is friends with Victor and gets invited to these parties every year.  We never learn how or why Victor and Bill are friends.<br/><br/>We do learn that Bill is in fact a doctor who's not a jealous man until his wife tells him that she had a fantasy once  about being with another man she saw.  Then Bill decides it's time to roam the streets and encounter every sexually skewed person on the planet as he tries desperately to cheat on his wife.  You don't learn much else about Bill except that he did in fact go to medical school, as evidenced by the fact that he runs into an old friend from med-school who dropped out.  His friend, Nick Nightengale, is not developed much either.<br/><br/>Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) plays opposite Cruise as his wife.  We never learn much about her either, except that she's a flirt when she's drunk, she likes to smoke weed, and she's really upset that her husband doesn't think that she would  cheat on him.  Oh yeah, there is some mentioned interest in art and I think we see her looking through the want ads for  a job once.<br/><br/>The two have a daughter in the movie who's only purpose is to  prove to you that Bill and Alice have actually been  married for the stated nine years without having to actually explain any of their past.  In fact, we learn nothing about their relationship whatsover.  Keep in mind, that their relationship is the supposed crux of this movie.  The ""climax"" of the movie is when Bill ends up at a secret sex party where everyone is masked and cloaked.  He is immeadiately recognized by a hooker who he had briefly helped the night before when she was drunk and high on heroin and cocaine. How she recognized Bill through his cloak and mask despite only have met him once in an extremely foggy (near-overdose) state is beyond me.  Eventually, his true identity is exposed at the party and Bill's life may be in  danger (you're not sure because you never told who's at the party and what their capable of).  The hooker comes to Bill's rescue and sacrifices herself for his sake.  The climax is later undone as Victor explains that the whole identity exposing, life-threatening scene may have in fact been staged just to scare him.  You never learn one way or the other what the truth is.<br/><br/>The movie has a fitting ending as Bill ends up confessing all that has transposed to Alice and she tells him that they  need to ""f*ck"". <br/><br/>This was one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. Even if you are curious about this movie, I urge you to save your money."

This movie is not for everyone; some will enjoy it today, others may enjoy it 10 years from now.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that will leave you thinking for days and weeks and I might still discover more things that I like about it 5 or 10 years from now."
"bandw","9","4","6","27 April 2012"," Perhaps Kubrick's most emotionally accessible film
","As fascinating as they are Kubrick's other films from this are about people and events you are not likely to experience in real life. In this movie Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) may be living a New York City lifestyle beyond the financial reach of most of us, but it is easy to identify with their emotional lives. They have been married for nine years and the opening scene establishes how comfortable they are with each other, maybe too comfortable. For example, in preparing for an upscale party given by a wealthy friend, Bill is looking in the mirror while Alice is on the toilet. She is dressed in an elegant black gown and when she gets up Bill does not even look at her as he tells her she looks great.<br/><br/>At the party both Bill and Alice are the subjects of attempted seductions. The scene between Bill and Alice in their Manhattan apartment after the party is pivotal, and one of the best in the movie. It shows just what a delicate balance relationships can be in. Alice was a little suspicious of Bill's disappearing after she had seen him with two young women at the party and in her interrogation of her husband she subtly twists everything he says to put him on the spot. For her part she confesses to a past obsession with a Naval officer that she had seen only once from a distance. Her confession punctures Bill's confidence in their relationship as he imagines Alice together with the officer. But, beyond the jealousy, Bill's imaginings spark a sexual passion in him. This scene sets up the entire rest of the movie, not only the story line, but the filming. Kubrick's use of color in this movie is striking, lushly lighted foregrounds with contrasting backgrounds. The scene that has Alice softly lighted standing in a doorway with the room behind her a deep blue is typical.<br/><br/>In ultimate frustration Bill leaves the apartment to wander the streets of New York. He meets an old friend in a bar and the intrigue begins. Bill winds up at an exclusive ritualistic sexual orgy where everyone wears a medieval mask. Anyone who has seen this movie will remember the orgy scenes--they are mesmerizing, but not pornographic. One thing that is pressed home is how much of sex is driven by what is imagined, both good and bad.<br/><br/>As things progress the movie takes on the aspects of part thriller and part comedy. In the end the audience is left asking what is real and what is fake. But at least the relationship between Bill and Alice is resolved.<br/><br/>I can't remember when a musical score has played such an important part in a movie. The romantic Shostakovitch Russian Waltz is a perfect background for the lighter scenes, but it is the second movement of Ligeti's Musica Ricercata that adds a particularly haunting quality to the scenes where Bill is wandering in the darkness. I had not realized how the playing of a single note on a piano can build tension.<br/><br/>There are scenes that seemed superfluous to me, like the scene where Bill runs into a bunch of rowdies who hector him on the street, accusing him of being gay. <br/><br/>This film adds to the distinguished list of accomplishments of a great director."
"betc","5","4","6","19 July 1999"," Disappointing
","Although I consider myself a Kubric fan, I was disappointed in this film. The catalyst for the plot is Nicole's character's admission that she was tempted not just to cheat on her husband, but also to give up her marriage and child for just one night with some guy she never even had a conversation with.  Give me a break!  Since Nicole's character is not a total flake, I had a major problem believing this.  I also thought the plot was overly moralistic and misogynistic.  Women who indulge in promiscuous sex are severely punished while men are not (the Sydney Pollack character).  There is excessive female nudity, while Tom rarely takes off his over-coat. There are many nude scenes of Nicole, and when she's not naked, she's frequently clad in just her underwear.  The orgy scene was ridiculous with the digitized cover-ups.  This movie dragged on in what seemed like real time. On the plus side, I loved the look of the film, as well as the cinematography and use of light.  Tom was perfectly cast."

","This is perhaps the most underrated film in existence. It reads like a Greek tragedy in its content of sin (jealousy, envy, etc.), its consequences and the constant Dionysian excess displayed throughout the film. For example, the Doctor's arrogance and the hubris he experiences at the end. A background of simple piano strokes intensifies the dramatic effect. In many ways, the film proceeds like the great classics of the 1940s and 1950s (except for the level of nudity, of course). It's suspense is both brilliant and subtle. It is unfortunate that the masses lack the intellect required to recognize how unique this film is. The film has numerous undertones of ancient Greek plays. The masses, however cannot appreciate a film if it lacks constant special effects and tend to lack understanding of brilliant subtlety. This film took longer than the standard six month, cookie-cutter story. They do not make films like these any more."
"zetes","10","7","13","18 July 1999"," Kubrick's Second best after 2001
","I think the critics, even the ones who like this film, are missing the point. When 2001 came out, most every critic panned it completely. Pauline Kael, the uber-critic, called it dull and unimaginative. At that time, I can understand her view. Kubrick's famous films that far were The Killing, Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lolita (the only one on this list I haven't seen), and Dr. Strangelove. All of these are wonderful films, Dr. Strangelove usually being considered his second masterpiece after 2001, but they lack the style of all the later Kubrick films. 2001 may be somewhat tedious to the average person once in a while, and it's almost uninterpretable, but it leaves posibly the strongest after-thoughts of any film. Kubrick's target was our love for narrative, but our unconscious minds. The pleasure of watching 2001 and Kubrick's other later films resides deep inside. It is too bad critics only have a few days to write their reviews. But by this time, they should have seen enough of Kubrick's films to realize this. The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, and Full Metal jacket all aged beautifully in my perception, and they all get better with each subsequent viewing. No other director who ever lived can do this.<br/><br/>Only 2001 effects the unconscious mind more than Eyes Wide Shut. It is truly his second best film. It's images wander in my mind two days afterward as if I saw it an hour ago. I lay in bed the whole first night thinking about it, not sleeping for ten minutes. I didn't need to go to sleep to dream that night. The film seemed as if I dreamed it. The grainy film really added to that effect. And the color scheme. God, Kubrick was a genius to set this film at Christmastime. There are several gorgeous shots of Christmas lights. And a neon rainbow that especially lingers in my mind. And the religious orgy scene, which will undoubtedly become the most famous scene in the film, has colors that just made me weep with their heavenly beauty. Oh, and those purple sheets at the very end of the film. Critics complained about a speech near the end that undermined and ruined a nice murder mystery thread of the narrative (see especially Roger Ebert's review; though I love him, I think he's dead wrong this time). I think it would have been below Kubrick to end the film with a mysterious twist. Any director can give us a narrative trick at the end to put a goofy smile on our face. The idiotic ending of The Usual Suspects comes to the head of my mind. It's usually misinterpreted as genius because people don't realize that the sum of the parts ought to naturally be greater than one clever scene. If you want to see real genius, see Eyes Wide Shut, the second best film that Kubrick made, the second best film of the nineteen-nineties, and one of the best films ever made."
"moonspinner55","2","10","21","5 January 2009"," Kubrick's cop-out: there's no sting in the writing, and hardly a chill in the air...
","""Eyes Wide Shut"" looks great but never comes together. It has an impossibly long build-up which strives to tell us that a wealthy, seemingly happy married couple have cracks in their facade, which sends the husband ""out into the night"". Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick has shown tremendous talent with his actors, but even this auteur can't break through Tom Cruise's candy-coated shell (the movie is all about masks, but Cruise is wearing the biggest one, that of a movie star who can't escape his own inhibitions). Nicole Kidman is perhaps better, but her role is extremely weak (Kubrick has never had much affinity for his women). Does the picture hope to shock? To provoke? Is it a psychological thriller or a voyeur's fantasy? It seems to struggle with all these ingredients. In the end, it is mostly just dull and slow, one final glimpse of Kubrick revering himself and the potency of the heterosexual male. * from ****"
"zevt","8","6","11","2 March 2013"," Maddeningly intriguing - it has staying power even if you don't like it
","Like most Kubrick movies, a very unique experience whether you like it or not. My personal opinion of this movie is constantly wavering for years now. Even while I re-watch it, I find myself not liking certain aspects of it, but unable to let it go.<br/><br/>Cruise and Kidman, once a couple in real life, act as a couple that has reached a crisis. The crisis involves sex and the issue of sexual fantasies and their dangerous and ignored place in a marriage.<br/><br/>It attacks immaturity and the act of burying your head in the sand when it comes to other people's human frailties, flaws and fantasies while accepting your own. Hence the title.<br/><br/>Dr. William Harford (Cruise) is a typically naive young husband who thinks a woman, and especially his wife, is faithful because she requires love and stability in a relationship. He flirts at parties, seems faithful, but also seems to be oblivious to the dangers and hypocrisies of his fantasies and the way he sees women.<br/><br/>When he fails to show jealousy over a suave man that hits on his wife, she brutally crushes his naiveté by telling him of a time where she was willing to leave him for a fling with a sailor. Although it is an aggressive and rude confession, it's easy to overlook her admissions of fear and conflicting feelings for him, and her message to him, which she does a bad job of conveying, is clear once you think about it with mature sensitivity.<br/><br/>(spoilers) <br/><br/>He then wanders through the city, staggering with the implications and unpleasant images that this confession triggers, and is so outraged, angry and confused, that he tentatively pushes his flirtations and fantasies a few steps further. This night of strange sexual encounters is almost surreal, with people hitting on him for the strangest reasons, coming close to infidelity with a sweet hooker, all leading to the notorious cult-orgy scene.<br/><br/>And then comes the day-after, full of disappointing realism, daylight, and scary repercussions. He finds out how dangerous his encounters could have been. There is a death which may or may not have been caused by his naiveté. There is a plausible explanation, but is it really plausible? <br/><br/>The movie doesn't answer this question. It leaves us hanging with our own imaginations, like a fantasy. Instead, it is back to reality for the couple, only this time their eyes are opened to their flaws and responsibilities and possible choices.<br/><br/>Given the above way of looking at this movie, her last line becomes clearer. It is a crude awakening that sex is not always a romantic, or harmless fantasy, and that adults don't just make love to their wives, but *uck as well.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie may just be saying that humans are led by their animalistic drives regardless of dangerous consequences, and it's time to wake up to this fact and accept it the way it is. It doesn't explicitly raise the issue of making responsible choices. That's the kind of movie this is: Ambiguous, but thought-provoking.<br/><br/>It is not really an erotic movie. Kidman's nudity in the beginning of the movie is just as engineered as the rest of the movie: She starts as a sex object and a mother, gives us a strange, mysterious look in the mirror, then forcibly becomes a sexual person with flaws and immoral sexual fantasies of her own.<br/><br/>There was much hullabaloo over the cult-orgy scene and what it did or didn't show, but whether genitalia was shown or not is irrelevant. I found the whole scene ridiculous and mechanical until I realized that it is exactly the effect it was going for and that it needs to be taken as a surreality, and is only there to involve the audience in a fantasy experience detached from reality and a tangible eroticism, and with unexpected, unknown dangers.<br/><br/>Besides the ridiculous orgy, another flaw is Kubrick's ability to drain some scenes of their blood, drawn out with overly-pregnant pauses and slow pacing, possibly due to his famously pedantic multiple takes. But, in some cases, this helps the atmosphere and gives you time to absorb the scene.<br/><br/>This movie is a lot of things. It is an art-house movie about sex for adults. It is a horror-thriller for men in a unique sense of the genre. It is definitely a thought-provoking movie. It doesn't seem to appeal to female audiences as much as men though, but perhaps this review will help appreciate it a bit more.<br/><br/>I may have explained too much for a movie that wants to be open-ended and provocative. But if nothing else, I wrote this for myself to try to organize my thoughts and figure out why it glued itself to my mind so."
"eyecandyforu","10","6","11","11 March 2010"," The title says it all...
","Eyes Wide Shut remains one of those films that when I mention it to people, I inevitably get eye rolls and OMGs. It's weirdness seems to overpower it, causing what I like to call ""The Art-house Effect"". Many expect a mainstream film; this if far from one. Many viewers no doubt expected a film that would titillate and shock. It does do both of these things but they take a far backseat. For all it's convolution and confusion, the story is very simple. A man travels by night across Manhattan and Long Island at Christmas. During this all-nighter he has many strange adventures and is subjected to temptations. In the light of the next day, he is shown how wrong he was about his perceptions. If this reminds you of A Christmas Carol, then congratulations because you would be right. This film could be rightly called a very adult Carol. It also suggests legends and myths where the ""hero"" is tested by his encounters and found to be worthy.<br/><br/>Kubrick was a film genius. He doesn't care if we ""don't get it"", he never has. Most of his films have been received as being difficult to understand, yet later they somehow achieve clarity. It's as though we catch up to him after a few years. His lighting in this is especially sublime, ""pushing"" the exposure a few extra stops so that ambient light, (candles, table lamps, Christmas lights) is plenty of light. This makes the goings on dark and dreamlike. Further enhancing this unreal atmosphere are supposedly outdoor street scenes, which look artificial to the extreme. Look at the streets the next time you watch this, they look pristine, impossibly perfect. My only severe criticism of this film is the casting of Cruise and Kidman. A Superceleb couple at the time of filming, IMHO they are horribly miscast. Cruise projects very little presence, I wondered why anyone bothered to interact with him to the degree they do. Kidman pretty much started her Ice Queen period here, despite a playful character, she is distant. Their looks only go so far in this. There's the feeling of rebelliousness by both of them, as though they are fighting against the rest of the film. It's a testament to Kubrick's masterful hand that the film transcends this miscasting, under another director it might have ruined it. <br/><br/>This film is magic. A fairy tale for grown ups. It's message is clear and echoed throughout the film by the password for entry to the party. Without trust and honesty in relationships, we are lost."

","And that is precisely Bill Harford's life, from the moment Marion kisses him at her father's deathbed to his opening a beer in his kitchen in the wee small hours before entering his bedroom and spotting the Venetian mask next to his sleeping wife Alice.<br/><br/>Go ahead, try it: Remove all that transpires between these moments. Remove even the mask. Fill in with what you like, or leave it blank. A plot will remain, arguably coherent, likely not as visually arresting, driven or interesting, but unquestionably a context in which to try to understand the prelude and possible coda to a crisis in the relationship between married and child-rearing urban professionals. We know these people, even if they smoke pot and listen to Shostakovich.<br/><br/>I've not since seen Tom Cruise so vulnerable or Nicole Kidman so quietly terrifying. Their off-screen relationship, during and after, has no bearing, for this is Stanley Kubrick's waking dream, from the torpor of everyday life in defense of the relentless pursuit of the fleeting and superficial, to the gradual surrender to a visceral, sensual, claustrophobic and candy-colored alternate reality, to eyes forced unwillingly wide open. And we are all made welcome to it, whether we want to or not and whether we like it or not.<br/><br/>And when you suddenly awake from a vivid and intensely pleasurable dream, do you not consciously strive to revive, re-create and re-enter it? Bill Harford tries repeatedly.<br/><br/>They don't make movies like this any more. I am convinced that for the most part they've stopped trying. Kubrick is doubtless judged by his more famous movies, but such is the true measure of his genius. No other film director convinced me to pay as much attention to what appeared on-screen or want one or more re-viewings to try to see what I'd missed. I wish he was still filming though full well realize I'd likely still await the final cut...<br/><br/>I am also convinced Kubrick knew he was dying. The actors' lines are his own.

","I guess Kubrick couldn't have wished for a better way to end his impressive filmography.<br/><br/>'Eyes Wide Shut' is a perfect ending to one of the most accomplished directorial careers and easily one of his finest works, right up there with 'A Clockwork Orange' or his early gem 'The Killing'.<br/><br/>The magic of this movie lies in how the story unfolds..and deeply explores the human psyche; delves through the numerous assumptions and beliefs that one lives with, regarding the opposite sex, regarding marriage and regarding commitment and fidelity. At the same time, it urges the viewer to think.<br/><br/>The story may seem a slow pacer, but not a single frame or scene is out of place or irrelevant to the story.<br/><br/>It all starts with a party Dr William Harford (Cruise) and his wife Alice (Kidman) attend. They encounter certain strangers there. The couple converse about the ongoings at the party, and the discussion soon turns into a sour one, with Alice confessing about how she once almost cheated on him. This is when William goes into a state of shock and disbelief and starts questioning his assumptions about married life and commitment. Unpleasant thoughts cross his mind following that revelation. And about this time, he leaves for a certain funeral and this is how his bizarre odyssey begins.<br/><br/>Kubrick builds up the atmosphere like a hypnotist, and makes sure the viewer watches the story unfold in awe..and get a feel of what Cruise's character experiences.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie has to be seen to be believed and any synopsis won't do justice to this magnificent film.<br/><br/>This is one of Cruise's finest performances. Kidman does a terrific job. Of the supporting cast, Sydney Pollack is superb as Victor Ziegler. Likewise, Todd Field, Rade Serbedzija and Mary Richardson in a small role.<br/><br/>But what makes this movie much more watchable is the fantastic cinematography, brilliant direction, and the oh-so-mesmerizing score. <br/><br/>'Eyes Wide Shut' is a Collector's item for any respectable film buff. A hypnotic experience...do not miss it."

","When compared to such films as Dr. Strangelove, The Shining, or Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut has some great shoes to fill.  Yet, it manages to meet every possible expectation, and then some.  It starts with Dr. Bill Harford, played by Tom Cruise, and his wife Alice Harford, played by Nicole Kidman at an expensive party given by one of their friends.  Each are properly being pursued by attractive members of the opposite sex.  In a later discussion of such matters by the bed, and with a little help from some narcotics, an argument breaks out surrounding the tense subject of sexual fantasy and infidelity.  Upset, by this new information, Bill is exposed to many new and dangerous sexual encounters.  Kubrick takes full artistic license when using a very grainy film stock which gives the film a classic and almost warm feeling.  But once things get a little harry, his tight close ups and slow zooming in adds to the uncomfortable feelings presented on the screen.  Kubrick also uses spectacular lighting, and the sound of a solo piano to deeply intensify every uncomfortable situation. Eyes Wide Shut, though dealing with sexual subject manor, is handled professionally, with a touch of Kubrick just to make everything absolutely perfect."

Certainlty some people's opinions are as such too.<br/><br/>What I saw was an intriguing depiction of actions and consequences catalysed by events that never even actually happened, but were as damaging as those that did happen. Dr. Bill (Cruise) uses Alice's admission during a hilarious pot smoking scene as his excuse to justify his own desires and fantasies. The first visit to the hooker, leading to Dr.Bill visiting his old friends Jazz Club leading to the bizarrely fantastical ""Costume Party"" sequence are all a consequence of their pot smoking session.<br/><br/>I loved how the plot came together, even though it was fairly obvious who the secret helper at the costume party was, and why his pianist friend disappeared the day after.

"Galina_movie_fan","10","8","16","8 February 2006"," Perfect Conclusion to the Trilogy of Great Journeys:
","I believe that Kubrick's swansong is a great masterpiece, it is one of my favorite films and has been since I saw it first time. I felt under the film's spell from the very beginning: the camera was so much in love with Kidman's gorgeous figure, her golden hair; the music by Shostakovich - so European even though the film takes place in NYC. The film was so clever and so mesmerizing. The more I watched the more I realized that there was something vaguely familiar and strangely comical in the film. I kept thinking and it occurred to me that Kubrick paid homage and parodied Joyce's ""Ulysses"" in the same way Joyce himself treated Homer's celebrated poem. For me, there are so many similarities between ""Bloomsday"" and ""Billnight"", between both men's journeys and adventures on the streets of Dublin and NYC that I am curious if anyone else noticed that. There are visits to the Kingdom of Dead, sirens, Cyclops, the sorceress that turns men in pigs (the figure of speech that is :)). Both Bloom and Bill try to run from but can't forget and eventually come back to the only woman they are attracted to for eternity - Penelope - Molly Bloom- Alice Harford. Both deeply suffer from her infidelity (Bloom from the real one and Bill from imaginative but it hurts the same). Both are very insecure men who doubt their own masculinity and try to prove to them that they are the real men but they can't. Both are married to the strong women who would give them hope in the end - both ""Ulysses"" and ""EWS"" ends on the affirmative note. The last word in ""Ulysses"" ""Yes"" belongs to Molly just before she fell asleep and the last lines in EWS are: <br/><br/>""Alice Harford: I do love you and you know there is something very important we need to do as soon as possible. Dr. Bill Harford: What's that? Alice Harford: F_uck."" <br/><br/>If that's not the happiest and most satisfying ending for a movie ever then I don't know which one is. For the great ending I can forgive a movie many sins. But tell you the truth, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is perfect, it has nothing to apologize for. It is the movie that would be admired many years from now. Perfect conclusion to the trilogy of great journeys of a man for search of himself - ""Odyssey"", ""Ulysses"", and ""Eyes Wide Shut""."
"JamesHitchcock","9","8","16","29 July 2005"," Kubrick's Last Haunting Masterpiece
","This was Stanley Kubrick's last film, completed shortly before his death and twelve years after its predecessor, ""Full Metal Jacket"". Kubrick was capable of producing brilliantly original films quite different to anything else, such as ""A Clockwork Orange"", and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is another example of this ability. It can be seen as an erotic film, but that does not mean that it is pornographic or titillating. Rather, it is erotic in the sense that it deals with issues relating to physical love and sexuality, but it deals with them in an intelligent, sober manner.<br/><br/>The mood of eroticism is set from the start. Bill Harford, a New York doctor , and his wife Alice have been invited to a Christmas party given by Victor Ziegler, one of his patients. At the party Harford is called to treat a naked young woman who is suffering from a drugs overdose. (It turns out that she is a prostitute). Both Harford and Alice flirt with others, he with two young models, she with a smooth but lecherous older man. Returning home, they get involved in a discussion about sexual attraction and jealousy, which leads Alice to confess that she once came close to being unfaithful.<br/><br/>On the surface, Harford is a man who seems to have everything going for him- affluence, a successful practice which includes many wealthy and influential patients, of whom Ziegler is one, a luxurious apartment, marriage to an attractive wife and a young daughter. Like many films, however, this one is concerned to explore the hidden depths of character that can lie below a surface appearance of normality. Harford is called away from his discussions with Alice by a telephone call to attend a patient, and is plunged into a series of increasingly bizarre sexual encounters. The daughter of a dead patient attempts to seduce him, there is a meeting with another prostitute, he encounters an eccentric Eastern European costume-hire shop owner with a nymphomaniac daughter. The strangest of Harford's adventures comes after he meets Nick Nightingale, an old friend from medical college, in a bar. Nick is now working as a musician, and tells Harford of a mansion near the city where the rich and powerful meet to take part in sexual orgies, something Nick knows about because he is among those employed to provide musical entertainment at these gatherings. He tells Harford that one is due to take place that night and gives him the information he will need, including the password, to gatecrash the event.<br/><br/>This is a multi-layered film that defies any simple interpretation. Harford's adventures can be interpreted either as reality, or as a sexual fantasy, or as a dream. The lack of any definite answer to this question is, however, a strength rather than a weakness. There is certainly something dreamlike about the film, especially the part dealing with his night-time odyssey through the city. (Most of the film, in fact, takes place either at night or in darkened rooms; only a few scenes take place in daylight). The orgy itself- the key scene in the film- is dealt with in a particularly surreal, hallucinatory style. It takes place in an opulent but chilly stately home, and takes the form of a strange, quasi-religious ritual performed by masked participants to the accompaniment of weird music. The women are all naked except for their masks, the men dressed in long hooded gowns similar to the robes worn by monks.<br/><br/>On one level the film is about contemporary neuroses, both sexual and otherwise. Some of Harford's encounters can be seen as symbolic of fears about sexually transmitted disease (the prostitute he meets turns out to be HIV-positive) or sexual orientation (he is twice mistaken for a homosexual, once by a gang of hooligans and once by a gay hotel receptionist who tries to chat him up). The strange orgy, organised by a secretive group of men drawn from America's powerful and wealthy classes, may reflect conspiracy theories about domination by elite secret societies who ruthlessly exclude the public from their deliberations. Harford's attempt to gatecrash ends in failure when he is both literally and metaphorically unmasked as an impostor. On the other hand, this scene may have symbolic overtones about anonymous, impersonal sex or Freudian ones about fear of castration or impotence; Harford never takes part in any sexual activity, but remains a voyeur.<br/><br/>Despite its dark overtones and disturbing symbolism, the film actually has an optimistic conclusion. Without wanting to give too much away, I can say that Harford makes some startling discoveries about both a friend and his wife, but these lead to a reconciliation between himself and Alice and a strengthening of their marriage. The action takes place just before Christmas, and brightly lit Christmas trees are a recurrent image, appearing in a number of scenes. These can be interpreted either as specifically Christian images or as more generalised symbols of hope and goodwill.<br/><br/>I was never really convinced by Nicole Kidman, whose Alice too often seemed an odd mixture of childishness and sexual forthrightness. Tom Cruise, however, was very good in the main role of Harford. At times (as in ""The Last Samurai"") he can be guilty of overacting, but there was no trace of that here; his performance remained calm, controlled and deliberate, despite the bizarre experiences his character was going through. That Harford seemed emotionally in control throughout perhaps strengthens the idea that his adventures are to be interpreted as a dream or fantasy (as perhaps does the title).<br/><br/>The music for the film is particularly memorable; not just that during the orgy scene, but also the recurrent simple piano motif and that Shostakovich waltz which is in itself capable of summoning up an atmosphere of elegant decadence. Kubrick's last film is also his last masterpiece, a strange, haunting fantasy and a work to stand alongside earlier masterpieces such as ""Paths of Glory"", ""Spartacus"", ""Dr Strangelove"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"". 9/10"

Look at them. They are not there without a reason. And each one has a particular meaning. And pay attention to the infamous orgy scene, which some may found it to be too distracting, to look at the paintings as well. References to the Roman empire are clever, if you look right on it. Be aware of everything on scene. Every shot of it is likely to be a work of art. A perfect 10/ 10."

","Out of the wondrous imaginative mind of Stanley Kubrick comes this erotic tale of successful doctor William Harford (Tom Cruise) who believes he and his beautiful wife (Nicole Kidman) are a modern uninhibited and sophisticated couple. That all changes when the pair pauses a moment in their sedate and upscale life to smoke a joint. The husband reviews their evening at a fancy ball and reveals he was hit on by a couple of gorgeous women, but had the strength and fortitude to resist their invitation and charms. Taking his cue, the wife reveals that she too was invited to a sexual rendezvous and considered it just another of the many flirts she daily encounters. In fact, she further reveals, she's often had several wild fantasies involving herself and a handsome ship's Captain. This awakens and disturbs the doctor who believes there is much more to the sexual world of his wife which he is not privy to. Intrigued by the possibilities, he begins a personal but dangerous Odyssey to discover the dark secret world of the sexually provocative. The question arises. Can one delve into the black depths of perversion without losing himself? Eyes Wide Shut is a spellbinding foray of spectral images, complete with an equally haunting theme. All in all, a strange but alluring film where one discovers that enlightenment comes not without a price. ****"

","It always amazes me how this film has been misunderstood by so many people. The proof of that is that the highest votes on IMDb for this film has been given to males under 18 and the lowest by females in general, most noticeably over 45. I must say, though - Eyes Wide Shut has very little to do with sex and very much to do with relationships. Of course sex has a lot to do with it, especially if viewed from a Freudian perspective, but the film's main focus is on the nature and limits of relationships. What is cheating? Is thinking about other people cheating? Where lies the limit between thinking and doing? Does Dr. Bill cheat on Alice anymore than she does on him? What is acceptable in terms of sexual fantasy? To what extent our sexual frustrations, aspirations and ethics is dependent primarily on preconceived social values? Eyes Wide Shut raises all these important questions and there resides its greatness."

The performances are flawless. The story is undeniably brilliant. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are completely convincing as husband and wife. The entire film feels like a lucid dream. The film is clearly inspired by the work of David Lynch. The film was completed just days before Kubrick's death.

"sol-","Null","8","17","13 January 2005"," My brief review of the film
","A perfectly photographed and superbly directed film about the state of modern marriages and how society is heading, in a world that is becoming increasingly morally decaying. The mystery element of the film provides it with a perfect atmosphere to set up the confused emotions of the main character, and gives the film an intriguing quality. The background music is excellent, and the cast is superb. The emotional state that Tom Cruise is able to bring to his character is totally believable, and film directors Sydney Pollack and Todd Field have interesting supporting roles. The film is nonetheless quite long for the subject matter at hand, but besides for this there is little wrong with the film. Some were repelled by the frequent nudity and sexual content of the film, however without such, this would not be the modern masterpiece it is. Certainly quite a high note for Kubrick to have ended his career on."

But when I finally came around to watching it, I was stunned.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful movie to watch, and it's been quite a while since I've seen a movie that was so subtle, profound, and intricate. The movie was well-acted all the way around, with Kidman in particular impressing me. The music was excellent, going perfectly with the movie, especially the steady piano pulse, which was down-right chilling. In keeping with the mood of the movie, the emotions always lurked right under the surface, never quite rearing their heads. The intensity of the cult ritual scene was incredible. This is truly a movie to make you think.<br/><br/>This movie is long, yes. It has a fairly slow pacing, yes. But its a sad day when people cannot muster the attention span to watch such a moving film. <br/><br/>This was an excellent movie, a true credit to Kubrick's name, and it was a fantastic way for him to wrap-up his career. Looking back, I seriously can't find any substantial flaws with this film. Don't believe what you hear."

","The movie has been excellently and sufficiently reviewed in the many contributions to this site. The main advantage of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" however is that it is always subject to a further analysis or renewed insights as it covers all the aspects of our individual consciousness. The many interpretations which have been expressed here, illustrate the complex and thought-provoking theme of the movie: ""theme"" is not even an appropriate choice of words as the subject matter embraces so much more: reality, dreams, human interaction, aesthetics, depravity etc etc. The title alone is fascinating as such and could easily constitute the basis for a profound philosophical or psychological debate: are we humans so frustrated by our affinity to the animal world that we can only observe our carnal selves from behind a mask? Do we constantly have to close our eyes to our true nature? Is hypocrisy the only means of reaching a higher level? Is beauty but a mere dream and a negation of what we really are? Is compromise our dismal but only means of salvation?

","If most of your life has been mainstream and predictable, then this film may be shocking, arousing, interesting and exciting. For those who have taken some chances, seen some real diversity and tasted the unique flavors of life, this film feels much like decaf coffee. Some of the character development is inconsistent. This makes the plot difficult to believe. Rarely does a person summon the courage to make such a rapid advancement from timid mainstreamer to bold party crasher in the matter of few hours. Also the use of murder is a poor fit given the limited exposure to risk by the party hosts. The activities at the party were R-rated but not so extreme as to merit the taking of life to conceal the activities. If you have lived a full and colorful life, skip this average art work. If your idea of a wild time is hooking up with a stranger or going to a party where you know nobody, then this film might impress you. This would explain the many high ratings paired with quite a few very low ratings."
"laurieweston-55004","10","4","7","7 September 2015"," Stanley Kubrick's last film is a strange one
","Out of all of Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is arguably the most decisive. Some say it's a work of art on par with 2001, others say it's just glorified porn. And at first glance, I can see why people would think that. But give it a closer look, and I think it will surprise you.<br/><br/>A doctor called Will living in New York (played by Tom Cruise) discovers his wife (played by Nicole Kidman) had a fantasy about having an affair with a sailor. Understandably angry about this, he leaves to try and gain his own attraction for another woman to get back at her. He eventually gets into a strange sexual cult who discover him and plan to do god knows what to him, but he's saved by a women he saved earlier that day. The cult let him go, but he remains suspicious that they're following him around.<br/><br/>The film is absolutely gorgeous. Kubrick films are well known for being shot like a work of art, but this film takes to a whole new level. It has a very dreamlike look and feel to everything. The colors are hazy and blurry, like when you're feeling tired. Cruise gives a great performance as Will. He manages to sell that this man is feeling betrayed, confused, and even jealous that his wife has these thoughts in her head. Kidman is pretty good as well.<br/><br/>The masked ball scene is easily the highlight of the film. Not because it's erotic, though it certainly is that, but for another reason. Going back to dreams, it feels like something right out of a nightmare. The masks are extremely creepy, as they just stare endlessly. The music is beyond creepy. It sounds otherworldly and just shakes you're nerves effortlessly.<br/><br/>On a side note, have you ever noticed that Kubrick films usually have two distinct halves to them? As in, the story normally makes a big shift halfway into the film. Eyes Wide Shut does something similar. I won't tell you exactly what, but pay attention to the world before and after the masked ball scene, and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>I can see why some may be turned off by this film due it's rather 'adult' content, but it's still a masterpiece of film. It is very long, so make sure you have plenty of time, and be sure to let everything sink in."
"BuildDiscipline","10","4","7","10 July 2015"," How disturbing sex(ual fantasies) can be...
","I'm writing this with the chanting of the initiation scene of the masked ball running through my head, over and over again.<br/><br/>Kubrick's movies don't come alive on first viewing. At least they never did for me. It's with the second of third viewing that you begin scratching the surface of the first of many layers of meaning that his masterpieces have to offer. Last night was my second viewing of 'Eyes Wide Shut' and it left me disturbed, dumbfounded and questioning.<br/><br/>I haven't stopped asking myself: 'What is this movie really about?'. It is not simply about sexual desire, or lifelong commitment to another human being, nor is it about an illuminati kind of world that operates next to our society that we are completely unaware of. These are just the symbols that Kubrick plays with. But what do the symbols mean?<br/><br/>What I think Kubrick wanted to do with this movie, is to show how deeply disturbing sex and sexual fantasies can be. It is a feeling that can hardly be expressed using words, which is why Kubrick tried it with this film.<br/><br/>Bergman was on the same mission when he made 'Persona', which this movie strangely kept reminding me of. Watch it and see for yourself whether you can find the similarities. Keep an eye out for disturbingly explicit sexual fantasies that are being expressed by a woman. Hearing that as a man feels like being being stabbed in the heart by your own partner, laughing, which is exactly what Alice did in her sleep.<br/><br/>Side note: The cinematography of this movie reminded me of David Linch' Twin Peaks at times. Especially of the dream scenes. <br/><br/>When I woke up this morning, the first thing I wondered was: what if Alice was actually present at the orgy? The dream she described is very similar to the orgy scene at the masked ball, except she could hardly have been physically present. What if she was mentally present somehow? What if the whole thing was some sort of (collective) dream? A merging of sexual desires and fantasies. The place where they come true.<br/><br/>What is blatantly obvious is how important William's occupation and title as a doctor is. I don't know how many times he pulled out his ID throughout the movie to identify himself as Dr. Harford, but if you were to make a compilation of it it would be hard to believe that this was all in just one movie, instead a whole TV series. What does this mean? Why is his role as a doctor so important and how does it relate to what Kubrick was trying to achieve? I don't have the answer and there probably is not just one answer, but I feel the question is important. Does it have to do with identify? Status? Or with the fact that deep down, he is a good human being? He lives up to both the Hippocratic Oath as a doctor and his oath as a married husband. He's had at least 4 opportunities to cheat throughout the course of the movie, but he never did. It makes you wonder: why didn't he? 'Fidelio' (faithfulness) was the only word he knew and spoke with confidence at the intervention at the masked ball... <br/><br/>When he was called to Ziegler's room to fix the situation with the OD'ing prostitute Mandy, he did so in such a professional manner and we never saw the two models he was flirting with before, again. His profession and his oath are clearly more important to him than fulfilling his own sexual desires. Even though he may look and act like a flirt.<br/><br/>Was he being honest when he told Alice that he only thinks about the health of his client when he is in his role of a doctor? Was he mentally fidelio?<br/><br/>We know Alice wasn't. She admitted to have cheated on him mentally, which raises the question: is mentally cheating cheating as well? It certainly feels that way to William, who put on a fake smile when he saw Alice helping their daughter with her math. Their marriage was no longer the same.<br/><br/>The scene where William is sitting in the taxi, picturing his wife having sex with the marine, may be the most pivotal scene of the movie. You can feel how disturbed he is by the mere fantasy of his wife being unfaithful. It destroys him. And as a man, I know exactly what that feeling feels like. I know you do too.<br/><br/>Wrapping up, Kubrick beautifully showed one of the many paradoxes that we find ourselves stuck in as humans: to be able to physically fulfill our sexual desires, but not being able to live with them mentally and the exact other way around."

The sexual perversions and secrets of the people in the movie as well as the way they all use one another really made me uncomfortable at times. But I think that is part of the point Stanley Kubrick intended to make.<br/><br/>The acting is not perfect but it's very good. I would say it's the best movie Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman ever did. Sidney Pollack is great as the rich, self-centred man.<br/><br/>It's a mystery that's really about love and how relationships last and survive, and ""what really matters.""<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything but visually it's quite stunning as any Kubrick movie is, and I'd point out that this was his favourite film of all the ones he directed so that should be worth something right? :)"

","A really good film, enhancing Stanley Kubrick's reputation as a great director. I'm a big fan of Kubrick's work from 1971 onwards but wasn't expecting this film to be very good. Fortunately I was wrong.<br/><br/>The Cruise/Kidman billing put me off right from the start, perhaps suggesting a rather lame, overly stylized level of production, and the film's length at over two-and-a-half hours also put me off, but for all that, it turned out to be an engrossing and entertaining film.<br/><br/>If you're not into full frontal nudity and orgies you're not going to be impressed by this particular method of jolting your attention and setting the scene for the thriller/mystery aspect of the film, which doesn't quite pull it off in terms of tension. I was on the edge of my seat at one point, half-anticipating a Hitchcock thriller with a tense and justifiable ending, but unfortunately the film decided to play it safe, re-focusing on the lust/sexual/marriage aspects of the film instead of giving satisfaction.<br/><br/>The story refocuses on Kubrick's message about potential deceit and who is betraying who, whether the couple are justified in feeling the way they do and how we ourselves would react under such tempting circumstances. Cruise's acting is good, but the transition his character made from being a faithful husband, with doubts about his wife's fidelity, into a man prepared to go to any lengths to satisfy his curiosity, wasn't quite believable.<br/><br/>For all that, I really enjoyed the movie, continuing Kubrick's great run of form since A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket. Overall a worthy addition to the SK legacy.<br/><br/>The ending was a little too convenient for me, but it did pose a very interesting question. Are we faithful to our partners because we love them, or because of obstacles that prevent us from being unfaithful?"

I was blown away.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is a cinematic masterpiece that, in true Kubrick fashion, can be interpreted in innumerable ways and puzzled over for hours. Eyes Wide Shut dissects everything from marriage to sexual perversion all the while containing an ominous tone that turns it into some perverse horror story. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise both give excellent career defining performances as does Sydney Pollack even with his extremely short screen time. <br/><br/>I'm not sure why this isn't considered one of Kubrick's best. Virtually every movie he has made, including the disappointing Full Metal Jacket, are considered to be some of the greatest pictures to every grace a multiplex, yet Eyes Wide Shut was virtually ignored by critics and audiences alike. I guess most of his movies were misunderstood at the time of their release and the intense expectation everyone had coming in didn't help either, but don't be fooled.

"Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson","7","4","7","24 June 2008"," The last Masterpiece!
","It was inevitable that Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut would be the most misunderstood film of 1999. Kubrick died four months prior to its release, and there was no end to speculation how much he would have tinkered with the picture, changed it, ""fixed"" it. We'll never know. But even without the haunting enigma of the director's death--and its eerie echo/anticipation in the scene when Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) visits the deathbed of one of his patients--Eyes Wide Shut would have perplexed and polarized viewers and reviewers. After all, virtually every movie of Kubrick's post-U.S. career had; only 1964's Dr. Strangelove opened to something approaching consensus. Quite apart from the author's tinkering, Kubrick's movies themselves always seemed to change--partly because they changed us, changed the world and the ways we experienced and understood it. And we may expect Eyes Wide Shut to do the same. Unlike Kubrick himself, it has time. So consider, as we settle in to live with this long, advisedly slow, mesmerizing film, how challenging and ambiguous its narrative strategy is. The source is an Arthur Schnitzler novella titled Traumnovelle (or ""Dream Story""), and it's a moot question how much of Eyes Wide Shut itself is dream, from the blue shadows frosting the Harfords' bedroom to the backstage replica of New York's Greenwich Village that Kubrick built in England. Its major movement is an imaginative night-journey (even the daylight parts of it) taken by a man reeling from his wife's teasing confession of fantasized infidelity, and toward the end there is a token gesture of the couple waking to reality and, perhaps, a new, chastened maturity. Yet on some level--visually, psychologically, logically--every scene shimmers with unreality. Is everything in the movie a dream? And if so, who is dreaming it at any given moment, and why?<br/><br/>Don't settle for easy answers. Kubrick's ultimate odyssey beckons. And now the dream is yours."
"vdecaire","8","4","7","12 April 2008"," One of the most audacious filmmakers of our time delivers an unforgettable modern sexual fable
","The story begins with a shot of what the film is entailing: sexual deprivation, temptation and exploration on so many levels. The shot is of Nicole Kidman slipping off her dress revealing her naked body within the pallor of her luxurious apartment. Funny. Tom Cruise plays a different role for him, but not one he necessarily did poorly with, in fact, playing someone in his position would be quite a task. After the couple- William and Alice Harford- enjoy themselves at a party hosted by a fellow doctor, they adjourn to their home to have sex. Ahem. Anyway, they drink, and smoke pot, and begin telling each other how hard it basically is to ignore the temptation of everyday sexual situations, which brings up a story that a menacing Alice begins to tell, about how she almost cheated on him, almost. But this seems to spark some kind of chain reaction for Mr. Harford, and he leaves on a house call, but out of spite, revenge and malice decides to walk the streets of New York, and begins a quest of moral and immoral discovery that leads him to long periods of thought to himself. What is just a story of light revenge between a husband and wife, is actually beginning to become a harrowing journey into some kind of murder mystery. After his pianist friend (Todd Field) informs him of a new gig he got at a mysterious location, Harford can't ignore the apparent lustful edict that goes on at this place, so he gets a costume, including the infamous mask, and spends a lot of money, then is ready to go to this place. It was described as sexual pleasure beyond imagining. And he realizes that it is, but it is also some kind of dangerous cult that poses a threat,and when a stripper informs him that he does not belong there and must leave, he also is told the same by the group.

","I watched this twice - thinking that perhaps I had missed something. <br/><br/>But, unlike ""2001"", I came up short. I thought this film was completely overproduced and Tom Cruise miscast.<br/><br/>The continuously-emphasized sexual tension is not merited by the facts of the film. What is this sex club that requires such surreptitiousness? Nothing out of the ordinary - nothing like the infamous Plato's Retreat of the 1970s. Sex in the club seems terribly ""ordinary"" (no dark realizations of taboo practices).<br/><br/>And one has only to utter a password to gain entry? Aw come-on - if the members are THAT exclusive, they surely would have more secure procedures to ensure restricted admission.<br/><br/>More to the point: every time something sexual is about to happen in the movie, it takes on a negative aspect (a sexual encounter turns out to include an underage girl, another possible sex partner is revealed to have HIV, etc).<br/><br/>And then there's Tom Cruise, who, by his own admission, had trouble with the part. Small wonder: he doesn't have the suave intellectual character needed for the part. He's used to playing highly physically-expressed heroes - not troubled degreed professionals. (He's also never looked more ridiculous standing next to his former wife Nicole - who towers over him despite the fact she must have been sporting flats.)<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully photographed, however, and lit to the hilt: golds, blues and reds all sensuously rendered in soft focus. But it all seems so unnecessary - even distracting - considering how un-sensational the storyline becomes.<br/><br/>Poor Stanley Kubrick - I'm sure he tried very hard to forge a mystery filled with sexual innuendo and ambiguity, but I think, in the end, he simply realized it was a lost cause. He signed off on it - then signed off on Life - leaving Tom and Nicole feeling/looking guilty for pushing him over the edge due to their inability to connect with the subject matter, And they got divorced! (I could swear their ""love scenes"" were totally devoid of any chemistry)."

","Eyes Wide Shut is a strange movie, even for Kubrick. Mysterious. Absolutely nothing is explained and it's one big enigma. There is a strong element of sexual voyeurism as in the scene watching Nicole Kidman go to the bathroom and at the costume party/orgy with naked women and couples copulating in the shadows. Overall the film has a strong underlying current of sexual perversity mixed with conspiracy theory. Cruise sees things he's not supposed to see and he can't reveal them or something unnamed but bad will happen to him.<br/><br/>The plot: Tom Cruise wanders the streets after his wife Nicole Kidman confesses that she has had sexual fantasies about another man. After various encounters he ends up at a costume party/orgy in a mansion where all the guests, except him, seem to be in on some secret, almost as if they belonged to a cult of some sort. Stanley Pollack, a friend who seems to know the true identities of the masked party-goers, warns Cruise to keep his mouth shut about what he's seen at the party. <br/><br/>As for the acting, Cruise is in most every scene and he seems to sleepwalk through the film, but knowing Kubrick that's what he must have wanted. As is usual in Kubrick films, every character is unemotional and detached. <br/><br/>I honestly don't have any idea of what the film is about except it left me with an unpleasant feeling of dread.<br/><br/>I've seen all of Kubricks's movies many times and this is definitely his least accessible film."

"pale69rider","10","4","7","5 January 2000"," The Best Film of 1999
","""Eyes Wide Shut"" weaves its web of psychological carnage with a power that has nothing to do with taste, or preference. Kubrick's images are undeniable and very, very startling. The eye must watch. There is a remarkable trademark of Kubrick's that lies in his spacing of dialogue. It is never as simple as ""He said"" - cut to Her - ""She said"". That is the formula, but Kubrick always cuts away early. He leaves a discernible pause. This creates a note of discord (emphasized in the music score with its jarring one-note piano stabbings), in that everyone who speaks in his films appear to be studying one another. People speak in measured tones, but rarely communicate themselves well to one another. Many have spoken of Kubrick's ""coldness"" as a filmmaker, and it is true that he always keeps his characters at arm's length, distancing them from each other and us. But the reason behind this would appear to be that in doing so, the film's eye catches everything. Nothing gets overlooked in the heat of the moment, in the messiness of emotional embrace. We watch Kubrick's players watch.<br/><br/>I have heard tell of a comparison with ""The Matrix"", which I find especially perceptive. Here, the matrix is created by us, by our own psychological make-up. Which of course is more terrifying and pessimistic, as well as more truthful. While Kubrick unsettles with his world of penetrating observers, there are moments of participatory activity, but tellingly, it occurs in dream. Kidman's character is frightened by her dreams of actively humiliating and degrading her husband, more still because she secretly revels in it. Cruise, on the other hand, goes on a tripped-out 48 hour adventure in which he tries desperately to play the role of ""outsider"" his wife so desires, only to be discovered, revealed and publicly shamed. Kubrick's contrasts are obvious, but sooooo compelling: Kidman is active and cruel in her dream-life, Cruise is passive and reflective in his waking existence. As the film ultimately asks at its conclusion, is one more innocent than the other?<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" may not be the most optimistic portrayal of a marriage and its strengths, but Kubrick has again, and sadly for the last grand time, allowed us to see through his eyes a world where the notion of communication is not taken for granted. His people struggle to express, and seem all the more human for it. Let it be said that Kubrick's eyes were always wide open, and to the details most of us figured too mundane to truly appreciate. He will be greatly missed."

"Holden_Kidman","10","5","10","15 July 2009"," My Favorite Movie of All Time!
","Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is one of those that can be analyzed in every way shape and form. Even though the film wasn't a big success back when it was released (Exactly ten years ago today!!), the film has since grown and has found new fans with every viewing. I don't care what anyone says, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are perfectly cast as the wealthy secretive couple. I know a lot of people feel their pacing was very slow, but, when you think about it, Eyes Wide Shut is a very theatrical film. Basically, the film could be adapted to the stage with no problem. Cruise and Kidman took their time with each word to show the distinct emotion Bill or Alice would feel. Especially Kidman. Her lengthy monologues are beautifully seductive in the way she truthfully presents them to Bill and the audience. She is probably the most ambiguous character in the whole movie, often compared to the Hal 9000 from 2001. Both take their time to get their point across, which causes an uneasy feeling for the audience, and both have feminine attributes that control the other characters around them. Bill, on the other hand, is the type of character that you aren't sure if you want to like him or not. I know many people that understand him and feel him and yet I know others that feel he is too emotionally stiff. Both are correct. When Bill enters New York City around the witching hour, he witnesses a vain world that he would never see in the daylight. He tries to go with the flow and ends up being too voyeuristic and sticking his nose in places he shouldn't even dream of. Unlike Alice and her comparison to the Hal 9000, Bill is easily comparable to Barry Lyndon. Both Barry and Bill are too shallow for the upper society they try to take a part of. They aren't ready and both characters try to grow faster than they already are. Like The Shining, we don't root for Bill or Alice. In Fact, if any of the characters encountered a fatal attack, the audience wouldn't show sympathy. The characters in this film are sympathetic at all. I think this brings a new barrier to the way we look at character developments in other films. Kubrick took a risk and I believed it worked. Kubrick created yet another masterpiece and ended on the best note. I don't think there could have been another film that would have fit the end of the century like Kubrick's EWS. This was Kubrick's own personal favorite and I can see why! 10/10 ****/4"
"howard.schumann","9","5","10","28 August 2006"," Beautifully shot, impeccably acted, and consistently engrossing
","Beautifully shot, impeccably acted, and consistently engrossing, Eyes Wide Shut is a fitting finale to the career of Stanley Kubrick. Taking us ""where the rainbow ends"", Eyes Wide Shut leads us through several days in the life of upper class New York Doctor Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) as he navigates through New York's sexual underground in a fit of jealousy. Based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 Traumnovelle (Dream Novella), it is a film without explanations and the viewer must decide what is real and what is fantasy. From the outset, it is clear that there is trouble in the Harford's nine-year old marriage, though it has not yet affected their eight-year old daughter Helena (Madison Eginton) who is eagerly looking forward to Christmas.<br/><br/>The first hint that something is not right is when Bill tells his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) how great her hair looks without bothering to look at her. She does not say anything but her body language suggests that she is dissatisfied. The tension between them becomes crystallized during a party thrown by a wealthy acquaintance, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack) in which she draws the attention of a charming Hungarian suitor and he is pursued by two attractive models. ""One of the charms of married life is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties,'' the suave Hungarian tells Alice.<br/><br/>The events lead afterward to a discussion of marital fidelity. Upset over Bill's lack of jealousy, Alice, who has been smoking pot, recounts a fantasy she had about abandoning her family for a handsome naval officer she met at a resort hotel. Feeling that he has to prove his virility, Bill, in the vein of Scorcese's After Hours, undertakes a 48-hour odyssey through the dark side of New York looking for reassurance from a sexual partner. As in a recurring dream, at the moment before satisfaction is achieved - intruders, a cell phone, or a threat to his safety interrupts each experience. In his journey, he encounters the daughter of a deceased patient; a prostitute; the underage daughter of a costume salesman; a threatening group of homophobes, and a male hotel desk clerk who is turned on to him.<br/><br/>The piece de resistance, however, is an extravagantly staged costumed orgy at a swank Long Island mansion. Lured by the piano player Nick Nightingale (Todd Field) who interests Dr. Harford with a story of mysterious gigs he plays blindfolded, he is led through a medieval-looking forest to a black Mass for the rich and powerful in which everyone is masked and costumed. When the doctor is exposed as an intruder, he is in real danger until a stately woman who has given him prior warnings to leave, saves him from at the very least taking his clothes off (from what else we can only guess).<br/><br/>Although Cruise as D. Harford is the centerpiece of the film, he shows little emotion. He is either looking bewildered or acting uncomfortably sincere but he is always a passive onlooker. One expects that at some point he will confront himself and grasp the meaning of what is taking place, but there are no epiphanies or realizations. It is only when Alice, perhaps suspecting that she has gone too far in her story telling, asks Bill what they will do now, do they drop their masks and come to terms with the realities of their relationship.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut was Kubrick's final film and it is one of his best. Enhanced by an original score by Jocelyn Pook, darkly evocative piano music by Gyorgy Ligetti, and excerpts from Shostakovich, the film maintains its tension throughout and never lets us know where it is going. Although the mood suggests a decadent civilization careening out of control, Eyes Wide Shut ended up for me as a life-affirming experience. It challenges us not only to come to terms with our commitments in life but to better distinguish the difference between our thoughts and feelings and our true experience of ourselves and the people around us who give our life its meaning."
"phatdan","10","5","10","6 August 2006"," Very Scary Sex Story
","Eyes Wide Shut is more of an educational experience than entertainment. There is no classic protagonist to win us over, nobody triumphs and nothing is resolved, except that evil wins the day. <br/><br/>Demonic worship clearly represents evil in this film. It is revealed midway with no forewarning. How this ties in to human sexual behavior is for the viewer to conclude. However, the storyteller pulls no punches as to his intention. <br/><br/>The enticement sparked in men when they see a beautiful woman (Kidman's nude expose) contrasted to men that hide their identity behind grotesque masks as they seek sexual gratification is just another take on a very familiar theme. <br/><br/>Maybe the incentive for this film was to reveal the exploitation of women by a monstrous cult. However, whether Kubrick knew of such a cult is inconsequential. That women are forced, even young girls, into sexual slavery is a sad reality that needs more exposure in an apathetic world steeped in depravity.<br/><br/>I don't know how Kubrick died. I believe the film was released after his death."

How do you join? Is it a secret club? What was the purpose of the red caped man? All I could think of was that the red caped man was a leader of a satanic cult. The music and the chanting of the words. Now if this was some kind of party, why did they have such creepy music and chanting. Then some of the masked guests or participants removed their capes, the women were beautiful but practically naked with only their masks and bikini bottoms. Then they all started touching each other as the music and chanting continued. Once they were done, they went off with the other cloaked men. We saw scenes of debauchery (I hope I use it properly) at this mysterious mansion. Naked women mostly and few naked men engage in sordid lovemaking. Of course, Pollack's character only hinted that the masks were protect the identities of the rich and powerful at these parties. No matter what, what was a prostitute doing there? When one woman risks herself to save Tom's character, we are expected to believe it was all an act. Come on, I can't believe that Tom's character was just playing a role in dark play. I'm sorry but I have so many questions about the house, the party, and the participants which left me kind of disappointed.

That, to me, is what makes a Kubrick film stand apart from others.<br/><br/>But to some, this lack of easy comprehension makes them a little angry. If they can't easily understand a story - i.e. - they can't explain it to themselves easily, they say ""hate it."" Kubrick, more than any other director, made films that told stories as only film can tell. His films can't be reduced to words.

","SPOILER ALERT Stanley Kubrick's swan song is a well-made, hypnotic, and overall outstanding film which combines elements from all of the late director's earlier films.  Doctor Tom Cruise learns one night that his wife Nicole Kidman has thought about changing the course of both their lives for a one-night stand with a naval officer who she saw just once and did not even converse with.  They have a marijuana-induced argument which leads to emotional sparks for Cruise.  Now he is out to seek revenge on his wife because of her thoughts.  What follows is a strange journey into the deepest, darkest places of New York City and the human psyche, in general. Cruise learns that the daughter of one of his late patients has an infatuation for him, he almost becomes the victim of a hate crime as young college guys think that he is a homosexual, he is propositioned by a beautiful hooker, and he comes into contact with an old college buddy. The old friend is mysterious and Cruise becomes intrigued after he learns that the friend, now a piano player, has a gig at an unknown location.  Cruise gets the information needed to attend the ""get-together"" and makes the necessary arrangements.  He runs into another strange situation when he goes to rent a costume for the occasion.  When he finally reaches his destination, he realizes that what he thought he wanted is not what he wants at all.  The wild and crazy thrill-ride of the night finally comes to a close, but the next day proves to be even darker and more disturbing. Cruise basically retraces the steps that he took the night before (not necessarily in the same order) and his ""eyes open wide"" to see  everything that had happened the night before.  In the end, Cruise realizes that dark elements are even darker in the daylight than in the black of night.  He comes clean to Kidman and they both realize that sex, excitement, and thrills are fine in the fantasy world, but could be the poorest of elements in real life (given the right, or wrong, situation).  Kubrick's direction is amazing to say the least.  This film is not the ramblings of some old, washed-up film-maker.  Kubrick is always sure of where he wants to go and his screenplay keeps up the suspense, interest, and tenseness of the audience.  I can see why this film took so long to shoot.  The cinematography alone is a sight to behold.  Dark streets illuminated by Christmas lights and vivid colors shining through black backgrounds are commonplace throughout here.  The editing and set directions are also superb.  Tom Cruise is very strong as well.  He dominates the film the final two hours or so.  Nicole Kidman starts strong, but Cruise becomes the focus. All the supporters are strong as well.  Sydney Pollack and Vanessa Shaw shine the most.  If there was ever a film that was destroyed because of too much hype, it is this one.  All the talk of the long shoot, the excessive sexual situations, and the death of Kubrick made this film become a mainstream project.  The result was an excellent opening weekend, but a failure overall at the box office due to bad word-of-mouth.  The average movie-goer will not get anything out of this film.  This is a deep, thought-provoking film that is somewhat an art-house flick (even though I have never been crazy about that term).  The publicity about the sexual situations turned many away and brought in many who did not care about anything except seeing a bunch of naked women.  That is a real shame.  All this caused the film to be dismissed by the general public and by the Academy as well.  Overall ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is an excellent film that ranks real high on Kubrick's list of credits (I would still have to put ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and ""A Clockwork Orange"" ahead of this film).  With all this said, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was probably the best film of 1999 and is one of the best films of the decade.  4.5 out of 5 stars."
"Dan S","3","5","10","3 April 2000"," Unfortunate Legacy for a Great Movie Maker
","I am a great fan of Kubrick.  His movies are timeless and courageous, but this one just didn't work.  It was, in a word, lame.  As a dark fantasy it did not disturb, as a comment on life it did not convince.  Tom Cruise seemed uncomfortable and out of his element, perhaps he's not ready to grow up and act in mature adult roles.  Some of Kidman's worst work, and I believe she is a tremendously talented actress, she was better and more appealing in Batman.  Too bad she allowed Kubrick to sell out her stunning physical features rather than utilise her acting ability.  I would have expected more from both of them.<br/><br/>Perhaps, also, it was also a poor choice of material.  I know that Kubrick has had the rights to this book for quite a while, should have kept them a little bit longer.   There was nothing in the way of revelation about the conflict the characters were faced with.  We all deal with temptation every day.  However the characters reaction was almost cartoonish - something one would find in a TV sitcom, but with an attempt to be dark.  I never bought that the Cruise character was ever in any danger, and never empathised with his plight.  The Michael Douglas movie, The gGe, did what this movie was trying to do with much greater effect - the entering of a surreal world where one's most basic values and character are tested.  The Cruise character survived (morally) by pure luck and not due to any inner strength. He was nothing more than a hypocrite that got lucky in the end and the last line of the movie was nothing short of stupid.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove, Clockwork Orange, the Shining, 2001, etc.  These will live forever.<br/><br/>I'm afraid many of the other commentors here have their eyes wide shut to this movie, and are voting for Kubrick's legacy.

It's really about what goes on in the mind, not everything can be taken literally, it may be a dream or not, but you don't know which part is which. You're constantly being challenged as to your beliefs and values. The story, the images and the music captivate unlike anything ever has in film.

","Like pretty much all of Kubrick's other films, I think that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" will grow in stature with time. Although not his strongest film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is still a compelling picture, mostly due to the trance-like atmosphere it creates.<br/><br/>The dreamlike mood that permeates the film, as well as the strange characters Tom Cruise's character encounters, almost makes this seem like a David Lynch film. Nevertheless, one is never in doubt that this is a Kubrick film, as each shot is meticulously crafted with Kubrick's trademark visual elegance. <br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" is meant to be Kubrick's exploration of sexual relations. Its deals with themes of lust and jealousy, and how these innate human characteristics can take their toll on a relationship. Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) play the married couple whose relationship begins to unravel when Alice admits she had sexual fantasies about another man, sparking Bill's jealousy and causing him to go on a sexual adventure that takes him to places he never could have imagined. Its here that the film is most compelling, and delivers some of the most memorable scenes ever to grace a Kubrick film. Although the pace of the film is quite slow, this is important in creating the dreamlike atmosphere, and the plot still remains intriguing. I was never bored. <br/><br/>Cruise and Kidman both deliver strong performances. However, as per usual with any Kubrick film, its the director that is the star of the show. Although I'm a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick, this is probably the one complaint I would have about his style, as I feel that his perfectionism can sometimes detract from the raw quality of the performances. Its not often that I come away from his films feeling like I truly know the characters or have gone through fire and hell with them. Nevertheless, the film is a visual treat, and that is the reason that I keep coming back to Kubrick: he is a visionary with images.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the last stunning work of the director's illustrious career. Its a fitting end to his legacy."

","Eyes Wide Shut is a perfect title for this movie. I didn't understand title until I watched it a few times. This was really a well written and acted out movie. Plus the music made it more interesting.(just a few notes) This movie is about delusions, hopes and dreams. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman definitely had chemistry on screen together. They were hot. I enjoyed it even when they disagreed, because they would talk things out. They were friends. I'm trying to figure out why I never heard of this movie. It was really different. It showed the side of the norm and a private society (occult). But why did they want Tom to remove his clothing before a woman intercepted? The chanting was a real blast. The scene became dark. Tom please play in some more movies like this one. I haven't enjoyed Tom so much since Risky Business. This was a real grownup part for him and he is still gorgeous"
"johnmichael-2","10","3","5","17 February 2008"," Dreamlike! I Am in Love With This Film
","The first thing you must notice is that, in accordance to the title of this review, I LOVE ""Eyes Wide Shut""--not ""like"", not ""appreciate"", but LOVE. As I write this, I am a 17-year-old male who has watched this film four times already, and I shall watch it many times again.<br/><br/>""But all the negative comments!"" you say. ""All the people who said this film was Kubrick's worst! That it was unsexy and slow!"" Yes, the sex-to-nudity ratio was very low, and yes, it'll take you over half-an-hour longer to watch the movie than it would to read the novella, but if the physical act of sex and quick pacing were all that mattered in a movie, I wouldn't be here right now.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" was severely misrepresented by its hype. It is not an erotic thriller; it is a psychosexual drama/mystery. It is about Dr. Bill Hardford and his wife, Alice, and her confession of sexual longing that sends him on a dreamlike odyssey to discover his own sexual desires and where his wife fits into the equation. It is not romantic. It is a serious drama, easily Stanley Kubrick's most sophisticated work (though ""A Clockwork Orange"" edges over it as my favorite), and not a single word, image, sound, or musical note is wasted. I love every minute of it.<br/><br/>To truly enjoy ""Eyes Wide Shut"", you cannot pop it into your DVD player for a passive romp in front of the screen. You must immerse yourself in this film--watch the characters interact with each other and with the scenes around them, let the music and the sound sing their symphonies to your pulsing heart, and, above all, be willing to THINK and HAVE PATIENCE, two things that don't come all that easily to the broad masses.<br/><br/>Though Stanley Kubrick is often partial to unknown actors, you will recognize some of the faces, other than Cruise and Kidman. There is Sydney Pollack and Todd Field, but there is also Vinessa Shaw (from ""The Hills Have Eyes""; director Alexandre Aja began working with her because of her role in this movie as the whore Domino), Leelee Sobieski (""Never Been Kissed""), and Alan Cumming (""X-Men"" and ""Spy Kids""), all coming together from movies that range from mediocre to pretty darn good, but they all reach their pinnacle here, in ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Even the small roles--Rade Serbedzija as Milich, Sobieski as his daughter, Marie Richardson as the woman who declares undying love for Bill Harford over her father's deathbed, and Cumming as a hotel desk clerk--are lavished with detail, encapsulated in not only their dialogue but also in their body language and facial expressions.<br/><br/>Another thing to notice is this: Stanley Kubrick spent 15 months shooting this film (when most directors could have done it in 3 or 4), and it really shows. Never has a film felt so unrushed, nor so comfortable with what it is. This film breathes as if on the zephyrs of a dream. There is not a moment when the actors look as if they're rushing through their lines or going through the motions; Kubrick not only gives them time to prepare for their roles, but he also gives them screen time to let their actions speak instead of their mouths.<br/><br/>""Traumnovelle"", translated as ""Dream Story"", was the basis for this movie; might I add that the movie follows the novel very closely except that it transplants it from 1920s Austria to New York City in the 1990s. And yet it keeps the feel suggested by the original title, for never has a movie been so like a dream! It has both the sweet parts and the nightmarish parts, and then the plain weird parts that make no sense at all. And it is slow--very, very slow and very, very long, like a night in which you cannot get to sleep--but every single time I watch it, I never grow antsy towards the end! ""Amadeus"", ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and ""The Exorcist"" all got me antsy at one point or another, despite the fact that I love all of these movies and have watched them all multiples times. But, with ""Eyes Wide Shut"", I am perfectly content to watch the movie play out in its own sweet time, and cutting this film down to 120 minutes or less (which any other filmmaker would have and could have easily done) would have ruined the dream that this film is. Have I already mentioned that I am a 17-year-old male, by the way, a product of the sound-byte generation?<br/><br/>I am gushing into my keyboard, but somehow I feel my words are inadequate. Let me sum up by saying that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a film you can never hope to see the likes of again--the same can be said for any Kubrick film, especially since he never made the same kind of film twice--and it would be a travesty to miss it simply because you don't have the patience for it. I say GET the patience. Exert a bit of brainpower and try to sink yourself into this film until you're in over your head. It's not something most of us are used to doing with films, but it is entirely worth it.<br/><br/>Call me a collegiate who tries to squeeze meaning out of void places. Call me a teen who likes to see his nudity. Call me a person who wants to appear smart by giving this film 10 stars. Call me a Kubrick freak. Slice it any way you like, but I love ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and I think you will, too."
"galileo3","10","3","5","5 November 2007"," Kubrick's haunting, psychosexual masterpiece
","EYES WIDE SHUT (1999)<br/><br/>Number 1 - 1999 <br/><br/>Top 10 - 1990s <br/><br/>Top 100 - All Time<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's ultimate film is many things. A compelling psychosexual journey, a haunting, surrealistic experience and a fascinatingly chilling study of the darker aspects of humanity.<br/><br/>This is a satisfying conclusion to the career of one of the greatest figures in the history of cinema. Eyes Wide Shut is no ordinary film. It is a stunning, spectrum of dreams and opportunities avoided. This is what Kubrick should be remembered for; daring, outrageous film-making, graphic, unbelievable scenes, moments, words... <br/><br/>The anticipation to this film had been groundbreaking. CRUISE.KIDMAN.KUBRICK. was the tagline... Critics were ready to praise or scrutinise the great director's work, and they did. Eyes Wide Shut, like most of Kubrick's films (including 2001, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket) was met with mixed reviews. <br/><br/>Some critics were ecstatic, awarding the film a five star rating, while others were severely critical. This is an important thing for Kubrick films; they are strange, personal, mystical, ambiguous pictures that may provoke or bore - this is what makes Stanley Kubrick the great filmmaker that he was and shall ever be. <br/><br/>Classifying 'Eyes Wide Shut' as an erotic thriller does not do it justice. This is an intense, visceral study of humanity, the bonds that bring us together and the lusts that disintegrate us as a society. I refuse to believe that Stanley Kubrick spent his time making a film just to display graphic sexuality and nudity. This film is about so much more. <br/><br/>Kubrick studies how the various functions and derivatives in our society cause us to become depersonalised, dehumanised and become mere primitive animals enganging in crude acts. <br/><br/>The famous orgy scene, which was subjected to ludicruous digital altering for the American cinemas is something splendidly unusual. It is a vivid, visual orgy, a mad orchestration of colours, lighting, costumes and music, a sequence that remarkably reminds of the kind of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick is. <br/><br/>As Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise), wonders through the halls, passing near masked men and women that engage in sexual acts - here sex is nothing more than a sinful, pleasurous activity. The human element of love and passion in sexual intercourse is completely stripped in this stunning, intoxicating sequence. There are probably important people behind that mask, hiding behind a layer of plastic that is covering their identity, and if revealed, it would be disastrous... <br/><br/>Kubrick plays special attention to each scene; he doesn't roll them together, he pauses, like each scene is like a dream or rather a nightmare. The perfectionist that is Kubrick is apparent in every camera angle in this film. <br/><br/>Perhaps Kubrick wants to tell us that everything is so easy to access for the affluent. Sex, drugs, fantasies, yet nothing seems enough at the end. <br/><br/>The film is two and a half hours long, it's structured beautifully and with passion across every scene, and of course there's no denying that this is strictly an adult film that collides with elements of psychological thriller, intense drama and perhaps at times surrealistic horror. <br/><br/>This is no small feat. Kubrick departed the pantheon of cinema in glorious fashion, with his last intoxicating masterpiece. Ironically, the last word ever uttered on a Stanley Kubrick film is F*CK...<br/><br/>10/10"

","Kubrick's last endeavor, very strange. Kubrick is a very unusual storyteller, albeit he always brings on a host of varying elements that add flavor and usually makes the story transformation into a strange and different world. Cruise is interesting, eerie, as he wades through this tale of an icy and ever so-slightly 'twisted' married couple. I think that Nicole Kidman is beautiful. She seems to bring out more graciousness and expansion to most of everything that she has been cast. She was but a zombie in 'Eyes'. I still believe that she was picture perfect as the wife of the man. From the activity that quietly took place it seemed as if you are on the inside of a private 'members only' life. That this is in a secret place even though you are watching it all happened on the big screen. It takes a lot to bring that sort of experience to the individual viewer. I was in deep and then came the 'party' civil and wild and strange all in once. This film was in the tradition of Kubrick's brilliant vision, although it lacked what much of his other films carried, a certain ingredient. A feeling, even if hopeless, a kind of all encompassing greatness. This didn't have all that sort of Stanley Kubrick's splendor as his past list of work's did. This left me feeling cold at the end, I still had a certain amount of enjoyment from this however.<br/><br/>Three out of four stars. (***) Recommended<br/><br/>Thx--IMDb.com"

","I saw Eyes Wide Shut when it first came out on video, in 1999.  I liked it, but I felt somewhat removed from the underbelly of the high class social world.  But the second time around, the whole film reached out, grabbed me, sucked me in, and then spit me out, sort of like Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) getting the boot from the scary, deep voiced, masked man, at the mansion. Like Bill, I felt overwhelmed by the whole `show' of psycho-sexual displays among multiple party after party, at the mansion, where men roamed around masked and caped, and women, all with hour glass figures, glided topless, with faces concealed by feathered masks.  This incredible screen play written by Stanley Kubrick and Frederic Raphael is adapted from Arthur Schnitzler's novel.  The film is superbly executed by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who play the two main characters. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise so convincingly plays Bill Harford, a young, but mature New York doctor.  With his wife, Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman), they have a seven year old girl.  Every year the two attend Victor Ziegler's (Sydney Pollack) annual holiday black tie dinner dance, held at a hotel.  That night Bill and Alice innocently separate, only to find themselves in the arms of another. Alice warmed and mellowed from the champagne, dances the night away with a matured Hungarian gigolo.  Meanwhile, Bill recognizes Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), the piano player, who is a former medical student friend of Bill's. Nick, married, a father of four, from Seattle, is now playing New York gigs to support his family, back home, in Seattle.  Not soon later, two models are thoroughly enjoying their flirtatious moment with Bill.  But the session is soon interrupted, when Bill is asked to meet Victor in an upstairs room. Mandy (Julienne Davis), a prostitute and Victor's playmate, is lying naked and drugged out, in a chair.  Upon bringing her conscious, Bill confirms that she will be alright.  Victor is eager to extinguish Mandy from his room immediately, but Bill insists that Victor let her rest for an hour.  Bottom line, at this moment, Bill is smart, professional, and sensitive, and Victor is completely not.<br/><br/>That night, Alice and Bill suffer post party blues, in their bedroom together.  They smoke a joint and begin to talk about their sexual thoughts. When Alice tells of her wanderings to another man, I had problems hearing the audio.  It appears that she is not completely sure if she slept with another man or not.  Needless to say, Bill is stunned.  His naiveté about his wife's carnal desires is surprising, but this aspect is all part of the story.  On the other hand, Alice accuses Bill of having sexual thoughts during his patient exams.  Bill defends that sex is the last thing on his or the patient's mind, during that time.  We believe Bill's claim.  It is valid and makes complete common sense.  Back at work, Bill begins dreaming of Alice having passionate sex with another man.  Of course, the dream is like a black and white film, which is appropriate coming from Bill's thoughts. These thoughts of her infidelity eat away at his sense of security and trust.  <br/><br/>At night, a prostitute picks up Bill, where else but on a street corner! When his wife calls on the cell phone, just before he is about to have sex with the hooker, he changes his mind about having sex.  He pays the woman and walks away.  Late that night, he stops by a night club, where Nick happens to be playing a gig.  The two sit down and talk.  Nick tells Bill of his next job at a mansion, where he is required to play blindfolded.  Bill wants to find his `other desire,' just as his wife has admitted to her own. He wants to attend the mansion soirée.  Nick gives Bill the password, `Fedaglio,' in which to enter the estate.<br/><br/>But before Bill attends the party, he must have the proper attire: a black tuxedo, a mask, and a cape.  Purchasing the goods from `Over the Rainbow,' costume shop, in the middle of the night, with tux, cape, and gold decorated mask, he attends this dark, ritualistic, and cult-like party, full of topless women, with feathered masks and tasteful (are there any other kind among the high class?) sexual orgies in every room.  Once at the party via taxi, a masked woman tells Bill that his life could be in grave danger and that he should leave.  Bill stays, until that is, a clan leader asks him to repeat the house password, not the password to get into the house.  Victor will later tell Bill that there is no other password.  Once again, the masked woman comes to Bill's rescue sparing him full nudity in front of all and who knows what else.  He leaves as he came, by taxi.<br/><br/>Now is it 4:00 a.m. when he arrives at home, and Alice admits that she was dreaming of f***ing so many men, that she could no longer keep track.  She is in tears and Bill is disturbed by, what I will refer to as, his Fedaglio experience.  The two turn in after their tumultuous experiences.<br/><br/>The next night, Bill brings a gift to the prostitute, with whom he was going to have sex.  He learns from the roommate, that she has just been diagnosed with AIDS.  This is the second wave of naiveté for Bill.  He is completely stunned and glazed by the news.  Gathering his senses in a coffee shop, he reads an article in the paper, that Amanda Curren has died from drug overdose.  He views the body and recognizes it as `Mandy,' Victor's sex mate.  Was Mandy a drug and sex addict?  Victor confesses that she willingly took drugs on her own volition.  Therefore, one would conclude no foul play. Nevertheless, Bill is neither pleased nor satisfied.  Victor says to Bill, something to the effect, `Bill, you were never really invited to the party, and as a result, the guests put on a show for you, to shock you.'  Bill replies with command, `no show should end up with a woman being murdered, Victor!' <br/><br/>Bill and Alice, now strolling through FAO Schwarz, with their little seven year old daughter, realize they both need to strengthen their relationship. They realize future adult temptations are in front of them.  The film ends with our minds left to wonder how they will handle their own and surrounding relationships.  I would definitely love to see an Eyes Wide Shut, Volume II. If the script worked, it would have to fit Cruise and Kidman in the present.  I am sure the writers would have plenty of material with which to work.  Eyes Wide Shut is a great spectacle of sexual tribalism, at its pinnacle.  It reflects communal sexual ownership or bondage, in contrast to the struggles of monogamy and privacy, in a marriage, as depicted by Bill and Alice.  Looking back, as to when it came out, it was highly underrated and valued, as to its importance and relevance of contemporary thought provoking issues.  Possibly, at that time, mass culture was not in tune to the nature of this subject matter.  If you have not seen this film, I highly recommend that you do.  You will not be disappointed in the very life-like interpretative mood to this subject matter."

","I'm a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick but I'm totally mystified as to the reason he made this movie.  What story was he telling?  A man's odyssey into Soho after hours?  I thought Griffen Dunn did a better job in ""After Hours"".  At least that plot line was believable compared to this one.  Was it some sort of subliminal sexual message? As pretty as the girls were, I wasn't moved. Go watch ""Blue Velvet"" if you want to be disturbed on a sexual level. Perhaps it's art, I don't know.  I wasn't all that impressed with the cinematography.  I put this movie up there with Professional Wrestling as one of those things I don't understand, but other people find entertaining."
"jonathandoe_se7en","7","3","5","6 September 2001"," People tend to miss the point of Kubrick's films.
","When Eyes Wide Shut was released in 1999, shortly after Kubrick's death, every critic panned the film, calling it static, cold and empty. Many people said that the performances where either dull, or just plain over the top. All I can think is ""have these people ever seen any other Stanley Kubrick film"". Kubrick didn't make films to accommodate narrative, look at 2001: A Space Odyssey or Barry Lyndon, and he definitely didn't make films for character purposes Kubrick made films about ideas. <br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is about the idea of jealousy, it's about sexual paranoia in the home, its about desires and longings. The narrative is non-substantial, the film works better as a long form selection of vignettes that befall Bill (Cruise) through his dark night on the town, and with this in mind it's no wonder that people have hailed the film as ""1999: A Sexual Odyssey"". Because in the same way that Kier Dullea was transformed into the star child, so is Dr Bill transformed into a better human being. The comparisons to 2001 are many, much like that film this also has Kubrick in a more optimistic mood. There's no dehumanisation here, this isn't A Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket; Eyes Wide Shut is showing us that sometimes we take things for granted.<br/><br/>The film does however fall flat in the middle, and there are a couple of instances where Kubrick tries to sandwich in the message that `sometimes married couples have fantasies but in the end it's all okay', and I think this might have just been Kubrick panicking when the film went over budget, trying to make the story a little more acceptable. But this is on par with other films such as Dr Strangelove and Paths of Glory. And when you look back all Kubrick's films get negative reviews when they are first released, expect people to finally wake up to Eyes Wide Shut, sometime in the not too distant future."
"gbheron","5","3","5","24 April 2001"," Poor Showing for Kubrick (Spoiler)
","Had ""Eyes Wide Shut"" been released as a companion piece to ""A Clockwork Orange"", Kubrick might have been able to connect with his audience. In the early '70s, a cinematic 'pushing the envelope' was an end in itself; the story vehicle was often secondary. You just had to push. And at that point in time, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" would have been doing just that, challenging the audience with a new type of film, new ideas. By 2000, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is pushing nothing and telling its story poorly.  It's a challenge to keep your eyes open.<br/><br/>One problem is that of motivation, both on the character's part and that of the director. For example, why does the Nicole Kidman character confess of an affair she might have had, but didn't? Out of the blue to her stoned husband? The characters just don't act logically. And for Mr. Kubrick, why does he shoot what he does?  Why does he think that watching Ms. Kidman wipe herself adds to the story? Weird.<br/><br/>And the story's high point...rich New Yorkers holding super-secret dress-up soirées to screw whores. I don't think so. As a long-term ex-pat in Europe Mr. Kubrick must have gotten confused...and should have set the story in Brussels.<br/><br/>Bottom line: watch ""Paths of Glory"" for a fifth time instead."
"chaos-rampant","Null","4","8","24 December 2011"," Feverish sexual dream
","Just to be clear at the outset, Kubrick was a great engineer of visual dynamics, an architectural mind above all, but not a very deep thinker.<br/><br/>On a first round through cinema, he really seems to validate his name as one of the most impressive directors; every encounter seems to be a daunting prospect exploring some unprecedented way of seeing things, and those that don't make you feel like it's your fault.<br/><br/>On the second round however, you begin to notice things; how a lot of innovation that is attributed to him is really Antonioni's, how his metaphors usually mirrored one way and then only as you see them, how his perceived coldness was only a way of blocking things, the application of some aesthetic of ideal beauty, how his most profound visual gestures amounted to little more than operatic platitudes.<br/><br/>His films were not so much centered in shared life then, breath from soul, they were merely different ways of tinkering with the medium and how it could play out. Each new subject matter was only an opportunity to apply the colors in a different way. Ritual without ecstacy. Great visual sex but only rarely with some flame. Except this, this one tried.<br/><br/>This was meant to be about a shared life that we knew about and shared in from every tabloid headline, a public life that referenced cinematic dreams. It was meant to be about us wanting to see Tom and Nicole, intimate, vulnerable, human. It was a big thing at the time, foolish peeping toms that we are. We expected sex, and sex as the cracks in the porcelain mirror. Kubrick of course knew in advance and duly obliged us, the first shot being that of a buck naked Kidman. And both of them break down at some point, tattering the beautiful image we knew.<br/><br/>So at first glance we may concede that we got what we came for and more, interestingly consummated outside the bedroom as a feverish dream about sex with all the nervous anticipation and none of the actual sex, and so that the project was successful.<br/><br/>To some degree it is. The tabloids may be old news now but it's still the most interesting angle Kubrick ever worked from; a dreamy film couple playing a film couple but with some nightmare between them that was secretly fantasized about. We savour the game of deception, but of course the burning question remains; how much of it true and how much our own lurid fantasy along with the man? <br/><br/>The point of course is that we're not supposed to know, and be as confounded as they are at the end in how lust obscures their real world. Was her dream a lie masking the real thing? Was his reality one long wandering nightmare about guilt and shame stirred from restless sleep? <br/><br/>Since it's the whole point that the lines between waking world and sleep are blurred, what matters is the connection, how these two interject into each other's mind. Kubrick posits this to be a portentous metaphysical wiring; his sudden absence at the party that gives him the brunt of the blame as though he was vicariously consummating by covering up for what himself had in mind; as soon as she reveals her sexual fantasy back home, the phone rings to announce a death; later in the hooker's apartment, another sexual fantasy is interrupted by another phone call; or the finale of the famous orgy scene, where he bares himself for inquisitive, judgmental eyes.<br/><br/>(Kubrick is careful to avoid suggesting this is about female sexual abuse, we see homosexual pairs dancing together, one male, the other female).<br/><br/>This would be potent stuff that could have gone a long way to alleviate the horribly ostentatious acting, truly atrocious by everyone involved, and dear lord if that gay waiter is not a surefire sign of senility, the clunky dialogue, the pomp verging on flamboyant camp of the whole thing.<br/><br/>But that still leaves those last two scenes, with Sydney Pollack in the billiards room and later in the shopping mall. Every little nuance that we might have teased out for ambiguity is spelled out for us, that it's meant to be ambiguous, and that dreams may be real and vice versa, as though it was truly important stuff that we couldn't afford to miss. Every.little.nuance, there, with meaningful pauses between them, and Tom Cruise clutching his head like he's trying to shake loose some desperate emotion. It is woeful stuff to see from Kubrick.<br/><br/>We're left with a director who seems to have spent his last 12 years watching Lynch, and only applied garish colors on what he thinks it's all about. An embarrassing way to end a career, which is even more of a pity considering how he kept this for himself and gave away AI to Spielberg."

Not surprisingly for Kubrick, the film is original and definitely intriguing. Cruise and Kidman, as usual, delivered great performances as Alice and Bill Harford.

","The last film directed by Stanley Kubrick, EYES WIDE SHUT, is a masterpiece, or by other words, a magnificent way for a director to finish is career. This film is too straight to follow, but at the same time very complex, because it's a deep reflection about a couple's relationship and intimacy. It's about love, jealous, matrimony, loyalty, and adventures outside matrimony, whether ""they are real or in dreams"" <br/><br/>The viewer watches the plot through Dr. William Harford's mind (played by Tom Cruise) and we feel his fears, his tension, his insurance about his matrimony and the loyalty of his wife. We can feel the tension growing and how lost he is! His wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), is also lost and confused, but she's controlling the game, to the point of testing him, telling him an affair she once had with a sailor man But did it really happen, or is she just telling her sexual fantasy to instigate him, to make him jealous? I think the end answers that! <br/><br/>Aside from their relationship, this movie is also great for many other reasons! It's mysterious, suspenseful, odd and mystical! The scene where occurs that weird and mysterious party is amazing, because it creates a magnificent ambiance of seduction and mystery, but also obscurity and weirdness. No one knows who is who, behind those creepy and sinister masks, what increases the mystery. The ceremony scene is simply astonishing. Together, the music, the voices, the masks, the women, and the ritual it self create this bizarre and mystical ambiance, that is so seductive at the same time. It's one of my favourite's scenes ever I must say! From all types of cinema, from all movies I ever saw! <br/><br/>The acting is great, especially by Tom Cruise, which does one of the best roles of his long and succeeded career. His character is quite lost, scared and confused and he plays it very well. Nicole Kidman also does a good job, playing his tempting wife.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is amazing! I know it's not an original OST, since it's a very well known classical piece, but it's just brilliant, providing suspense and tension to the film.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece, and it resumes it all!"

Involved relationships are quite layered like an onion with very fine texture that has moods that can shift and spin around in an instant. Moods are constantly shifting around in this film. <br/><br/>No place is there a relationship like one wishes with a cashier at a grocery store where one can bring the goods, plump down the money and just leave. Those can be humans' wishes but even at the cashier they wind up being more involved with layers that build up tensions and shifting moods.<br/><br/>Kubrick uses sexual images only as a decoy. These ""masks"" make the audience chase after the wrong area, carrying their own delusions. Even the smoking of dope by Kidman and Cruise is a part of the mask. Humans are never more self-deceiving than when they are either high on dope or drunk.<br/><br/>In most all of the scenes the backdrops keep changing just like a magician has his assistants constantly doing the dirty work while his moves are only misleading deceptions.<br/><br/>There is a mail pickup box with a distinct gang tagging on it in this film. The trouble is that it shows up in 3 places as if it had legs. It is located in front of the Rainbow Costume shop, in front of the hotel where Dr. Bill investigated the whereabouts of Nick Nightengale, and it is located again in front of a suite and leather shop when Dr. Bill is being followed on foot. <br/><br/>Another mailbox grows legs. It disappears completely from the film. It was located just about 30 feet to the right of the Rainbow Costume shop and can be seen right as Dr. Bill pays his cab fare. He backs away from the cab and then you can see it. When Dr. Bill returns his costume the mailbox disappears just as his mask seemed to.<br/><br/>Also, in the background the address number sequences on the shops make no sense. One can observe them during as Dr. Bill is followed on foot. The numbers on the buildings on one side of the street progress from 20 to 21 to 22 to 23, etc. Directly on the opposite side of the street the numbers increase from 30 to 31 to 32 to 33,etc. Again this makes no sense. Other mailboxes appear and their proximity to one another are nonsensical. But that is what happens when humans dream.<br/><br/>A window air conditioner disappears in moments after characters return to a room. Dr. Bill's office wall is rearranged where diplomas replace paintings that were there earlier. The road to the night club house has changed its journey. The journey exits on an expressway ramp at night and that same exit is bypassed in the day. The daytime approach is from the opposite direction from the evening approach. Many actions take place in mirrors and reflections with backs turned, just as backs can be turned in dreams.<br/><br/>Colors play roles that match up with the moods of the scenes. Even some of the rooms change color when characters re-enter with changing moods to match. It even seems that the promotion of the film and all the actors reactions may have been a mask, something they agreed to do for Kubrick so that even his most loyal followers would be convinced that he made a dud out of his last film. He seems to have had the last laugh on an audience that had its eyes wide open to the deceptions but shut closed to what is really just an lucid dream.<br/><br/>Kubrick's widow dropped the hint of the film's meaning right before its release and no one was listening. She said the film's main message was fear, deceptions and dreams. She was right.<br/><br/>It was the first thought on every adult's mind that this film should not be seen by too young of a viewer. We have a fear of what it might do to such an impressionable mind. We, the audience, were the main characters. The advertisement of the film was a deception to throw us off and played a major masking role and the whole film was a dream.<br/><br/>Was this Kubrick's best? I think so."

","Stanley Kubrick. The god of film-making. His movies is not equivalent to anything else. True art. This movie is a masterpiece. A dream you never want to end. Kubrick really know how to mesmerize us with his unforgettable use of camera and music. He puts the viewer in a state of trance and you don't even know if the things that Bill Harford (tom cruise) experience is a dream or something unexplainable. And that defines Eyes Wide Shut very well. A nonverbal experience. A message from Kubrick which is not even supposed to be explained in words. <br/><br/>It took Kubrick 13 years to deliver Eyes Wide Shut after the release of Full Metal Jacket. In this 13 years Kubrick where very depressed sometimes and he felt like he had a big pressure to perform in his next movie. it had to be a special movie. Not just an average movie. <br/><br/>And then finally when the work with Eyes Wide Shut where finished he died a week later...<br/><br/>And the results: A movie like nothing else & for me the best movie ever made along with 2001: A Space Odyssey<br/><br/>10/10 thank you Kubrick"

","What a terrible film, what a waste of time.  I'm sorry, but there is only so much I can take and I must speak out.  Yes, I am aware that it is Kubric, but need I remind everybody that he did die before the end of making this film, and indeed, it shows. The editing is dreadful: it was far too long; they were overindulgent in scene and shot lengths.  And while the sets are lavish and the lighting beautiful it does not make up for a POINTLESS script.  It is a hollow shell of a film, a pretty facade, but scrape past that and you will reveal a void of superficial characterisation, trite dialogue, SHOCKINGLY BAD musical score (c'mon.1 note??), with an inane plot.<br/><br/>There is no plot, and the insipid characterisation is only made worse by the shockingly bad acting (I'm sorry, was Kidman laughing or crying???).  I am aware that a good use of the pause can add an element of drama to another wise dull dialogue, but adding it after EVERY WORD makes it boring to watch, and it only resulted in a pathetic attempt to add depth to two shallow characters.  The character's adversity is banal, and it is extremely difficult to muster any concern for anything that befalls them.<br/><br/>I am also aware that the film won much acclaim, but I feel that this is misguided plaudit from blinded fans of Kubric.  This is a rotten film, and Kubric fans would be best looking at his better work rather than remembering him for this banal crap.  People put too much emphasis on visuals, forgetting there is supposed to be a point, (remember that thing called the narrative).  This is hardly cinema de look, and even `The Big Blue' had a better plot!<br/><br/>If you have not seen this yet, then you are lucky  (in more ways than one) as you are obviously not a die-hard disciple of Kubric, and are therefore not vulnerable to liking a TERRIBLE film.  I feel quite safe in saying that you too, will loathe this film.  Do not waste your time.<br/><br/>1/10 (an award I do not bestow often)<br/><br/>PS: If you are still gripped with the desire to see this film I recommend watching it in fast forward, you'll adequately get the gist and if you do this with a DVD player you can listen to the dialogue at the pace that most humans speak at."

","""Can you fool some of the people all of the time?""<br/><br/>The first IMDB comment is illuminating.  This Gazzer-guy is clearly taken in by the name Kubrick and has checked his objectivity at the door on the way in.  I would love to read his comments if Kevin Costner was labelled as the director, just to fool him.<br/><br/>How bad is Eyes Wide Shut?  A porn ripoff called ""Thighs Wide Open"" is a considerably better film with more to say. Porno's that try (and fail) to put in some sort of socially redeeming material are often quite a hoot. But in ""Thighs"", they have a why-don't-we-all-take-off-these- stupid-masks"" scene that is just exquisite in it's irony.<br/><br/>Yes, take off the stupid masks!  There is a underworld in New York City (and many other cities) of sexual promiscuity and multiple partners and whatever can be imagined but there is certainly NO SEX MAFIA in New York or likely anywhere else. If there's one in London, then why didn't the old stiff place his film there! Why defame New York City?<br/><br/>Kubrick lost it before he died. This is not an art film. This is a bad film.  It has nothing to say and none of the characters in the film even begin to approach reality. Approach!<br/><br/>Last, I would love to see the sales figures for the film's sound track.  It will likely take the grammy award for best single-note-piano-recital category. I often find myself humming that unforgettable tune in the elevator.<br/><br/>Kubrick's real epitaph: ""Died Dumb.

","Eyes wide shut is for me the best movie of Stanley Cubrick.
From the beginning to the end this film is a masterpiece.
The scenery,the camera points of view..the slow but entertaining flow have all their means.
Many people say that the movie ends very awkwardly(including me),
and that is because the actual hole movie had another 21 or 23 minutes to end yet.
And this is not a conspiracy.It is a fact.That being said, the movie would go on by showing Bill Harford's wife being part of the orgy and who were some of the masked guests at that orgy house.
For that and many other reasons, i give this movie a 10+++ because i know Stanley wouldn't leave such a bad ending to his last film."
"xmdbx","6","2","3","28 March 2019"," I Think I'm Disappointed
","This is a difficult film for me to wrap my head around. Stanley Kubrick is unequivocally my favorite director of all time. My two favorite movies (Dr. Strangelove and 2001) are both directed by him and I love most of his films. He is objectively a master of cinema. Having that opinion going into a film can sometimes be problematic. I have to resist the urge of over-analyzing things and treat it like a regular movie. I find it hard to tell what is important in Eyes Wide Shut. Is it the dream vs. reality narrative? Is it the lust? The power of the ultra-rich? Something unseen and unsaid? Or, more likely, a combination of all of these things? There are a few films that are so different than what we're used to that you have to rely on a feeling that what you just watched was special in order to get a grasp on what you think of it. I think 2001 is an example of that but I think Mulholland Dr. is a better example. At the end of both films you basically have no idea what you just watched but, at least in my experience, you're okay with that. You know you're not supposed to get everything. With Eyes Wide Shut I didn't really get that feeling. I went into the film ready to watch something that I would recognize as amazing and ended up let down that I found it to be just alright. I was left with a lot of questions. I think a lot of this feeling can be attributed mainly to a couple of things. One being Nicole Kidman's character. I found too many of her scenes hard to watch. Her slow, monotone dialogue took over nearly every scene she was in and not for the better if you ask me. I understand that it's supposed to be somewhat dream-like but there is just too much of it for my tastes. The other thing that irked me was the theme music. I couldn't help but think that the piano theme was lazy and that is coming from someone who thinks that Kubrick movies have some of the best scores there are. I have a feeling that it was intended to make the viewer uneasy but I wasn't too big a fan of it. Conversely, I thought the framing and lighting were immaculate, as expected. Cinematography is not something you have to worry about with Kubrick. The acting was pretty good, including that of Kidman, I just had a problem with her character. The story was compelling and thought-provoking but that is more due to the source material than the film itself. The liberties that the movie takes with the source material is what has kept me thinking of it for the past few days and I think a film that is on your mind for days after (in a non-negative way) deserves some credit just for that. I am about as confused as I've been after watching a movie and I have a feeling that my qualms were intended but at this point they are mostly lost on me. The film is often thought of as misunderstood and I probably agree but, at this point in time, I don't find it to be a masterpiece."

","This was the legendary Stanley Kubrick's final film(he passed away literally a few days after the film's premiere). Now, is it a good film? That depends on what you are looking for. This is a work of high authority and one can see Kubrick's influence in each frame. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play real life couple in high society New York(completely recreated on a London soundstage). They are invited a party where sexual dealings and offerings are exchanged which leads to an altercations of sorts later at home. What follows is a ride into a rabbit hole by Cruise's character involving sex cults, orgies, identities and obsessions. The film isn't as heavy handed as it appears and the pacing is very good.

","""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a slow-burn drama/thriller with deep themes that bring about many questions. It brings to light a discussion that needs to be had.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The drama plays out beautifully in this film. It begins by introducing a deep concept that nearly everyone deals with: wondering what it would be like to be with someone else. What follows is a horrifying venture. Kubrick once again takes command of the audience's attention and brings to light a darker side of the elite and the human psyche in general. *Cinematography/Editing: The tone and camerawork of the film is very recognizable as being a Kubrick film. Larry Smith does a fantastic job of bringing the film a dreamlike quality in visual terms. This sets up an important part of the narrative because much of it deals with dreams and how they affect us more than we may think. The editing is a bit of a weak point in the film. There was apparently quite a bit of studio interference with this film so it is very likely that the final cut is not exactly what Kubrick had intended. While there are a few pacing issues, most of the film is top quality. *Dialogue/Acting: The stumbling dialogue between characters is a brilliant touch to this film. It feels authentic and natural. Bill tries to cover up what he has done, and he is very awkward about it. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman do a phenomenal job portraying a couple who is struggling to deal with feelings of attraction to other people. The supporting actors all make this film come together. There are some strong performances by the members of the elite during the ritual scenes. *Music/Sound: The music is haunting in this film when it needs to be. It adds to the feeling of anxiety created by the situations Bill puts himself in. The sound is designed well and feels authentic. It is especially effective during the ritual scene. The soundscape feels very eerie during that moment. *Production Design/Special Effects: The costume and set pieces are grand and add to the feeling of the wealth that all of the characters have.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a beautiful and gut-wrenching film that brings to light the evils of the elite and shows us the importance of needing to address feelings of unfaithfulness in our own relationships. Are dreams really just dreams?"
"highplainsdrifter-63381","10","2","3","23 August 2017"," Kubrick's Masterpiece
","The short descriptions and plot summaries, here and elsewhere, while perfectly accurate, really don't do this film justice. It takes place in New York City, over the course of several days, and centers around Tom Cruise and his efforts to deal with a very strange situation in which he finds himself.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays a doctor and the main protagonist, Nicole Kidman is his wife, Sydney Pollock is his very wealthy friend and patient. While the actors all do an excellent job, IMHO the real star of this film doesn't appear on screen at all. The real star is the Director, Stanley Kubrick. The way he adapts the story from the novel ""Traumnovelle"", elicits wonderful performances from the entire cast, controls the mood with great music, and orchestrates the whole thing into a riveting experience, in my view make him the real star.<br/><br/>There are so many delicious little sub-plots that, while they could have been greatly simplified, as they are they add a dimension of character and color that make the film far more interesting. The scenes where Tom Cruise speaks with a gay hotel clerk, or deals with a costumer played by Rade Serbedzija (along with his nymphomaniac daughter and her two boyfriends), or finally confronts Sydney Pollock at the end, almost stand alone as great little character pieces that not only help tell the story, but become little side branches that add to the whole.<br/><br/>That said, for me the best scene of the film is at the ""House"", where the good doctor finds himself immersed in a very bizarre and dangerous situation. I won't say any more than that, just watch for that scene.<br/><br/>This film works on so many levels. There's the main plot itself, where Tom Cruise tries to deal with a strange but all-too-real situation. The terrific little sub-plots with wonderful, if slightly off-beat, supporting characters. The music, especially at moments of high tension.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Stanley Kubrick passed shortly after finishing this film. It is often considered his masterpiece, and deservedly so. This is easily one of my favorite films."
"kshiarella","Null","2","3","7 February 2017"," Thematic Sketch for viewers...
","The following is an attempt to provide a thematic sketch of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to help tie together some of the confusing imagery of the film and to make sense of the story that the film makers were trying to express. (Contains spoilers) <br/><br/>The story is a character's loss of innocence but, in exchange, gains the faculty of intimacy. Essentially, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is Homer's ""Odyssey"" re-worked to fit Freudian psychology. As an(extremely) brief reminder, Freud posited that the human mind is composed of three competing components: 1. The Id, which represents the dark subconscious drives of lust for sex, power, violence an domination over others, 2. The Super Ego which is the result of expectations in our lives that drive us to conform to standards and is manifested as guilt and self criticism, and 3. The Ego, which is our little rational self that, weakly, tries to negotiate between the drives of the Id and Super Ego.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Dr. Bill is a man who's Id is asleep and he is completely driven by his Super Ego. He lives his life in perfect conformity with the way he thinks he should. He is a successful doctor with beautiful patients, has a beautiful wife and beautiful daughter, lives in a beautiful apartment surrounded by beautiful artwork, in a beautiful neighborhood and attends parties with beautiful people where beautiful models, two at a time, try to seduce him. He is happy in his existence, but he is blind to the darker elements of the human mind, thus, his eyes are ""wide shut."" Dr. Bill is plastic and hollow. His smile is attractive but phony, His perspectives on the people around him are superficial and non-insightful. Without the Id, Dr. Bill is blind to intimacy as he cannot truly relate to others. He is an innocent.<br/><br/>As we meet his wife, she is angry. Her husband does not really see her as anything but a part of his beautiful life and she is alienated by it. She feels unseen. She goes to the party and she feels the pull of seduction and the pangs of jealousy and she hates herself for both; and, moreover, she is angry because she is isolated from her husband because he seems blind to such human states of mind. She is a person hurting from loss of career but Dr. Bill doesn't seem to get it. They are still beautiful people living a beautiful life as they should.<br/><br/>In exasperation, she provokes her husband in an argument to finally try to get him to see her truly, as a complex human being dealing with dark feelings. She challenges his image of her and his limited human perspective by revealing a fantasy (and, later, a dream). Her fantasy was derived by an experience of a man who, with a glance, was able to see her, something Dr. Bill, seemingly, can't do.<br/><br/>Her provocation cracks his armor and the needles of his Id rush forth in the form of a maddening jealous sexual fantasy derived from his wife's revelations. He flees into the city where he goes through a tour of characters dominated by their Id. At first he dismisses them as off the wall until he finds himself at the ritualistic orgy of some super-rich secret society. The Super Rich follow Nietzsche's ""Master Morality,"" i.e., they do whatever they please, freeing them to chase the desires of their Id, unbridled. The seemingly wildly out of place scene exemplifies an extreme display of the Id in overt human behavior, thus, is useful to drive the awakening of Dr. Bill. And for Dr. Bill the scene is quite a slap up-side his Super Ego's head (as it is for the viewers of the film).<br/><br/>After witnessing the bizarre sexual ritual, Dr. Bill re-retraces his steps to re-visit the cast of characters he had visited the day before and sees them through open eyes, newly aware of their humanity in the context of the darker elements of mankind. He reaches out to them, to touch them with his new-found intimacy but can't make contact This failure drives him home.<br/><br/>In his tour, Dr, Bill is exposed to all the powers of the Id: lust, power, perversion, and domination. The experiences break the barriers erected by his Super Ego. His eyes are now open to the seamy realities of human nature. He feels the draw, the repulsion, the pain and the beauty. He discovers that the wold of the Id is sublime. He is now open to true human intimacy.<br/><br/>He goes home to find the mask laying on his pillow next to his wife. It is a symbol of the barrier from intimacy that his Super Ego had created. But now, the mask is gone, Dr. Bill's Id has been unleashed. He can see his wife for the first time though these eyes. He can now see her pain and anger for what it is, and see her as a whole person.<br/><br/>The wife is hurt but relieved to hear of his journey. Finally, the two can begin to share a balanced life. Not a superficially happy, innocent life contented by meeting superficial standards and expectations but rather living as whole people capable of intimacy<br/><br/>On one level, the movie is quite dark. Can we call it personal growth when someone learns something that makes them less happy? It is like the choice of Neo in ""The Matrix."" Would it be better to be happily deluded or to see things as they actually are, in full color rather than just in black and white, if pain also comes along with it? This is the dark ground covered by the film. Within this framework, that Dr, Bill has a personal awakening to the world of the Id, the progression of the film is quite clean. Every scene is useful in the progression."
"Leofwine_draca","7","2","3","10 July 2016"," Way too long, but it's a fitting swansong for Kubrick
","Kubrick's final film turns out to be both disappointing and spellbinding, but thankfully the spellbinding part far outweighs the disappointing bit. Despite the massive hype, many critics were unkind to this film, labelling it wishy-washy and insubstantial. While I agree that it is definitely flawed, there are some excellent scenes in the film which rival those of any creepy horror film.<br/><br/>While the film starts off poorly, it does get better, let me assure you. Kubrick almost deliberately seems to be trying to push the viewer away, challenging him by drawing out unimportant scenes and pushing them into our faces. I do agree that the film is far, far too long, the two hour and a half length is just over the top, and I'm sure that it could have been cut down half an hour to a greater effect. Also, the widely publicised 'erotic' content is not actually there; although the film is based around sex, there is very little actual sex on show, and Cruise doesn't even sleep with anybody, apart from his wife. There is lots of nudity on full view, but no more than you'd see on TV, so it's not really very shocking.<br/><br/>The film has an interesting cast, with Tom Cruise being an agreeable focus point from the film; it's not hard to imagine that he can be irresistible to every person he meets, male or female. Nicole Kidman actually appears only at the beginning and the end of the film to provide some antagonistic argument, and also to shed her clothes (no surprise there). The rest of the cast all put in believable, immaculate performances, but the real star here is Stanley Kubrick. Having made only a handful of films in his career, this epic was to be his swansong, and the magic that made 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and THE SHINING such good films is still here, you just have to dig to see it.<br/><br/>The best moments in the film are when Cruise visits the orgy. The sight of the robed, masked figures is genuinely spooky and unsettling, especially when they discover Cruise to be an outsider and begin to threaten him. These scenes are pure horror and very effective, as is another moment where Cruise is followed down the street by a faceless man. In fact, I liked the whole of Cruise's journey through the night and his discovery of the consequences the next day, just not the Cruise/Kidman bits which surrounded it. The film is bolstered by an eerily effective soundtrack, one piece of music being played on piano sticking in the mind. While it is overused, it's still quite chilling. EYES WIDE SHUT may be no masterpiece and it may take some sitting through, but there are some great bits to enjoy and altogether it serves as a fitting swansong to Kubrick. Recommended."

It has an outstanding complexity, formed by adding it's message (or messages, because we're talking about a Kubrick film) to the other features, such as the plot, setting, cast, or the image.<br/><br/>It questions a moral problem linked to the human nature, exposed through a plot which is slowly developed, but once realized by the main characters, it fixes it's roots deeply into their perspectives and actions. Basically, every scene is a key, a piece of a puzzle that, at least in my case, has not been completed even by today. As usual, Kubrick seems to have thrown away the last piece of this puzzle, engaging the viewer to ""create"" his own piece, based on his particular perspective on the approached subject(s).<br/><br/>It is full of hidden symbols and clues, which I haven't even spotted before watching several youtube clips about this movie.

","This is the only Kubrick film that I've watched so far that I can say I really enjoyed watching. This movie is unlike any you will ever watch. The thing that I found most interesting is that this movie is very long, feels long and yet I never wanted it to end. This movie is one where you watch it and you never know what is coming next. Predictability goes out the window in this movie. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances in this movie and I loved watching his character on screen figuring things out as we the audience figure it out. Complaints come down to the score and there are a few scenes where there is a lot of dialogue being swapped between characters and the pace slows. This is a solid film overall and one that I highly recommend for those who are a fan of Kubrick and or Cruise."
"Lejink","8","2","3","28 May 2011"," The dark night...
","Talk about your long dark night of the soul. This is a deliberately unsettling exploration of jealousy, sexual curiosity and deviance masked under a morality tale against adultery and drug-taking...I think. <br/><br/>Kubrick's very adult film takes us into the world of successful New York doctor Tom Cruise (""Dr Bill Harford"") and Nicole Kidman and from the simple opening of them leaving their infant child in the charge of their baby-sitter to attend a glitzy Christmas party hosted by the mega-rich Sydney Pollack, sees them subject to sexual temptation with third parties (two for one in Cruise's case) from which they just about extricate themselves. However, post-party and back in their own bed, we see them smoking a joint and gradually fashion an argument, culminating in Kidman's shocking admission to her husband about a sexual fantasy she had over a soldier some time before, even when in her husband's company. One surprise call for Cruise to attend the death of his old mentor gives him the opportunity to explore his darker side and attempt to expiate the vision of Kidman and her fantasy love which fuels his actions.<br/><br/>I can't claim to understand the many facets of this strong film but was certainly held from one discomfiting scene to the next. First Cruise is almost seduced by the grieving daughter of the dead man whom he's attending, then he similarly pulls back from a liaison with a kindly (as it turns out very kindly prostitute) thanks to a timely phone call from his wife, before finally his curiosity and motivations get the better of him and he gate-crashes a sinister masqued orgy where apparently anything goes but in truth all is carefully orchestrated, monitored and controlled. On the way though, he witnesses a troubling situation at the fancy-dress shop whose owner he gets up after hours to furnish him with the required disguise for the ball, with the owner's obviously barely pubescent daughter is caught almost in-flagrante with what appears to be a father and son Oriental pair.<br/><br/>The centrepiece of the film and the one that perhaps demonstrates Kubrick's powers most is the orgy scene. A deliberately constructed long slow tease of a scene with the viewer made to follow Cruise's subjective voyeuristic gaze as he wanders through the plush, massive rooms of the secret mansion, witnessing sexual acts performed in dumb show for the specially invited guests to a backdrop of a gloomy but haunting piano refrain. Thus we the viewer feel the danger of the faceless Mr Big who catches Cruise out in his deception who to protect the anonymity and exclusivity of his ""parties"" that he will extract the highest price to deter interlopers in the future.<br/><br/>I found myself carried along uneasily on Cruise's coat-tails and of course are made to examine our own morality and sexual mores and even as it seems both Cruise may have just about learned his lesson, that shocking last word on camera of Kidman's perhaps gives the lie to that. Of course it could all have been a drug-fuelled dream/nightmare of Cruise's, which would help explain the enigmatic title of the movie...<br/><br/>Both leads are very good in what must have been difficult parts to play, especially as they were of course married at the time. The support players were all as significant but unobtrusive as they needed to be. However it's in the orchestration of the set, actors, lighting, camera movement and music that one sees a great director at work. I doubt I could have been persuaded subject matter like this without knowing that the likes if Kubrick was behind the camera.<br/><br/>As it happened, it turned out of course to be his last movie and what a demanding, challenging, even risky one it turned out to be. While I couldn't argue it as the best movie in his oeuvre, it is obviously the work of a major talent and testimony that he maintained his considerable powers to the end."

","Have you seen 'A Clockwork Orange'? If yes then it will be easier to accept and enjoy this one. When the form of delivery does not repel, only then it's possible to acquire the ideas and messages the movie serves. It's Kubrick, it's discrepant... The movie is explicit, sometimes it's vulgar and repulsive, but every snippet of a dialog contains food for thought, non trivial, even controversial, but ideas, that from time to time will come to your mind and the movie will echo back even after a very long time.<br/><br/>The plot is concentrated on a 9 year married couple which lives happy and peaceful life. But a confession, slight and insignificant at first sight, made by the wife (Kidman), turns upside down the lives of the both. A confession, that she cheated on him just by thought, makes the husband (Cruise) to open his eyes and see that he did not really know neither his wife, nor himself, and this revelation leads him to a chain of unusual and dangerous affairs.<br/><br/>But the plot is not the only strong side of the movie. Flawless acting of Kidman and Cruise, supported by Kubrick's unique style and accompanied by brilliant music complete the picture.<br/><br/>Even if you are not fond of Kubrick, or drama movies in general, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a must see, just to be aware of another type of movies, or maybe the only representative of that type."

"toqtaqiya2","8","2","3","10 November 2010"," The final work of legendary director Stanley Kubrick.
","Stanley Kubrick's detractors used his showmanship as a criticism of his films, claiming that they were only simple stories writ portentously and pompously large, all form and no substance. And these detractors were never so merciless - or so numerous - as they were with his final film, Eyes Wide Shut, which was released posthumously in the summer of 1998. The incentive came fast and furious. The film was too slow. Its vision of New York was hopelessly out of touch. It was misogynist. It was ugly. Its notion of sexuality was old-fashioned. It was unfinished. The rumours were dished out to a public that finally had no use for this most intimate and nakedly emotional of Kubrick's films. Eyes Wide Shut is the story of a young Manhattan doctor (Tom Cruise) who uses his wife's (Nicole Kidman) spontaneous confession of past unrequited desire for another man as license to explore his own desires, only to encounter an endless series of prohibitions and frustrations. For those who went to Kubrick's film with their eyes wide open, it is one of his greatest films, composed and enacted in dream logic, set in the ravishing tones of fin-de-siecle Viennese painting. Kubrick uses his two dedicated superstars to dig deep into uncomfortable emotional issues. He may have lived in England for the last 35 years of his life, and he may have been a towering artist, but Kubrick was also the last of the great American showmen. He knew how to deliver a total experience. Like most of his work, Eyes Wide Shut will make the shift to classic status."
"antonjsw1","Null","2","3","31 July 2010"," Kubrick's final masterpiece
","Sadly this was Stanley Kubrick's final film.<br/><br/>Despite not directing a film for some 12 years, and taking some 2 years to shoot and complete this film. Kubrick has lost none of his skill to make a first rate film that deals with a complex human issue is a dispassionate and objective way, yet keeps the film accessible, entertaining and most importantly, staying in the mind of the viewer long after having seen it.<br/><br/>Kubrick's film is a study of the human condition, from the perspective of how sex is part of a relationship. It also makes a statement of how human life is viewed in the higher echelons of society, and seems to indicate it is a commodity to enjoy, and then dispose of, with little or any emotional energy being invested. Cruise gives a compelling performance with more restraint than a typical for him and watching his character put himself into temptation is interesting. However Nicole Kidman is more than a match her husband in the acting department with a very effective and charismatic performance - their initial, immature drug fuelled argument in the bedroom is very effective and her character viciously demolishes the world-view and confidence of the Tom Cruise character. While the focus of the film is on the Bill Harford, Kidman's interactions with Cruise are always charged and riveting. <br/><br/>As to other performances, they are all competent, albeit Rade Sherbedgia's broad performance is clearly the amusing dark comic relief in the film, which works well and is definitely needed. Actor/director Todd Field and Sky Dumont are engaging in small parts but its the late Sydney Pollack who is commanding as Victor Zielger and is charismatic and totally amoral in the main supporting role. <br/><br/>Technical credits, as usual for a Kubrick film are first rate. Larry Smith's photography, no doubt enhanced by Kubrick's own outstanding knowledge of lighting is excellent, especially as this was Smith's first film as a Director of Photography. He had previously worked on the lighting crews on both Barry Lyndon and The Shining. He has gone on to by the lighting cameraman on a wide variety of projects after this film. Kubrick also shows he is the master of Steadicam, ably supported by veteran operator Elizabeth Ziegler. Nigel Galts editing is also very slick and polished. Joceyln Pook's music, supplemented with pre-existing music tracks, no doubt chosen or influenced by Kubrick himself is effective in creating a dark and disturbing mood.<br/><br/>However, as with many Kubrick films, its the outstanding production design that is the greatest technical achievement. Led by Les Tomkins and Kubrick veteran Roy Walker they create a world that is totally convincing - after all the film's first unit shot entirely in the UK<br/><br/>In summary this film is an appropriate and final outstanding achievement for possibly the most technically yet sophisticated and challenging visual storyteller I have come across watching movies."
"dlombard-2","8","2","3","3 March 2010"," Kubrick's masterpiece of surrealist exploration into human sexuality
","The first shot of Eyes Wide Shut (1999) epitomizes the content that is elaborated on throughout Stanley Kubrick's 154 minute drama. The shot frames Nicole Kidman inside two red drapes, wearing a black dress which she then peels off to reveal only her naked body. There is no context for this scene, and it ends abruptly when the films title appears. From the beginning there is no doubt that this movie will be about sex, in every sense and stigma of the word. The highlighting of the female form at the very start embodies the way in which Kubrick's film relies on the titillation of the viewers through graphic sexual imagery to perform its own critique and revelation of human sexuality at the turn of the century. The film utilizes both the narrative involving a married couple and their deep rooted sexual desires, as well the spectator's perception and impression of the visual articulation on screen in its display the grand scope of human sexuality and what that entails. The viewer travels down detailed avenues of the most basic of human desires and its presence in society, depicting images of adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, child exploitation and implications of fatalism at the hands of promiscuity. Kubrick utilizes every facet of film art, production and distribution to articulate his expose on human sexuality, and this film stands out as highly controversial for how it visually depicts this. <br/><br/>The role of media saturation of sexuality in America is only a small portion of the films overarching expose on human sexual inclinations. The film's narrative revolves around the affluent lives of Dr. Bill Harford and his wife Alice, which provides the framework for Kubrick to address the virtue of the institute of marriage and the way in which people deviate from it. An integral scene in Kubrick's depiction of their marriage is a marijuana fueled argument between him and Alice regarding their respective notions of infidelity. Alice berates Bill for his implications that men and women harbor different sexual inclinations after he states that men view beautiful women, namely Alice, as simply a sexual object to be conquered, and sex is the only thing on their mind. Conversely, he feels women have an ingrained notion that sex is about security and reassurance, to which Alice is quickly and relentlessly ready to refute. She goes into depth in describing how she fantasized about a naval officer when they vacationed at Cape Cod the year before, and how she would have given everything up to have one night with this man. Kubrick deconstruct Bill's, and the viewer's, simplistic notion of gender dictating sexual desires with Alice's emotional monologue. This sets forth the rest of the film as Bill's own search for a sexual awakening once he is exposed to Alice's deepest and darkest sexual fantasies, the kind of fantasies which Bill adamantly denies at the beginning of the scene. From this scene forward is where Kubrick's sexual expedition begins, detailing the culture of sexuality in a way which no major, high-budget studio feature had attempted before. <br/><br/>The most notorious and amazing scene in this film is the ritualistic sex party which Bill attends. He clearly cannot resist the urge to witness what his friend Nick, who plays the piano blindfolded at the party, had described to him. This is the point in the film where Kubrick's pure and natural depiction of the culture of human sexuality is transformed into an indulgent and surreal sequence of sexual fantasy. The scene features dozens of masked spectators, all circling what seems to be a very religious ritual of sexuality. Masked women circle around a man donning a bright red robe, with incense burning and a very ominous chant continues throughout. These first moments of the party feature such motifs such as masks and a religious context to further separate the previous, more human sexual experiences, and transform the theme of sexuality into an ancient pagan ritual. This kind of stark contrast between the first portions of the film defines it as overly surreal and dream-like. Bill walks through the party, witnessing explicit sexual intercourse throughout the long tracking shot. Kubrick establishes such a grandiose mansion setting to further the viewer's surrealistic and fantastical perception of the scene. <br/><br/>The explicit nature of the aforementioned scene was too graphic for Warner to release, requiring superimpositions to avoid an NC-17 rating. But the effect on the viewer is not lost due to the changes. Just as Bill is taken completely by surprise by the events at the party, so is the viewer. As a participant in viewing this film, the viewer and the protagonist are both placed inside the dark fantasy of anonymous sexual encounters on an unbelievable scale. Kubrick leaves the viewer with so many questions about those events on screen, but all a viewer can do is interpret what such a surreal and fantastical sequence was supposed to mean within the frame of critiquing human sexuality. While the surrealistic sequence greatly contrasts Bill's other interactions throughout that night, it functions to further Kubrick's theme of sexual culture by contrasting the realities of marriage, prostitution, homophobia, and fatalism directly with the dark sexual fantasy portrayed at the mansion. This reveals the human nature of sexual desire and fantasies of such, while still grounding the narrative and its characters in their sexual reality."
"joshi_3592","10","2","3","18 December 2009"," Well it's Kubrick film, that's for sure.
","This must be THE weirdest film I've ever (or at least American film). In my opinion Kubricks 2001, is understandable in comparison. Now I'm giving this movie a 7/10 because it's a Kubrick film, and I admit that I probably missed the point. Nverteless the acting was great and I liked the character development in the film. The exact meaning of the characters experiences I did NOT get at all. But I'm sure one day I'll see the film again and say: ""aha, now I get it"". that's how 2001 was for me, and I doubt this will be an exception.<br/><br/>A little warning for you who are afraid of graphic films. There is a LOT of nudity in this film. Almost to the point of being humorously weird I thought. The main subject of this film is SEX. And for some scenes that's about it. Never before have I seen a film with so much sex, orgy's, full and partial nudity. Why this is in the film I don't know, I'll probably figure that out one day as well.<br/><br/>I must say this is not a bad final movie for Kubricks great career. It is as stunning and mysterious and symbolic as all of his movies. And he probably took the answer to this secret to his grave as well, so we may never fully know."
"johnnyboyz","7","2","3","21 October 2009"," ......but keep your mind wide open.
","There's a scene in Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, in which the lead feels he is being followed by an unruly and somewhat antagonistic force down a public street. The setting is the night; the location is a usually bustling city and the happenings within the frame capture what's at stake for these people. A certain Dr. William Harford (Cruise) stands by a stand selling items; his surveyor at the end of the street, keeping a watchful eye on the good doctor, whilst himself perched between two very distinct locales: a large, welcoming restaurant and a sex shop displaying the latest in lingerie. In a very basic sense, and given what Harford knows at this point about the stalker, the two locales the follower stands between represent Harford's predicament: carrying on with what you're doing and keeping quiet equates in being able to carry on in life, best represented by the restaurant offering food, or 'life' - indeed salvation. The alternative is the sex shop across the road, the option to quash one's guilt about what happened at the mansion and spill the beans on what he saw and was told would happen. We are led that the repercussions, however, would equate in pain for William and his family; possibly even death.<br/><br/>In one sequence lasting about fifteen seconds but running on some previous material, the film manages to touch on ideas of guilt and sex as a weapon or as a piece of blackmail whilst incorporating a certain sense of horror and adding to what was, up to this point, feeling like a suburban drama of some description. The brief shift in mood has us momentarily frightened, that a force we were not expecting in this 'type' of film does indeed exist, and possesses an ability to harm. Kubrick's final film, 1999's Eyes Wide Shut, seems to be a mediation on sexuality and the urge to further sexual ventures. Like Polanski's Bitter Moon before it, the film is about a male lead attempting to further his sexual horizons; with the hitch that he is running on ego and lust more-so a slower and more natural sensation which demands he should try new things in his own time.<br/><br/>William has a wife named Alice (Kidman), and they have one very young daughter. They dress extravagantly, play classical music as they get ready for nights out and they attend functions that embrace public holidays and display works of art, all in the metropolis that is New York City. I'm not sure if saying that the film ""isn't really about them as a couple"" is entirely correct, although you will not come away from the film with the nourishing sense of accomplishment born out of their relationship-come-marriage. Essentially, the film is a circular journey for Bill; beginning and immediately ending with head on and frank interaction with his wife. More-so for me, the film is purely about the male, in this case the husband, Bill. The spark that lights his fuse and refrains it from burning out is talk with Alice about how she once felt for a Naval officer many years ago, something that is intensified when his conflicting feelings clash following a call-out to a patients house. Prior to hearing Alice's story, Bill actively flirts with two young models at the function whereas at the home of a woman's dead father, post-conversation, Bill talks and interacts with said woman but turns down any advances.<br/><br/>For all the shops selling lingerie; the naked lead characters and for all the nudity and fetishistic animal masks that come with that particular segment, the film is exceedingly un-erotic or 'un-titalating'. Why? Because there is a certain danger linked to these things: the already established sex shop is iconographically on one 'side' of the road in which the lead could cross, but it would spell disaster; the naked women lying motionless in a recreational room is there because of a drug overdose while the outrageous sequence of several naked bodies wandering around a large house and having intercourse over a soundtrack of odd chanting instills fear more than anything else born out of the fact that we, the lead character, should not be there – and are in grave danger.<br/><br/>Bill's further descent is emphasised when a group of young men call into question his sexuality, accusing him of looking like a homosexual and when his stumbling into a jazz club and an interaction with a musician he's known of for years going back to medical school prods things along, there's no going back upon hearing of a strange place in which strange goings on occur. The film works well and stands up to Kubrick's prior work, with the entire de-robing sequence being able to be placed on that mantle with any other 'out there' sequence from Kubrick's work: scenes such as Slim Pickens' riding of the atomic bomb and the visionary sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey as the lead journeys to where only very few, if any, have ever been before.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is an accomplished film; a piece that carries dramatic weight and retains its focus and guile. The film is frightening, but it is the nature of human beings that scares us the most in the picture; and those with such carefree attitudes to sexual goings on around them: the owner of a clothes shop regarding what he can do with his daughter and a certain Victor Ziegler (Pollack), who knows why naked women got to be how they are at his place but shows no real compassion to them: they are to be used and disregarded if they step out of line. This was certainly no shameful departure for Kubrick."

I've only seen 4 of his films (2001, Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket and this) and I think that FMJ is still his best film, but this is still worth seeing.<br/><br/>
Doctor William Harford (Tom Cruise) becomes obsessed with having a sexual encounter after his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) admits to having sexual fantasies about a man she met and chastising William for dishonesty in not admitting to his own fantasies.

Even a man they knew well was involved. They kind of state the obvious in the dialog often, but it's forgivable. Some people think the whole thing was William's dream, but I think it was all real.

Things do not always move at a snappy pace and a few scenes could have been cut in half, but if you love the art of film and admire Kubrick in any way, you've got to appreciate what he was trying to do even if the outcome is not to your liking.

Not because this is the last production by  director Stanley Kubrick, but due to the fact that Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey)  really did a great motion picture. Eyes Wide Shut is a movie that explores the psychological roots of the human feelings, concerning a very delicate subject, which is the treason. The eroticism present in the movie is not gratuitous. There is a purpose to be there and the purpose is to make us think about many things that surround our lives: from the prostitute contaminated with AIDS to the man who uses his own daughter to gain money, the movie constantly gives us something to think about. And there is a lot of time to think since the movie is very long, sometimes tedious. But nothing that we can not tolerate. Moreover, Kubrick presents a natural vision from one of the biggest myths of the human kind: the sex. In Eyes Wide Shut the sexuality is treated with extremely naturalness. <br/><br/>It seems that Kubrick's last piece of art have great chances to receive some nominations for the next Academy Awards and succeed in some categories: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman acted extremely well, so were the supporting performances, the art direction and costume design are superb, the soundtrack is excellent, collecting some great musics that fit perfectly in the screen, following the story according to the movie plot; not to mention, of course, the direction.

It does not give all the answers, which I really like, and leaves space for some fantasy, which is what the film is really about.<br/><br/>The story does not want to be true nor event realistic. Journey in the mind of a man:  one night he sees and witnesses different things, the morning after it seems that the photographs of all the places and situations have turned negative and reveal an new reality.<br/><br/>The idea of death dominates the whole film, love, sex and jealousy are perceived as ways to be reassured that we are not dead. This is his obsession. You can see it because he seems to keep passive, just watching what is happening. At the beginning, he comes close to seeing Amanda (the party girl) dying, then he is called because one of his patient is dead, whose daughter seems to obsessively desire him. He gives up with the idea of having sex with Domino (the street prostitute) and the day after he finds out she was HIV positive. He meets again Amanda, at the morgue this time.<br/><br/>I personally think that close to the end, when he finds his wife asleep close to the mask he was wearing on his pillow, he pictures the representation of his own death, and this is what makes him cry, nothing else.<br/><br/>Obsessive score,but it has to be, they are obsessive ideas. Some scenes are a too long, but it is worth seeing a second time to pick more subtleties I presume.<br/><br/>This film does not show any splattered blood, dismembered nor disembowelled body, no brain material, no murder, no violence, no situation that could trigger first degree nightmare, sex only between consenting adults. In other words, lots of space for censure. Still, in our society that tolerates depiction of 1001 different ways of killing someone, the noise and fuss made about one or two representations of ways of making love and maybe creating life is understandable.<br/><br/>Understandable, maybe, sensible, certainly not."

","Perhaps his best, undeniably his bleakest, Eyes Wide Shut provides us with the most depraved view of the human condition we've bore witness to in a Kubrick film. <br/><br/>Beyond the engaging storyline, lush cinematography and flawless performances, Kubrick's view of human depravity manifests itself not on the fields (or training grounds) of war, nor in government facilities, nor in space, but in the apartments and homes of New York's millionaires, billionaires and prostitutes. In this veritable horror film, there are neither characters who find redemption nor those who escape their own predicaments unpunished.<br/><br/>Sidney Pollack, whose drooglike visage hovering over the unconscious prostitute during an overdose, a foreshadowing of some real nastiness, shows us that wealth and evil do compliment each other quite nicely. A woman who lunges at Cruise's Dr. Harford exclaiming ""I love you!"" while her father's corpse lies behind them and her fiancee enters the apartment, pales in comparison to the likeable prostitute who contracts HIV.<br/><br/>Beyond its devastating cinematography and score, (I can only imagine the number of takes for this one) the masked-ball orgy sequence provides us with a new and undeniably disturbing understanding of the relationship between sex and power and violence.  Only in a world constructed by Kubrick could such scenery serve as backdrop to the doomed marriage reduced to one convincingly uttered word by Mrs. Kidman in the toy store during the final scene. Someone mentioned a bleakness comparable to Bergman's Wild Strawberries. I think this is worse. And better."

","Eyes Wide Shut  keeps you on your heels and demands your attention throughout the length (2 hours and 45 minutes) of the film.  The plot follows a simple concept: marriage and fidelity.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise and his real-life wife play a successful married couple that at first appearance has everything they could possibly desire.  However, under the surface the viewer finds it apparent that this couple is struggling with a marriage that seems to have lost its appeal.  Kidman demonstrates, in startling detail, that she is not perfect wife her husband envisions. With no more than words and insinuation she makes evident that adultery does not require the carnal act of sex, but it is legitimately possible to be unfaithful in mind alone.  Kidman's all-to-honest confession sends Dr. Billy (Cruise) for ride that begins with simple introspection and leads him to the veritable edge.  Our hero, Cruise, becomes involved in an elaborate game of vindication through adultery and deception, and sends our hero to the brink and back.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is visually stunning and it's obvious that Kubrick poured his soul into his final film.  He is a master of leading the viewer through an intricate look into our collective humanity.  You find yourself feeling the pain and paranoia of his characters, and you will question if what you are watching is real or if its is imagined.  Crammed with irony, the story is as abstract as it is simple.  In all, you will enjoy the movie long after you leave the theater."

Fidelio is about a woman who dresses as a man and enters into the service of an evil Don to find and free her husband, who had been imprisoned for resisting the tyrant's evil ways.  In EWS, the husband enters the castle seeking to join (not resist) in the evil Don's adventures.

"graciaaaaa","9","1","1","17 April 2020"," On Kubrick's couch
","""Eyes Wide Shut"". What a brilliant engagement in the subject, not giving me the occasion to hesitate on a wasted Monday. Finally, I let myself plunge into Kubrick's legacy.<br/><br/>One thing that took all of my admiration was the lucidity in his definition of fantasm.
The story is simple: a dull couple is tortured by the sudden appearance of fantasm in their marriage. On one side, Bill, an ordinary American, wanders around New York, looking for sexual eccentricities. On the other, Alice, slowly deserts her married life for passionate oneiric meetings with the master of her heart.<br/><br/>However, their fantasies turn out to be too high (or too far somewhere), in reality Bill and Alice always found themselves rejected by their desires (Bill face death every time he gets near to his sexual ambitions and Alice's sweet dreams are in fact nightmares). Kubrick demonstrates the state of dissatisfaction inherent in sex when it's imagined, when the fantasy expresses deeper repressed desires or scars (Alice's self esteem for exemple). This way of Kubrick to travel between the layers of reality or the mind, on screen, made the experience remarkably terrifying. Watching ""Eyes Wide Shut"" isn't only entertainment, it's taking part to some kind of cinematic reflection on perception (hence the oximoron wide/shut about vision in the title).<br/><br/>In fact, what I also found astonishing in the movie was the thriller form (heavy silences, melodic rhythms, a dark gothic setting of NY) that was very well handled. Indeed, fear (rather than sympathy) accompanied the plot in a way that unveiled the purposes or spirit of the film. The thriller setting almost becomes a story by itself, along to the main subject (which is fantasy), for them to collide and produce reactions within the viewers or the characters (notice the reversal provoked by the mask lying on the marital bed). The movie is incisive, from stage to audience.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"", a beautiful and living analysis of psychosexuality. Anything as predictable as taking us into the heads of characters, but the mixture of elements fitting together and Kubrick's genius = grotesque, occultism, libertinism, death, denunciation, mystery, depression, love, desire, jealousy, dream, marriage, and anything else you notice. Us, viewers are the last element of the experiment. Our eye-opening journey innocently starts with the title, ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and involves us in an adventure full of discernment."

"ups-36964","8","1","1","9 January 2020"," Most underrated Kubrick film
","Although the title is ""Eyes wide shut"", when watching this film, you have to keep your eyes wide open. This film is base on the novella (Traumnovelle) (Dream Story), written by Arthur Schnitzler, who Freud claimed had such an intimate affinity with. Kubrick had spent decades of time adapted the novella to the motion picture. With joint effort of two greatest minds, the film is among the most profound ones, so that requires great effort to interpret. In the very beginning of the film, Bill walked from the living room, through the bedroom, towards bathroom. This move provides us a clear establishment inside this New York couple's house. The view is clearly described by Tim Kreider as, ""The paintings that cover the Harfords' walls from floor to ceiling (painted by Kubrick's wife Christiane) almost all depict flowers or food, making explicit the function of art in their environment as mere decor-art for consumption."" Then followed, Alice, who just finished using the bathroom stand up, made her first frontal appearance. This obvious continuity between the paintings and Alice, combining the starting scene which displayed her naked back, implied that our main female character was also an art work that the main male character had collected. When Alice asked Bill why he wasn't jealous, the answer Bill gave is ""Because you are my wife and the mother of my child."" What he had in mind was that Alice was something he owned rather than the person he shared a life with. Alice talked about her fantasy to Bill that she was ready to give up every thing, including her family and her child just because of the glance of the naval officer. She was saying that in order to protest the Bill's ownership. This revealed more of the submissive position where Alice stood --- Always leading by the male. Her appearance was always associated with the mirror. As analysis in Lacan's theory:""The mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential libidinal relationship with the body image"" Alice constantly behavior of checking the mirror indicates of her loss of self-identification. She was familiar with being a wife and a mother---the ego characteristics required by the society. Alice looked like a serious person, wearing glasses, hardly smile. Not until she was on alcohol, pot or during dreaming, did the relax expression appeared on her face. From this we would know she repressed lots of her own desires, hide the tension, the anxiety deep down, so as to meet the demand of her husband and the society. However, when she was unconscious, she couldn't control of the desires and just let it out. The night, Bill came home from the orgy party, found her giggling during her sleep. But when woke up, she look very terrified. The transition from sleep to awaken is analog with the transition form unconscious to conscious. The four step of dream interpretation ""secondary revision"" could be applied to the dramatic attitude changing from being satisfied to being terrified. She feels guilty about dream cheating of her husband so she forced herself as remembering the dream as a horrific nightmare.<br/><br/>Bill maintained his dominant poison, identified himself as the role of the saver, using money to control people such as costume shop owner, the taxi driver and ultimately since he was the only financial support of the family, using money to control Alice. When he wanted to do something that considered as immoral or transgression, he start to searching through the unconscious to find the excuses to keep him away from being guilty. The fantasies of his wife making love with the naval officer occurring three times, each followed by the action of searching other women to fulfill his sexual needs, hooking up with the prostitute, calling his late patient's daughter who expressed her desires for him before and going to the orgy party. He needed the reason for the self gratification. And the idea of revenge to his wife's fantasized infidelity severed him well. From this we can indicate that Bill indeed is a very hypocritical person. He spared no effort finding ways to satisfy his id desires while his wife Alice tried really hard to repress it. I think the scene which he found that the mask lying on his pillow implied that he, not his wife, is the person who cheated and disguised as an honest man. Every detail in this film is carefully designed. The name of prostitute the ""domino"" is actually a kind of mask, which predicted the following masque in held in the Somerton. The password of the party is ""Fidelio"", which was the Italian for faithful. It's severs as an irony because using such word as engaging into an orgy. Also, Fidelio is Beethoven' opera telling the story of how a wife risked her life to save her husband in prison from death. It predicted the result that in the end Mandy sacrificed herself to protect Bill's life. It also was using stairs as a metaphor for social class and the dirt inside the upper ones. The higher you climb, the more bodies you might discovered in their closets. Just as the saying goes: ""There is nothing accidental in Kubrick's film."" Because of the films contains numerous hidden meanings and great complexity. People who watch the film at the first time often found it very confusing. Also, during the promotion, it marketed as an erotic thriller, therefore, for people who just want to watch celebrities couple having hot steamy sex on screen would be really disappointed. It's much more sophisticated and you would notice something new when you watch it again and again.
Overall, it isn't a mainstream movie so some of you may not enjoy it. But real cinema fans will definitely like it. It has a very deep message though"
"thomaspaton-98923","4","1","1","8 September 2019"," Very Conflicted
","Kubrick's final cinematic offering is very powerful and intriguing... but a huge disappointment for me personally. Eyes Wide Shut is an intense and steamy chronicle of deception, marriage, and human desire. Eyes Wide Shut is a highly pretentious, morally ambiguous, and an unusually graphic melodrama masquerading as high-art. With grand and intricate architecture, a moody musical score, a lot of slow talking, and purposefully graphic imagery... are all things that took away from this movie being great. The dialogue was well written, but the line-delivery was weak and every sequence was at least twenty minutes too long. This movie was high on my radar list for years... I waited until I felt like I was ready... and I wasn't. Either I wasn't ready (which I'm fine with admitting), or this film is simply a melodramatic bore trying to be something that it's not. The camerawork, the director, and the cast are really the only things this movie has going for it. Without those things, this movie would have been truly awful. I looked deeper into the ideas and themes... thought it was purposefully and forcefully symbolic and painfully pretentious/self-indulgent. I tried seeing the directors vision, somewhat understood it? But was still let down, confused, and very conflicted. Stanley Kubrick didn't have to show such extremely over-acted and steamy love scenes, disturbing sexual content, and an unsettling/moody atmosphere to get his point across... that is, if he had a point. Kubrick is still my all-time favourite director... but this film, this film was a mess."
"rahulrajchukkath","9","1","1","3 September 2019"," Most Underrated Film of Kubrick?
","Kubrick left leaving everything what he had acquired here. 400 days of Eyes Wide Shut made it a masterpiece of Kubrick which we should rank aside with 2001, shining etc. A hypnotic and dreamy narration adds crisp long shots and dedicated music with brilliant acting are more than enough to immerse into this classic.<br/><br/>Sexually explicit scenes might be the reason which made people conclude this is an erotic film which exactly isn't. While erotica barely an essence of the plot, there is more intricate paradox of commitment the film deals with. Conflict starts from an argument of Bill and Alice revealing their misconceptions on marriage making an epiphany both to us and the leads. Then begins the dreamy travel through the city which ends up in a more eerie atmosphere of a ritual orgy. Eventually leads us to a realisation how much layered its plot is. The very climax scenes unfolds before us, both dream and truth are mutually upside-down.<br/><br/>Along with the master cinematography, Jocelyn Pook's hand-picked music scores adds to the complexity and the mystery. A noteworthy Tamil song with a Carnatic music intensify the extremity of strangeness of the orgy scene. Also, happy hear that in a film like this. I do notice how gorgeous Tom Cruise as well as Kidman as the film demands the necessity of their beauty.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut easily becomes my second favorite Kubrick film after The Shining."
"nikxatz","8","1","1","10 August 2019"," Kubrick's swan song is about human desires and sex- I'm obsessed
","""Eyes Wide Shut"" is Kubrick's last film and the conclusion to my summer Kubrick Marathon. During those days, that the honour to watch these weird and effective stories come alive from maybe the most influensial director of all time and one of my favorites for sure. Eyes Wide Shut is a weird experience and it differs from any other Kubric film. It is a film which can be seen from many angles and in order to be fully understood and appreciated, it has to be viewed multiple times.<br/><br/>In the film, Kubrick grows deep into our very own human desires for sex, truth, connection, consumerism and creates a ""universe"" where everything is shiny and we get to take a look to how consumerism and money have changed the world and everyone has become more or less a being that gives full attention to what people think about them and how they look. As I see it, the couple of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman can be seen a mirror to the society that Kubric wants to portray during the whole film. The husband eagerly consumes without giving a second thought, tries to meet new women and engage with them, he cannot stop trying to achieve his sexual goals and money and generally his whole economical and social state is a ticket for completing his desires. Notice that his first line in the film has to do with his wallet or that he does not hesitate to give money even if he does not need do. His consuming nature and desire for more and more are viewed by his long walks from place to place and his whole obsession with that orgy mask party. He goes to gritty extremes and I love those scenes which purely reveal his obsessive nature. Cruise is a blast and let's not forget that 1999 was a blast for him, because he was exceptional is Magnolia too.<br/><br/>The wife is more of a self-lover, a narcissist. She hold the title ""of a beautiful lady"" and we can see that see always car about her looks and likes it when people call her pretty with flattering words. One of the shots that reveal her nature Is the shot where the couple kisses in front of the mirror naked and the wife looks at her self while she is passionately kissed by her husband. She is also haunted by her dreams of another handsome man having sex with her and the idea of cheat poisons her souls but she actually cannot let it go. The dreams reveal her deep desires for another more free love, an affair out of all this and her inability to escape all this devastates her.<br/><br/>And dreams do play a really important role in this film. I think that in the end this film has an uncertainness to it. A lot of objects and scenes give you the impression that they might be a complete lie, something fake. We are not sure if the crazy and alienating elements are a matter of imagination or a symbolism or even real. Therefore, the film has a dream-like atmosphere.<br/><br/>
Kubrick's direction and the style definitely boost this fantasy element. Most of the scenes use colorful lightbulbs hanged in every room and street to provoke that tone (anyways, it is set during Christmas). The slow move of the camera during the walks of Tom Cruise in the night, the blues and reds, the clever choices of switching between steady and shaky cam, the dream sequences...<br/><br/>The technical aspects are great, like every other Kubrick film, though some sequences, especially during the 2nd half feel kind of weirdly shot and this is probably because Kubric's sad loss during the shooting. Leon Vitali, Stanley's loyal sidekick handled the shootings till the end and finished the film, but I think that some sequences felt more of Hitchcock or PTA than actual Kubric. That made the film kind of messy and less captivating<br/><br/>And this is m main bug too. It is not that I hated anything in the film, it is a really interesting film and you can make a lot out of it, but I felt kind of bored and uninterested during some parts , like it lacked a true consistency and core.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is pretty good. Its cinematography, camera and soundtrack are perfect. Great performances. The script is a different thing compared to Kubrick's previous films and I liked that Stanley wanted to talk about humans and the society by using a single couple with a weird relationship. It is about desires, deceit, love, lies and truth, identity and it hinges on the consumeristic and ""oriented-by the-looks"" society that we are living in. As a fact, I feel that it is a film that I prefer thinking than watching, at least for now. But anyways...every Kubrick film demands multiple watches.<br/><br/>I also want to add that I felt that the story might be a huge reference to Adam and Eve? A man and a woman naked succumbing into cheating and sinnery??? Well that's a bingo. And I appreciate that Kubrick movies are so open to theories and analysis<br/><br/>Kubrick is and will always be one of the most creative and genius filmmakers of all time. His films are crazy and unique and mad and funny and colorful and cool and meaningful and true and ""Eyes Wide Shut is no exception.<br/><br/>And I love him<br/><br/>And you know, there is something important that you need to do as soon as possible...<br/><br/>What's that?<br/><br/>Watch this film (or rewatch it )"

","Stanley Kubrick's final film is haunting, eerie and deeply layered- as all of his films were. Upon its release the film was causticize in various corners- some for its adult content and others for its lack of sexuality (Kubrick's films often polarized everyone). The film is loosely based on Traumnauvelle which is an Austrian book. It concerns a wealthy affluent couple and bizarre occurrences that befall our main lead- the doctor Dr. Bill Hardford(Tom Cruise). Highly atmospheric and well shot with a strange almost hypnotic pacing Eyes Wide Shut's reputation has improved greatly with age (again- such is the case with many of Kubrick's films). The film can be and should be viewed many times to get an understanding of all the nuances and hidden messages or themes.

It's a pretty movie in-general, the colors and lights have these blurs and mixes of colors. The angles also make the scene more beautiful to look at. Everything else is done well, however there is one problem. The time in this world is really unrealistic, and I don't know if that's intentional or not. Either way, it brings down the film.

","Unexpected mystery movie with great cast. I didn't read anything about the movie so I was surprised of the way it went. Not usual look at life.

"lewismart","10","1","1","5 September 2018"," A absolutely cinematic masterpiece
","I have always absolutely loved this film. The cinematography is gorgeous, the score is amazing. This has one of my favourite scores of any movie. The acting in this film is stellar. Tom cruise and Nicole Kidman put on great performances. <br/><br/>The trailers to this film slightly confuses me because it makes it look like a straight up erotic thriller, however in my opinion, this is way more of a drama but has some dark and sinister moments. The sex scenes in this film are not meant to be stimulating. The sex scenes always have an eerie and creepy feel and look to them. There's also not too many sex scenes, of course apart from the mass orgy scene in the middle of the film but otherwise it's not too bad. But the whole film does have a main theme of sex throughout even tho ,apart from a few scenes, not a lot of sex scenes are shown.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of people complaining that the ending isn't very climatic. That you don't find out who the association are and there's no climatic thrill moment at the end. However I appreciate this. It makes the group more sinister and mystifying. Another reason why I like that it doesn't delve too much into who they are because it would take away from the fact that the film is about Kidman's character and Cruises characters sexual desires and frustrations and it'll become something else. <br/><br/>Overall this is personally my favourite Kubrick film. I'm not saying it's the best but it's my personal favourite. I adore the films eeire and sinister feel throughout the whole film, even at a long time length, the movie doesn't drag and flows amazingly."

","It was Stanley Kubrick's final film.. and what a film it was. The Kubrick filmography after 2001: A Space Odyssey was big budgeted, highly conceived and highly anticipated event pictures. Eyes Wide Shut was given none of the pomp and circumstance in it's marketing campaign and neither was there any in the production phase. If anything, Eyes Wide Shut is a bookend to Kubrick's beautiful cinematic journey. It's a throwback, in many aspects, to the Film Noir wave of the 1950's, of which Kubrick made his name being apart of. In the genres of romance, mystery and suspense, Eyes Wide Shut remains to be one of the greatest films of it's kind ever made.<br/><br/>But why? Simply, it's about the minimalism. It's actors are tabloid hollywood caliber, it's sets and locations are based in the everyday and yet Eyes Wide Shut is hauntingly extraordinary. In short, it's dreamlike. The way Kubrick tackles sexual paranoia cuts to core of what every man and woman fears when they are in a monogamous relationship. Kubrick illustrates these fears through the metaphor of the sex cult that Tom Cruise's character visits. Of course, that scene has become famous in it's grandiose imagination and unforgettable mis-en-scene. But the sex cult was never intended to be taken at face value. In fact, many viewers mistakenly assumed that that was what the entire film was centered on. In reality, the cult was just one of the many sexual tests that Cruise is forced to take.<br/><br/>Cruise, over the course of the picture is put though a gauntlet of sexual temptation. For instance, visiting the house of the NYC prostitute, or the scene of the emotionally wrought, sexually starving widow of a dead patient. One of the most striking tests for me was the scene in which Cruise buys the costume from Rainbow Fashions, only to discover that the owner has a nymphomaniac of a daughter who he catches with a duo of Asian businessmen. She looks on at Cruise, with a flirtatious grin, telling him without saying a word, that he can have her anytime he wants. Kubrick explores sexual temptations from the covert to the overt and psychotically, the audience is challenged as well. How much would you get away with without your wife or husband knowing? On top of that, Kubrick asks an even scarier question. Are monogamous relationships a sham? Are we all just sexual creatures waiting for the next person to mate with? Nicole Kidman's monologue on her desire to cheat on her own husband is forever chilling. Kubrick, by no uncertain terms wants us to know that women can be just as sexually repressed, and potentially, just as unfaithful if they ever wanted to be.<br/><br/>I'll never forget the experience of watching Eyes Wide Shut, and neither will anyone else who watches it. It's the definitive swan song of the career of a man changed cinema as we knew it."

Thus begins a very long and terrifying night of exoticism in its darkest form. Hauntingly tense unable to see the horror that looms ahead when Cruise discovers that asking too many questions is fatal.

","****SPOILERS****Stanley Kubrick's last film that he delivered the rough cut to Warner Brothers studios a week before he suddenly passed away at age 70 is filled with innuendos about secret societies that control or are controlled by those in power who really run things in the world at large. This strange world of power and control is discovered almost by accident by young doctor William Hartford, Tom Cruise, who after his wife Alice, Nicole Kidman, confessed to him in having an affair with a handsome US naval officer, who ends up doing a series of naval maneuvers on her, the year before while on vacation at Cape Cod. William who feels that he's been cheated on by his wife now wants to have a good time of his own by going out at night to the city's red light district and pick up hookers and get even with Alice for what she did to him.<br/><br/>With the help of his friend pianist Nick Nightingale,Todd Field, William now looking for bigger kicks and thrills then a one night stand with a hooker that are places where the kicks or fun is both hot & heavy that are far more interesting as well as exciting if he's got the balls to go to and experience them. William soon gets himself invited to this costume party in the suburbs where he's told, by Nightingale, that everyone there lets it all hang out and does their thing without any interruption from the outside world. As things soon turn out it becomes apparent to the very naive William Hartford that he's way over his head with the people he's involved in and the things he sees, if reviled, may well end up having him and his family members murdered. In fact one of the masked women at the party who tried to get him to leave later ended up dead from a drug overdose.<br/><br/>The film has William slowly realize that things aren't what he thinks that they are with those whom he associates and parties with like some of his friends on the outside world. It's William's good friend jet set billionaire party thrower Victor Ziegler, Sydney Pollack, who later fills in the gaps to the persons and events that William got involved with at the costume party. William earlier had saved Sydney's a** by getting a young woman who overdosed on drugs in Victor's pad emergency treatment in order to keep Victor's both name out of the papers as well as a** from ending up behind bars. It was Victor's intervention that in fact prevented the members of the secret society that William spied on from doing both him and his wife Alice in.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS**** In the final moments of the movie it's William, who's been going through hell for what he saw and experienced, who ends up in a state of shock in him finding out that it was his wife Alice whom he tried to get revenge on, for cheating on him, who was behind this entire scam. Broken and defeated, in seeing that he's not in charge of his life, William now meekly goes along with his wife's wishes to forget about the past and just go on with their lives as if nothing happened. Interesting but uneven film about those who really control things in the world of finance and politics as well as our individual lives. With the sad fact that it's director Stanley Kubrick didn't live long enough to edit and release his director's cut, like he did in almost all of his movies, of the film that would have smoothed things out and explained its many rough and uneven edges."

"MF210","9","1","1","11 September 2011"," One of those films that improves on repeated viewings
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.<br/><br/>Back in 1999, Eyes Wide Shut was one of the most anticipated films of the year, only the Phantom Menace was more anticipated. Being Stanley Kubrick's final film and starring then married couple Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman, there was good reason for it to be so anticipated. Critical reception was positive but underwhelming, critics mostly admired the film but few called it a masterpiece. Audience response was mixed to negative, Eyes Wide Shut was a modest box office success based solely on it's two stars. <br/><br/>The opinion of some of Kubrick's films have changed drastically over the years. 2001 and The Shining received mixed to negative responses when they first debuted, now both are viewed as seminal masterpieces in their genre. It'll be interesting how Eyes Wide Shut is viewed in another ten years, I'm not so sure how it's overall legacy has changed much in the twelve years since it debuted. <br/><br/>My opinion of Eyes Wide Shut on the first viewing was that it was an interesting failure. It had some memorable scenes and images but I just didn't see the point in the film. For the most part, it seemed like Kubrick was going through the motions and it was an underwhelming way to end a brilliant career. <br/><br/>To say my opinion has changed is an understatement. While I would not call Eyes Wide Shut a masterpiece, I will say it is a very worthy addition to Stanley Kubrick's oeuvre and a fitting conclusion to his career. When I watch it now I see a film with some very memorable scenes and rich images, but also a fascinating look at jealousy and sexual temptation. What wasn't apparent to me on the first viewing has become so on repeated ones. The gratuitous sex doesn't seem pointless anymore, it's there for a reason. Give Kubrick credit for making sex seem so unappealing and mechanical, he's making a statement about the human condition. Sex isn't about love in EWS, very little of the sex is an act of love here, it's about filling urges and temptations. <br/><br/>EWS has the same striking visual style as previous Kubrick films. The film has a dream-like atmosphere, which has lead some people to believe that much of what is transpiring on the screen is a dream through Tom Cruise's character. The most memorable scene is the sexual orgy, it's very Gothic with the black cloaks and the masks worn by the characters. This scene ranks up there with the most memorable imagery in Kubrick's films. Another memorable scene is Tom Cruise's character being stalked through the streets of New York. <br/><br/>On the first viewing, I was not crazy about Tom Cruise's performance, I would've described it as ""wooden."" While I don't view it as great work and there are few instances where the performance falls flat, I think it is a generally solid performance. Nicole Kidman, though she has lesser screen time, is consistently excellent, taking attention away from Cruise every time they're on screen together. <br/><br/>EWS is a complex film that's difficult to describe and hard to take in on a single viewing. This film needs to be watched more than once to be appreciated. Perhaps it's not for everyone, which describes most of Kubrick's films, but for the adventurous film watcher, EWS is a worthy film."
"sammyfatkitty","8","1","1","14 August 2011"," Eyes Wide Shut Review
","Eyes Wide Shut is a tense and creepy psycho-sexual thriller, that unfortunately is ultimately a disappointing experience. However, this is still a well acted and well directed film with a genuinely disturbing feel to it. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise), and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman), are members of New York City's upper circle high-class society. Their relationship is going strong, until Alice recalls an event that happened while the family was on vacation, in which she thought about having an affair with a naval officer. The idea that his wife even considered such a thing makes Bill jealous and angry, so he decides to take things one step further and sets out to have a real affair of his own. Nicole Kidman is as good as ever in this film, but unfortunately you don't see much of her, as the story is centered around Tom Cruise's character, his night long escapade, and the resulting events. Tom Cruise does a fine job of playing the obsessed and hurt husband, who has blown his wife's fantasy entirely out of proportion in his mind, making it something much more unforgivable than it really was. You really feel bad for him, especially since his wife has hurt him so badly, and no matter how much he wants to get back at her, he can't seem to bring himself to do it. The direction is also fantastic. Kubrick gives the movie a very creepy feel, especially during the intense middle section. The way the movie is shot is great, and the musical score really adds to the overall effect. While both the acting and the direction were very good as expected, this movie isn't a classic for me because of the ending. This story of revenge and emotional as well as sexual fulfillment is very fascinating and quite original. It also builds up a huge amount of tension. Unfortunately, with so much set up and so many directions in which the movie could go, the movie just sort of fell flat towards the climax. There was no great twist at the end, and the story didn't tie itself together in an exciting way. The creepy atmosphere and the sense of true danger that the movie had built up was completely forgotten within the last 15 minutes. I was expecting the couple to realize that they had both made mistakes and forgive each other, as they did, but I also expected something extremely intense to happen beforehand. Overall, this movie features good acting and exceptional direction, but unfortunately it's extremely slowly paced and the story falls completely flat by the end. It's hard to even call the end a ""climax"" because not much happens at all. However I can still recommend at least a few viewings of this film, if only for the incredibly intense first 2 hours."
"kindigth","Null","1","1","14 September 2010"," Eyes Wide Shut
","About twenty minutes into Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, I find a familiar question on my mind. It's a question I've pondered often, a question I find myself asking nearly every time I see Tom Cruise on film: namely, why is this guy in this movie? I'm not one of those people who hates Tom Cruise, I just think he's a pretty bad actor bless his heart. And he's laboriously clenching his face and waving his hands, and his wife Nicole Kidman is doing some equally ingratiating non-imitation of human behavior, and grand master Kubrick is standing behind the camera taking it all in in steady, sustained shots--what's going on here? Tom and Nicole are performing, but they're not acting.<br/><br/>Thus, Eyes Wide Shut sort of fails as an exploration of characters, but it finds an odd success as something else entirely: a study of icons. It is no accident, of course, that Kubrick's sex odyssey stars a then-high profile then-married Hollywood couple: ""Cruise Kidman Kubrick"" is the film's only tag line. And while I was never invested in Tom's Dr. Bill, I was fascinated to see Cruise himself deal with the pressure of society's hypocritical sexual demands. After all, we hold our icons to a strict standard of monogamy while simultaneously conditioning their continued celebrity on a preposterous hypersexuality; it's our ever- present threat of sexual judgment and ridicule that pushes Cruise's character into a freaky sex cult, and pushes Cruise into celebrity marriages and couch-hopping lunacy. I can't guess to what extent Cruise and Kidman are in on the film's central conceit, but it seems clear to me that Kubrick's aspirations lie outside of traditional character-based narrative cinema.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is no Strangelove or Clockwork or 2001, but it is an interesting deconstruction of celebrity. If Tom Cruise is strange, confused and detached, we're complicit in the societal sexual hypocrisy that makes him that way. -TK 9/14/10"
"Stampsfightclub","8","1","1","25 May 2009"," Kubrick rattles off another genre in close look upon sexual desire
","After his wife's confession of lust towards another man, Doctor Will Harford (Cruise) sets out on a voyage of sexual desires and adventures.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick had certainly made a name for himself over the past few decades, ticking off genres with some splendid direction and filming that rattled cages and drew hefty debates amongst many critiques. He mastered the horror with The Shining, the sci-fi with 2001 and many others right up until this, where he aimed to tick the romance genre off his list. Sadly the American died shortly after presenting this to the distributer and so 10 years on, it is comforting to know he achieved something remarkable in the genre.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is debated as one of Kubrick's worst pictures. From the upside down sequence in 2001 to the blood flowing elevator montage in The Shining, Kubrick was artistically driven, a perfectionist and this is, apparently, where he falls short in the 1999 release. There are no wondrous experimentations, minimal elaborate scene stealing montages or anything otherwise to suggest it is the same person who directed numerous Oscar nominated pictures. So this would presumably be the reason for the critical analysis, but the absence of the camera doesn't dissolve any promise or prospect from the film. Actually, the lack of sweeping scenes brings the film right down to earth.<br/><br/>The story is after all a love story, a mature look upon a married couples lives with the use of drugs, sex and parenting to bring a strong level of realistic lifestyle to the picture. The scripting therefore requires little elaboration. There are many consistent montages with the couple, the close up of Kidman's confession is well executed by the director and one fine scene appears when Cruise enters the burlesque house. The sweeping smart approach to the masked personas is very well handled and the sharp music helps generate a feeling of chills and intensity.<br/><br/>The whole sex concept is a highly interesting look upon human sexuality and desire, a depiction of lust, trust and intrigue. This is consistently debated throughout, and worth hanging on to right to the question raising climax.<br/><br/>The music score is not on the level of say 2001 but it fits the mood of the script nicely. The strong piano strikes may infuriate edgy viewers but do settle the story into a state of intensity and drama.<br/><br/>Cruise gives yet another strong performance as the likable Doctor but Kidman is so infuriatingly boring you may look away. The drug taking sequence is a brave attempt to spice her stereotype up, but is driven way out of proportion.<br/><br/>Like all Kubrick pictures, there is a great mystery to solve come the end of the film, and just like Kubrick, he has rattled off another genre with a fine justification of romance."
"rcastl2335","Null","1","1","21 March 2004"," Beautiful fable
","Eyes Wide Shut is a horribly underrated film for everyone involved in the film, particularly Kubrick. The film needs to be viewed as a gorgeously photographed fable, twice told. Twice told because the primary character played by Tom Cruise, goes on two journeys--one at night, one in the morning retracing those nightwalking steps. Twice told because the journey begins with Nicole Kidman's questions and ends with Sydney Pollack's answers. It's also a fable because of the beautiful, glowing surroundings, the surrealist characters (the costume shop owner and his daughter for example)whether masked or not,and the constantly hovering menace. The film features Kidman at her most luminous. It's also one of her first, best mature performances and can be seen as a precursor to her blossoming as an actress in The Hours and Cold Mountain. She has two particularly fine scenes, one at the beginning of the film where she wounds Cruise, and the final one in the department store, which ends the film with a tough, bitter kick. Cruise, too, is fine in a performance that is light years ahead of the phone-it-in commercial ones he usually gives. Sydney Pollack is simply extraordinary. There are some minor flaws, mostly in editing individual scenes for length, and had Kubrick lived long enough to do the final polish on the film it would be seen as a classic look at sex, trust and marriage. As it is now, it'll have to settle for near-classic."
"Geord","Null","1","1","7 September 2003"," Kubrick: ""The most difficult and challenging thing about directing a film is getting out of the car.""
","Spoilers.<br/><br/>Perhaps Kubrick doesn't deserve quite as much credit as some people give him. I think he was basically a translator. He never created. He would become intrigued by ideas and characters from great novels then use his expertise as a film-maker to share them with us. <br/><br/>Kubrick's greatest talent was in the editing and composition of his shots. This talent was fully developed by the time he made Dr. Strangelove' and was at its peak when he made Barry Lyndon.' I am convinced that by the time he made Full Metal Jacket,' Kubrick wasn't interested in trying to improve his abilities. He became lazy and merely relied on them.<br/><br/>I think Kubrick's tiredness as a film-maker is one of the things this film represents. It is a good film and it is unconventional enough to be distinctly his work. But what it lacks is the visual flare his other films have. It could be argued that this was deliberate, but I don't believe it was. The Stedicam work in the first scene is exceptionally well done and there are a few other shots in the film that are just as good. The visual look of the rest of the film is mediocre. <br/><br/>The two things in this film that are as good as his earlier work are the dialogue and the performances. Their work is very interesting. It is so interesting that one feels compelled to watch the film again and again, trying to make complete sense of it. The fascinating thing is that you never can. There is always something new to discover. This is what separates Kubrick's work from mainstream cinema. You never get bored.<br/><br/>
Despite this, there are a number of scenes that I think didn't work exactly the way Kubrick had intended. One of them is the scene where Alice tells Bill about the Naval officer. Perhaps the point of this scene is to illustrate that sexual desire can cause people to lose all self control. If this was in fact what was intended, then I think it is supposed to act as a shock that reawakens Bill's own desire to have sex with other women. He then begins the exploration of his own sexuality. This is a good idea in theory. The problem is that the scene is very weak, which doesn't give Bill's reaction much credibility, especially since Alice was stoned when she made the confession.<br/><br/>Another scene that I think doesn't work very well is Alice's explanation of her dream. I think you would have to rely too much on old-fashioned Freudian dream interpretation to find the true meaning of this scene.  One could be very astute and come up with several interpretations, but I think it stretched logic a bit, which again didn't give the scene much credibility.<br/><br/>
Excluding these two scenes, I would say that the film is very intriguing. It was interesting to watch a supposedly happy marriage being compromised by sexual fantasy, which is a subject not many films deal with. It is easy to understand why a man like Kubrick was interested in the material."

Actually I think that anyone who states that EWS is a bad movie knows nothing about filmmaking, and should stick with ""Independance day"", ""XXX"", or other stupidities. Gee, there's even this guy who writes "" it looks like a bad blow up from a 16mm print. The sets are pitiful, the lighting is horrid..""... I can't believe it. How people may get pretentious, when they obviously know nothing about what they're talking about. Brilliant cinematography has always been one of Kubrick's strengths, and it still is in EWS. If you think differently, you need an ophthalmologist.<br/><br/>2/Even considering the subtext and the metaphoric work of Kubrick, I still can't enjoy the movie despite its many strong features. I'm still convinced that casting Cruise was a mistake. The whole movie, and the whole story (would it be ""real"" or ""fantasmatic"") is experienced from Harford's point of view. He is immature and self-confident, and he faces events and characters that break his small world, and make him realize how weak he is, eventually leading him to total submission to his wife. He regresses to childhood by missing every opportunity offered to him to be an adult. But in the beginning of the film, we see rightaway that Dr. Harford is actually an adolescent. The character impersonated by Cruise is obviously immature, right from the start. This ruins the whole movie for me, as I'm surprised by none of Harford's reactions to the events.  This shallow character is too obvious, too caricatured, so the collision between his miserable personality and the weird oniric threatening world (real or not) he faces doesn't work for me. All I saw is... Tom cruise in a Kubrick movie!<br/><br/>3/ I'm quite shocked by highly snobbish comments I've read from self-infatuated people claiming that disliking EWS only shows one's inability to understand it. This statement is very suspect, who are those guys to claim they actually understood the movie, after all? They have their own idea (like I do) of what EWS means, doesn't mean it was Kubrick's purpose. Like with recent David Lynch movies, anyone saying that the purpose of EWS is ""obvious"" to ""intelligent"" people, and confusing only to ""unintelligent"" people, has his eyes wide shut like Dr. Harford. Their world is full of certitudes. Beware of the awakening...<br/><br/>I do agree with the idea that many didn't like EWS simply because they can't cope with artistic, challenging movies. But it's not my case (challenging directors as Lynch, Cronenberg, Tarkowski, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Jodorowski and the like - and Kubrick, of course- have a very good place in my collection), though after having played EWS 11 times, I'm still NOT convinced. I'd love to.<br/><br/>To all of you who haven't seen this movie, go and see for yourself. After all, it's our beloved Kubrick's very last movie, and it still has many outstanding qualities to offer. Just don't expect too much."
"cascara","6","1","1","9 October 2002"," Good film, flawed script
","This is a perfect example of a great director who was not a writer, but whose ego was not capable of recognizing this fact; thus the interminable rewrites that exasperated the cast. This is a beautifully photographed and acted motion picture in service of a deeply flawed story. A good (not even great) screenwriter could have turned what is merely an interesting work by a great director into a film that truly showcased Kubrick's gifts and was worthy of being his final work. It's a pity."
"michael-95","Null","1","1","17 July 1999"," More movies should be made with this level of dedication
","Watching this film was like a throwback to another cinematic time, Kubrick's style is a joy to watch.  I found a few choppy transition scenes but the majority of the film was technically wonderful.  Cruise and Kidman put in top notch performances.  I was a bit disappointed by the omission of the 65 second orgy scene, I think the scene was central to plot and not gratuitous unnecessary sex.  They really should have left the scene intact and taken an NC-17, this wasn't a movie kids would generally appreciate."
"spoon-15","10","1","1","17 July 1999"," Each of Kubrick's films get better with each viewing and this is no exception
","Stanley Kubrick truly is a genius.  All of his movies have been extremely exciting and they only get better with each viewing.  Eyes Wide Shut is no exception to the master's work.  The only sad thing about this movie is that this is the last film he will ever make.  And what an ending it was. He shocked people with Clockwork Orange and frightened them with 2001 Space Odyssey and The Shining.  Eyes Wide Shut is not about sex, which is what the previews would have you believe, rather it is about paranoia.  The paranoia of trusting a spouse. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman both give performances of a lifetime.  Nicole finally gets the credit she deserves. Kubrick fans will not be disappointed by his final film. Kubrick's last film is not to be missed and only gets better with each viewing."
"~PL~","10","1","1","19 March 2000"," I can't believe it's not nominated for 1999's best film!
","Eyes Wide Shut was the last Kubrick masterpiece (his last film, in other words). We can say his carreer (and life) ended in a nice way (without being mean). This film is amazing, mysterious, very well acted and extremely well directed! I can't understand why it is not nominated for last year's best movie! I thought this one was better than American Beauty, which was my favorite of last year before seeing Eyes Wide Shut (but I didn't see Man On The Moon). I guess the Academy couldn't nominate it because it was ''too hot for Oscar''. This is not the best Kubrick film (with films like 2001:A Space Odyssey, Dr.Strangelove, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket and Clockwork Orange, it's pretty hard to do better than all of these!!!!!) but it worth watching! When I told people I wanted to see Eyes Wide shut, they said ''I wonder why!'' but they were wrong...when you watch this film, go further than watching the nudity and fast-forwarding the rest of the film...if you do so, you won't like the film. I am a big fan of Kubrick movies and I was very interested in the whole film. It was mysterious, the atmosphere was very enjoyable. Kubrick made a kind of mix of his films (Lolita, Clockwork Orange and even The Shining!!!). A must-see! the ending was like the ending of the other Kubrick films, surprising, intelligent and appropriate. I loved it. I give it 90%."
"droog1983","10","1","1","5 December 1999"," The best film of the year!
","As of December 5, 1999 Eyes Wide Shut is definitley the best film of the year.  Only three other films released this year have been close to it, Bringing out the Dead, The Insider, and American Beauty.<br/><br/>
One thing that makes me angry is when people say this film is about sex. This film is definitley not about sex.  Anyone who says that either didn't see the film, or didn't understand it.  The film may deal with sexual issues, but it is not about sex.  It is about jealousy, and sexual obsession.  It is about betrayal and trust.<br/><br/>Directed by Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest film makers ever, and starring Nicole Kidman (who should win an oscar for her portrayal) and Tom Cruise (who deserves the very least a  nomination).  Stanley Kubrick puts us on the streets of New York after hours.  We follow Cruise's character (Bill) on the streets as he is tempted and lured into a sexual world, but will Bill do it, or does he have enough faith?  This is not Kubrick's best film, but one of his finest, and definitley one of the top 10 films of the 90's.  I feel it may get cheated during Oscar time, but the movie will always stay high in my heart.<br/><br/>God bless Stanley Kubrick.  He was truly a magnificent man.  I never met the man in my whole life, but in my short 16 year old life so far he is the closest person to me who has ever died.  And I have to say, I had a tear in my eye when I heard he past away.  So please, viddy this film, you wont be dissapointed.<br/><br/>My rating: A+!"
"Ron Plasma","8","1","1","25 October 1999"," It came. We saw. But did it conquer?
","There is no doubt in my mind that Eyes Wide Shut is a master work.  It's a feel isn't it?  Somehow you can sense that Nicole Kidman, a very beautiful woman, has been coached into the role of - a very beautiful woman.  But it's not the same beautiful woman.  What a clever trick!  The New York streets, (put together in Pinewood), are so New York that you expect Gene Kelly to splash about in their puddles.  Then there is the set that is a large number of the most perfect naked female bodies.  Phew!  That must have been CGI. It would upset the natural balance of the world if all that flawless flesh gathered in one room.  Omitting to do the faces was just a tease.  Oh, yeah.<br/><br/>And Tom Cruise was OK.  So.  Masterpiece?  Maybe.  It works for me."
"stanley-20","10","1","1","25 October 1999"," The best movie of the year.
","I don't know what everyone is saying about this movie,but this is simply the best movie of the year and one of the best of Kubrick's filmography.The script is excellent and Kubrick's direction is a lesson for every filmaker in hollywood and a movie that most would wish to make.I simply praise it."
"VinnieTheDog","Null","1","1","24 October 1999"," A Magnificent, Captivating Failure.
","I have to declare myself as a Kubrick disciple since I saw 2001 when I was 12. I actually burst out into tears in public when I heard he'd died. So I can say that I was almost too scared to see this movie in case it disappointed. As a piece of work it is utterly beguiling. From the opening frames he once again transports you into a world all of his own and which you seem to yearn to return to once released from it. That is what he did like no other filmmaker ever.<br/><br/>But is it a good film? I think that Stanley actually trod on a bit of a mine with this. Having made the definitive films dealing with many other genres, he had obviously brooded for 20 years on bringing that same dispassionate, yet disturbingly vibrant eye to sex. And I get the conclusion from this film that he is ultimately disallusioned with cornering his prey. Where war, space and psychopathy render huge revalations and insights by his 'freeze' treatment, I get the impression that the conclusion he comes to in the end, is that the subject matter is found wanting of drama. In short, that sex is ultimately boring.<br/><br/>I personally found this conclusion actually quite ironically humourous and therefore it didn't really ruin the film for me, but then I am a Kubrick nut!"
"S.F.1014","Null","1","1","24 October 1999"," The fall of a genius!
","I was hardly as disappointed as I was when I saw 'MATRIX' when I left 'EYES WIDE SHUT'. Nobody would have expected Cruise and Kidman to be able to perform their parts worth a Kubrick, but not even Kubrick is worth himself with this movie. I really had big problems not to fall asleep 'cause of the boring story, that contains too many pseudo-dramatic and pseudo-erotic scenes and shows an orgy that may perhaps cause a sensation in the USA, but in the rest of the world, people have been told the facts of life. After all it's simply too long. The only positive image that 'EYES WIDE SHUT' gave me was the music, that expressed the mysterious mood, the rest of the movie was meant to express.<br/><br/>=> Stanley Kubrick IS dead!"
"cliftor","Null","1","1","8 September 1999"," Unfairly maligned
","This film, while not one of Stanley Kubrick's masterpieces, is a very compelling work nonetheless and deserves better than the negative  buzz it's gotten from typical filmgoers, who expect movies with a standard linear plot and a theme (if there is one) wrapped up in a tight little bow.  It is a somewhat profound, always interesting study of the inherent sexual desires present beneath the surface in all of us and is made more effective by the remarkable one-key score.  However, unlike Kubrick's finer pictures, such as ""A Clockwork Orange"", this movie contains little subtext beneath it's main theme and it's effectiveness is hindered by it's need to give the story a definitive, happy ending when an ambiguous one consistent with the film's nightmarish feel would have been more appropriate.  If you want a truly awe-inspiring work, Kubrick left behind a whole challenging body to admire; if you just want ""Kubrick-lite"", this one is worth checking out.  But be warned-you will still be expected to use your brain."
"Bond-48","9","1","1","14 July 1999"," What a heavy movie!
","I saw this movie two days before its release at a pre-screening and it blew me away! This movie may have a lot of sex in it but there was a whole lot more to it. It's a  bit slow moving, but there is so much to think about after the movie is over. Tom Cruise did a great job acting, and so did his wife. One warning though, this movie is not for everyone!"
"Daniel-84","Null","1","1","14 July 1999"," Tom & Nicole are excellent
","This film is probably the best film of the 90's and definitely this year. With all the rubbish like Star Wars, The Mummy and Austin Powers, it is good to finally see a movie that moves you, that makes you think, that shocks you and leaves you breathless. Stanley Kubrick director of films like 'A Clockwork Orange' and '2001 - a space odyssey' has done a remarkable job with this movie. He moves the camera like nobody else. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman also throw in excellent performances as a troubled married couple. Metaphoric and unforgetteble, this is Kubricks best and last movie. And it is also the best movie you will see all year. Trust me."
"Don-102","10","1","1","20 July 1999"," 1999: A Sex Odyssey
","As long as you don't buy into the hype that surrounds pictures like EYES WIDE SHUT, you can watch without prejudice and assess what you are seeing more precisely.  Let me say that Stanley Kubrick's final film is a psychological and visual masterpiece.  The ridiculous media hype generated by the famed director's meticulous filmmaking methods and the film's allegedly ""pornographic"" style with stars such as Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman is flat out sad.  It is an extremely GOOD film with some truly GREAT moments.  Kubrick's swan song is his best work since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in 1971.<br/><br/>Short-attention span viewers beware:  Stay Away!  Go see ARLINGTON ROAD if you want generic, meaningless entertainment.  Smart, discerning moviegoers with an eye for art and unique cinema must, and probably will, see EYES WIDE SHUT.  This is an engaging and excrutiatingly candid look at sexual obsession and jealousy within a man's mind and heart.  Sex is what human beings, specifically males, think of most.  What an exploration into a few days in the life of a jealous husband who falls into some strange and disturbing sexual situations.<br/><br/>Is the film soft-core porn?  Absolutely not.  The sex scenes are very mild in accordance to what has been reported through both rumors and initial reviews.  Is the film about sex and only sex?  In a way, yes.  Sex involves passion and love, jealousy, and danger.  These 4 elements are tied together with such disturbing subtlety, quite frankly I was spellbound.  Sex also involves temptation and aftermath, which is also pertinent to the rather linear story.  Kubrick and company do not go over the top.  They merely present to us a dangerous nightmare maybe not entirely unlike the Kidman character's sexual dream and revelation.<br/><br/>EYES WIDE SHUT is long, but seems bitterly quick and I couldn't help but shake my head in amazement at the people who walked out on such a superlative piece of work.  This is not a commercial Cruise-Kidman film (thankfully).  Marketing has made it appear to be one.  It is a labor of love that will always be looked at through a microscope.<br/><br/>The performances are good and I think Kidman may be underused here.  There are some brief moments when the Cruise character reminds you of ""Mitch McDeere"" of THE FIRM  and will figure it all out, but Kubrick fans will know better.  The sinister two-note piano key played throughout the movie goes so well within the foreign New York atmosphere (it was all shot in England) and so many of the great director's trademarks emerge (a bathroom scene, steadicam shots, extraordinary set decoration, gloomy lighting).  The title is a nifty way of naming a film the TV networks would call ""The Misadventures of Dr. Bill"".  They truly are misadventures, but a motive is there.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and see Stanley Kubrick's farewell stamp to his legendary career.  It is by all means a thriller, with dark thoughts, sexual double-crossing, kinky parties, and all that Kubrickian stuff that never fails to leave you in awe.<br/><br/>RATING: ****"
"GrammarCub","9","1","1","16 July 1999"," Haunting, brilliant requiem by one of the masters
","I'm still in shock after seeing ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" a haunting masterpiece of a film written, directed, and produced by one of film's great artists, Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick died just five days after showing his film, suggested by Arthur Schnitzler's novel ""Traumnovelle,"" to Warner Bros. Thankfully, the studio has left most of Kubrick's vision intact, reportedly interfering with but a single scene. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is sexy, emotional, thrilling, and sickening - and brilliant. During the filming, which took over a year, the cast and crew were sworn to secrecy. Speculation and rumors ran wild about the husband-and-wife team of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman: would there be a steamy sex scene? Or, even more intriguing: would we see Tom naked? All anyone really knew was that this was a sexy thriller, a la ""Basic Instinct."" An early rumor I heard was that Kubrick decided to shoot a porno movie using well-known actors and a good script. Well, forget anything you may have heard before - you're in for a shock.<br/><br/>Put simply, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not really about sex. Not that it isn't erotic - nearly every scene is alive with sexual energy - but there's a bigger game at stake than just the one played horizontally. This is a film about power, and the loss of power that comes with sexual situations. Tom Cruise, who plays Dr. Bill Harford, is disturbed when his wife Alice (played beautifully by Nicole Kidman) confesses having sexual thoughts about another man. Perhaps part revenge, part curiosity, he sets out on an odyssey to be unfaithful - but somehow, never succeeds. One is reminded of those characters in Greek mythology who were given the impossible tasks in Hades; one had to fill up a bucket with no bottom, and one had to constantly push a rock uphill that would always roll back down to the bottom. Dr. Harford is a man without power who nevertheless requires it - in most situations, his credentials give him power, but he discovers there are certain people he cannot impress simply by flashing his board card.<br/><br/>One of these people is his wife - time and again, she takes the upper hand in their relationship. As Bill stumbles haplessly about New York, visions of Alice's infidelity flash through his mind. Much of his odyssey seems to stem from a ""This'll show her!"" mindset rather than the cool, rational façade he wants us to see. In fact, nearly all of Bill's actions seem impulsive - from his decision to visit a whore's bedroom to his chance meeting with an old friend at a piano bar to the drive to the infamous manor house where the film's climax occurs. Dr. Harford is unable to exude power here, in the company of an exclusive group of lechers and courtesans. He is seen instantly as an imposter, and the message is clear: Only the powerful need remain.<br/><br/>The specifics of the plot are not nearly as important as the film's ultimate message. Suffice to say, there is intrigue, murder, sex, drugs, and suspicion enough to keep even the most jaded moviegoer interested and guessing until the final scene. And, in keeping with the rest of the film, Cruise's character is not allowed to emerge victorious in the final reel - it is Alice who ultimately shows her strength and power, not Bill. ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" as its title may imply, is full of ironies both large and small: the main character is an anti-hero, his every success doomed from the opening credits; a hooker has sociology textbooks on view in her apartment; a junkie and whore sacrifices herself to save another. What makes this movie so intriguing is that every scene, every moment captured on film, is so carefully constructed that we get the feeling we are standing just behind Bill, observing his tragic fall and even being drawn down with him.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" is an outstanding film, one that will be surely recognized by the Academy Awards. I would be very surprised indeed if Kubrick were not nominated posthumously for Best Director. In addition, it is rare indeed for a major studio release starring big-name stars to be an art film - and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a work of art. Every light, every mask, every character - all come together in a stunning array of beauty, shock, and wisdom that makes me realize what a tragic loss Mr. Kubrick's death was. I've often said that Stanley Kubrick never made a bad film, and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is no exception. Disturbing, haunting, and shocking, it is also a beautiful, emotional, and masterful requiem by one of the great masters."
"Ms.Ennui","Null","1","1","17 July 1999"," Don't blame Kubrick
","Performers' importance varies from movie to movie.  Normally, I see them as window dressing--especially with actresses.  But with this particular movie, the actors are vital.  A major fault with the movie is Tom and Nicole's inability to be a convincing couple.  With EWS, Bill's not-so-wild escapades are supposed to be motivated by the infliction of jealousy by his wife and various sequences of events, but the relationship between Tom and Nicole made it impossibly silly to imagine how Alice could put Bill in such a state.  Flashing back to black and white soft core between Nicole and some naval officer isn't enough.  After all, there are tons of infidelities going around in today's society, and you don't see men crashing orgies for it, let alone crashing one just because of the idea of infidelity.<br/><br/>It wasn't the script's fault, though.  Kidman's lines emphasize her willingness to throw away a 9 year relationship for a fling as well as her inability to see her husband as a masculine and sexual being.  I believe that was suposed to be a significant point of revelation for Bill.  But there was nothing in Nicole's delivery of her lines to make me believe how dire and dreadful a point she was making, nor was there any good acting on Tom's part to make me believe that suddenly his whole concept of what kind of relationship he had (not to mention his concept of what a married couple is) suddenly shattered.  But if you listen to the lines carefully, you can see it's there.  Not just the lines, but the sequence of events that lead Cruise's character through his strange odyssey.  (Like the ridicule of Tom's sexuality by those boys who tell him to go back to San Francisco where he belongs.)<br/><br/>This was undoubtedly a terrific piece, and I'm not saying this to praise one of my favortie directors. Visually, it's gorgeous--very flawless.  There's a good sense of balance, too (except towards the end, maybe).  However, because of Tom and Nicole, I don't believe many people will realize how good it actually is.  Without knowing Bill's motivations the movie is pointless because like most Kubrick pieces the film isn't so much plot driven but character/psychology/action driven.  Try to ignore their performances and just listen to the words as written by Kubrick and pay attention to little details.  It'll make more sense that way.<br/><br/>It really is no wonder why Kubrick took so long with this film and had to call and recall Cruise and Kidman for so many reshoots."

","I cannot possibly sum up Eyes Wide Shut better than the quote from Time Magazine on the movie's commercial:<br/><br/>""Kubrick's haunting final masterpiece.""<br/><br/>Those four words say more than any other words possibly could.<br/><br/>""Kubrick's"" - Eyes Wide Shut is absolutely a Stanley Kubrick movie.  Every detail is beautiful, from the ear-piercing, rhythmic piano that gets your heart racing, to the beautiful visuals and colors that shift the mood of the story around only the way Kubrick can manage.<br/><br/>""haunting"" - The movie is creepy at best.  While it may begin almost like a cheap porno, there is a story building.  The casual nudity and numerous references to sex is what makes Eyes Wide Shut live.  The story is based on these elements rather than being encompassed by them.  The real story lies within the title.  The idea presented is that of reality vs dreams. Sometimes you can't tell which one is which, often leaving us with our ""eyes wide shut.""  This idea is what gives the movie its ""haunting"" feeling. When looking at a real situation and thinking it is almost dream like is as creepy as looking at a dream and believing it is real.<br/><br/>""final"" - This is the most unfortunate of the four words.  Stanley Kubrick has blessed us with many great films, Eyes Wide Shut being his last.<br/><br/>""masterpiece"" - Absolutely.  This is the only word in any language that can successfully describe Eyes Wide Shut.  Everyone gets something out of this movie.  However, there is no true way to describe it... it must be seen to truly understand.<br/><br/>So now after all of this, you may be wondering why I only gave it a 9/10 and not a 10?  Simple.  There is no such thing as a 10.  A 10 is a movie that holds the key to life itself or something equally important.<br/><br/>So there you have it.  My review of Eyes Wide Shut."

","I can understand how this is not a movie for everyone.  The slow pace and anti-climactic ending bother me, considering the tremendous combined talent that spend 18 months on this film. But I find it to be forgiveable, considering the many high points of this film.  The attention to minor details and characters made Dr. Bill's journey more intriguing.  Dr. Bill was painfully bland, sort of an everyman.  I too, was drawn in by that hooker with a heart of gold.  The scene where Dr. Bill is brought in to be questioned before the man in the red cloak at the orgy is chilling, no matter how many times I see it, as it is when he is getting stalked on the streets.  And the movie kept my interest, especially as Dr. Bill's actions the night before eat away at him as he searches for Nick and Mandy until he finally breaks down at home with his wife. And as always, the grand director has created a surreal and fascinating world in this film.  To me, that's what makes watching movies worth it. You get lost in it and in this case, it stays with you after it's over. Whether you've seen other Kubrick films or not I hope you can understand what he was trying to accomplish with this."

These two people live in a world that is not garaunteed to be real, and is often confusing and misleading.  Is it all just a dream?

The only plaudits were the ones I read from the normally whacked-out film critics, most of whom never want to admit ""they don't get it"" or love a certain director no matter what he puts on screen. Many times, such as in this movie, there is ""nothing to get."" This is nothing but a nice parade of boobs on display - and even that got boring soon - and a lot of pretentious ""art.""<br/><br/>Don't believe all those reviews that remark how ""thought--provoking"""" this movie is, etc, nor belittle yourself if you walked out of the theater and thought, ""huh?"" Consider yourself normal, honest human beings. Only the phonies, those pseudo-intellectuals, will blabber on and on about the merits of this film. It had no merit, cheapened sex in a big way, and was sad swan song for Kubrick."

","Want to state first that Kubrick actually is my favorite director and I put Clockwork Orange, Strangelove, and Lolita up there with the best, but I have to say EWS is one of the most boring, vacuous, silly and pretentious films I have ever seen. The stupid one note soundtrack is enough to give you a migraine and the dialogue is just pathetic. If you want to know how awful the script is just look at the ""quotes"" on the IMDb page and reflect on the fact that this crap is supposed to represent the MOST INTERESTING portion of the film's dialogue. As usual, Tom Cruise couldn't act his way out of a paper bag and a huge portion of his lines consists in repeating, for no apparent reason, the last line spoken by whomever he is talking to,in a dull, uncomprehending way, such as ""... because I had you followed."" ""You ..... had me ...... followed."" As for the ""suspense"" element, the party scenes are so boring and the very idea that the whole thing could be a big secret when there are dozens of hookers, butlers, bodyguards etc. running around the scene is just too stupid to be accepted even for ""conscious suspension of disbelief"". This is a terrible film."

","Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut was his final film made (as many people know) and as it is his last it is no less than a perfect Stanley Kubrick film.  He can still grab you with his terrific filmaking in a sexual odyssey that seems not only extraordinary to his audience, but to himself as well (he took a twelve year interlude between making Full Metal Jacket in 1987 and this film).<br/><br/>The acting is also superb, mainly by the real life husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as the couple who hold many secrets from each other.  The film goes on a little longer than some of Kubrick's past ones, but thats because there is a lot more detail in this picture than hin his other ones, including sexual rendevous, long dialogues and scenes of intrigue.  In short, this is Kubick's last, one of his best, and most intriguing films."

","Perhaps it is in the perspective of looking back in time on this thriller, that has the advantage of fresher perspectives and recent history to more accurately see what Kubrick was stating.<br/><br/>It is funny to see cinema aficionados develop theories of metaphors and allegory, so convoluted and complex. They are the people with Eyes Wide Shut. <br/><br/>The TRUTH of this cinema masterpiece, is hidden in plain sight! Woven intricately throughout this film are the themes and representations of a group said to influence almost all of Hollywood. <br/><br/>They are said to be sexual predators, using woman like sex slaves, the imagery of the movie. Today we have the benefit of Harvey Weinstein and scores of other people outed from the 'ME TOO"" Movement, with impropriety woven through every level in Hollywood.<br/><br/>The imagery in Eyes Wide Shut is that of the rumored ""ILLUMINATI"". It isn't coincidence that the Orgy at the Mansion, is filled with Pentagrams, devil masks, rebuking Christian ideals with Pentagram stars on the Christmas tree. The Illuminati are as real as the yearly Event in Bohemian Grove, filled with politicians, rock and rappers, Hollywood movers and shakers, caught on camera worshipping an Owl totem and Baal, a Devil figure.<br/><br/>The scene of that Orgy with all the nudity, is a representation of the Illuminati orgies, from costume to the Rothschild inspired mansion.<br/><br/>More interesting in retrospect is Kubrick's heart attack, which allowed Warner Brothers to edit 24 minutes out of the film, as Kubrick had a contract of full artistic control. It is said to have contained the lurid scenes of human sacrifice, and developed the character dancing with Nicole Kidman as the man in the red robe at the Orgy. Rainbows, pedophilia, and magic are throughout the movie, more Illuminati themes.<br/><br/>In the final scene, at the toy store, the board game of magic with a Pentagram, and the fact that the daughter seems to go off unnoticed with two older men looking back at Cruise and Kidman, harkens to the black magic and pedophilia, said to be part of Illuminati practices. <br/><br/>In plain sight in the movie are the mask of a pyramid and the all-seeing eye of Horace.<br/><br/>If you think none of this can be possible, Look at the back of your dollar bill where you will find the all-seeing eye, the Pyramid, and under both the Latin phrase which translates into NEW WORLD ORDER.....hidden in plain sight."

"director-12","1","4","9","19 July 1999"," Eyes Wide Shut is exactly what my eyes were half-way through this boring and bad Kubrick film
","Eyes Wide Shut is exactly what my eyes were half-way through this boring and bad Kubrick film.  Stanley Kubrick himself was a bizarre and eccentric guy, and he tried to serve up a display and or commentary to the darker side of human sexuality -- which probably parallels the director himself(who knows? who cares).  The subject matter of this film and the way it was examined misses the mark of good cinema by such a tremendous margin, and I'm sad Kubrick doesn't have a chance to try again now that he's passed on.  But then again, I don't care who you are.  If it takes you 75 takes on a single set-up during a single scene of filmmaking, then you are not a perfectionist, you are obsessive-compulsive and most likely very insecure. I feel bad for Tom and Nicole having spent a year and a half of their lives committed to this project.  What a waste.  And it seemed to me that Tom knew this much during his interview on 20/20.   While on the subject of Tom and Nicole, their performances(and most of the other actors as well) were the only redeeming factor of this film.  Their performances were the only characteristic of this film that kept me in the theater to the end. Otherwise, I would've walked half-way through the second act. Unfortunately, their material was the failure of this film, and, dare I say, the direction.<br/><br/>The boredom that overcomes the viewer in Eyes Wide Shut is so prevalent by the third act, that you are most likely to be removed from any attachment to this film by the time the big orgy scene rolls around.  And then it becomes laughable because you have already lost respect for what the movie was trying to convey.  And what was the deal with the horrible scoring of this film?  That horrendous pounding of the single note from a piano was so disturbing that it removed me from any chance of being able to believe what was in front of me.  Audience members in the Los Angeles theater where I watched this movie were laughing every time that damn single piano key was struck.  I couldn't believe all the yawning, himming and hawing, and shifting in theater seats going on during this movie.  People were looking around and bored senseless.  The comments on the long crowded walk out of the theater chimed all the same notes:  this just wasn't a good movie -- not even close.<br/><br/>Can Hollywood and the press please not pull another ""emperor's new clothes"" review on this film like they did with Terrance Malick's pathetic attempt at a war movie ""The Thin Red Line""?  I know people will be afraid to say Kubrick made a bad film.  Let's face it, it's bad.  It's easy to say it's a good movie, because it's cool to be a big fan of Stanley Kubrick.  So naturally, the reviews are more of a review of the man and possibly out of respect for the fact that he is dead.  But you have to call it like it is. This is exactly what Hollywood did for Terrance Malick's last film. Everybody began talking about how great this guy was and citing his last work as an example of his greatness.  Gee, I don't remember ""Badlands"" being on anybody's top twenty list of all-time greatest movies.  And suddenly, most of Hollywood is singing praises for the bad director who hasn't made a movie in over twenty years.  It's disgusting.  And Malick's ""Thin Red Line"" was much worse than ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  So don't be sucked in by this false hype.  Can I recommend you see this film in the theater?  No way.  On a scale of 1 to 10 -- I give it a 2."
"musical_notes12","10","3","6","6 September 2014"," A great movie after 15 years
","This film is a work of genius that, like all Kubric films, is open to many interpretations. The art of this film remains its slow, thoughtful pace, camera angles and distances, facial studies, colour and ingenious set designs. The original music of Jocelyn Pooke provides the necessary extra voice and story that gives this film the unique feel it has. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a study in psychology and nerve, human weakness and how we might overcome those weaknesses.<br/><br/>Many interpretations have been given of 'Eyes Wide Shut', and I agree that Kubric invites us to think carefully about his films, offering no definitive answers. However, I offer my own view of what I think is going on with the story of Bill and Alice Harford in this piece of cinema noire. Throughout the film, there are a series of clues dotted around the canvas like a puzzle of separate pieces, and yet bound by a common thread.<br/><br/>At the heart of the story are the married couple, Bill and Alice, who have marital problems. Alice, whilst telling of a sexual fantasy, doesn't actually enter into any kind of affair. Bill, jealous of Alice's fantasy, is seen walking into a series of temptations and embracing them. These temptations are rather like those described in the Garden of Eden story with Adam and Eve succumbing to temptation.<br/><br/>With Bill, it is his night walking and encounters with women in different situations that present his weaknesses. The one moment in the film that, for me, triggered thoughts about the Genesis story were the words of the masked woman at the hedonistic party who steps in to save Bill, saying she will redeem him. Who might she be to offer redemption? At that moment, the other parts of that central section of the film became clearer. The naked people seen copulating with each other is, for me, humans functioning as they should, to multiply. Naked flesh is not presented so much as erotic but rather as humankind exposed for what it is, as a sexually functioning race.<br/><br/>Bill is frail, showing fear as much as pleasure at the encounters he is having with the women he meets. The death of Mandy, a prostitute he first meets at Victor Zeigler's party, is a symbol of how life is. Destroy your body with drugs, and you will eventually die.<br/><br/>Life is frail, but we have to be strong and make better decisions, and that is what this film is about. It is brilliant and a great testimony as Stanley Kubric's final film."
"dunmore_ego","4","3","6","13 August 2011"," Pants Wide Open.
","Stanley Kubrick directs EYES WIDE SHUT with his pants wide open.<br/><br/>Elegant somberness, lurid themes, disturbing visuals, foreboding music, screaming colors. And tits.<br/><br/>Tits tits tits. Not banana teats, cow udders or raisins either, but perfectly-rounded, gently-sloped baseballs to cantaloupes. On women ivory-legged, flat-bellied, pear-buttocked, butter-smooth, hungry-lipped, not one a notch below 9. Call it art. Call it exploration of the dark side of the soul blah blah. Fact is, a magnificent portion of EYES WIDE SHUT is naked women. Simple. Kubrick ""clothes"" this prurience in the mantle of filmmaking, but isn't that how all artists score bitches (from rock stars to architects)? By couching their base intentions in seeming nobility? Yet, ironically, there can be nothing nobler than desiring to procreate, yet that too is cloaked in the bait-and-switch of family-raising.<br/><br/>But back to the naked women... Who are they and what do they want with my willy? They are the licentious consorts at the exclusive sex mansion that Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) infiltrates and then finds he can't escape.<br/><br/>You see, Harford and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) started speculating one night about their sexual fantasies and Harford discovers, to his chagrin, that hers are more exciting, detailed and likely to happen than his, which sets him on a libidinous quest to live lewd. No matter that the couple is happily married, have a daughter and successful jobs, let the blue-balled odyssey begin...<br/><br/>After unfulfilling encounters on the tame side of filth, a chance meeting with a friend gets Harford the secret password to the ultra-exclusive sex club for the super-desensitized. Luckily, everyone at the ritual has to dress in masks and cloaks like they're reenacting a Mozart opera, so no one knows Harford is crashing their orgy. Until the cult leader calls him out by name and asks him the password to - exit...<br/><br/>Cruise and Kidman reunite as an on screen couple - again (DAYS OF THUNDER 1990, FAR AND AWAY 1992), this time reportedly straining their real-life marriage with the hurtful residue of their brilliant performances. Further than balls deep. Beard or not. Or maybe it was that scene with the hooligans who pass Cruise on the street and call him a faggot. (I bet those guys are STILL eating out on that.) One time too many to simply flash the frozen smile and laugh it off? <br/><br/>The movie's opening scene is a harbinger of the territory it intends to tread: Harford, chatting to his wife Alice, walks into the bathroom where she sits on the toilet in a long, high-slit ball gown; she wipes herself with toilet paper and throws it away, chatting back nonchalantly. So innocuous, so sexy, so dirty (and all I could think of as she slinked through that party was the moist spot on her panties). Close eyes, ride it back down to calm...<br/><br/>Movie is telling us it will unflinchingly take us through the most private moments of this couple, uncomfortably close.<br/><br/>Written for the screen by Kubrick and Frederic Raphael, from Arthur Schnitzler's novel Traumnovelle, EYES WIDE SHUT seems to allude to that old gag, ""You think you know someone..."" In other words, when entering into marriage, you should supposedly know everything about the other person; the plan is - with eyes wide open. But is that ever possible in a species that cannot read each others' thoughts? <br/><br/>Kubrick's characteristic disturbing directorial style leaves us as disoriented as the lead character. As Harford's morals are warring within him, colors seem to fight with each other in his scenes - oranges and deep blues, ambers and ceruleans; as Harford stalks the New York sidewalk lathering himself into lust, the camera leads, then follows, moving eerily, as adrift as he is; as the couple speak in unloving tones in their marriage bedroom, the harsh lighting frays our corneas; when Harford tries to hire a cloak and mask costume, the lewd tableau he walks into (with Leelee Sobieski, Rade Sherbedgia and some Asian men) is disturbing for what it DOESN'T reveal.<br/><br/>The password: Fidelio. The expressionless gold mask. The taxi ride to the orgy mansion: nowhere. The single repeated piano note: pling......... pling....... pling..... The ritual: the tribades, letting cloaks fall to reveal their naked perfection (""But I say unto you, That whosoever look on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."" --King James Bible. Sorry, Christians - you're all going to hell!). The warning: leave. The sex: watching, performing, feigning disinterest, but it's the focal point of existence. The cameo: Sydney Pollack? The murder: identifying the sappho who warned him. The bonus: Nicole Kidman wearing nothing but reading glasses.<br/><br/>Okay... ride it down again.... calm... calm...<br/><br/>In the United States, EYES WIDE SHUT is rated NC-17 (that's the poop-your-pants, highest, deadliest rating a movie can get, without being porn), not because of its disturbing themes but because it shows people engaging in the life-creating practice of sex. Censors would much rather you drank in the death-creating practice of murder. Heaven forbid we show our kids how to make love; let's show them how to kill, and then we'll blame Judas Priest for the school shootings. A movie filled brim to end with murder can only manage an R-rating in the United States. What does that say about the hypocritical, gutless, inconsistent, wrong-headed, wrong-prioritied American censors? <br/><br/>That they're nothing but a bunch of TITS."

","This is my third favourite Kubrick movie, 2001 being my favourite and ACO being second Eyes Wide Shut is nevertheless a great movie backed by powerful performances from Cruise and Kidman. The first time I watched it I was pretty unimpressed,much like the first time I saw 2001 and that is now my favourite movie. The second time round I liked it a lot more. Eyes Wide Shut paints a very honest and mature picture of marriage and in that lies it's beauty.<br/><br/>Despite not being married I can completely identify with Nicole Kidman,she is a bored housewife who fantasises about other men to spice up her life. When she discloses this to hubby Mr Cruise he then goes on a downhill spiral and the implications it has on their marriage. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were brilliant in their roles as husband and wife. I suppose I may as well admit that I initially brought the DVD for Nicole Kidman and her skin show(trust me she did not disappoint me in that area) but I was not expecting to immensely enjoy it which I did. It really is an absolute shame that Mr Kubrick could not bask in it's glory for long, he died shortly after making it. Eyes Wide Shut is another addition to Mr Kubrick's fine work as a director and the industry is poorer place without him."
"stefanbe","10","3","6","12 December 2007"," Stanley Kubrick left behind a treasury of classics and Eyes Wide Shut most certainly ranks among his best.
","Stanley Kubrick began his career as a teenage photographer and finished it as a maverick filmmaker. The transition from a young Brooklyn kid to one of the greatest directors in the history of film is an impressive one and rather evident in plenty of his films. Kubrick always knew how to frame a shot, ever since he began taking pictures as a boy. In each of his films, the camera was placed perfectly, creating superb picture after picture. Kubrick was not just a filmmaker, he was an artist. Many years from now, his films will be looked at the same way the paint strokes of Goya or the music of Mozart are analysed today. To cap off his incredibly consistent career, the reclusive Kubrick made his first film in twelve years and one of his best. Eyes Wide Shut is a film that is hard to classify into one genre, as its unique cinematic experience brings something different never experienced before. Kubrick would continually re-invent film with such masterpieces like Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange and most importantly 2001: A Space Odyssey, his magnum opus. Eyes Wide Shut may unfortunately be Kubrick's final film, but thankfully he left the world with a bang and not a whimper.<br/><br/>Like all of Stanley Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is a piece of work that gets better with multiple viewings and more is noticed with each look. Not surprisingly, there is still plenty left un-explained and like a detective story, the viewer has to unravel clues much like the main protagonist does. Yet, before Harford turns into Sherlock Holmes, he represents a modern version of Odysseus from Homer's The Odyssey. Throughout the film, he is confronted by individuals wishing to give him sexual pleasure, yet he avoids them much like Odysseus and his encounter with the sirens. Similar to that character, turning down the various characters turned out to be fortunate for him. During his dreamy walk through New York, Harford encounters a prostitute who he kisses but eventually does not sleep with. The next morning, he finds out that she is HIV-positive. His decision to not have sex with her turns out to be a good one as he does not receive the deadly disease. He also turns down the offer of a patient of his and despite his sexuality being questioned by a group of rowdy teenagers (thus leading to the encounter with the prostitute), he still does not cheat on his wife. Her words may have caused jealousy, yet he actually ends up being a more noble character than Alice. With Harford as his main protagonist, Kubrick actually brought upon a rare personality that for him was un-explored. Harford has his flaws, but he is actually the most sane character of the film and the least demonic. Tom Cruise's performance also helps the audience be with the character as goes on his journey. He gives life to Harford and fleshes him out into a human being with feelings and emotions. Cruise is an accomplished actor and he hits the right keys, not going over-the-top and not being too drone-like. It is a subtle performance from one of Hollywood's biggest stars.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick would always give his female leads as much as heart-ache as his lead male actors. Most of the time he managed to bring forth a great performance as evidenced by Marisa Berenson in Barry Lyndon and Sue Lyon in Lolita. In the case of Shelley Duvall in The Shining, there was the opposite effect. Thankfully, Nicole Kidman's work in Eyes Wide Shut proves to be an outstanding performance, bringing forth a character whose dark side is shown even when she's just glancing towards the camera (a frequent Kubrick trademark). Her character is not on screen as much as Cruise is, but when she does show up on camera, she excels. Most of Alice's dialogue consists of monologues, each showing the character's rough edges easily. Kidman perfectly brings layer upon layer on the character. Even in Harford's frequent fantasies, there is something sinister and careless told about her. The most fascinating scene of Kidman's comes when she is high on drugs and reveals her sensual theories to her husband. The combination of Cruise and Kidman starts the scene, but she soon takes over silencing not just Harford but the viewer as well.<br/><br/>Another possibly sinister character with something to hide is done very well with Sydney Pollack. As soon as he is shown in a bathroom with an over-dosed and naked girl, the audience knows that this man has a couple of skeletons in his closet. When he reveals to Harford some information regarding both the cult and the naked girl, both Harford and the viewer aren't quite sure whether to trust him or not. It's not just the screenplay that leads us to believe this, but Pollack's performance as well. That final scene either produces plenty of information or makes people more confused about the past two hours than they were before. He says the whole orgy cult was done to scare Harford, yet why would they go through all the trouble to do all that? Harford is suspicious and so are we.<br/><br/>Kubrick only follows that sequence up with a final confrontation between Bill and Alice. In these culminating scenes, Alice states that ""only as sure as I am that the reality of one night, let alone that of a whole lifetime, can ever be the whole truth."" All of this goes back to the film's title. Are Harford's eyes wide shut? Or could it be Alice or even the pianist? How about Sydney Pollack's character? For all we know, it could even be Kubrick himself as the director certainly did work in mysterious ways. It is rumoured that long-gone rapper Tupac hinted in his songs about his eventual death. Could it be that Kubrick wanted to give us one last hint about him in this film? Maybe."

","'Eyes Wide Shut,' the long-awaited final film from visionary director Stanley Kubrick was released in 1999, shortly after Kubrick's sad and unfortunate death. Many predicted that it would be Kubrick's masterpiece - the film by which he would inevitably be remembered. It isn't, but 'Eyes Wide Shut' remains a stunning film, and nothing less than we've come to expect from this master director.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise (""Minority Report"") is Dr. William ""Bill"" Harford, a handsome and successful young doctor, who is happily married to Alice (Nicole Kidman, ""The Others"") with one young daughter, Helena. Bill is loyal to Alice, and he expects the same in return. However, he is severely shocked one night when Alice confesses that, a year earlier, she'd seriously contemplated having an affair with a young Navy officer.<br/><br/>Many have complained about the slow pace of 'Eyes Wide Shut.' I didn't find anything negative about it. The slow, meditative pace of the film (which shouldn't come as a surprise to fans of Kubrick's spectacular ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") gave the film its entire, dream-like quality, and I was simply transfixed to the screen the whole time. The scene where a masked Bill Harford wanders into the mysterious mansion amidst a secret sex ritual is simpling mesmerising, with no small thanks to the great direction from Kubrick. Once again, as always, he's chosen the perfect music to capture the atmosphere of the scene!<br/><br/>The only scenes where I thought the film slipped up were a couple of the later mansion scenes, when the mysterious woman was warning Cruise to get out of there. The bit where she said, ""You are in grave danger!"" sounded a bit melodramatic (reminded me of 'The Da Vinci Code,' actually), and also when she interrupts Cruise's stern interrogation by yelling, ""STOP!"" The quick zoom used in that moment made me laugh...<br/><br/>However, an astute fellow IMDb user alerted me to the fact that perhaps Kubrick did this deliberately. The actress in that scene (the mask prevents me from remembering who she actually was) sounded like she was acting because, simply put, her character was just acting. The entire display, as Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack) suggests later in the film, may have been an elaborate ploy to scare the wits through Harford. Not being an experienced actor, the woman may have been convincing enough for the terrified and confused Harford, but not necessarily for the astute film viewer sitting in the comfort of their home. Though it is impossible to understand entirely what Kubrick was attempting with that scene, it seems like the sort of thing he'd do!<br/><br/>'Eyes Wide Shut' contains great performances from a talented cast. I thought that Tom Cruise shined in the main role, translating the fear and confusion of his character to the screen beautifully. Nicole Kidman was also very good  her slow, brooding delivery of dialogue certainly contributed to the dreamlike quality of the film.<br/><br/>This is a quality film from one of the all-time greats of film-making. Often overlooked simply as ""Stanley Kubrick's last film,"" 'Eyes Wide Shut' deserves to be seen and appreciated by more film-goers."
"andrewtempleton","7","3","6","11 November 2006"," an extended gag
","His last film - Eyes Wide Shut - starts with an iconic, Kubrick moment: framed in a doorway and with her back to us, Nicole Kidman drops her dress to the ground. She is naked but she never turns around. We never see her (assuredly) delightful body from the front.<br/><br/>This image - and the action of Kidman dropping her dress - is a neat and effective summary for the entire film. Eyes Wide Shut is one long tease, a tease that expertly plays with the audience's expectations (expectations which are also built up by the marketing campaign - which was completely misleading as to the film's content). Kidman's dress falls easily to the floor and the viewer is immediately primed for an erotic thrill-ride. They couldn't be more wrong. Just as Nicole never turns around, Eyes Wide Shut never allows either of its central characters (and by extension, vicariously, us) to achieve sexual gratification.<br/><br/>Kidman's character has a re-occurring fantasy of a sexual encounter with a sailor - a fantasy that we can be fairly safe in assuming is never consummated. Driven by a jealousy over his wife's fantasy life (and no doubt by a desire to hurt Kidman's character for the cruel things she says to him), Tom Cruise's ""Dr Bill"" goes on a series of escalating sexual adventures to get laid - but each time he is frustrated. He never has sex. Neither of them do during the entire movie - with each other or with strangers, thus making Kidman's last line in the film at once predictable and perfect. It is the punch-line we've been waiting for. What these over-achieving, angst-ridden, New York WASPs need to do is simply f**k.<br/><br/>The movie works its way to this punch-line extremely well. I understand a lot of people find the movie slow. I think this is fair comment and can be attributed to the movie's one major flaw: Tom Cruise. His performance is mannered and unbelievable. I wonder if Cruise fully appreciated the depth of the material he was working with. If he did, I saw no sense of connection between the actor and the character he was playing. Cruise - such an icon himself - is never believable as the husband driven by jealousy into more and more desperate situations. According to an interview I read, Kubrick and his co-creator came up with the surname ""Harford"" because Kubrick wanted a Harrison Ford-like actor for the role (ie Har & Ford). I can't help wondering if the keeping of the name is not a sly comment from the director saying ""you're watching Cruise, but imagine Harrison Ford"". Ford would have been a much stronger choice and I can imagine Kubrick getting a much more nuanced performance than he did from Cruise. Alas, Ford would have been a bit long in the tooth at the time of filming. Kidman, it should be said, is wonderful but she almost always is.<br/><br/>There is one other glaring flaw with the film - at least in the version I saw. At one point, Cruise crashes an elaborate orgy/sex-party at a mansion. It would seem in Kubrick's original, there were a number of (reasonably) graphic sex scenes. In the North American version I saw, computer generated images of party-goers were placed in front of these sex scenes. I can't help but see this as akin to someone coming along with a magic marker and running thick black lines down the film-stock. These peculiar CGI figures are noticeably out of place (I noticed them and was unaware at the time of viewing that they were computer-generated) and, more importantly, undermines the thematic impact of the scene. The key here is that Dr Bill is not engaging in the sex, he's watching. He's observing, not participating in, sexual acts that are impersonal (everyone is masked) and theatrical. We need - as audience members - to see what Halford sees, otherwise it's pretty pointless. An alternative would have to have the audience's experience replicate Halford's - in trying to see into the orgies - but to have his (and our) view blocked or frustrated. Either would have worked.<br/><br/>Still, this is an important film and well worth-seeing. Just think of Harrison Ford when Tom grits his teeth and shows off his cheekbones"
"stro2425","10","3","6","30 May 2006"," The movie can be viewed in multiple ways.
","Replace the adults at the secret gathering with kids and you have a profound movie. Was Kubrick trying to expose pedophilia amongst powerful people? Who knows, but it makes the movie much more profound. It explains why Dr. Bill's life is threatened. Also, turn on the closed captions when the young girl whispers in Cruise's ear. She tells him to get a cloak lined with Ermine. Ermine was worn by royalty. It also symbolizes moral purity or innocence. Why does the movie use pedophilia as bookends for the orgy scene? <br/><br/>The movie is spooky, and also unbelievably complex. There is a strange amount of ""Grail"" imagery in the prostitute scene. Notice the immense amount of ""V's"" in the entire scene from her clothes to the way the Christmas lights are hung. Before the orgy there are also two road signs which have a ""V"" and an upside down ""V"" symbolizing the masculine and the feminine.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is about much more than relationships and sex. It is sort of like a Da Vinci painting. It's true meaning may take years to figure out."
"WriterDave","7","3","6","3 January 2006"," Frustrating Last Entry from Kubrick
","It's a shame that something as muddled (though fascinating and watchable throughout) as ""Eyes Wide Shut"" would become the last movie directed by possibly the greatest director of all time, Stanley Kubrick. It showcases all the things his detractors had been falsely claiming for years: he's out of steam, it's too long, it's too weird, and it has no point. Unfortunately the film is as overshadowed by the fact that it's Kubrick's last as it is by the fact that it was released at the height of Cruise and Kidman's status as Hollywood's uber-couple. Oh, how we wish Kubrick could be with us today, and how we all thought Tom and Nicole would last forever.<br/><br/>Kubrick's look at marriage and fidelity can be boiled down pretty easily: misadventures in unfaithfulness can be equally damaging playing out in one's imagination as they can be in reality. Despite a great, raw, and entrancing performance from Nicole Kidman, the film is pretty much one-sided and dedicates most of its runtime to Tom Cruise's unrealistic though entertaining nightly escapades. Only in a Kubrick film would a man find the prettiest, most polite, kindest hooker in New York City and then just happen upon a huge aristocratic sex cult at some castle/mansion out on Long Island. The whole thing is more kinky than erotic and just a bit silly, which isn't to say it's without its merits.<br/><br/>In the end, in spite of its flaws, I think it's rather fitting that the last line of the last film of a director like Kubrick who always had such a dark sense of humor would be, ""f*ck"" and be spoken by one of the most elegant and beautiful and talented actresses of her generation. Sounds like a great idea."

","The so-called genius of Stanley Kubrick is totally lost on me. I'm pretty sure I'm in minority in my opinion (and it IS only an opinion), but I find his films almost unwatchable. Technically brilliant but cold, unengaging and tightly sealed. Suffocating. I'm sure anyone who took over 12 months to make a film could come up with something passable, and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is barely passable. Would we be talking about this film if it was directed by anyone else? Is it merely the high-budget high-brow version of a direct to video thriller? ""Bedroom Eyes VII: The Masquerade"" perhaps? The sexuality on display is stunningly unerotic, the music score heavy-handed (and caused ripples of laughter amongst the audience when I saw the film), the acting highly variable. Tom Cruise tries too hard as usual, and once again fails to come across as a believable character. Nicole Kidman's scenes at the party that opens the film are frankly awful, but for the remainder of the movie she is remarkable. The climactic orgy features some great Venetian masks but is mind-bogglingly heavy handed in execution... I've tried to justify the turgidness of the experience, thinking it actually tells the story of a man with no sexual imagination. Hence his visions of his wife sleeping with another man are flat and clichÃ©d, his responses to sexual situations are muted and almost coy. But even if that were the case, it doesn't make for an interesting cinematic experience. There's no passion on evidence in this picture, no animal lusts and desires and urges. It's too calculated - nothing is 'felt'. And as a result, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" sags and deflates under the weight of pretension."

","I freely admit I watched this movie partly due to the ""sex"" publicity, and partly because it was Kubrick film, and everyone talks about what a genius he was supposed to be. I also only watched it because it happened to be on cable when there was nothing else on.<br/><br/>The music drove me up the wall - one guy, with one finger, hitting the same damn note on the piano until I was ready to kill someone. I ended up muting the movie to avoid the music. Music gets -5 stars.<br/><br/>The movie didn't make any sense to me - the ending invalidated the movie to me. ""Stuff happened, and it greatly impacted our lives, but lets pretend it never happened, and go on as if it didn't."" No real resolution, just a vague resumption of their lives, and a sort of unvoiced agreement to pretend it never happened.<br/><br/>The sex scenes were strange, cold, and clinical. The acting was wooden, boring, and confusing.<br/><br/>I found the stuff with Leelee Sobieski's character confusing and creepy, and instead of finding her cool as usual, it was just.. kinda gross.<br/><br/>I know this was supposed to be Kubrick's final opus, but I found absolutely NOTHING redeemable about this, and in fact, felt stupider for having sat through it. Cruise is vague, Kidman a waste, and Sobieski a waste. I recommend you avoid this movie unless you just REALLY must see Kubrick's last flick, just cuz you feel you need to, or you liked his other movies. I found myself waiting for the sex scenes just as a ""high point"" and they weren't worth the wait.<br/><br/>I hated this movie - it goes on my top 3 worst movies EVER list."

","One of the most under-rated films of the decade, Eyes Wide Shut is a brilliant masterpiece, from the very opening of the film to its very end. Kubrick succeeds in what many good filmmakers failed before him- and conveys a beautiful imagery of our state of dreams, full of sexual symbolism and other dream-like symbols (notice the stop signs in the streets in front of Tom Cruise), and creates a feeling of total wandering; although consistent, due to the fact that every scene and dialogue is vital and neccecary for the film's development.<br/><br/>Moreover, Kubrick's use of music is even more genius than always, and Ligeti's motif from Musica Ricercarta shows us the repetitive nature of dreams, together with a feeling that we don't know where to go next.<br/><br/>And of course there is a note of marriage life, men's sexuality (and the attempt to deny women's sexuality) and the very fine acting of Cruise and Kidman, which was a postlude of there own relationship.<br/><br/>For me, this is the finest, most perfect film of Kubrick, and therefore one of the best films of all.

"Flame372","Null","3","6","17 August 2004"," Clever film Kubrick!...revelations about Bill's journey - a must read
","I have recently watched EWS and was captivated by it. I found it intriguing and thought provoking. So much so that the following couple of days I spent pondering the plot and trying to make sense of it all! I came across this site ...fantastic!<br/><br/>Here are some revelations I would like to share that might be of interest to those as captivated by the film as I am.<br/><br/>Bills journey started when he got that late night call from Marion who was grieving over her deceased father. I found it interesting that we learned immediately of Marion's overwhelming feelings for Bill. This was significant because it was mirroring Alice's overwhelming desire for the naval officer that sparked this ensuing obsessive reaction in Bill. Marion, like Alice, was willing to throw her ENTIRE life (with Carl) away for a chance at Bill. This stresses the reason behind his journey - his quest that began as he walked and walked.....<br/><br/>What was the relevance of Domino contracting HIV??? I think this reflected Bill's FIRST lucky escape - it would have cost him his life if Alice didn't call him when she did. Like his dogged determination to turn up to the forbidden event (orgy) - also could have cost him his life. HE ALSO WAS WILLING TO THROW AWAY HIS LIFE FOR THESE FLEETING SEXUAL EXPERIENCES. He was trying to experience an overwhelming desire to revenge Alice - (he kept imagining her with the sailor).<br/><br/>How did the masked Mandy at the orgy recognise an intruder when no-one had spoken to her about the receipt found in Bill's coat pocket or the taxi? She was involved with the ceremony so she couldn't have known those things. I think its because his 'cloak' gave him away - perhaps he should have worn an ermine-lined cloak. This may be showing us a connection between Milich, his daughter at RAINBOW costumes and the orgy. Remember they were acting strangely when Bill returned the costume - were they involved in the orgy? In costuming the members? Or perhaps the daughter had more to do with it than that! <br/><br/>Bill would have had sex with the 2 girls at the Xmas party with the significant line ""we'll take you to the end of the RAINBOW"". And what stopped him?? He was pulled away from that encounter by the NEAR DEATH OF MANDY- I believe this was his first warning!!! The next time he refused to be pulled away from an erotic situation resulted in MANDY'S death.<br/><br/>It is a very clever movie. I welcome any comments on my comments."

","This film is not only about sex, nudity and fornication. My wife, who completely missed the point was amazed that 'Nicole allowed herself to be in this lewd film'. Of course there is a LOT of nudity, but what struck me was what Kubrick was telling us about where power resides in society.<br/><br/>Cruise is an affluent, well connected Doctor with a beautiful wife who slowly becomes aware of an unseen, powerful inner sanctum who literally get away with murder. They can make people disappear. They can threaten anyone who exposes them. They can even threaten Cruise himself!<br/><br/>
I thought his portrayal was brilliant, you could see the good Doctor's mind working as, piece by piece, he realizes how hopeless his position would be were he to air his suspicions to Police.<br/><br/>Kubrick is telling us something far more profound than the incredible debauchery of a wealthy class of New York citizens. He also knew it would be lost on most viewers of this excellent film."
"stefan-144","5","3","6","15 January 2003"," Nothing much, in beautiful wrapping
","It's a pity that this became Kubrick's last movie. Some artists seem to know when their time is up, and hurry to make sort of an artistic testament - like Dostoevsky in the last 50 or so pages of Brothers Karamazov. I gather that Kubrick did not have such a premonition, or he just felt that there was not much to add to his fabulous suite of movies.<br/><br/>This one is a long series of beautiful sceneries, and beautiful people parading, but there's really not much happening. Not much to be shocked about, either. Tom Cruise's character is bewildered to find a secret group committed to rituals of a frank but also quite conventional sexual nature. Why would that be so unsettling? He is also perplexed to learn that his wife has fantasies of unfaithfulness, and more so to find that he can have them, too. Huh?<br/><br/>I guess the movie would have been much more interesting, if instead we had been following Nicole Kidman, playing his wife, on similar adventures. Since she was more at ease with those thirsts within herself, the development would no doubt have been more interesting. Kidman also handles her role with much more delicacy, enriching it, while Cruise mainly stands around looking stiff - well, the script might not have given him much else to do.<br/><br/>This whole film would have been much better off, if directed by Fellini. He would have known to go beyond the middle class morality, and fill the scenes with such stuff as of which dreams are really woven."

Does the American film industry still believe they can get away with re-doing bad scenarios simply by re-locating to the US? Do we really need two and one-half hours of boredom to tell us that relationships reach a point where the humanity and vulnerability of those involved is either accepted with compassion or rejected and lead to a breakup? Can this be interpreted as an anti-feminine film? (Wheatly was known for it.) Where the hell are Germaine, Betty and Gloria when we need them? Do Tom and Nicole need to work together so much that they will accept trash for a script? Did Nicole's agent tell her when Tom became the LEAD and her role diminished?

","Before I start, my apologies to the memory of Stanley Kubrick.  I truly enjoyed his work especially the Clockwork Orange.  However, his last work, Eyes Wide Shut, has to be one of if not the worst movie I have ever seen. It dragged horribly.  There were times when you could have driven a mack truck through the dialogue.  It was uninteresting.  I knew how it would end ten minutes into it, and I desperately wanted to walk out on it at that minute but remained in the hope that there would be a surprise or a turn around.  There wasn't.  The question that kept running through my mind while hating this movie was, ""How many people can come on to Tom Cruise in one movie?""  Every ten minutes someone is trying to get in this man's pants, two women at once, a woman who had just lost her father who lay dead in the bed next to her and Cruise as she professes her undying love, a man, and a few women in the orgy scene.  Don't get me wrong, Cruise is beautiful but please cut us all a break especially since all he is in this film is pretty.  His acting left very much to be desired, but that's really nothing new.  He has his shining moments (Interview with a Vampire, Jerry Maguire, Born on the Fourth of July) but mostly he's trite.  His wife, Nicole Kidman, was the true disappointment of this movie.  Her American accent was dead on but everything else felt very forced.  She did not become her character for one second in this film, and after her performance in To Die For we know that she can if she wants to.  Perhaps she refused to do so, I know I wouldn't want to be her.  About her I continued to wonder how often a person can say fuck in one movie, or even one sentence.  Her use of the word approached ludicrous proportions.  The positives of the film all came from the directing and lighting choices.  They effectively created the eerie atmosphere the movie demanded, but the acting and script shot all of that straight to hell.  Don't see this film."

A particular scene with Tom at the orgy was very tense and frightening, but the story was downhill from there.

","""Eyes Wide Shut"" might have been considered director Stanley Kubrick's most controversial masterpiece . . . if he'd filmed it in the early 1980's, as he originally intended.  While artistically and visually brilliant, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" suffers from relying on a script that would've been considered daring and shocking in years gone by, but for 1999 and beyond it offers nothing particularly outrageous.  With little substance behind the intended shock, the film is left with little else to entertain the audience.  It's kind of like watching ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?"" or even ""Basic Instinct"" today -- at the time those films were released, they pushed a lot of emotional buttons, but now the issues and topics they dealt with seems rather tame.<br/><br/>
The film deals with the relationship between Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman), a wealthy, happily married couple with a small, lovely daughter (Madison Eginton).  However, in an awkward moment Alice confesses to William that she considered cheating on him early on in their marriage.  She never actually acting on her adulterous thoughts, but William becomes so enraged that he goes out alone into the night, contemplating the future of his marriage and looking for a random sexual encounter with which he can gain a certain amount of revenge.<br/><br/>And that's it.  There's a lot of scenes (some imagined, some real) of kinky sexual encounters, but nothing incredibly over the top, nothing that hasn't been seen in mainstream films before.  William's reaction to his wife's confession seems entirely too strong.  No, I don't think that any man ever wants to hear from his wife that she thought about having an affair with somebody else, but to react as strongly as he did seemed slightly odd.  If she'd actually had the affair, it might've made more sense.  Scenes that could've been built into dark, brooding, tormented sequences of William agonizing over what to do often seem pointless because of this . . . and over two hours' worth of them is mind-numbingly boring overkill.<br/><br/>There's still a few highlights -- Cruise puts in a solid performance, considering the material he has to work with, and Kidman actually shines in what really is a supporting role as Alice.  Also, the mood, the camera angles, the odd lighting -- in terms of technique, the film ranks as one of Kubrick's finest efforts.  Considering all the hype that went along with this film, though, it's very disappointing, and even on its own merits, it's average at best.  Decent fare for a Kubrick fan, but otherwise, don't bother.  C-"

For whatever reason, I couldn't see anything but the surface value of Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT. The film is about Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman). Alice reveals to Bill that she once thought of having an affair and how she would've given up her entire life, her husband, her daughter, etc. for even one night with a passing Naval officer she'd seen. This news completely destroys Bill and he sets out into the streets of New York with visions of his wife in the arms of another man haunting his mind. Over the course of the night, he stumbles into a mysterious gathering in a secluded home where the halls are filled with people engaged in a ritualistic orgy. When Bill is discovered as an intruder and he believes a woman has been killed in order to protect him, he begins an his own investigation into what happened that night.<br/><br/>Kubrick always seemed to have a much deeper meaning behind the surface story and I'm sure this film is no different. Many critics and fans have praised this film endlessly, so I'm sure there is more to it than meets the eye. I'm sorry to say I just don't get it. It seems to hint at a glimpse into jealousy and the power of sex (or lack thereof) in relationships. For me, all of this potential subtext is lost when I'm drawn into the mystery behind the strange cult/society Bill wanders into. For the remainder of the movie, I just wanted to see this plot-line pan out and fill in the answers and any subtext was overlooked. If you're a true Kubrick fan and haven't watched this film yet, I hope you won't let my own inability to understand it influence your decision in any way. This film has been hailed by some as a masterpiece and is still an intriguing, suspenseful drama.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman do a fantastic job here, especially Kidman who's every line seems to drip with venom following their initial stoned confrontation over her once-desired infidelity. At the time of the film, the two were still married and I'm sure it contributed to their chemistry on-screen (well, maybe the awkwardness between the two sexually in the beginning or the animosity to come later). Again, Kubrick utilizes his masterful skills at creating atmosphere with his grainy footage, minimalist piano score, and colorful lighting. Despite the slow crawling pace of the film, it manages to remain engaging despite it's nearly three hour runtime. The ending was less than stellar and I felt it left a lot of loose ends, but again that's because my focus was on the mystery as opposed to the Harford's relationship. When the movie was over, it left me wanting answers but I still had the usual unease that seems to follow all of Kubrick's films. This film is probably best for true Kubrick fans and will leave the more casual fans a little underwhelmed."

","Eyes Wide Shut has some unusually eloquent and persuasive advocates and some equally eloquent and persuasive detractors.<br/><br/>If I gravitate towards the detractors it is because I see this movie as the culmination of a trend in Kubrick's work that had long troubled me.<br/><br/>Rather than attempt a detailed analysis of its strengths and weaknesses (both of which have been covered in other excellent IMDb reviews) I would merely use it as an illustration of what I see as Kubrick's principal weakness as a film-maker. He was too slow and got progressively slower.<br/><br/>I mean this in three senses.<br/><br/>Firstly, I cannot help noting that it took him just 8 years to make his first 5 features and another 35 years to make his next 5.<br/><br/>These later pictures all spent years in development. I doubt if this long gestation period was a good thing. If you spend too long thinking about a picture it is easy to lose track of why you wanted to make it in the first place (A.I.?) and there is always a danger that you will end up squeezing the life out of it.<br/><br/>Secondly, when Kubrick finally got a project into production he would take months and months to shoot it (14 months for Eyes Wide Shut). Notoriously he shot dozens of takes of every scene, constantly trying out new things. He got away with this because he used a very small crew and was very economical. His pictures may have taken an age to complete but they never went over budget.<br/><br/>But again, I suspect this obsessive concern with the minutiae of every shot was counter-productive. Sometimes, Kubrick couldn't see the wood for the trees. He was so focused on how each individual scene should play that he lost sight of how the picture as a whole would work with an audience. You cannot force a movie to be great just by sheer hard work and painstaking attention to detail.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the movies themselves are often too slow and none more so than Eyes Wide Shut.<br/><br/>For one thing, no movie in recent years has spent so much time just getting characters from one scene to another. When they cross a room we see every step. For example, Tom Cruise is called to the bedside of one of his patients. We see him in a taxi, tortured by thoughts of his wife with another man. Then Kubrick cuts to an empty lobby just as the elevator arrives. The door opens and Cruise walks slowly across the lobby and through another doorway. As he does so, the camera dollies to the left so we can see him pass through that door and across another room. He rings the bell of an apartment. We cut to the interior of the apartment. A maid enters from the right and walks all the way across the hall to open the door and let Cruise in. She takes his coat and they exchange a couple of words before Cruise walks across the hall and over to the bedroom door. He knocks. Next, we cut to an interior of the bedroom. The door is opened and Cruise walks in. Finally the scene begins. And this is from the man who once spanned 5 million years with a single jump cut!<br/><br/>This scene is not an exception. The whole movie is like that.<br/><br/>This is compounded by the highly stylised acting that Kubrick came to love. In this movie, people often talk in slow motion. Nicole Kidman, in particular, is often required to break each sentence down into disconnected fragments, with agonising pauses between them. This is not her normal style and must have been specifically dictated by Kubrick.<br/><br/>Fine - except that much of the dialogue is achingly banal and unconvincing. Tom Cruise's flirtation with the two girls at the party is feeble enough, but those lines sound like Oscar Wilde in comparison to the ones exchanged by Sky Dumont and Nicole Kidman. What was Kubrick thinking of?<br/><br/>This is a valid question, because he probably knew exactly what he was doing. If the dialogue is banal it was because he wanted it that way. If the pacing is funereal it is because it was part of his design for the picture. I suspect that he wanted it to play like a lucid dream. Lucid dreams seem very normal when they are happening: it is only on reflection that you realise how strange they actually were. In Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick was probably aiming at an apparently realistic surface, but with subtly surrealistic undertones.<br/><br/>For me it didn't work. The surface is just too prosaic to hold the interest and the undertones are too studied and too calculated to be unsettling. As a result, the movie is cold and clinical when it needs to be passionate and engaged.<br/><br/>Ultimately, there is too much thought and too little feeling: too much technique and too little instinct.<br/><br/>I would draw a somewhat artificial distinction between movie artists and movie entertainers. It has nothing to do with quality: there are lousy artists and great entertainers. The difference is that artists make the movies they feel they have to make. Entertainers make the movies they feel their audiences want to see. <br/><br/>Unquestionably, Kubrick was an artist. He always followed his own Muse. For a long time I was happy to go along for the ride, but eventually his Muse took him to places where I couldn't follow.<br/><br/>From my perspective, his career after 2001: A Space Odyssey was mostly a story of decline and fall."

","Reading other user reviews it would seem that a favourite line is that EWS is supposed 'to make the viewer think'. Let me decode that line for you. It simply means that the movie, especially in terms of character, makes no sense whatsoever, so you are left wondering what in the world these people were doing. So yes. I thought. I thought, 'Wow - this is an incredibly bad film.' Again, reading other reviews, I am confronted with the idea that perhaps Doctor Bill's wanderings through NYC are really just some kind of dream or fantasy sequence. I don't know where this idea came from - perhaps the book itself but I can definitely say that it DOESN'T come from the film. There is nothing to suggest that you are in a dream or fantasy world - it is played straight. And because of this it fails miserably because neither character, but especially Cruise's, acts in a manner that follows normal human behaviour.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT Bill states quite clearly in the argument between he and his wife that he is not a jealous person. Nothing is particularly shocking about Alice's admittance that she wanted to have adulterous sex with a Naval officer that would suddenly cause this to change in Bill. And yet suddenly we now see Bill obsessing over the image of his wife engaging in adultery in his mind, and at this point the whole movie loses the plot. We see a grieving daughter that hardly knows him profess her undying love to him. Who knows why. He then decides to visit a prostitute - only to not go through with it when his wife calls, even though there is no indication of the relief of an escaped mistake. Despite this ' I can't cheat on my wife' moment - he then suddenly becomes incredibly curious about his piano friend's secret gig - that he goes to an awful lot of trouble to steal into the event to see for himself. Why? It just wouldn't have happened. Bill's character is not that sexual driven - he not that sexual compelled - hence him not having sex with the prostitute. He wouldn't have gone there. And when he did get there- he certainly would have gone running at the first sign of trouble - i.e., the masked woman telling him to get out of there.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about these strange behavioural choices. And I understand true 'tragedy' where a character is compelled by their character to follow their seeming fate through to a destructive conclusion - but there were no signs of destruction in Cruise's character - nor was there a fatal and destructive end. So it was all pretty pointless. Add to it an incredibly trite ending in a toy store where the moral of the story is 'we need to f**k.' If that sounds bad- let me assure you - it really really is.<br/><br/>In terms of sexual matters - overt and subtle and the machinations of sexual desire - David Lynch captures more truth in a single surreal scene in almost any of his movies than this one does in almost three hours. I don't really think Kubrick and sex go together at all."

","As I read through the comments, I have to wonder what is wrong with movies. When something this enervated gets made and discussed seriously, you want to laugh. But you're too aghast to do that, so you just keep watching. If Kubrick wanted to blow the lid off of sex, he's about forty years late. If he wanted to shock you with the idea that women love sex and fantasize about it, then again, I feel that he must have been locked in an emotional prison the last few decades. As with Full Metal Jacket, the ideas and themes are woefully out of date and overdone by the time Kubrick gets to them. Have you ever seen a movie about sex that showed it so clinically? And for god's sakes, it's supposed to be about a sex club, where is the heat. And then there they are just sparks from earlier movies. When Cruise goes to buy his costume, the shop's daughter is a flirty tease, a new Lolita? It's a yawn. And what of the casting of Cruise and Kidman. Did it add the personal touch that Kubrick was hoping for? I don't think so, because Kidman's character is so brittle and shrill and Cruise is down in the dumps. These two may not sex, but they certainly need some yoga. And if you take it, as some have written here, as some great work of art, what the hell what would you take from that? That sex is universal? That you should never go to a sex club unprepared? There are many moments when laughter is induced due to Kubrick's arch staging. My favorite is when Cruise is constantly being warned that he's in danger. Of course, since both he and the girl warning him, are wearing masks, you don't really catch much emotional weight. But it's funny to listen too the girl just the same."

","I mean no disrespect to the late Stanley Kubrick, but this film is a complete waste of time and money.  The acting wasn't bad, and there are a lot of talented people in this film.  The storyline was too strange to even fathom, and Class A actors (Cruise, Kidman, Pollack) gave good performances that couldn't save this ugly mess.  Upon leaving this movie in the theater, my date said, ""Not as bad as I thought it would be.""  That is the highest compliment he could pay this movie.<br/><br/>They say truth is stranger than fiction, but this is just ridiculously worthless.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, the only portion of this film that had any merit was seeing Cruise and Kidman in scenes together.

","After seeing YWS, my first thought was that Mr Kubrik, gifted movie maker that he was, had not the slightest feeling for the nature of the bonds between real people.  My second thought was that Cruise and Kidman were perfect ""actors"" for this movie, as they are both perfect facades with absolutely nothing behind those facades.  Interesting.<br/><br/>On reflecting on this movie overnight, my initial reactions are unchanged.<br/><br/>The only interesting thing about this movie is that so many people seem to have found it interesting and/or excellent.  Even Mr Ebert has found nice things to say about this goofy movie.  Maybe he didn't want to say harsh things about a dead man's last movie, or wanted to show respect for Mr Kubrik.<br/><br/>The movie utterly fails my first test for any movie - that it suspends disbelief, and draws me into the movie's reality.  Never during the movie was I drawn into it.  It was a long 2½  hour movie about Tom and Nicole being in a goofy Kubrik movie.<br/><br/>The story-line, about a man 10 years married going off into a wild sexual fantasy because his wife confessed that she'd lusted after another man the year before, might have been credible in 1920 Vienna.  It's just plain silly when the setting is 1999 New York.<br/><br/>I gather there was a lot of hullabaloo about digital alterations made to the orgy scenes. I don't understand the hullabaloo. The movie would have been no less goofy if full clinical details of sexual intercourse had been laid out on the screen.<br/><br/>I've greatly admired several of Mr Kubrik's movies, and will probably see them again.  This sad piece isn't one of them."

","Stanley Kubrick's last film was one of the most eagerly awaited and mysterious movies ever made. Ever since 1996, film fans have been waiting for the ""master's"" final film to make it to the big screen. Although, Kubrick had other projects in mind, it was obvious that with the huge gap between each film that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" would be the final chapter to his career.<br/><br/>Kubrick had stated that this was his best film and the two stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, both said that they were blown away by the film when they first saw it. The only reason I can think of that can explain this is that the three of them were involved in this project for so long that they had convinced themselves that they were making a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Since ""Barry Lyndon (1975)"", Kubrick's films have not matched the quality of his earlier masterworks and unfortunately, Kubrick has finished his career with his weakest and most obviously flawed film.<br/><br/>After an intriguing and very stylish opening, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" simply loses all it's direction. After coming home from a high-society gathering from which both Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice, have spent most the evening flirting, Alice tells her husband of a fantasy she once had about a man she saw, telling William that she would have given up everything, her marriage included, in order to fulfil that fantasy. This fairly unlikely and irrelevant anecdote, told with Alice's intention of keeping her husband from being over-confident about her marital fidelity, leads Dr. Harford on a bizarre and totally unbelievable walk through the streets of New York and into a sexual underworld where he himself has the opportunity to fulfil his own fantasies. A promising beginning to the movie disintegrates into an aimless and seemingly improvised story with many unnecessary scenes (Cruise's character seems to spend an eternity getting a costume for a mysterious and potentially dangerous sex orgy). Dr. Harford simply wanders from one weird character to another as the story becomes more ridiculous with a totally implausible explanation of it all being tacked on at the end. Also, the final piece of dialogue was probably one of the first things to have been written as it simply doesn't belong with what has happened before but seems to have been put there because it sounds clever and witty.<br/><br/>However, this IS a Kubrick film and anyone with any interest in films should see it purely for that reason. However, many people will be disappointed because Kubrick's movies are eulogised simply because he made them, ""Jingle All the Way"" would be acclaimed as a complex and thought-provoking masterpiece if Kubrick's name been attached to the credits.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick was one of the greatest and most naturally gifted directors of all time but unfortunately as he became more obsessive about the making of his films he seemed to lose the ability to judge whether his projects actually had a good story.<br/><br/>Here we have a great director working meticulously at a boring film, it's a pity he couldn't have finished on a higher note."

","Some observations:<br/><br/>1) As the movie starts, with that nonstop jazz waltz by Shostakovich playing and the New York Xmas party at an elegant townhouse with everyone in gowns and tuxes, and then, OMG—is Sydney Pollack in this movie?—I had to wonder if I was watching a parody of all those Woody Allen Manhattan melodramas. Only much funnier.<br/><br/>2) Directed by Kubrick and co-written by Fredric Raphael...who both had such seminal successes in the 1960s...this movie strikes me as the very last gasp of 1960s Eurotrash. The nudity + Venetian masks, opulent houses and clothes, the terrible acting...if only it were badly subtitled and starred Alain Delon instead of Tom Cruise, this could be a lost ""masterpiece"" by some forgotten Italian hack-director. (Except the 1960s Italian version would have been a lot more violent, bloody, and...fun!)<br/><br/>Alas, Kubrick made this movie exactly 30 years too late. I think maybe there should be a rule that 70-year-old filmmakers should NOT try to make ""erotic"" thrillers. The result is inevitably creepy, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>3) As the ""story"" progresses, with poor Tom unable to get laid and witnessing one buzz-killing scene after another, I couldn't help but think of that classic line by Edith Massey in Female Trouble, hysterically warning her son away from the straight world: ""The life of the heterosexual is a SICK and BORING life!"" Kubrick seems to have made this exercise to illustrate just that point.<br/><br/>4) Rich weirdos having a sex orgy-cum-black mass at a mansion in the middle of nowhere is a venerable Eurotrash cliché, but I think Roman Polanski had the last word on this particular motif in The Ninth Gate, also released in 1999, and an infinitely sexier, more sinister movie. If only Polanksi had made Eyes Wide Shut...sigh...<br/><br/>5) Was this Kubrick's pro-monogamy, post-AIDS rebuttal of Rocky Horror Picture Show? Tom & Nicole as Brad & Janet, tempted to stray from their marriage vows. But here, they don't. ""Don't Dream It, Be It"" is replaced by ""Think About It Constantly, Don't Dare Do Anything (You'll Die!)""...and of course, rich weirdos in costumes being kinky in a mansion in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>6) Why the Xmas trees everywhere? (Except of course at the mansion of the human-sacrificing Satan worshippers.) Because this is a Christian movie, duh!<br/><br/>7) Death looms over every scene of Tom seeking to get laid outside his marriage. At the first party, the naked woman (tempation) almost dies of an OD. When his patient's daughter kisses Tom, her dead father is right there in the room. The hooker Tom almost sleeps with (saved by a phone call from his wife) turns out to have tested HIV-positive; that was a close call! And of course, there is a human sacrifice at the masked ball; another close call, as it could have been Tom. At the end (while Xmas-shopping, and in the presence of their daughter) the two procreators face up to the inevitability of having sexual fantasies, but renew their ""covenant"" to ""f"" only each other.<br/><br/>8) Thus, Kubrick's final message to mankind: sex outside procreative monogamy = death.<br/><br/>And here are all these ""reviewers"" rattling on about how transgressive this movie is, when it could hardly be more conservative. Titillating, yes, but only so as to show a man walking through the dangerous fire of temptation and coming out the other side."

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>The story is extremely yet elegantly complex and thoughtful. There are numerous scenes that are symbolic and a handful of metaphors throughout the film. The story is deep and deals with the human condition as it relates infidelity. The ending in my eyes did seem a little weak.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman both do a great job at portraying their respective characters. Tom Cruise plays a vulnerable man who is torn between revenge and doing what is right. The only downside of the acting is that Tom Cruise doesn't play the doctor role very well. He just doesn't look like a doctor.<br/><br/>The music is the part of the film. The music perfectly blends with the film giving it a sense of wonder and mystery.<br/><br/>The pacing is a little slow and the runtime is overlong. The tone is mysterious, dark, and unsettling.<br/><br/>There is an abundant amount of nudity throughout the film. The nudity is there as a symbol. It symbolizes the temptation of infidelity.<br/><br/>Pros: Elegant and complex story, well crafted symbols and metaphors, good acting, stunning use of music, storing yet varying tone, and a great use of nudity as a symbol of infidelity<br/><br/>Cons: Overlong runtime, Tom Cruise as a doctor, some slow pacing, and a weak ending<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8.2"

","A man is drawn into an underground sexual group which puts his family in danger.<br/><br/>Based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella Traumnovelle (Dream Story) as a mystery thriller Stanley Kubrick's Eye Wide Shut at first glance doesn't deliver, with only a few taught scenes littered throughout as an elite secret society is discovered by the film's main doctor character played by Tom Cruise. However, as a visual and atmospheric piece of cinema it excels. <br/><br/>Interestingly, it's not the famous masonic segment or Bill (Cruise) and Alison (Nicole Kidman) relationship woes nor the basic thriller premise that ignite interest it's the plot's undercurrent, what is not said but implied and insinuated through looks, background items and actions that makes Eye Wide Shut so interesting. It can been seen to have many layers and can be inter-played and interpreted in different ways similar to, but more subtle than the likes of Revolver (2005) or Mulholland Drive. Just touching the surface, did Bill and Alison handover their daughter to the secret society at the end? Was Alison already a member? Was Bill's friend killed? Are the characters all lying to Bill? Kubrick presents endless questions, which answers only throws out more questions. <br/><br/>The camera work, lighting, sets, music and costumes are great. Supporting actors Sydney Pollack, Vinessa Shaw, Leelee Sobieski and Rade Serbedzija really shine. Oddly Kidman feels subdued throughout and Cruise (possibly cast too young) while reaching some emotional heights never seems moved by the bizarre nightmare he finds himself in, again this could be interpreted in different ways depending on your thoughts if you believe that there is more going on beneath the exposition or if it's taken at face value. Eyes Wide Shut arguably only really works if you deem more is going on than there actually is.<br/><br/>Overall, excellent atmosphere with a story that allows the viewer to draw their own conclusions. If you expect a conventional thriller you may be left disappointed but if you enjoy daydreams about chance and missed opportunities this may float your boat."

","Being a life-long Kubrick fan, I had very high hopes for this, his final film. And it did not surprise me that after the first viewing, I honestly didn't like it very much. (This is often the case with Kubrick's movies.) Yes, it has the classic Kubrick flourishes -- elegant, even lush, cinematography, musical refrains that stick in the brain like cockle-burrs, delightfully off-beat characters that you just don't see in other films -- but there was still something, well, missing.<br/><br/>Kubrick has always (at least since ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and excluding ""The Shining"") taken chances with casting. For ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" he used two fairly obscure actors named Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood; later choices included Malcolm McDowell, Ryan O'Neill, Marisa Berenson and Matthew Modine. They all worked (some would disagree) because Kubrick basically broke them down and molded them to suit his vision of the performance. But ""Eyes Wide Shut"" departs from the practice, employing Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, two of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the time. I understand the rationale -- Cruise and Kidman were married, though they'd split soon after ""EWS"" was released, theoretically creating a more believable pairing for Bill and Alice Harford. But Kubrick has never let such matters as star power or compatibility influence his choice of actors before ... why now? Was it because ""EWS"" is such a strange, potentially scandalous movie that Kubrick feared no one would see it otherwise? This seems unlikely for the director of ""Lolita"" and ""A Clockwork Orange."" <br/><br/>Whatever Kubrick's rationale, Cruise and Kidman simply don't work in these roles. I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, though I've liked him in certain roles. He just doesn't have the chops for a role this challenging. Kidman is a fine actress, but she comes off as flighty, shrill, angry and submissive by turns; there is no real emotional center to her character, and perhaps no actress could give her one.<br/><br/>The story itself is straightforward enough when you remember the source material: ""Traumnovelle,"" or dream story. Where in the story the dream begins is the question. I think it is when Bill comes home to find Alice dreaming; she wakes up, he falls asleep. There are other clues, such as the costume shop, which has been reconfigured when Bill returns his cowl the day after the party. Also, note how in the first half of the movie, women come on to Bill; in the second half it's the other way 'round (without success). I also have a theory that the movie is essentially Kubrick's second crack at Joyce's ""Ulysses"" (""2001"" being the first), but I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>Such notions only come with repeat viewings. This is the ONLY way to experience a Kubrick film. I've never liked his movies as much the first time as I did the second or third. He packs too much information into every frame for my brain to apprehend it all."
"ElMaruecan82","10","2","4","1 February 2011"," Kubrick's epitaph to Humanity ...
","There is something profoundly sad in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" ... is it because it's the last film of Stanley Kubrick, the Maestro, this gifted talent who put the word genius and movies together ? or because of this feeling of melancholic futility inhabiting the life of this couple who's got everything to be happy, yet seems to have registered to a formula where sex is an episodic necessity made of an ephemeral pleasure, and the rest is an ersatz of normality built around not to feel like something precious is being wasted ... indeed, boredom never seemed so real, so palpable, in a movie ironically made of movements and dialogs ... but the sadness is from this couple who chose ""deception as a necessity"" ... the boredom is inside, imperceptible, which makes it even more pathetic. Only Kubrick could have made Cruise and Kidman so charming and pathetic in the same time.<br/><br/>There is a kind of inner pathos in this bourgeois way of life, that would be scary if it wasn't so comic sometimes. Take Bill's insistence that he's a doctor as to give himself more credibility in some critical situations where self-importance might be helpful, Alice's morbid and paranoid pot-smelling approach to marital relationships, looking for an excuse to make her husband jealous, this jealousy used to spice up a meaningless life ... marriage as a false remedy and real catalysis of perversity (indeed, since perversity literally means, to deviate from). And that's the meaning of these acts, deviating from the road of monotony. It's not about sex but about feeling alive through desire, desire as a desire to be desired.<br/><br/>Felling alive through the desire to be desired? Why? Is that because it's so normal to be desired by a husband that the feeling of love becomes artificial, does it feel like belonging to a world with no room for passion, for heart, for life. A fake world. A dreamy world, like sleeping and waiting for the awakening. Like a lucid dream with no awakening, is that Alice and Bill's nightmare ? Is that marriage ? a mutual lucid nightmare ? Bill lives in the illusion of happiness when Alice lives in the pursuit of an adulterous desire. But Bill is too intelligent not to realize the sadness of his condition and Alice too in love, not to admit the futility of her quest. They need each other, because Bill has no alternative and neither has Alice. Hence the lucid nightmare, and the only way to wake up is honesty ... or an extraordinarily scary journey into the ""other world"".<br/><br/>Yes, the turning point is Bill's sexual ""adventure"" during the film, discovering sex outside the marriage, like an odyssey into the underground, the world of illegitimate sex, through an investigation consumed by a jealous flame lit by Alice. A world made of fantasy expressed during the most peculiar moments, a world of extreme decadence where sex sounds like sect ... from a philosophical commentary of the danger of marital routine, the movie turns into a fascinating thriller where things doesn't seem like the way they are, making us wondering what hides behind those creepy masks, those pagan psalms. A reminiscent of the paranoid feeling from ""Rosemary's Baby"" making us wondering if this is staged, or real, if its meaning is scary or if it is meant to be scary. The rituals we witness from Bill's point of view behind the thrills, highlight how we, humans, finally still need conventions even in the satisfaction of our lowest instincts, sex with a prostitute as a retributed service, sex as a fantasy hiding behind the curtain of reality, and sexual adult games so staged and sacred they become as institutional as marriage. Maybe we need to humanize our bestiality, to make it ridiculously human, not to feel like animals. Normal people go perverse to feel alive, and perverse people act conventionally to feel human, normality leads to perversity which fatally gets you back to normality. This is the whole vanity of perversity ...<br/><br/>And at the end, Bill realizes he didn't value his luck to be with Alice and Alice realizes that her thirst and desire of lust was just a burst of ego, that would have made things worse and scarier had they become reality. They were saved by their love for each other like Bill's faithfulness prevented him from sex with a prostitute that'll be revealed to have AIDS and Alice realizing through her fantasy that she indeed loved her husband, even if it was in a very sad way. How such a positive conclusion can be so sad? Maybe because the ""other world"" is even more dangerous and scary, and the illusory warm comfort of a castle made of bullshit stinks less than the reality of this bourgeois debauchery. Kidman sums it up quite well, when she expresses her disdain towards the ""Forever"" word, nothing is sure, let's just admit it, but not say it. Now, they feel normal but they must feel alive, by igniting the desire that was almost extinguished by those doubts and treacheries. They just need ... she uses the F word, probably less obscene and more sincere than ""Forever""<br/><br/>Oh yes, I really didn't expect these last lines, but they couldn't be truer and more powerful, they perfectly fit the film, and I guess after ""Don Corleone"" these will be my most memorable concluding lines from a movie, I didn't expect such an optimistic, or let's say bittersweet ending ... all I can say is that the Maestro knows how to fit a music with the theme of a film. Optimism and sadness, fear and nostalgia, desire and passion, wisdom and realization ... beautifully embodied in the beautiful Waltz that made me cry at the end, with my eyes wide open, before shutting them and letting one tear running on my face, a tear to the memory of an immortal genius called ... Stanley Kubrick."

"addict123","10","2","4","3 February 2009"," Kubrick's final masterpiece
","You've gotta hand it to Kubrick, the man never sold out, no matter how critically acclaimed his films were and no matter how much attention the film industry has paid to him, the man always worked to achieve perfection in every shot of every minute of every film he made in his forty years or so in the business. Eyes wide shut, his last feature, is a prime example of Kubrick's masterful directorial style, though not as critically acclaimed as other films he made such as 2001, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut deserves to be included among these, just showing that right up until the end, Kubrick was still making some of the greatest films ever. <br/><br/>Kubrick's direction is unquestionable, everything about this film is pure class, perfect shots, perfect locations, perfect story, and a perfect cast. I was sceptical about Tom Cruise at first, for reasons other than the obvious that according to the IMDb review submission is a prohibited word, but Cruise gives a great performance here, it is a shame he went on to be in such limp efforts as Valkyrie. Having the patience to work with Kubrick does make me respect Cruise more than I did, as it is common knowledge that Kubrick demanded up to 100 takes in some of his picture, explaining why he only released a catalogue of around 15 films over a forty year period. But Cruise's performance here is definitely the high point of his career, especially so in scenes where he has no dialogue, such as the orgy scene. Cruise wandering around the mansion observing depraved sexual acts while the piano instrumentals help add to the mysterious aura. As well as being the high point of Tom Cruise's career, the orgy scene I would say definitely rivals other famous moments in Kubrick's history in film, the camera moving through the house, its just encaptivating. <br/><br/>On top of Cruise's performance, all others cast in this film were clearly the only people you could cast in the film, perfect actors on perfect form, all roles were played magnificently, Kidman especially. I was unsure about her performance in the scene about half an hour in where Cruise and Kidman's characters were getting stoned together and arguing, but only to slight extent, throughout the film Kidman's role as Alice, the wife with sexual longings makes the plot all the more interesting, what with Cruise's character Bill's investigation into the orgy. <br/><br/>Another noticeable aspect of the film that adds to its impact is the score, the piano based instrumentals serves to add to the tension and the mysterious atmosphere, especially so during the orgy scene. The instrumentals make the film feel dreamlike, its almost as if the viewer is seeing it as though they were stoned. The instrumentals help to suck you into the world of the confused jealous husband, adding to the film's overall impact on the viewer. <br/><br/>The film was controversial at the time of release, but let me just say that if you think that sex and nudity detract from the artistic significance of a film, you're a f******g cretin. Some argue that porn is art, and the sex scenes and especially the orgy in Eyes Wide Shut proves this right. The orgy scene may be pretty daring, but that was the brilliance of Kubrick, there are no boundaries, all he cared about was making an amazing film. It really is a shame that Kubrick's gone from the world of cinema. While so many nowadays pander to the hordes of those who wish to see more limp, badly directed tripe such as the alien vs predator films or god forbid movie parodies like disaster movie and s**t like that. With people like Kubrick gone, we've got very few visionaries left. We've still got Lynch, the Coen Brothers, Cronenberg and others, but more and more people flock to features with no heart in them. While Kubrick's gone, his films remain a testament to his extraordinary directorial style. Eyes Wide shut is a prime example of the director at his best."
"adrongardner","8","2","4","19 January 2009"," Strange Love
","Like other Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is interesting but also a bit of a strange film. Perhaps that is being too definite or even unkind. Most of Stanley Kubrick's films are simply unlike any other. So yes, Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. There are some very bizarre, moments in the movie, but this is precisely what makes it work the way it does. Whatever faults the work may posses, and these too may be debatable, the movie is a memorable and complete work of originality.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is a classically constructed work that is both very simple but also complex and full of depth. It is mysterious, sexy and also quite funny. While the leads Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman aren't particularly sharp, there are some great performances in the varied cast, mostly from the side characters that pop in from time to time. Rade Serbedzija and Allen Cumming are two of the many standouts.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with the Arthur Schnitzler original novella, you'll find the core story to be very faithful. Without laying out a lengthy synopsis, which this complex film would require, it is safe to say this is essentially a fantasy film. Schnitzler's story confronted the fantasies, temptations and occasional ambiguities of marriage. More to the point, as a plot point in the film eludes to, the notion of fidelity.<br/><br/>The story unfolds in a series of small vignettes, all revolving around the notion of sexual attraction and the fantasy of such. It is never truly made clear of what parts we are seeing could be true, or what could be essentially a fantasy. As the final lines of the book and the movie lay out to us, Some things are real and others are just fantasy. It is a very clever and rich way for a story to unfold. Well that's the idea anyway.<br/><br/>Examining the film's strengths and weaknesses, you may find, there really is no way to find any solid faults. In execution, much like Full Metal Jacket, the movie has an uneven pace of plotting. While Barry Lyndon's deliberate method of story-telling was highly appropriate. The Shining's slow but steady pace also had its advantages. Here in Eyes Wide Shut, I feel the main flaw is the movie could move much faster.<br/><br/>Some individual scenes play out absolutely flat, most of these being the scenes between Cruise and Kidman. But even as they can feel flat, these scenes can also be seen as highlighting the monotony of their married life. But pacing wise, they just don't work. On the other hand, the pace and plotting are far more engaging than the similar, but abominable ""Mulholland Drive"" from David Lynch. <br/><br/>There are moments of great depth and visual power in this film. I don't see how more original a film can be made in fact. Eyes Wide Shut, I think, is fearless in examining the timeless issue of fidelity. When is fantasy good? When is it dangerous? What conversations with your significant other are better left unsaid? These questions are handled in a much more mature and profound way than the occasional schlock nonsense of a Woody Allen relationship film where people complain for an hour and a half. While Eyes Wide Shut is flawed in some ways, it is also a wonderful and memorable trip worth taking if you have an open mind and aren't expecting Sleepless in Seattle. Uneven but interesting and completely original."

Strange to say the least. Some say that he was punished for revealing too much. (Interestingly, Aaron Russo of America: Freedom to Fascism fame also died after he made his documentary exposing the Illuminati's tools of control, especially in the USA.) A movie well done and believable because it is so close to reality - the reality that most do not see and may never see.

"BobStage","8","2","4","18 October 2007"," A Legendary Film from a Legendary Director
","I have heard from people I know that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is either a great film or a bad movie. Having seen it myself, I would say that this is one of Kubrick's best. The film deals with the topics of sex, trust, secrets, and temptation. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays a doctor, married with a seven-year-old daughter in New York City. He takes his wonderful life for granted, until his wife admits to have almost cheated on him. Stunned by this piece of news, he is drawn into a dark world of temptation, whether it is with a prostitute, or with his patients' daughter. Finally, he is drawn to this mysterious mansion where an orgy of masked people satisfy their lust. <br/><br/>In the discussion of art and filming, this movie is a masterpiece. The atmosphere is so mysterious, so dark, and very strange. There are some scenes that sent shivers down my spine. One thing I liked in particular was the conversations Tom Cruise's character had with characters such as the hotel clerk, the Russian store owner, and his old friend. <br/><br/>One disappointment was Nicole Kidman. I just did not like her in this film, for a number of reasons. Her acting did not impress me as much as Tom's did. I was glad that much of the scenes were focused on Tom Cruise's character rather than Nicole's. She is probably the biggest reason that I would rate the film 9 out of 10 rather than 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>However, it is a very good film overall. Stanley Kubrick died believing that he had made the best movie of his life with ""Eyes Wide Shut"". I'd say he was not too far from the truth. This film is brilliant, and it is a pity that it was not as appreciated as it should be."
"Det_McNulty","10","2","4","24 July 2007"," Kubrick's Misunderstood Masterpiece, Constructed On A Daring and Visionary Scope Of Allegory
","Eyes Wide Shut has become infamous for a variety of reasons, since it is the last film Stanley Kubrick ever completed, and even then some still argue that Eyes Wide Shut never got the final cut which was intended by Kubrick before he deceased. I know many people who have seen the film for the individual reason of expecting numerous levels of erotically-charged sex. Fortunately, those viewers found something which was entirely unforeseen. Many critics ""flamed"" the film upon release, yet as each year goes by Eyes Wide Shut receives increasing critical acclaim. Another controversy was the fact that the film avoided its NC-17 by censoring the notorious orgy scene, which infuriated American audiences. Much mystery and speculation surrounds the film, making everything all the more fascinating. All of this and more comes down to one thing, the fact that Kubrick was a director who changed the face of cinema, revolutionising the way a film could be composed through even its most intricate of features.<br/><br/>It was during the production of Eyes Wide Shut -which lasted a considerable amount of time- that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were in the middle stage of their marriage. Two years after the release of the film the couple filed for divorce. In the film, they perform as a married couple who suddenly befall a dysfunctional relationship after the experience of one party. This leads the couple to become wary of one-an-other and a state of surreal desire washes over Dr. William Harford (played by Tom Cruise) who suspects his wife of adultery after she admits some dark secrets through drug-induced paranoia. After viewing Eyes Wide Shut, dissect the film's features carefully, given that you will gain much more hindsight.<br/><br/>Ironically, it was two years subsequent to Eyes Wide Shut that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman ended their 11-year relationship. I find this interesting, since the film details topics such as martial fidelity. The narrative is composed through a somewhat fractured, distant and cold environment, epitomised by the ""vigilante quest"" that Tom Cruise's character embraces. You quickly realise that you have become a fellow protagonist in the experiences of Eyes Wide Shut, never quite knowing what is around the most ambiguous of corners. The human psyche is a difficult emotion to convey through acting, let alone directing. When released, Eyes Wide Shut was considered out-of-touch with the film-making of its time, yet I would say the film was a long way ahead of the cinema being released during the '90s. For example, the film studies many social trends buried inside the infrastructure of modernised society. A book of sociology can be seen during one scene, perfectly placed to echo Kubrick's own motifs.<br/><br/>Arguably, Kubrick offers his fans a surreal take on a desire which affects every man and woman at some point in their life. Something that is important to be acknowledged when comprehending Eyes Wide Shut is that the majority of it was filmed on a soundstage at Pinewood Studios, London. At the time of release, critics argued that this made the film feel ""unlike New York"", yet this was an intention of the film. It echoes the surreal, dream-like state of the film, conveying the nature of a wide environment, which opens the viewer to personally analyse the features included within the gapingly open landscape. Eyes Wide Shut is a film whereby every aspect is open, such as the characters being exposed to let their own emotions walk free through an indistinct style of script-writing. The film is one which is open to viewer elucidation; even the title of the work has been debated as being the key to supporting the often cited ""dream theory"".<br/><br/>Built on an ambiance resembling that of a period-drama, the film actually has many elements of tension, some might even go so far as to say horror. When you look at a scene, like that of the infamous masked-orgy sequence there is a real dread that starts to build up within the viewer, since the environment is superficially unnerving, bizarre and ultimately quite terrifying. The danger presented within the scene is that of an authoritative nature, which does not manipulate the audience, but instead makes them think about the people behind the masks. Yet, it is notably apparent that the sequence is not only a study of lust, covetousness suspicion and the craving for psychological stability, but it is also metaphorically speaking- a look at high-class society members at a substantial advantage in power.<br/><br/>The copious use of the ""Kubrickian"" steadicam is that of significant poise, resonated by the trademark tracking-shots of Kubrick, which subtly scrutinise environments to a profoundly postured degree. The use of Italian architecture and sceptically shadowed lighting igniting the film's scenery and character's emotions plays an important role for much of the subtext. The abrasive, menacing score polarises the personality of the key players within the narrative, helping make everything all the more analytical in its refined style. A fundamental aspect of the feature is the allegory and allusions created by the use of paintings, sculptures, architectures and the dream-states which are personified through the screenplay. Another crucial basis of Eyes Wide Shut is the fact it is depicting barren, upper-class individuals who need to find a connotation to their lives, primarily due to the frustration that has been gained through boredom. This is all shown through the faultless acting from Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who both offer the finest performances of their careers, bursting with unquestionable flavour and chemistry. The expressionistic technicalities should be contrasted against the complex hypothesis of the film.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut deserves to be watched multiple times for the viewer to fully digest and appreciate the experience of what is an unprecedented, flawless and misjudged masterpiece which delves inside the darkest realms of human psyche. Even if you are one of the haters, I know for a fact that it is impossible for you to forget a film like Eyes Wide Shut."
"druss44121-1","9","2","4","14 June 2007"," Incredible... more layers each time I see it
","I love movies that have a basic story that you can follow, a basic narrative that isn't just completely random, but that when you look at it deeper, you see that it really is about something much different, and that the apparent thematic material and story are really clever disguises for something much more complex and interesting. The real meaning is there but you have to dig to find it. There is still something on the surface but it hides the real material, like skin covering the real meat and skeleton.<br/><br/>Now, I've been doing some reading about the cult and the Illumanti and all that and Kubrick's death and how it all relates. Let me first say that I completely agree that Eyes Wide Shut isn't REALLY about sexual exploration and the relationship of a couple who are having marriage issues. These are themes that have been explored way before EWS came out, and many critics jumped on the movie for not being original like most Kubrick films and beating a dead horse that had already been cinematically explored. But I think Kubrick was more intelligent than that. However, many conspiracy theorists jump on the fact that EWS is really all about cults (certainly ironic considering Cruise and Kidman's scientology ties) and how evil they are, and especially about how the Illumanti control the world and we are blind to it, with some even saying that EWS is Kubrick's warning of a new dark age to come. And blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Me, I see the film as actually a deep complex study on our fascination with cults and conspiracy theories as a whole, and of the unknown. It is inherint that there is something creepy about what we don't understand. The mysterious is never boring. I think a lot of people attribute stuff (say, 9/11 for example) to crazy theories because a) it makes everything seem more interesting and b) because it means responsibility is never in your own hands. This works with EWS very well I think. Firstly, Cruise and Kidman are portrayed as the 'vanilla American' couple getting bored with life and each other. Again, many conspiracy theories are made by people bored with their own lives that want excitement in believing that there is a BIGGER PICTURE out there and that they are one of the lucky few to really see what is happening, while everyone else is ""sheep."" This also fits in with Cruise's intent interest to go to the party he is told about that he knows is VERY exclusive. It is exciting and different, and it is something most people don't know about.<br/><br/>But then, secondly, is the fact that Cruise doesn't have to really take responsibility for his actions. He had drawn away from his wife, and was willing to cheat on her, but then the ""cult"" threatens his life and suddenly the issue of infidelity is MINOR when compared to the grand tragedy and mystery that he came upon. This can very much be symbolic of why such organizations have their powerfullness and mystery trumped up, and why conspiracy theories are so popular. It takes away the importance of our own actions in the big scheme of things. They can be the invisible scape goat we point to when we make our own mistakes. It's a way to gauge your own sins against far greater sins and to find absolution in this fact.<br/><br/>Even the title, EYES WIDE SHUT, fits in this paradox. People make themselves believe they have a greater view on life than all others while really they are the most blind themselves. The ones who think ""they get it"" and that everyone else is sheep are only fooling their own hearts.<br/><br/>I see the sun worshipping ""cult"" as a tool to further these themes and the journey the main character takes through both reality and fantasy, ego and anonymity. The real trick to it, and the trick to most of Kubrick's film, is that they are never about what you think they are about. If the film says one thing, it really means another.<br/><br/>To me a big theme of Eyes Wide Shut is responsibility, and the importance of our own actions as OUR actions (and the contrast between your actions being part of a larger sum and belonging to you on an individual level.) The blurred line between the real and the unreal, between boring old life and the fantasy of our dreams, is also very important as well for this film, especially in the fact that sometimes we want - and need - that line to be blurred. To discover more about ourselves and who we really are, and also to discover more about life and the experiences and sensations it can offer, we can find ourselves searching out dangerous roads. These confusing paths can lead many places. They can lead to a reality where up is down, where the blind see more than anyone else, and where those who appear enlightened actually are the most sightless of all. So to speak, this is a journey where you can take each step with your eyes wide shut."

"jackalchow","8","2","4","11 December 2006"," Kubrick's style is lasting and consistent
","I have watched 6 of Kubrick' s production so far, his style kept unchanged except for AI which was not completed by him.<br/><br/>The films of Stanley mostly reflect his philosophy to community and humanity. So most of the films will not have very abundant story content. He abandoned to develop the script in a way that our of audience's expectation(or what I feel unexpected is that those movies having an ending in such way). If you don't concern the showing time, you won't think that the story has just be completed in such a way. Instead, he portrayed in details about Tom Curise's psychological contradiction. <br/><br/>The career and appearance of Tom Curise acted made him to be very appreciated by females. The banquet was arranged to be shown in the beginning highly reflected the live of the couple. Suspect was also initiated in it, even the opening dialogue revealed the lurk of this couple who seems to have a perfect family.<br/><br/>Afterwards, once Tom knew that Kiman was almost cheated him, his self-struggle became stronger and the tension of the movie increased gradually, where the peak was reached by Tom attending the potential dangerous odyssey. But he still couldn't take the revenge to his wife as what he try to do was actually based on his jealousy (even he have never met the sailor, the flashback of his imagination about the sexual behavior between that guy with Kiman). He had noting to do and that's why such nightmare couldn't let him overcome his sincere to his wife. That's why he told everything to her as he couldn't play the game of cheating his wife by wearing the mask.<br/><br/>In addition, I am especially impressed by the continuous dissolving editing in the scene of Tom going to the sexual party. The taxi across from the crowded city to the silence area. With a dissolved way that made audience also fell into the dream around, as well as the mystery.Kubrick played the similar action to it by keeping the place be secret all the time including at the end of the film. It is unimportant to know the secret behind anymore(although many people like to know the truth of it:curiosity for all). That is what the master ability of achieving this. <br/><br/>By doing such action, the film won't be too long and the main message will be shown clearly rather than the audience changing the focus on that incident.Next,it made the crossover between reality and dream: one of the philosophical argument in the world. People usually confused and mix real world and dream, they may even don't know which one is real. Probably what we think our daily live is real one but the fact may still be hidden(Martix reflected more about this topic)."

","After watching Eyes Wide Shut (EWS) I found myself extremely divided over how to properly evaluate it.<br/><br/>Let me start by looking at what I consider EWS's strong points.<br/><br/>Aesthetically EWS is a stunning film. Kubrick's signature tracking shots and creative use of colour and imagery make for many memorable scenes. Lots of symbolism is employed, such as the sexually charged paintings, and of course the wide assortment of masks and costumes. The soundtrack is also perfectly suited to the atmosphere of each scene. The use of a slow but rising piano beat is particularly effective at conveying the mystery and uncertainty that Tom's Cruise's character finds himself in and I found myself replaying it in my head for a long time after my first viewing.<br/><br/>Now for the not so good.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with EWS is its often painfully slow pacing. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, EWS has very little actual dialogue, instead relying largely on imagery to guide you through the journey. The problem is that what dialogue there is is not very interesting or relevant. Why does Tom Cruise's character have to repeat every bloody thing that others tell him? This combined with the at times agonizingly slow delivery of the lines frustrated the **** out of me. I can understand what Kubrick was going for (a dreamlike surreal atmosphere) but he fails to sell it clearly and convincingly enough, and the end result is tediousness rather than suspense.<br/><br/>Honestly this is a real love hate relationship for me. EWS does grow on you a bit with repeated viewings; still a lot of people will likely be turned off by the pacing. The film is still better than a lot of what's out there, and is definitely worth a look for fans of Kubrick's other work. Overall though, I felt it was one of his weaker efforts."

","Eyes Wide Shut was Stanley Kubrick's final masterpiece in which he left the audience for the last time with a feeling that cannot be put into words. The film takes off after Alice(Nicole Kidman)gets angry with her husband Bill(Tom Cruise)because he has never been jealous of her in their marriage of nine years. In order to give Bill a wake-up call she reveals to him an event that happened a year before while they were on vacation. Alice tells him that she was attracted to a navy officer,who she saw, so much that she could have given up her entire life with Bill and their daughter if the officer had wanted her for just one night.<br/><br/>This upsets Bill and he begins seeing images in his mind of his wife and the officer together. He only comes to fully believe that a woman could leave her man for another man she does not even know when he makes a house-call to one of his patients. There the woman, who's father has just died, tells Bill that she loves him and kisses him. Dr-Bill can't understand why this woman has fallen in love with him even though they barely know each other. Right after this, Bill meets the woman's fiancé Carl, who is a guy just like Bill, and then it really kicks in that what Alice was telling him could possibly happen.<br/><br/>Infuriated with his wife, Bill sets off on a sexual odyssey that night for revenge, but also discovery. His journey leads him to a prostitute, and to a secret mask and costume party that he should not have attended because he not only puts one woman's life on the line, but also puts himself and his family in grave danger.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick will have you hanging on every single word in every single scene in total suspense in this haunting film. It is one of Kubrick's best films,even though they are all magnificent in their own way. The screenplay is superb, the acting is intense, and the direction is unbelievable. There are all the trademarks of Kubrick's art present in Eyes Wide Shut and the atmosphere is utterly chilling. You have never seen Tom Cruise in a role like this either. This film is a must-see because it is perfectly shot. It comes from a director who has left his mark on the film world and will never be forgotten.<br/><br/>See this film!!!"

"FilmSnobby","3","2","4","5 July 2004"," Moldy. Very moldy.
","Just the other night, I saw this movie again on HBO, which has been re-running it for some inexplicable reason. My dislike of it hasn't changed in the 5 intervening years since I first saw it. Although it's not quite the UNMITIGATED disaster some claim, *Eyes Wide Shut* is still pretty ludicrous: there will be no later revising-upward of critical opinion, a la<br/><br/>*2001: A Space Odyssey*. It will rather be remembered for more morbid reasons; to wit, for killing Kubrick and sundering the marriage of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.<br/><br/>For the real-life peripherals surrounding the movie were more interesting than the movie itself -- which, I'm sorry to say, is really, really, really old hat for cinephiles. I realize that this film and its director have a huge fan-club, as evidenced by hundreds of glowing -- if naive -- reviews on this website, but please spare me the lectures that my dislike of the film indicates that I ""just don't get it"". No, YOU don't get it. *Eyes Wide Shut* is ""art-house cinema"" for the lazy people, for the people who can't be bothered to force themselves to watch all those subtitled foreign movies from several decades ago that have already, and AMPLY, covered this same material. Doubtless, these same lazy people haven't bothered to read much Schnitzler or even Freud, for that matter. And thus, they're not bored to death by *Eyes Wide Shut*. They see ""genius"", while I'm looking at the same old thing. I dunno, but from where I sit, Schnitzler's psycho-sexual theories, while provocative in the mid-Twenties when he wrote the story on which this film is based, are anachronisms in today's culture that boasts of an 50%+ divorce rate. And so what's the result of Kubrick's unwieldy update of 1920's-Vienna to 1999-New York City? Total absurdity, when we realize that Tom Cruise's character, Bill ""I'm-A-Doctor"" Harford, is actually amazed that his wife once had a sexual fantasy involving a Naval officer. The whole ludicrous situation is laid out in a ludicrous scene, in which we also learn that Nicole Kidman is so unsatisfied as a wife that a mere GLANCE from the Navy guy would've caused her to abandon her husband and young daughter. I don't know any women who would behave in such a way. (I've only read them in Freud.)<br/><br/>This all drives poor Dr. Harford quite mad (dear God, perhaps she even had sexual partners BEFORE I EVEN MET HER!), and he hits the street (an unrecognizable New York City -- the movie was filmed, obviously, in London), looking for a good time. Or something. I guess the idea here is revenge against his wife's dirty, dirty thoughts. Or something. Without belaboring the plot-points, let's just say that he ends up visiting hookers, nubile daughters of haberdashers, among others, but Kubrick doesn't permit our hero<br/><br/>(TOM CRUISE, okay?) to actually score. But then, the whole silly thing is unlikely in the first place. Eventually the movie gets to its centerpiece: a campy orgy straight out of a De Sade spoof, with waving incense, chants, creepy electro-organ music, and hundreds of interchangeable naked girls wearing only high-heels and really cool Venetian masks. We are, I believe, meant to nod wisely at Kubrick's ""commentary"" concerning the impersonality of sex outside the sacred marriage bond. *Eyes Wide Shut*, in others words, is a movie made by a happily married man of 4 decades.<br/><br/>By the time we get to the orgy, the bored cinephile's only interest is considering how much better Fellini would've done this sort of thing. After all, Fellini, though sloppy, was a true surrealist . . . and along those lines, Bunuel would've made a sheer masterpiece of this movie. But Kubrick was inspired, so many years ago, by the dour Antonioni: they each certainly had their share of bourgeois baggage to bring to their work. The point being, this is a movie without any heat, without any fun. The focus is on the backlash of erotic freedom, with the supposed irony of our hero's not being able to actually enjoy any of that freedom during the course of the film. Some here have found this to be profound, and perhaps it would've seemed more profound to me if this film had been a period piece set in, say, the 1800's -- a time in which sexual autonomy was strictly a deeply private idea to be smothered in guilt and the flames of Hell. But in 1999's New York, it's a weird and ultimately pointless anachronism. And sadly it's not even redeemed with the usual photographic brilliance one expects from Kubrick: the picture is grainy, gritty, and even glaring (you keep having this urge to turn down either your color or the contrast on your TV set), overly schematic in terms of ""color-coding"" (blue lighting indicates chasteness; red lighting indicates erotic danger). Indeed, the whole movie is full of shallow symbols a la the lighting -- the perfect movie, in other words, for film grads writing their thesis. What a bore.<br/><br/>I'll refrain from adding in-depth to the countless comments about the inanity of the dialogue and the tepidness of the performances. I'll only say this much: not much of a surprise here, given the director's track record with bad ""star"" performances in favor of quirky minor players who enliven things a bit in his movies. Needless to say, these bit parts by talented character actors add just about the only enjoyable elements to a sad last at-bat from Stanley Kubrick."

","I can't remember at the moment who said (or wrote) that a director, when he ceases to be an artist, becomes a photographer, but this movie amply proves it. Gorgeous to look at, it's nothing but a moving Playboy centerfold; no real sexuality, just empty echoes of it. The only good thing about it is the choice of both leading actors - they are just as plastic as they were obviously supposed to be.<br/><br/>There is one real drama here - the tragedy of Kubrick the old man. I don't think it would be hard to explain and analyze it, but I am not going to try; I respect Kubrick far too much for all the great movies that kept inspiring me through many a decade. This one only made me sad."

","I have only ever fastforwarded through three movies in my lifetime. This is one of them. The plot is interesting enough, but the pacing is so slow. There are far too many dramatic pauses, and let's face it, no one in the world speaks as slow as Nicole Kidman does in this movie. Speaking of good ol Nicole, I am amazed that the Academy was able to forgive her enough after this film to give her an Oscar. She is absolutely terrible in this film except when she is not speaking. Which, since she makes so many pauses, is quite a bit of the time. Cruise is ok, nothing spectacular. Here's my suggestion to those of you who haven't seen it: 1. Don't spend your money on renting or buying it. 2. If you can get it for free, go for it. But 3. Fastforward to the part where Nicole and Tom are smoking pot. Stop and watch. Fast forward to the part where Tom meets his old med school buddy. Stop and watch. Fast forward to the part where he arrives at the orgy palace. Stop and watch. Fast forward to the point where Tom meets up with Ziegler. Stop and watch. Turn off the movie. Believe me, you won't be missing anything."

","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>Sex is bad.  It's so bad that even imagining having any would be disastrous. Tom Cruise hits the streets after his wife tells him of a fantasy she had of another man.  How dare she?!  Everywhere he goes, he is denied.  A teen nympho, a hooker, even an orgy end in a complete bust for him.  And this is Tom Cruise we're talking about.  If he can't have sex at an orgy, he must be floating through a nightmare.<br/><br/>This film has one fatal flaw.  It's boring.  Terribly boring.  The pauses are agonizing.  The scene where they are waiting for the guard at the gate while the piano hits one note over and over is torture.  Any merit this film has is drowned out by the sheer nothingness of the action. <br/><br/>
I still love the trailer for this film.  The Chris Issak song was great over mysterious, sexy pictures of Cruise and Kidman.  It was sold as a sex thriller.  I guess it wouldn't have made too much money if it was sold as the impotent dream movie."

Sure, it's an engaging story, but none of the outcomes or discoveries really excite you or interest you.

I literally feel no emotion over this film as I usually do with Kubrick films.  It had a definate Kubrick-ian eerie atmosphere, but the content just wasn't there.<br/><br/>I don't hold any of the performances responsible for the mediocrity of this movie.  They all did just great.  Cruise was right there, Kidman as stunning and moving as usual.  I think they were a natural to do movies together and would have liked to see more.  In fact, it might be a true test of their acting skills to do another film together now.  A romance story and must make it believable.  Actually, I wish they'd get back together.  Call me a sap, but I just liked them together.  Oh well.<br/><br/>I guess I have to take issue with the story itself.  It just did nothing for me.  It was there, then it was over.  It had a plot, just not an interesting one.  It seemed like it had twists but still needed twists.  I don't know, I just wasn't really thrilled.  Maybe I'll try watching it again some time just to see the two together again and maybe there'll be something that grabs me.<br/><br/>I give it 5/10 pts.  5 for the performances of the cast and crew.

"tobiasn","2","2","4","2 July 2002"," ill-conceived, pretentious, and Tom Cruise is miscast
","Kubrick grew up in the Bronx, NY. It is possible that in junior high school some other boy told Stanley a fantasy about orgies on Long Island, NY (where richer people lived). Perhaps as an older man - after a liftime in England - Kubrick retained such a memory, and glued onto it another idea he had - to cast a real-life couple as a couple in a movie.<br/><br/>There is hardly another explanation how such a great film-maker could make such a piece of incoherent nonsense. While Tom Cruise is an under-rated performer, his specialty is aggressive, high-energy, and relaxed characters. To cast Cruise as a repressed older NY physician lacking in imagination was colossally wrong. In 30 seconds anyone can think of a better choice (John Heard, or Jeff Goldblum spring to mind).<br/><br/>Kubrick's earlier movies were marked by the realistic and detailed depictions of technology and professions. Compare this movie, which completely fails to depict what is like to be a doctor.<br/><br/>Of course, if Kubrick had wanted to make a real movie, in order to introduce conflict he would have had his doctor discover the practice of sleeping around with female nurses, or something. But no, it had to be a secret society of orgiers! Given the name of the movie, is this society supposed to have opened this doctor's eyes? That's so absurd an idea as to be almost laughable.<br/><br/>I am no prude, I like looking at women as much as the next guy, but here some strange almost-lechery seemed to have compelled Kubrick to put sequence after sequence of female half-nudity, all of it gratuitous and dull. Maybe it was Kubrick's film-maker instincts, maybe he knew that showing so much flesh would con all the young fools into thinking this was a good movie."

","Kubrick's last film is an empty work, no matter how some critics try to complicate it.<br/><br/>The problem of this movie is that nothing really happens.

","this is no ""Dr. Strangelove"", nor is it ""A[n] Clockwork Orange"".  It lacks the profundity that it so desperately strives for.  When an artist shoots for deep meaning on film and misses, the result isn't pretty.<br/><br/>To my eye, the truest scenes were the most mundane; and the best acting by the child in the family scenes.  It may well be that a man hearing his wife's confession would act as did Tom Cruise's character in this film but the bizarre nature of the action failed the Oscar Wilde dictum concerning the willing suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Many persons who commented on this movie take pains to say that the story is not about sexual depravity but about the nature of the relationship between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in the film.  My view is that only exceptional storytellers in rare, inspired moments can tell a story with so little reference to the theme and yet let the audience feel as though they have discovered it for themselves.  It can happen, but Kubrick sadly did not attain this in his final work, and the result is that most of the film does not drive the story or explain the theme but is simply excess.<br/><br/>I also agree with many who thought the soundtrack was more annoying than mood-setting.<br/><br/>All in all, I feel that Stanley Kubrick reached for the stars and came up without them, and without even the moon, rather simply with a vacuum."

I belong to the minority who loved the film.<br/><br/>A major problem for most viewers was that most viewers expected a film full of sex and nudity. Sex and nudity serves only as the backdrop of the film.<br/><br/>
From the password ""Fidelio"" to the fact that two married individuals chose to play the main roles, there are clues that this fascinating film is all about reaffirmation of faith in marriage and trust, on jealousy and redemption of faith in marriage..small but important facets of the cosmic reality of our lives. The trail of thought is connected to several facets philosophical innuendoes provided in ""2001"".<br/><br/>Pook's minimalist score is another highlight of this great film.

","Can an actor's character mask ever become his real-life face?  It would seem so, judging by Tom Cruise's ""Special Feature"" interview on the DVD of ""Eyes Wide Shut."" <br/><br/>As Cruise reflects upon his experiences in making the film and his relationship with Director Stanley Kubrick, one senses the actor hasn't fully shed his role.  The low tones of his voice, the deliberate and interminable pacing of his lines, and the introspective and diffident attitude and mannerisms of his delivery all seem to be those of Dr. William ""Bill"" Harford carried over to real life.  Indeed, at one point in reflecting upon his first learning of Kubrick's death, Cruise appears to almost uncontrollably recapitulate the start of Dr. Bill's emotional ""release"" scene from the film's climax.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's only natural, after having spent eighteen intense months (longer including the preparatory period) with this character, being in every scene, and all the while under the powerful influence of Kubrick.<br/><br/>Anyone who might think acting is a fairly easy can view this interview footage and observe the challenges demanded by the craft. When Laurence Olivier was once asked whether it was better to take the character home or leave it at the stage door, Olivier responded the latter.<br/><br/>Perhaps techniques in de-programming might be as beneficial as actual character development to the actor's work.  At least one hopes Mr. Cruise will follow this up with some light comedies."

","Eyes Wide Shut, at its basic level, is not a very good film.<br/><br/>Different genres of film traditionally have different associated levels of expected verisimilitude.  The degree of acceptable ""reality"" from a ""Star Wars"", for example, is understandably different than what one would rightly expect from a ""Das Boot"".  On this level, alone, I felt the characters, situations, reactions, motivations and dialog in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to be woefully lacking in a connection to the real world.  Not only were the characters themselves unrecognizable as ""real"" people, their reactions were seemingly random without any firm basis of character.  The sub-plots were largely undeveloped and, on a whole, felt askew and contrived.  Dialog was stilted and, in many cases, seemed to be more forced soliloquy than conversation.  The use of the digitally added ""figures"" in the infamous orgy scene became so repetitive that it bordered on the comical.  (By the way, this was done with much greater dramatic and comical effect in the title sequence of ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"").<br/><br/>I place much of the blame for the weakness of the work on the screenplay itself.  I have not read the novel the story was based upon (nor am I now inclined to do so), but I was left wondering why so many talents were so intent on making this poor film.<br/><br/>To remember Kubrick's greatness, look to his other works, and leave ""Eyes Wide Shut"" deep in the vault."

","I can't imaging anyone who is not married, or who has never been in a serious, long term relation ship, ""getting"" this movie.  Not for kids, nor the action movie crowd, or those looking for an erotic thriller, it is one of the finest films ever made.  Visually stunning, and very sure of itself, it either speaks to you...or you will be bored stiff.  The key to understanding this movie (if understanding is the right word) is the line that Alice delivers very near the end, after Bill's confession to her.  She says something like, ""We are all fortunate to survive all our adventures, whether they are real or imagined"".  I can't think of a more profound statement in any film.<br/><br/>It is most interesting to view this film beside ""Letter from an Unknown Woman"", by Max Ophuls,the only other filmmaker Kubrick cited as an influence.  There, Joan Fontaine chases after Louis Jourdan, a pianist(hmmm).  She follows him, fantisizes about him, gives up her family and honor for him...and he barely remembers her name.  EWS can easily be seen as another take on a similar theme.  Dr. Harford figures out in 48 hours, what it took Fontaine's character a lifetime ... <WARNING: This is only a spoiler for ""Letter from an Unknown Woman>... and neither she, nor the pianist survive their adventure.<br/><br/>If you don't think you will enjoy this movie, you probably will not, so don't bother.

","Found the movie to be a total failure - really one of the worst movies I've ever seen, for the following reasons:   <br/><br/>1. Basic acting and mechanical problems - the writing was laughably bad, and the actors were directed to be wooden - they took five beats between every line, and were almost devoid of emotion (you have to assume, given Kubrick's habit of doing a hundred takes, that he *chose* these wooden performances as being what he wanted... Tom Cruise has too large a body of work to assume that what is on the screen is representative of what he would normally do). <br/><br/>
As to the writing: there was this motif of answering almost every question with a repeat of the question, after a few beats, until finally this friend of mine was able to say this sentence after a line by Cruise to Kidman: ""If she answers by repeating his entire question in the form of a declarative sentence one more time, I'll kill myself..."" whereupon that is exactly what happened.  in another scene, Cruise walks into a room, featuring an obvious shot of a small Christmas tree. I say aloud ""nice tree""... after which Cruise's character says ""nice tree...""....  I mean, farcically bad, like how many times did Cruise's character show his wallet ID card and say ""I'm a doctor"" to how many people?  <br/><br/>2. Structural problems  so, the basic conceit is that the wife's dreams are dead-on realistic, while the husband's reality is dream-like... wonderful. But by the time you clue in to this, you just don't care, since nothing that actually happens makes any sense. So, of course, you can say it's *supposed* to not make sense, since it's ""ream-lie"", but that doesn't really help, since it is, actually, reality.  why would the people at the orgy care so much if someone crashes their party? they're all in masks! who the hell would know who was there?  why would the costume-store owner go from wanting to kill his daughter for being a slut, to offering her to Cruise's character?  why would anything that happened, happen? why would Kidman's character report those dreams to Cruise, in such a brutal, nasty, straightforward way - and then why would she cry after Cruise's character told her what happened, since nothing actually happened? He wasn't unfaithful with any of these prostitutes or other women he met. <br/><br/>
3. the music - unbelievably annoying  <br/><br/>4. the scene around the pool table - neither character knew what they were saying, or why they were saying it - nothing that happened made any sense, on any layer that the movie was trying to work on.  <br/><br/>5. the mask on the bed - I *wish* there was some hiding of emotion, or layer of deceit, but both of these people told each other everything, to the detriment of their relationship. If anything, the lesson is say less.   I have to go now. I'm a doctor. Here, let me show you this card to prove it."

","EWS is an unfortunately incoherent adaptation of a book whose main ideas are a half-century behind the times. Kubrick applies his mighty skills to making a movie out of it, but is betrayed by his own lack of focus. This main fault is compounded by shaky performances by Kidman, who seems to be doing ""The Three Faces Of Alice"" and Cruise, who stares stoicly or covers his face whenever called upon to express emotion (except once when he sobs). In addition, there is the weakly obvious screen-play (which Kubrick co-wrote), and a leaden pace and self-indulgent editing that makes it seem even longer than it's nearly three hours. The film is one of Kubrick's least successful efforts, but given the level of his work, it's still better than most recent films, and worth a look.

I liked it even more after it was over and the film was wrapped up and I had the whole picture. What a fascinating movie!

","Many people will rebut criticisms of this film by stating that it's a Kubrick movie and not meant to have the elements present in traditional Hollywood films with mass appeal.  The truth is, this film spends well over an hour building up to its premise, and when it finally gets there, the characters spout off cliche lines such as ""you know not what danger you are in here"".  And as I was watching the film ridiculously and boringly meander through its premise, I couldn't help but think, ""We are never going to find out what danger he is in, are we?""  I thought this because the film sets up a mystery with the potential to have a complex solution, yet it was evident from the laziness present in the writing up until that point, that it would be too much work for the screenplay's authors (one of whom was Kubrick) to formulate an intelligent solution to its own mystery.  This lack of explanation sometimes works in movies, i.e. not knowing what's in the suitcase in Pulp Fiction allows for fun speculation.  However, there is no such desire to speculate here, because as the film continues to sloppily drag on, the only thing you'll speculate on is when you'll finally get to leave the theater."

And this film traumatizes me just like that. I was too psychologically affected that I did not bother washing my dishes and read my book before bed (my daily routines that I regularly enjoy). That is needless to say this film struck me to the core, and I am still shook by it. It is Kubrick's last venture into the study of humanity and human nature.<br/><br/>We the audience are embarked on a sexual odyssey with our protagonist to which we explore the sexual subconscious of the human psyche, represented through material events acting as archetypes. Sex is a lot of things; it can be marriage and fertility, the emancipation from virginity and empowerment of women's position in men (as the conversation between the Hungarian man Alice indicates), it can be solace and comfort for pains (Marion kissing Dr. Bill after her father's death) , it can be a mean for financial survival (prostitution), it can be kink (the two men having sex with the store owner's daughter while dressed in women's garments), and the masonic elites ritual performed in a dark and sinister proportion. Then there is the creepy mysterious soundtrack that I'm guessing was composed in two notes, the tune keeps ringing in my head as if a nightmare. The film leaves a lot of questions and hidden meanings that I am determined to muster out an answer and interpretation, but rest assured that I may probably will never watch it again.<br/><br/>Kubrick's films have always discussed radical and controversial topics which are visual literary discussion into human behaviorism and subconscious. Thank you Stanley Kubrick for everything, and I hope there are people like me who should praise and uphold his films and legacy, and to make sure they are way up there with the titans of art."
"sirenebern","9","0","0","10 June 2020"," Layered, dark fantasy from the maestro Kubrick
","I watched ""Eyes Wide Shut"" again last night after first seeing it years ago. Stanley Kubrick's final film is not going to be entertainment for the mass-market audience, who may have been curious about the film's sex scenes based on the trailer set to ""Bad, Bad Thing."" In fact, this film is a surreal, layered, dreamlike exposition on society, social class, marriage, fidelity and truth more than it is about sex, although sexuality, sexual behavior and sexual mores are the prisms through which Kubrick tells this dark fable. In 1999, Tom Cruise was certainly already at the zenith of Hollywood mainstream stardom, so it's interesting that he took this role in order to work with Kubrick, and that Kubrick wanted to cast him as the idealized vision of a square, upstanding, white-bread Manhattan physician devoted to his beautiful, and very bored wife, played by his real-life spouse at the time, Nicole Kidman. I read that Kubrick wanted a real-life couple to explore the darker aspects of married life and sex in the story, and it sounds like he put them through some psychologically painful experiences to elicit the tension required for the two characters. Cruise plays Bill Harford, a man whose ego is absolutely shredded when his wife, Alice, reveals that she wanted to cheat on him the year before. This knowledge leads Bill to embark on a weird night of sexual misadventures that leave him emotionally shattered. Bill is wealthy, handsome and intelligent, but the film shows that he's still a pawn in a decadent, corrupt society where there are far wealthier, far more powerful and manipulative men in charge who use him when it's convenient, and use and discard very beautiful (and frequently naked) women without a fleeing thought for their humanity. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" left me with the impression that there is a light and dark side to life and humanity, and that at certain times, we cross back and forth between them, sometimes with titillation and delight, and sometimes with horror. Cruise's Bill is emotionally emasculated by his wife's desire to cheat and by some of his experiences on his night of wandering through New York's sinister side. It's funny how he keeps showing everyone his New York medical license to be sure everyone knows he's a doctor, so you should trust and respect him! I wonder if Kubrick especially liked the fact that Cruise was a few inches shorter than his wife to highlight his feelings of inadequacy (which neither Bill nor Cruise should have, certainly). I found Alice rather cold, possibly written that way, but it felt believable too, as she seemed like a woman who felt unfulfilled and marginalized in her marriage and life, sort of the stereotype of the wealthy doctor's wife whose husband spends long hours at the clinic instead of with her. She lives in a gilded cage but feels trapped and bored. Kubrick famously used color and lighting to great effect, including scenes shot in blue light and scenes soaked in red. The orgy scene felt rather tame for all the fuss. Maybe Kubrick did not intend for there to be any fuss. I feel that the scene was more a metaphor for class and sexual exploitation in our society. Shame on the MPAA for insisting that CGI people be inserted to partially block the view of some sex scenes. Let adults watch Kubrick's film unedited. I was able to view the unedited version of the sequence online, and there was nothing shocking at all. No need to censor it. The blocked view scenes look awkward."

"atlasmb","10","0","0","2 March 2020"," A Classic
","One of the most underrated films of all time, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the result of an intense collaboration between Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and Stanley Kubrick. Its title suggests an elusive meaning, a conundrum. And that is what the film delivers as presented from the viewpoint of its protagonist, Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise).<br/><br/>Kubrick delivers a visually stunning piece of cinema---with its striking emphasis on color and light---wrapped around an odyssey that is laid over a tale of domestic disquiet. Just as some films include numerous memorable quotes, EWS includes numerous images that stick with you forever.<br/><br/>The theme of the film is about the structures of society and its conventions, like marriage, which overlay the raw realities of the human psyche. It is a film of manners that lies like a thin veneer over the uncertainties and brutalities of uncivilized man that always lurk where we dare not look. But EWS dares and provokes us to follow its exploration of the seams of civility, the indulgences that few can afford. It seems to say, like Eliot'sPrufrock, ""Let us go then, you and I..."" I refer you to the rest of that stanza which seems so relevant here.<br/><br/>The film also has a cadence that draws you in. Moments of calm and enchanting certainty are punctuated by scenes of confusing happenstance and a nagging insistence that some upheaval impends. Dream-like beauty always seems to be on the verge of interruption. This is a meditation on the investments and sacrifices we make to achieve happiness, success, or the tranquility of perceived certainty.<br/><br/>EWS includes some wonderful supporting performances in addition to its captivating starring roles. Particularly noteworthy is the performance of Leelee Sobieski, who plays a girl of mysterious circumstances and intentions.<br/><br/>Perhaps one day this film will sit atop the popular lists that enshrine the best of cinema where it deserves to be."

Then, it is about trying to get out of the rabbit hole after experiencing this.
This movie is built around atmosphere and is really not supposed to be realistic, but rather the isolation that covers the frame or the excess is supposed to give a feel for this strange world that the characters inhabit. The films high amount of sex is used more as a metaphor for the other parts of ourselves that we do not want the rest of the world to know about.

","Stanley Kubrick was a genius... of sort?<br/><br/>What is Eyes Wide Shut about? Is it about moral decay of the upper class? Is it about marriage ? Is it about jealousy? Is it about the rules of society (something like ""there's always a bigger fish"") or about secret masonic-illuminati clubs? I often hear people say about different directors/authors that ""His/her films/books are about everything"". Well if someone filmed about everything - it was Kubrick, for sure. Eyes Wide Shut, just as Space Odyssey, just as Full Metal Jacket, - is about everything and about nothing at the same time. It's open for interpretations and almost every viewer will, most likely, even unwillingly, interpret it in their own personal way. I say ""almost"" because Eyes Wide Shut is a long film, as most of Kubrick's works, and many people just don't get sucked in by it as much as Kubrick adorers do. And this film is a trance even more than the rest Kubrick films (apart from 2001, perhaps).<br/><br/>Now, a lot of people call Stanley Kubrick a stylist. I'm not sure I can agree with that most of the times. He was sophisticated and precise in what he wanted the viewer to be able to see in the shot and where he wants the viewer's attention. But at the same time his films feel almost raw. The shots are very simple. And this is especially the case with Eyes Wide Shut.<br/><br/>Still, the ritual scene is one of my favorite scenes of all time. I don't know why. Can't even explain it as, again, it's not stylish or tricky in any way, but I just love it.<br/><br/>The conspiracy thery about Kubrick's death, the ""seized by the studio"" 24 minutes of the film etc. was on my mind almost the whole time I was thinking about Eyes Wide Shut and rewatching it. I don't know and I'm sure that not a lot do know about how many of this is true, but I still imagine how perfect it could've been with all the missing scenes (if they exist). I must say that I had a feeling that the movie is kind of incomplete after I've seen it the first time, not knowing about the WB-Illuminati shinenigans at all. And rewatching it again made me feel even more like it.<br/><br/>Regardless of if it was on purpose by Kubrick or not, I'd love to literally see more of this film, I'd love for it to continue and not to end on such a teasing note, almost mocking me as a viewer (and a man!). Otherwise, not my favorite film by Kubrick, but certainly not less deep than all the others. I was born 6 months after Stanley Kubrick died but I still miss him. 8/10. October 16, 2019.<br/><br/>P.S.

1999
When I saw the film back in the day it left me baffled as it did with most viewers (and many critics as well, though they had a hard time trying not to show it).
The death of its author overshadowed the film, and rumours about the famous ""masked orgy scene"" somehow mined my viewing ""..when's this orgy scene coming...?""
So I was left thinking that this cryptic farewell by Stanley was either too complex for me or that this story about jealousy didn't turn out to be as iconic as his other masterpieces.<br/><br/>2019
20 years have gone by and I now believe that EWS is one of K's most complex and fascinating films.
Maybe because I've grown up in the meanwhile but on my second viewing I picked up on details, patterns, hints, symbolisms that I didn't ' on my first viewing twenty years ago. This is a film to watch over and over again.<br/><br/>The plot a in a nutshell: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are the Hartfords a dream couple,young, beautiful and presumably with good economic prospects..but as wealth and status they are nowhere near to Victor Ziegler (Sidney Pollack) whose grand style Christmas party they've been invited to.
At the party the couple toys with the idea of possible infidelity (without believing to much in it) and Cruise's character, who is a doctor, witnesses also an unexpected aspect of Ziegler's private life though he is sworn to secrecy.<br/><br/>The following day after having had a fight with his wife on the subject of infidelity Cruise's character is called to the house of a patient and this sets him off on an all night long journey across a Christmas lit New York.
He is tormented by jealousy but at the same time he bumps into many potential sexual encounters with different women (most of them, if not all with rufous hues in their hair like his wife's).
The night culminates in an out of town castle which in a distorted way (as in a dream) provides a bookend to Ziegler's party at the beginning.
By the end of the eventful night all of Hartford's insecurities, inadequacies and maybe his inability to climb the social ladder are dramatically unfolded.<br/><br/>Throughout Cruise/Hartford's odyssey his perception of sex is always associated with money and death and violence and guilt and social status.
But maybe Nicole Kidman's character has a more practical take on this subject. Her last line in the Christmas shopping scene maybe is after all the best way to drive away nightmares and insecurities, restore normality and reunite the family.<br/><br/>This F-word is the last thing we will see from Stanley Kubrick, a very private man whom we got to know a bit better in the following years through books and documentaries and interviews with his family and collaborators.
After 20 years he is still very much missed."

It's said that it was his last but at least he had the last word about true cinema and not money making garbage for human consumption. Eyes Wide Shut first gave me the idea of what the Bohemian Club was about but it's more secretive then that and less open to the public. It's for very rich and powerful people who don't have a clue what evil they are a part of and how much it destroys. They are the button pushers and puppet masters of the age of politician and dictator greed that we live in. Anything evil is possible with eyes wide shut. The suspense is comparable to 2001 but not from a computer and actually HAL seems more human than some of the faceless characters in this movie.

","Where to begin with this film... it's not bad I mean I think it's interesting but man... It's very surreal viewing this. This was the last film Stanley Kubrick directed before his tragic passing and I have to say I think it's a good film to go out on. The story's about a happily married couple Dr. Bill and Alice Harford (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) who attend a Christmas party in New York. After they come home they discuss their fantasies while high on weed. At first it's innocent until Alice admits one of hers involving a naval officer in Cape Cod. This shocks Bill who decides to sleep with someone. This leads him to a bizarre masked orgy where he almost dies had a mysterious woman not sacrifice herself for him.<br/><br/>Afterwards he begins to fear for his life wondering if he's being watched and in danger or not. From this point on it gets really bizarre. The film has a dreamlike feel which keeps you hypnotized. The orgy scene's very surreal yet unsurprisingly erotic. There're a lot of scenes that are hilarious like the scene where when Bill is returning his costume, the store owner, Mr. Milich (Rade Serbedzija) kicks out 2 customers and puts them under a citizens arrest for screwing with his daughter (Leelee Sobieski) yet it's also gross because she looks underage and it doesn't help that in a later scene it's implied they worked something out when Bill notices the same men are there. The actors do a good job conveying the dreamlike yet menacing feel to the movie. Tom Cruise does well playing the busy yet charming Dr. Bill searching for the ultimate conquest.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is an interesting yet bizarre film. It's not bad as it has an interesting style and is interesting to watch but it's weird and even uncomfortable at times. If you like art films I suggest you check this one out."

","Despite being subconsciously aware of just how in over his head he is, the sheer secrecy and audacity of the activities taking place in the rustic andornate chateau outside of New York City was far too captivating for Dr. Harford to pull away from.
Perhaps not considered his best work (while some seem entrapped in discovering patterns and symbolism of his earlier works - where it seemed more of focus, I believe Eyes Wide Shut (EWS) provided a better glimpse in Kubrick's visionary ability to convey a real-life adult fairy tale while never breaking the concrete confines of the real world in which it is set), Kubrick undoubtedly
""gave it his all"" in what many refer to as the ""orgy scene"" near the middle of Eyes Wide Shut. The buildup to this moment might've seemed intense,with exposure to the concept of sexuality from many different angles, but as Dr. Harford makes his arrangement with the cabbie to request he stay put until his return - the viewer can't help but to get excited. As he shares the password, one can only use their best guess as to what lies beyond the mansion doors. The initial effect when viewed first time is jaw-dropping: the dark lighting, the deep red of the carpeting and drapery, the entire scene screams at a very primitive and
human ceremonial event. The only missing ingredient that ensures ""separation of church and flesh,"" would be the costumes - notably the masks worn by the event's attendees. When Dr. Harford finds his way to the main ballroom and feasts his eyes on the incense burning, the crowds, and the kneeling women - there is no mistaking his inability to grasp the realities of where he's found himself while also feeling entirely captivated. Perhaps most memorable - though excusable if one is unable to recall due to the intense visuals, is the Gregorian chant heard throughout. The masks become increasingly important in relation to
this chant because although it seems more than likely that it would become from the man in the red cape - one can only assume with a roomful of masked and robed figures. The two major closeups - like bookends - occur when Dr. Harford is first noticed by a male and female couple from above. The importance here is that they are keenly aware of his uninvited presence, though not of who he actually is. Once Dr. Harford is required to remove his mask, it is clear that everyone in the room now knows of his visage, but the only positive reaction - and second closeup - is that of a masked female from above. The story
would later come full circle when it is realized that she chose to sacrifice for him because he had saved her life previously. I believe the lighting in each of these closeups tells its own story, one of darkness and one of light, respectively, providing a sort of ""microcosm"" for the rest of the film - one that begins in darkness and unfulfilled desire, and one of light, being saved,
and finding one's way back to their lover."

The acting in this film was outstanding. I felt the pain and anger stirring within Bill as Alice explained her ordeal. I felt the desire for an alternate life every time Alice explained to Bill a different universe to her present. Overall, this film is surprisingly great and the runtime is nothing to fret.

","This is the kind of movie that I'll almost immediately head on over to the IMDb FAQ page after watching to see if there's anything offered that might help with interpreting the picture. But as is often the case with complex stories, there are multiple levels of interpretation one might apply to the events that occur on a bizarre night during which Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) tries to come to terms with his wife's (Nicole Kidman) hint of a marital infidelity. There's something to be said about the idea that Harford's participation at the masquerade party was all part of a dreamscape, and that it was only his fevered imagination coming up with all the strange occurrences he experienced after leaving his wife at their apartment. How else for example, would Masked Woman #1 have been able to determine that Harford's life was in great danger by attending, and that he should leave immediately? Or consider the sudden appearance of Harford's own mask on his bed pillow next to Alice (Kidman). If it were all a dream, there's no reason to question the improbabilities because one's own subconscious mind is making it all up. Also contributing to the idea that most of this was all a dream was Harford's own reaction to events occurring around him, as most of what he experienced summoned very little emotional response. <br/><br/>While watching though, I didn't get the sense that Harford was dreaming. Having become obsessed over his wife's admission, it felt that he was out for some semblance of revenge against her for even thinking of being unfaithful. He further added to his own paranoia by envisioning his wife in bed with the mythical Navy military man. The entire sequence at the party estate was bizarrely surreal and had me mesmerized. It had the appearance of some sort of black mass ritual and felt demonic in it's intensity. The use of a password and the presence of the blindfolded piano player Nick (Todd Field) only added to the mystery of Harford's experience. <br/><br/>Regarding the principals, I don't think Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman ever looked more appealing. As a glamorous couple they rivaled Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" and the fact that they were married while making this picture suggests they were willing to lay it all on the line for their craft. I was put off by Kidman's character while at the Ziegler (Sidney Pollack) party while dancing with Szavost (Sky Dumont), and she only added to the perception of being a witch with a capital 'B' back at their apartment. The idea that their marriage was hitting the skids would be something of an understatement, though Harford's response went a bit beyond the pale. Perhaps another viewing of the film would be in order to further test some of the ideas presented by other critics, though one's first impression of a surreal adventure needs some time to percolate. I will revisit the film again when the time is right."

","Eyes Wide Shut came out in the Summer of 1999 and was directed by my favourite director of all time, Stanley Kubrick, who sadly died a week after the film's final cut was shown. The film follows Bill and Alice Harford who seem like a typical New York wealthy and happy family with their 7 year old daughter but when Alice reveals a secret about a sexual encounter with a man from last summer, Bill then goes to get fair on his wife by also sleeping with someone and after everything fails, Bill then is recommended by his friend to go to a building outside NYC only to discover the great danger he's in and how it can affect his family and friends. Eyes Wide Shut deserves more attention because it truly is a masterpiece in cinematic history, why? The film is art, it's so beautiful, can we all just look at that amazing ritual scene in the film, that scene was basically a painting, literally, A PAINTING!! The performances are so loveable but I haft to say, Kidman goes way over Cruise, I really wished she was in the film more which was probably just my little glitch with it but I truly did not mind that, she was just better than Tom Cruise, no affence! There arent really any other characters except for a few who pop in and out like the costume shop man and his daughter and people like that. My favourite part of the film, like many's obviously was the mansion scene, it was just because it was so beautiful and mysterious and so well acted by Cruise. Eyes Wide Shut deserves more praise then 74% on Rotten Tomatoes!"

I feel that what the movie is really trying to say is hidden under the symbolism. This film is chock full of crazy stuff that I do not have the space to mention here. I was so impressed with this film that I decided to read the novel it was based on, Dream Story by Arthur Schnitzler. Other than a few things, this is an extremely faithful adaptation of the story, and many of the problems people had with the film they would find in the book as well.

"Saiyan_Prince_Vegeta","Null","0","0","4 March 2018"," This movie is something else, truly an art
","First, lets start with technical aspect.
The dialogues and the scenes in the movie are something else - they are long and slow, which is quite unusual for movies. The scenes are very slow, but they glue you to the screen. You have intense feeling while watching the movie and the movie is mysterious. 
You have to watch this movie in a slow, relaxed, immersed state - don't expect action here.
This movie is really well directed and is truly a piece of cinematographic art in different ways - dialogues, story, meaning, scenes, looks.
Tom Cruise is beautiful, more adult and already looks more like Ethan Hunt here, which is cool. Nicole Kidman is beautiful as well.
Keep in mind there's really a lot of nudity here, so you might not want to show or recommend it to everyone. <br/><br/>* What is the movie about and what is the lesson? *
The whole movie I was asking myself ""Why would she tell her husband that she wanted to have sex with another man?! That can totally ruin their relationship, it was not necessary to tell that!"". However, after reading reviews, it seems that actually the movie is about on sexual relationship and fantasies and that you NEED to be open about some things like that. When a couple does not share their fantasies or desires then they might start fantasizing bad things, like cheating with someone else who can fullfill these desires. As a result, they both started fantasizing about cheating.
Thus, it is important to tell your desires or thoughts to the partner, to make sure they know what you want.<br/><br/> As some people have noticed, there are really many sexual scenes in this movie with different types of people, which all might represent something, no one knows for sure, so there are many theories, but I guess it is open for interpretation on purpose.<br/><br/>I think it is worth reading fan theories, for example on reddit I've seen some really interesting theories."

","The movie that I tried to ignore for past 4 years since researching about the secret society and conspiracy theories. Finally today is the day to talk about this film. Stanley Kubrick exposed one of the oldest secret in this world through dream & mystery genre. I like the one dialogue said by Tom Cruise - What kind of fu**ing charade is that taking lives of people. Stanley significantly hints those celebrities that died and will die in future too. Here are some eye-opening facts about Eyes Wide Shut<br/><br/>1. The film is based on novella Traumnovelle (Dream Story) which was published in 1926.<br/><br/>2. The Warner Bros. Pictures pushed Kubrick to cast A-list names.<br/><br/>3. Kubrick liked the idea of casting a real-life married couple in the film, and originally considered Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger. Eventually, he went with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who were married from 1990 to 2001.<br/><br/>4. Though the film is set in New York, it was filmed in London.<br/><br/>5. The movie is the Guiness World Record Holder for the longest constant movie shoot with a total of 400 days. Cruise and Kidman only committed to six months of filming. The extended shoot delayed work for Mission: Impossible II. Tom didn't seem to mind though as he said - we knew from the beginning the level of commitment needed.<br/><br/>6. Kubrick temporarily banned Cruise from the set during shoot Kidman's sex scene with another man, which motivates the rest of the film's plot. They spent 6 days to filming the one-minute scene (wtf Kubrick).<br/><br/>7. Six days for a one-minute scene is nothing compared to the time Kubrick had Cruise do 95 takes of one simple action: walking through a door. <br/><br/>8. Kubrick has a cameo in the movie which can be seen sitting in a booth at the Sonata Café.<br/><br/>9. Kubrick passed away less than a week after showing the studio what would be the final cut of the film to Warner Bros. (not surprise for those revealing secret society)<br/><br/>10. Eyes Wide Shut came out a full 12 years after Kubrick's previous film 1987's Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>11. Kubrick's only film to earned $30,196,742 during its first week in release.<br/><br/>12. One year after the film's release, Cruise admitted that he ""didn't like playing Dr. Bill. I didn't like him. It was unpleasant. But I would have absolutely kicked myself if I hadn't done this."

","Although the movie has imperfections, it certainly is thought-provoking. <br/><br/>One theme is the sexual exploitation of women by the wealthy and powerful. Another is trust and infidelity within a marriage.<br/><br/>The danger of drug abuse is shown in an early scene, as a young prostitute nearly dies. The danger of working as a prostitute (and the danger of having sex with a prostitute) is revealed, as the roommate tells the doctor that the hooker he hired the night before, but did not have sex with, has just discovered out she's HIV positive. <br/><br/>Something that was unrealistic and inconsistent with an earlier scene was the costume shop owner happily using his underage daughter as a prostitute. This should have been edited out. Another weakness is a too-long conversation between the doctor and his wife, and the overly long and repetitive conversation between the wife and the man she was dancing with. <br/><br/>There are still some important unanswered questions at the end (I will not post a spoiler and say what they are), but the mystery is presented in an intelligent way, unlike in some other movies, and so doesn't annoy the viewer, but instead makes one think."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","0","4 September 2017"," A complex swan song from Kubrick
","""Eyes Wide Shut"" marked the end of legendary director Stanley Kubrick's career, being completed mere days before his death. His first film in more than a decade, it was eagerly anticipated but was ultimately met with mixed reviews. This was probably partially due to the advertising campaign that tried to sell the movie as an erotic thriller. What moviegoers actually got was something much more unique and surreal.<br/><br/>The story focuses on a married couple, Dr. William & Alice Harford (played by Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman). When Alice confesses that she fantasized about cheating on her husband with a young naval officer it disturbs him that his marriage may not be as secure as he thought. Over the course of the night he embarks on an odyssey of sexual discovery wherein he grapples with his newfound jealousy & insecurity.<br/><br/>This synopsis is purposely fairly vague since I feel that the plot moves into such unexpected territory that it would be a shame to go into the movie knowing too much. The trailer gives away very little but it probably led people to expect a completely different kind of movie. While there is a heavy sexual element to the movie, I certainly wouldn't call it erotic. To me it seems much more clinical (perhaps mirroring the doctor's viewpoint), studied & surreal.<br/><br/>The movie shows Kubrick's attention to detail in every frame. There's a consistent dream-like vibe that's unlikely to appeal to everyone. I find this to be clearly evident in the visuals and the music but also in the acting. Despite moving at a very deliberate pace, the story is gripping, at least once the initial groundwork is laid. However, the script's main strength is the amount of depth that it has, leading to many possible interpretations. To be honest, I was somewhat bewildered the first time I saw the movie but the second time around I discovered a whole new layer of meaning.<br/><br/>The acting is a bit harder to judge. The film's dream-like feel called for a more mannered approach than is typical of today's films. To some, this might be seen as artificial. Personally, I think that some of the acting comes across as a bit laboured but, overall, I'm happy with all of the performances. Tom Cruise, in particular, showed that he was up to the task of playing a character whose seemingly perfect exterior masked an interior plagued with doubts.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" is truly the type of movie that practically begs for multiple viewings. From a visual standpoint, it's absolutely gorgeous. When it comes to the story, it's both compelling and thought-provoking. In retrospect, it seems unbelievable that the movie got almost no recognition at the major awards shows (Oscars, Golden Globes & BAFTAs). While it may not quite reach the dizzying heights of all-time classics like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" & ""A Clockwork Orange"", it isn't that far off."

","A little drawn out and predictable but still riveting and highly charged with tension, the plot lines are neatly—if somewhat over-literally—tied up. The final scene in which Kidman (Alice Hartford) suggests behavior to resolve the sexual mistrust between her and her husband seems to me reductive and not to answer the exciting questions about the place of the libido in married life, i. e., the discussion that precipitated the action.<br/><br/>Everything implied or said in the movie is in a 5200 word short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne, ""Young Goodman Brown"" (1835). The sex (more implied than explicit), the uncertainty, and the guilt are all there; Hawthorne's story is told with more tact, with a clearer philosophical framework and less self-consciousness than in Kubrik's film, which I still liked, though."

","In Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, it explores the themes of infidelity and trust between a married couple, played by Kidman and Cruise. This film is yet another example of the pure genius of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. Like many of his other films, Eyes Wide Shut contains many subtle references that are easy to miss. For this reason, his films should always be viewed more than once to get the full effect. For most of the film, there is a sensible distrust between the couple. They have both had thoughts and experiences with cheating on each other, but it doesn't start to effect their relationship until they begin to talk about it with each other. Prior to learning that his wife, Alice, was at one point attracted to another man, Cruise's character, Bill, would never think about cheating on his wife. Although he clearly had thought about it, it seemed as though he would remain faithful to Alice. The night he finds out she had feelings for another man, the theme of fidelity becomes extremely present in his mind. In the end of the movie, they both decide, whether it was a dream or something they actually did, those feelings only existed during that night. Although the ending seemed unrealistic, I did enjoy seeing the change in Tom Cruise's character after realizing his wife almost cheated on him. In addition to the acting and the plot, this film, like Kubrick's other masterpieces, was beautifully shot. The movie also had a fitting soundtrack. Overall, I was satisfied with this movie as the final film of Stanley Kubrick's career."

","Based on the 1926 novel 'Traumnovelle' by Austrian author, director Stanley Kubric changes the setting to fit the 90's New York keeping the flavour same. New York city doctor William Harford aka Bill (Tom Cruise) is successful in his profession, has married a former art curator Alice and has a beautiful 7 year old daughter Helena. All is picture perfect until Alice reveals that she was not perfectly loyal to her husband, and that she fantasized about a naval officer who she had just seen, but never even talked. She was ready to give up everything just for being with him for one afternoon, but instead, returned to her husband. And that she continues fantasizing about him. Learning about the near-infidelity of his wife, Bill is determined to find the thrill of having a relationship with someone else and sets out to do just the same. For that, he is prepared to go to any lengths, including the one which will prove to be a threat for his life, and his family.<br/><br/>This movie has many layers, and includes the portrayal of many characters who are a part of Bill's journey. This is no blood or gore. Instead, it takes the classic route of a thriller, and mostly relies on human psychology. Accordingly, this movie cannot be specifically categorized as a thriller, suspense or classic. This is a mixture of all three. The entire film explores the relationships between humans, especially couples, and just how their mind can waver. It poses a question that how lethal is infidelity? Is near- infidelity equally dangerous? As this film basically is about sexual fantasies and obsession, few of the scenes are slightly cringe-worthy. (It received an R rating, so.. you might just want to keep your 'eyes wide SHUT').The attention paid to minute details is worth watching. This is a slow paced, dramatic movie, with ominous piano music in the background, so you will need plenty of patience to reach the conclusion. Also this movie depends heavily on psychology, so it is filled with ambiguous meanings. So interpret in your own way. However, compared to the powerful beginning, the ending slightly wavers. But it is an equally thought provoking one. After this movie ends, you might just continue thinking, untangling the chain of events. This one is completely different."

I could easily be wrong but the source material that made this movie is a book called 'Traumnovelle' which, from the German, it means Dream Story. And the guy who wrote the book was a doctor.

","Eyes wide shut certainly is a peculiar movie, but it's intriguing, which is the main reason I watched it one night. This movie does feature very good performances by the lead actors, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. I was very impressed by their performances. The plot of the movie is kinda hard to explain, basically it's about Tom Cruise's character's one night exploration of himself and of moral and sexual discoveries after his wife, played by Nicole's character tells him that one time she came close and considered cheating on him. So as you can probably imagine, you're in for very intense, graphic sexual content and a lot of male and female nudity (both rear and full frontal). So if that sort of thing offends you, then stay away, Cus it's in this film for sure! Personally, it didn't bother me a whole whole lot, but in a couple of scenes it got to be just a little much. Now the movie's script is well written and intelligent, that was nice to see. In my opinion, Tom Cruise was the best part of this film, his performance was gripping, and he sure did look good doing it lol, but seriously, he was awesome here! And Nicole gave one of her best performances ever in this film, she was so real and dramatic! Stanley Kubrick did do a pretty good job with this movie, it was shot beautifully, and intelligently. I appreciate this film's intelligence, you can sure tell that a lot of hard work went into the making of this film. This movie is very psychological and interesting to watch. It ultimately is just about tom and Nicole's marriage and about why she considered cheating on him, and how tom gets through it and how he deals with it. I would have preferred less nudity and a little less sex, that would've been nice. I'm perfectly alright with having some female/male nudity, and I'm alright with sex scenes, as long as they aren't like porn. I just feel like In a couple scenes the amount of sex/nudity sort of took away from the main objective of the movie and in a way distracted the audience. And the ending to Eyes Wide Shut is in my humble opinion one of the greatest endings in cinema history, it's so well acted, and well written, and it's refreshing to see how they resolved everything, it's a true testament to the word marriage. This is a good film for married couples to see, but you might wanna zip through one scene or 2, just because as I said previously, the amount of nudity can be a little distracting. 7/10 overall for Eyes Wide Shut."

","Eyes Wide Shut is a 1999 American erotic thriller film loosely based upon Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella Dream Story. The film was directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick. It was his last film, as he died six days after showing his final cut to Warner Brothers studios.[2] The story, set in and around New York City, follows the sexually charged adventures of Dr. Bill Harford, who is shocked when his wife, Alice, reveals that she had contemplated an affair a year earlier. He embarks on a night-long adventure, during which he infiltrates a massive masked orgy of an unnamed secret society.<br/><br/>Kubrick obtained the filming rights for Dream Story in the 1960s, considering it a perfect novel to adapt on a film about sexual relations. The project was only revived in the 1990s, when the director hired writer Frederic Raphael to help him with the adaptation. The film was mostly shot in the United Kingdom (aside from some exterior establishing shots), and included a detailed recreation of some exterior Greenwich Village street scenes at Pinewood Studios. The film spent a long time in production, and holds the Guinness World Record for the longest continuous film shoot period, at 400 days."

","There was a lot of hype surrounding Kubrick when this film was made. Clockwork Orange clearly went for the whole shock value thing and so I thought this film might follow in that shadow. Add to this Tom Cruise's ego and surely....a recipe for disaster? Well...actually no. The relationship on (and off) screen between Cruise and Kidman is obvious from the outset and Kubrick films with a real talent towards a 'fly-on -the-wall' style. The inevitable scenes when they arrive are both erotic and yet extremely awkward. Pleasantly surprised by this film...and yet left wondering....why still rely on the 'shock' factor again. The Shining still easily remains Kubrick's lasting legacy."

","Tom Cruise's character is a strange person. Although he may be very intelligent since he is a physician, in many scenes he shows the spectator he is not that sane. Many of his actions in this picture aren't totally normal. For instance, who would accept to enter in a hooker's house and after deciding the price, go away because the wife gave a simple call? It's not common among men. Nicole Kidman's is an even crazier character, and sometimes it's annoying that sex is the only thing she talks about. I don't think the story is very plausible or reliable, but I can admit it is original. The main thing that keeps this movie working is the exceptional DIRECTING. Kubrick, as usual, makes the slow story become very entertaining, and even shocking the spectator when the scene could be totally uninteresting. The scene of the mask laying in the pillow was pretty intense, I got even scared when this scene began-- and see, this isn't an horror movie or anything. All in all, even thought the poor ending, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a good movie due to the professional directing and the original story, but don't have extreme expectations from this..."
"chris-impens","8","0","0","11 November 2011"," Better written but less consistent than the novella
","A film you're not likely to forget. Kubrick's slow ""Barry Lyndon"" pace works nicely, the plot is intriguing enough, acting and score are excellent. The film is much better written than the original novella -""Dream Story"" by Arthur Schnitzler-, which is very poor literature indeed. Actually, the novella is more like a draft of a novel yet to be written than anything else. Fortunately, it has been written, if not by Schnitzler. Kubrick also threw in some drugs, several homosexual aspects and two new characters: Victor Ziegler and Mandy. Not all of these additions are improvements. The stoned couple does reveal some secret thoughts, but the gay elements don't add anything, quite the contrary. In the novella, the street incident has nothing to do with gay bashing but with death in duel, which fits nicely between the deceased patient and driving to the orgy in a hearse. Mandy also doesn't add anything except her nice body and some extra confusion. She ends up in the morgue, and Victor claims she was the ""mysterious woman"", but he's definitely lying. If you watch closely enough (it's a hard job, but someone has to do it), you see their bodies are different; if you're lazy, just verify the credits, and you'll find that, in real life, one is called Julienne Davis and the other Abigail Good. Are we expected to overlook this, or is it an extra ""dreamlike"" layer deliberately added by Kubrick? The nice thing for an author or a director dealing in ""dreams"" is that logical inconsistencies are part of the game! This said, the novella, while poorly written, is less inconsistent than the movie. Schnitzler's intruder is betrayed at the orgy because he's the only one not to change costumes, and -speaking of costumes- the shop owner's daughter is caught wearing a whig and sitting with two gentlemen dressed as judges. I fail to see why Kubrick had to turn these into Japanese. (Incidentally, Marion Nathanson's fiancé, a historian according to Schnitzler, is a mathematician in the film. As neither detail has any importance, one wonders why such changes are made at all.) Most importantly, Schnitzler's password for the orgy is directly linked to the woman's infidelity fantasy; it's a pity that Kubrick threw away this crucial entrance key to the man's fantasy. The novella ends with the mask on the pillow. If only Kubrick had done the same! His last scene, trivial and cheap, is a complete letdown."

","1st watched 8/7/2011 – 8 out of 10(Dir-Stanley Kubrick): Revealing journey about what women and men go thru when dealing with sexual infidelity whether it be real or imaginary when couples are married. This last movie by Stanley Kubrick is not perfect, but makes you think while it takes you through one couple's warped experiences after the wife reveals that she was thinking about being with another man sexually during a very important point in their relationship(the couple's engagement). The man, played by Tom Cruise, then has a night where he encounters a prostitute and then a weird sexual cult. He never is unfaithful – just as the wife isn't – but these occurrences in many cases would still split couples up eventually. The deception that Cruise's character has to go through is almost a bigger sin then his encounters and the wife, played by Nicole Kidman brilliantly in a unique part for her, kind of pays for her blatant honesty. The pacing is definitely Kubrick-like(slow and methodical) and not for everyone, and some of the scenes don't make sense -- but overall this is a compelling probe into human sexual existence and how male and females play with it – almost to our own destruction."

","Knowing Kubrick's style of movies, the explicit content in his movies, and the creepy style he does his movies in, I knew this last Kubrick project would be quite a thrill. Dying right after the movie was made, of a heart attack, I had a feeling Kubrick knew the end was near, and decided to go all out before he went out. And what a way to do it. This movie has Kubrick written all over it. This movie intrigued me quite a bit. Although it may seem like a usual Kubrick style movie, it quickly turns into a nonstop series of nude everywhere, and creepiness all around.<br/><br/>New York doctor Bill Hartford, (Tom Cruise) has an argument with his wife, (Nichole Kidman) about being faithful with each other one night when they're both stoned after returning from a party. This leads her to reveal at one point in their marriage when she had a sexual fantasy with a man they met on vacation with their daughter, and was ready to give up her future with her husband and daughter just to sleep with him. This causes him to go out in the streets of New York, filled with jealousy and sexual flames, on a nonstop discovery of moral and sexual intercourse.<br/><br/>He encounters a hooker, an awkward intrusion of a costume owner's daughter fooling around with two Asians, and a mansion where a ritual of sexual orgies is taking place. All fitting in one night, and continues on the next day, consuming you with tons of confusion, and questions you're just dying to know. By the time most of the more screwed up scenes are finished, they will leave you speechless and filled with curiosity. The hardest part of this film is not knowing whats going on, which can get a little on your nerves.<br/><br/>Though it is a little slow, most Kubrick films are. Its not too bad, and it does build up pretty well. The music score by Jocelyn Pook is outstanding. That suspenseful piano piece that shows whenever somethings going on just gets shivers right down your spine.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe the amount of nudity in this film. Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, (1971) which is rated X, doesn't even have as much nudity as this, which I didn't think was possible, which is shocking considering Kubrick could have had it much worse, though he decided to block most of the sex shown, for rating issues, though the film is still rated NC-17.<br/><br/>A truly terrifying thriller which is one of Kubrick's most shocking, yet highly intelligent drama thrillers, which will have you on the edge of your seat. Although not as good as A Clockwork Orange, its still one of the most thrilling films ever, and will live on in the legend of Stanley Kubrick forever."

","This was Stanley Kubrick's last film and I thought it an apt one for my 400th review. It's maybe not his greatest work, but you can still see the hand of the master in this one. His attention to detail is second to none and you'll struggle to find anything out of place in any shot. As for the plot, well, it's all very psychological and quite complicated, but worth sticking with. If you're bothered by nudity, which few people are these days, but even so, this one may not be to everyone's taste. I'll attempt to give you a brief summary and then some of my thought afterwards.<br/><br/>Bill Harford and his wife, Alice, live together with their daughter, Helena, in an apartment in New York. They are quite well off, Bill is a doctor and they enjoy many of the good things in life. And yet they are not happy. After an argument about sexuality, Bill sets out (to put it in basic terms) get laid. Events conspire against him and he fails, but a conversation with a friend, a musician, Nick Nightingale, leads him to a very strange party. Everyone is wearing cloaks and masks and it seems almost everyone is having sex. One of the women there tries to warn him that he may be in danger and he makes to leave, but too late, he is called before their leader to explain himself. Here I will leave my brief summary Thought I'd leave you on a bit of a cliff-hanger this time.<br/><br/>At two hours and forty minutes, this is one of the longest movies I've seen. It has a very slow and deliberate pace that, at times, can be a little annoying, but stick with it. To be honest, I had to take a little fifteen minute break in the middle or I wouldn't have made it to the end. The pay-off in the end may not be to everyone's liking and some my even see it as a let-down, but I thought it was OK.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, well, Tom Cruise proved that he can do more than stupid action/spy movies as Dr. William 'Bill' Harford. And Nicole Kidman put in a great performance as his wife, Alice. Sydney Pollack was good as Victor Ziegler and Todd Field was also decent as Nick Nightingale.<br/><br/>This film has gained a bit of notoriety for the sex scenes in it and, yes, there are sex scenes but there's nothing that breaks any decency laws. I found the film hard going in places but stuck with it. The music is really great too; just listen to the music playing in the background in places and you'll hear some melodies you might just recognise. It's probably the least favourite of the Kubrick films I've seen to date, but it's still worth a viewing (if you can clear a long enough time-slot) Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 7.3/10"

","The use of symbolism in this visually-rich film lent a much-needed dimension to the script, including the dreamlike atmosphere as well as all the symbols of the Illuminati, Priory of Sion, Satanic cults and secret societies.<br/><br/>But... the problem is that symbolism alone is not enough to make a film ""great"", even one made by the legendary Kubrick. The cinematography was gorgeous, but I found the plot flimsy and patchy.<br/><br/>This film could have been truly great if Kubrick either spent more time on the relationship aspect of it, really developing the main characters, or just skipped the relationship talk and made it a full-on suspense thriller. But it aimed for both, and sadly neither was strong enough to make you take the story seriously...<br/><br/>Kidman is flawless & enchanting in appearance, however her character is poorly written & inconsistent, often over-acting to make up for the lack of depth. Cruise started out surprisingly strong & enjoyably subtle, but, like the story itself, got wobbly as things unfolded and was all over the place. His famous (or infamous) mega-watt grin was *way* overused, so that it became more annoying & transparently manipulative than charming (I know, surprise surprise!) Still, the film was compelling enough to make you want to keep watching. I just wished we could have seen the final cut which Kubrick submitted to WB before his death, but which was never made.<br/><br/>~NN"

","Just as he did in A Clockwork Orange (1971), Kubrick enjoys putting a lot of female nudity in this movie and still keeps it above the level of porn. There's some unnecessary nudity in Eyes Wide Shut- a female patient passed out naked, a topless woman being examined by her doctor. Yet the film is beautifully shot, almost as hypnotic and surreal as Kubrick's The Shining, and the story is a tasteful, believable look at exotic sexual indiscretions.<br/><br/>The movie is basically about a doctor (Tom Cruise) who, behind his wife's back, seeks out a prostitute and later sneaks into an orgy. However, the mysterious masked participants know he doesn't belong there and the doctor may be in danger.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie is the casting of Tom Cruise. I just did not buy him as a doctor, particularly with his dumb ""look at me, I'm so cute"" smile. Nicole Kidman is his wife, both in real life and in the movie. She does better than Cruise and she's nice to look at (As a kid, I had a crush on her after Batman Forever), but she actually isn't in the movie that much. The movie explains some things to us, or so it seems (who the lady who came to the doctor's aid was, and why she died), but keeps other things mysterious, particularly the meaning of the orgy and the identity of its participants. It's not the most intriguing thing I've seen but it's not without worth. A fine movie to end a distinguished career with."
"Samiam3","8","0","0","7 March 2010"," despite the ending it qualifies as an achievement
","Considering his mise-en-scene, I like to think of Kubrick as a neo-expressionist. Eyes Wide Shut however embodies that and more. There is a dose of surrealism to this, in part because when all is said and done, the film makes no sense, which is frustrating because otherwise it would've been perfect. Like all Kubrick films, this one shows an exceptional knowledge of modern art. It is theatrical and haunting, sometimes a little too much so, which leads to a case of Overacting, also typical of Kubrick.The real problem with Eyes wide shut however is simply the last twenty minutes. Anti climactic, abrupt and does a terrible job of explaining what it attempts to, which results in the film ending on what seems like a random, almost lame note. Up till that point Eyes Wide Shut, is a near cinema sensation of modern film, and one that bookends the career of one of histories greatest auteurs."
"gmsmith-3","Null","0","0","15 August 2004"," I like this movie in spite of myself
","When this movie came out in 1999 I refused to go see it as well as rent it. Why? Because I loathe Tom Cruise. In all the movies I'd ever seen him in he always plays a cocky, arrogant, self-assured pretty-boy. I never thought of him as an actor; just as a guy who got lucky enough to be paid to just be himself on screen.<br/><br/>Recently I broke down and watched this movie. In spite of myself, I liked it. Why? For a couple reasons. Firstly, because it was just soooooo recognizable as a Stanley Kubrick piece of work. I'm not sure why his visual approach to cinematography is so appealing to me, but it is. Secondly, for the first time ever I saw someone get Tom Cruise to act like someone besides Tom Cruise. I still dislike Cruise as an actor, but was amazed that Kubrick was apparently able to wrest control of his ego enough to get him to act. <br/><br/>The result is a confusing, disturbing, pleasing to the eyes to watch film that screams Kubrick on every level. Love him or hate him, he did what he always does. <br/><br/>One additional note. I've always found it intriguing how Kubrick would refuse to ever come back to the US, therefore, all of his post ""Lolita"" movies were made in the UK for American audiences. If you watch 2001 enough times, you'll notice that people with American accents pronounce certain words in a classic English manner, and in ""Eyes Wide Shut"", you notice that none of the scenes that show New York City ever really show you anything you can recognize or identify as a landmark. That's because none of it was filmed in the US, and only a few of the actors were really Americans.<br/><br/>All in all, a bizarre movie that raises many more questions than it answers, but if you are a Kubrick fan, you won't complain."

","I can't judge about this film- is it good or is it bad, because verily I don't understand it `from soup to nuts'. Maybe I am too young to watch films like this, but nevertheless I try to express my humble opinion about how I realize `Wide eyes shut'. So I want to start from the film title- `wide eyes shut' it is really hard to imagine this in logical mind, but we need just to look at antonym of word `shut', it is open, so then our eyes wide open we see everything what surround us and our range of `visibility' is `wide'. So in this movie eyes is shut on everything also `wide'. The man called `Dr. William Harford `(Tom Cruise) live in `mask world', he is doctor, he have family- wife, kid. He live appealing just to this valuables (wife, kid and job) he don't see what really happening in nowadays earth- violence, pain, anger, drugs, whoredom, walking on the blade of knife and balancing between life and death. But then Bills wife `Alice Harford'(Nicole Kidman) tell him a story how she faith him with naval officer in her `mind', his life start to ruin down and from this moment in doctors mind start infighting and he step out to the street. This leaving home and searching for `dirty' love (sllaper) is like revenge and some kind of protest for hurt feelings. Doctor wants to return like for like. But street isn't friendly for `masked' mankind, because there are no rules like in our normal life. You don't need to put mask on you real `face' in the street and in our real instinctive first, because street `open your eyes' and you see what really happened that our human being is going straight to the `Stone Age'. And author of this movie wants to say that our `masks', our cultural heritage is the one and only thing which help us to stay human, and vanquish human nature (instinct of freaky and dirty love). So that's all I want to say."

Typically Kubrick; every frame is like a painting, beautiful to watch with its colours and symmetry. This is probably the most elegant erotic thriller you'll ever see. Don't listen to the people who say its slow and boring; Kubrick's films don't operate like most Hollywood fare, they gently break away from the accepted genre form and provoke the viewer to think about what they have seen and what they dream about."

","ATTENTION: All women shall wear a Versace gown and sling-back pumps when using the toilet.<br/><br/>Ok Let's move on.<br/><br/>While watching Eyes Wide Shut, I found myself repeatedly asking what I would have thought of this film had it not been Mr. Kubrick's work, and I think I might have liked it more than I did. Would he have made this film if he had known that it would be his last? With the master's name not in the credits, Eyes Wide Shut might have been an interesting art house effort, perhaps by a young director with a definite eye, and a future. Quite possibly, Nicole and Tom would still have been in the cast, perhaps working for scale and some points, for the fun of being in such a production, as both actors possess discernible integrity. But Eyes Wide Shut was a Kubrick, and I came away with a clear sense that this great artist of the cinema had possibly been running on fumes while directing it. Despite the seductive beauty of many of its set pieces, the film overall seemed to be walking under water. But Kubrick out of breath is still Kubrick and he still managed to give us an often fascinating piece of work, one that dripped the dark juices of life that he may have sensed were, for him, finally drying up.<br/><br/>Although the aforementioned integrity is a good thing in any artist, that quality alone may not always be enough. An actor must still be right for the role and when Tom Cruise is wrong, no one is wrong quite like him. But this seldom, if ever, has anything to do with his skill as an actor. Like Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, or Clint Eastwood, Tom Cruise is a Movie Star and movie stars have indelible personalities that percolate up through every role. In Mr. Cruise's case, it's the shrewd, early post-adolescent we first encountered in Risky Business. Regardless of how sophisticated his subsequent characters have been, this personality has always been there and is something that Mr. Cruise will simply have to outgrow. As he seems to be aging gracefully, it may take a while.<br/><br/>While brilliant in Born on the Fourth of July, Rain Man, and Jerry McGuire, where his core adolescence was perfect, in Eyes Wide Shut, he's a college boy playing doctor in a tent-like white coat. In the first Mission Impossible, when Cruise's whizbang Ethan Hunt told Ving Rhames' Luther that `We're GOING to do it', referring to the planned burglary at CIA Langley, he simply came off like a frat boy planning to heist the Phi Delt bell. In that film, as in Eyes Wide Shut, Cruise never really acted badly. He was just wrong for the roles. In Eyes, during the orgy scene, when the spectacular courtesan under black feathers asks Dr. Bill (Cruise) what he thinks he is doing, the veracity of the question resonates on several levels. Nicole Kidman, a humanoid blend of fox and white-tailed deer, was almost equally unconvincing as his wife. I tried, but could not buy into this glittering and now-sundered couple. Lesser-known actors of the same age would have brought more authenticity, but both roles really called out for more mature actors with more cerebral styles. The Cruise-Kidman duet were never able to gain sufficient distance from their real selves because their character-set, a young fairy-tale couple, was too much like we perceive them in real life. The real Tom Cruise would never be seen ricocheting off a homophobic boy on a late-night city sidewalk, yet there he was, despite the Dr. Bill disguise. Given this, no matter how hard the pair tried, or over-acted, I could never escape the feeling that both were often faxing it in. Thomas Gibson, the briefly-visible, young college professor, would actually have made a more believable Dr. Bill. Eyes Wide Shut is a dark film and the sparkly Mr. And Mrs. Cruise simply shed too much of the wrong sort of light on it.<br/><br/>But not all of this film's casting choices were mistakes. The supporting cast took very good care of business, some of whom seemed to be poking their heads into the film from a parallel universe, even if given just a few lines, like Carmela Marner's smart waitress. Sidney Pollack was a great save when Harvey Keitel, due to scheduling conflicts, was unable to finish out as Victor Ziegler. Todd Field's Nick Nightingale worked beautifully. But the real coup d'etat was Vinessa Shaw's hooker, and walking billboard for the legalization of prostitution, Domino, who stepped out of the film's urbane murk and owned everything. Her scene is my absolute favorite. You don't want to merely bang a lady of such sweet and intelligent self-possession. You want to get her off the street, buy her a drink, and just watch her talk. She has everyone's number. Resistance is futile.<br/><br/>We will probably never know what Kubrick (David Lean's evil twin) really wanted to accomplish with Eyes Wide Shut (the title was probably borrowed from dialog in the superlative BBC production of John LeCarre's Smiley's People: Connie Sachs to Smiley during their great scene; Kubrick certainly would have seen it); We do know that it was messed with (Gee, isn't that surprising). Director's Cut, please, asap. I'm just sorry he's gone. We won't get to see him bounce back and pull off something brilliant ever again. What must it have been like to be him and be so burdened by the relentless expectations of so many after the monumental 2001: A Space Odyssey? I think he handled it. If you doubt him, or me, just watch his The Shining then follow it up with the not-bad TV version. There you will have the explicit and implicit difference between art and artifice."
"Old Joe","Null","0","0","6 March 2003"," Cruise. Kidman. Kubrick. Watch this movie with your eyes wide open!
","Whether you like his movies or not, you have to appreciate how different a director Stanley Kubrick really was. In the final movie he ever made, 'Eyes Wide Shut', he pushes the envelope for how much sexual content can be contained in one movie, in addition to what makes a movie that little bit different. This is a movie that has to be seen, with your 'eyes wide open'.<br/><br/>Consumed by betrayal and jealousy, wealthy Manhattan doctor Bill Harford's comfortable world is turned topsy-turvy when his wife's lascivious sexual fantasies about another man, lead him into a dangerous underworld of sexual ritualistic obsession. This erotic foray threatens to ruin his marriage -and may even ensnare him in a lurid murder mystery.<br/><br/>This movie is a very slow and long experience, and perhaps that is reason why you have to appreciate it so much. In many Hollywood movies, you get a standard formula, that does not do anything that I would call is 'new'. But with this film, you have to take in all of its aspects that it contains, meaning you have to be very patience while watching it.<br/><br/>That being said, Kubrick was another of the world's unique directors, in that he would have wanted every shot to be just the way he wanted. This movie is no different, in that you can see Kubrick's perfectionism really coming to the fore. It is as if he was in love with every shot of the movie, which is like another of Hollywood's directors, Quinton Tarantino. Being the movie fan I am, it was a great shame that Kubrick died during the production of this movie, as I am sure he would have had some interesting movies left to do if he was still alive today.<br/><br/>Eyes wide shut's story comes from the novel 'traumnovelle' by Arthur Schnitzler. The story itself is very confronting, looking at some challenging issues. The movie then takes that a step further, with the screenplay written by Kubrick and Fredrick Raphael, what I would call 'mind-boggling'. The issues of sex, infidelity, marriage and danger are all painted in such a way that the audience needs to ask the same questions of themselves, with some of us I'm sure not able to confront theses issues. Yet Kubrick plays with the audience making some issues so real, seem as if they are just a joke. The story to this movie is as original as you will see.<br/><br/>The stars of the movie are undoubtedly former Hollywood couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. They share a weird, but funny chemistry onscreen, as we get to see how frail a marriage they are in. I have no doubts that this project would have placed a great strain on their 'real' marriage, and was in some way responsible for the demise of their relationship. For Cruise, his role is different, as in almost every shot he looks vulnerable and about to breakdown. The pair go off to a party hosted by Victor Zielger (Sydney Pollack) that starts to show them in situations that could jepardise their marriage. However the best part of the movie comes the night after the party when Alice (Kidman) accuses her husband of cheating on her. She is so stoned, that she is being unreasonable, with Bill (Cruise) almost in tears, unable to defend himself. The shocking confession from Alice then rips Bill's world apart.  What follows will be debated for alongtime to come, as you are not sure what is real, and what is not.<br/><br/>'Eyes wide shut' has many fascinating elements, which include the sexual content, with Kubrick not holding back on what he wanted the audience to see. The female form becomes something that is not 'arousing', instead it is just normal. The rating that this movie was given, I am sure hurt it, because of the use of digitally animated sexual characters. Although they are hardly noticeable, the vision that Kubrick would have wanted to show us, would have been tainted it a little. Lights are used to great effect in the movie with the colours of the 'rainbow' so apparent. I believe this is to show off the obvious sexual tone of the movie's story. It is clever to see the rainbow effect in a couple of camera shots. While it is subtle, it can be quite noticeable if you look hard enough.<br/><br/>This movie also has an amazing soundtrack. The piano playing in the background for the majority of the movie is so thrilling and chilling that it gives the film great tension and suspense. It builds the story up to be more than what it would have been without music. The standout song from 'Eyes Wide Shut' has to be Chris Issak's hit 'Baby did a bad bad thing', which is one of the highlights of the entire movie for mine.<br/><br/>The majority of the film has a 'dreamlike' effect to it, and it is difficult to tell what is in reality and what is not. It asks many questions that I am sure we have to work the answers to ourself (such as did Alice have an affair with the naval officer or was it only ever a fantasy? What actually happened the night Bill went on his sexual exploration? Was it only a dream Bill was having after all? If it was not, can the Harford's marriage really survive, after such turbulent events?) That being said, it has taken three viewings of this film for me to actually like it. It is a film that people will either 'love or hate'. Someone said that Kubrick might have had an incite into the main stars immanent marriage problems, and perhaps he did. Then again we all have problems, but it has how we handle these problems, that predetermines what sort of life we end up having, whether we are a husband, a wife or a child.<br/><br/>CMRS gives 'Eyes Wide Shut': 3.5 (Good - Very Good Film)"

I think what Kubrick was going for here is a story about the risks in life of getting the line blurred between our dreams and our realities.  The film obviously has its realistic elements, but at the same time there is a dreamlike quality throughout the film. The Harfords cross back and forth between their dreams and their realities.  They resolve this in their final conversation in the toy store.  The orgy scene, which seems to disturb so many people, IS a dream.  The repetition of Christmas lights throughout the film also suggests some kind of a dream state.  Note the intense blue color in the windows in so many scenes.  Very dreamlike. The cascading white Christmas lights, so big of a set decoration at Victor's party, are repeated on a smaller scale in other scenes.  The film fascinates me with every repeat viewing.  I think some people tend to take the film at face value, almost a literal translation, and if that's the way you view the film I don't think it WOULD make much sense.

","One should conclude that this film was a kind of meditation from its director, Stanley Kubrick. Dialogues between Dr. William 'Bill' Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) are extremely interesting for any couple. In a talk between both he asserted that he would not do anything with any other woman because he respects her, also because she is the mother of his daughter and he knows that she would not do either something wrong. She frankly told him that once she had an imagination of sex with another guy and that she did not do anything with him next day because the guy disappeared. This was the reason for Bill to find some new sexual emotions, probably to forget what his wife said about a sexual act that never happened and he imagined all time in his mind. One must admit that Kubrick had good imagination in the rest of the plot with some complications that brought back Bill to his family. The end of the film is also interesting when his wife concluded that the solution to all problems for both is to have more sex between them. The film has too many erotic scenes, a bit exaggerated in this aspect."

The movie starts off with a shot of an undressed Kidman and revolves around sex and lust for the first forty five minutes or so. Then we have about an hour of nothing, an adventure that Cruise embarks on that leads us to the final scene, which is Kidman delivering the last few lines: ""You know what we have to do now? F*ck."" The movie remains one dimensional, never exploring any of the characters Cruise meets along the way, such as Leelee Sobieski's nyphomaniac teenager, and her father her approves, or Domino, the HIV-positive prostitute. Perhaps if the film began exploring some of these much more interesting characters, it would have turned into an interesting, provocative film. Instead, the film drags on for an hour only to result in the same thing we open up to. Every other scene has a nude woman and overall, it gets to be too much: the orgy, the models, the reoccuring scene of Kidman and the naval officer that Cruise keeps seeing in his head ... it's overwhelming.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing special at all. Kidman's fluttery laugh bothered me, and Cruise's blank stare (is he discovering something? is he coming to a realization? what are we gaining by looking at his blank face??), which was the center of too many scenes, is, quite frankly, boring.<br/><br/>The only reason to see this movie is because of the color scheme. Like in Amelie, Kubrick focused on two main colors for the entire movie (a golden glow and a bright blue), and put in occasional bright reds and purples. Also, notice the always-apparent Christmas tree, in practically every apartment or store.<br/><br/>This is an extremely slow movie. It is not enjoyable, and leaves the viewer confused and exasperated. It seems as though everyone was cast on a physical basis alone: Kidman and Cruise do make a beautiful couple, and all of the women are at least half nude throughout the entire film. But the talent is lacking. I recommend an earlier Kubrick, especially The Killing. They are much better than this piece of a ""sexual thriller."""

","I heard a lot of people talk about this film before I saw it. The critics seemed disappointed with it, and I heard it mentioned that Mr Kubrick just made this movie as an excuse to surround himself with naked women. Yada-yada-yada... I had no preconceptions about the movie other than it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, a director who had always delivered smashing movies in the past. This film serves as a fitting epitaph to a master craftsman.<br/><br/>So what is the movie about? I think it is a mockery of English sexual repression and an attack on the male psyche. Far from being sexually explicit in content it is, in fact, extremely restrained. It is intellectually erotic but there is no heat of lust present, which is intentional. Victorian values are hammered home time and again (the ""Dire consequences for Cruise's character and his family"" spoken by the man in the red cloak at the masked orgy, and the hooker who turned out to be HIV positive that Cruise had nearly had sex with the night before), which is quite amusing. Kubrick is not preaching here, just gently mocking the country in which he resided and made his movies. Of course, the film wasn't only about that.<br/><br/>It can be taken for granted that every shot and scene was masterfully photographed, from the cinema verite style shots of New York streets to the arch-Gothic pathos of the masked orgy. It had a very film noir feeling throughout and the mystery of what is happening is interesting from start to end.<br/><br/>I do not think Tom Cruise could act his way out of a paper bag but somehow Kubrick got him to turn in a decent performance. The unusual soundtrack added plenty of atmosphere to the picture but really stole the scene, initially, in the masked orgy sequence. I also really enjoyed the way the naked women walked in that sequence - like androids with cold grace and perfect balance. I had never seen anything like it before and found it one of the most pleasing touches of the movie.<br/><br/>The last line of the film was a classic comedy moment. Kubrick essentially made comically black movies and this one was no exception in my mind.<br/><br/>I think this movie is equal to his best work, and better than some of his not so good movies. I give this movie 10 out of 10."

","Stanley Kubrick is a master panoramic filmmaker in the tradition of Alexander Korda, David Lean, DeMille and Griffith only with philosophical and socially relevant depth.  This film is basically about marital fidelity using the upper crust as its vehicle along with  a genteel satanic-ritualistic pornography.  One wants to know if Kubrick is adding lots of T & A and black hooded gatherings to shore up a weak dramatic plot structure or if he these are artistically valid motifs that make the point: if the ruling class can't keep its decadence in check, how can one expect the rest of us to<br/><br/>The use of satanic overtones to exemplify degeneracy in high places was refreshingly minus the usual paranoia generating evocations of Manson gang sociopaths in my neighborhood.  These slasher film elements were yoked down hard to the service of the morality play.  One would presumably be made better able to resist temptations of the flesh without converting to catholicism, not as much from Pavlovian programming but from identification with the protagonists, reflection and dramatic catharsis.<br/><br/>The one controversial element in the film was its sound track which I found to be brilliant."

","Lots of spoilers:<br/><br/>I can completely understand why one would dislike this film, but it worked for me.  Stanley Kubrick builds up an entire uncomfortable, mysterious, surreal, dangerous, almost cartoony environment- that doesn't exist.  The joke of 'Eyes Wide Shut' is not only the orgy that seems much more sinister than it is, but the stunning reversal that climaxes in Bill arriving home and finding the mask on his side of the bed.  I was shattered.  The entire film sets you up to feel resentment toward Alice (who was she to tell her husband all that stuff, and who was she to lead on that old man all night at the party?).  But in the end, who was more unfaithful?  Bill was for seeking out what Alice only fantasized about.  Kubrick deserves credit for making the mystery/suspense element most of the film and completely subverting it at the end (courageous to say the least).  He also deserves credit for making such a weird film work in the first place.  There were a multitude of pitfalls where this movie could have failed miserably, particularly in the characterizations of Bill and Alice.  Had they not be sympathetic enough the entire film could have been made irrelevant.  However, the old master executed perfectly, and Eyes Wide Shut is a beautifully acted, directed, and photographed film.  There's no real 'point' here, it's more an exploration of male/female sexuality that by no means claims to have the answers. The glacial pacing didn't bother me (simply another element to make the viewer uncomfortable), nor did the nudity (anyone who calls this pornography is either unclear on the definition or has some very serious problems).  All part of Kubrick's massive joke on his audience.  If you can appreciate that kind of humor, this is a masterpiece."

","In Greek mythology, Zeus allegedly got into an argument with his wife, Hera, over which gender was more sexual, male or female;  so, he took a god and changed his sex, and then asked for a comparison.  Zeus wasn't happy with the answer:  the female of the species, the god reported, far surpassed the male, both in terms of desire, and ability.  <br/><br/>Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is narrowly focused on this issue of female sexuality.  In fact, its laser-beam dedication to the issue of feminine sexual desire is so unwavering that it's easy to be confused by its obsessive single-mindedness.  Although most of the movie's action follows Bill (Tom Cruise) as he struggles with jealousy over his wife's attraction to other men, it's really about her:  Alice (Nicole Kidman) literally defines his reality through her own.  And her reality is produced, not by her conscious will, but by the depths of her feminine sexuality, buried so deeply and so powerfully within the libidinous pre-conscious brain that her waking awareness is but a shadow image of it.<br/><br/>Bill's world is thrown into chaos when, high on pot, Alice's true nature comes smashing through her darkest depths to the light of consciousness. Discussing infidelity, he tells her that he's never been jealous of her because she `would never be unfaithful.'  She replies, sarcastically, `You're awfully sure of yourself, aren't you?'  Bill answers, confidently, `No, I'm sure of you.'  As a man, I feel the object ownership inherent in Bill's words.  And then Alice destroys Bill's somnambulistic, fragile, secure, culturally accepted and encouraged little lie, baring her lustful soul to him with a true confession.  With sultry and utterly visceral derision, Alice tells him, `If you men only knew.'  <br/><br/>Freud wrote about the difficulty of uniting two currents of feeling:  the tender, affectionate feelings, with the sensual ones.  And that's the central dilemma of Eyes Wide Shut.  The real question is not whether Bill will get over his jealousy:  it's whether Alice can integrate both types of feeling into her personality, and literally redeem their relationship as the more powerfully sexual of the two.  The very last words of the movie, spoken by Alice, leave no doubt."

While I do agree that it has those things, I did like it. I can't explain it. I was actually impressed with myself that I, as a teenager, was able to appreciate the film. Does that mean I am a serious moviegoer? I'm not sure. But I can say that all the people who hated it are probably those who have become adjusted to non-stop action, special effects, and explosions, a hint at why Steven Spielberg is more popular with the people. It takes a lot of guts these days to make a film like this. People are used to something happening right away, they have forgotten how to watch movies and read into them. I didn't understand this movie, I'm not sure I ever will. I didn't watch it to see Kidman naked, either. I'm sure Kubrick made this for some reason, however, it is lost to me. This is one of those movies where you just know they are trying to tell you something, to send you some message, because they simply couldn't have made a movie like this unless they were. You might find yourself asking why it was made and what it is about. Really I don't get that either. But maybe I am not comprehending enough to see it. But I still liked it. Strange. Whatever Kubrick was hinting at, I'm sure it was something important. I think the title had some meaning, too, but I don't know what it is. Kubrick liked to challenge people by making his movies a very different experience than most. The personal experience I had was that I learned I can still like a movie that is slow and very weird.

","Dr. Bill is confronted by this question by his wife. ""Why aren't you the jealous type?"" His response? Silence...Kubrick leaves the viewer to fill in the reasons. This question splits into two very basic questions that are often too disturbing for men to confront...namely ""what is jealousy and why do  we men try to convince women that we are not like other men? Jealousy first. Dr. Bill does not become enraged because his wife fancies someone else by itself. This film, along with all our lives, shows that men make comparisons of EFFORTS to other men. Dr. Bill has gone through med school. Dr. Bill has provided a big house with comforts. Dr. Bill has saved lives.  The film constantly shows the surroundings displaying all those efforts. What has the navel officer done? What are his efforts in Dr. Bill's comparison? Next to nothing! No man would ever get enraged if Michael Jordan beat him out while trying out for a basketball team. But what if some no-practice, beer drinking, over-weight sloth were to be selected over Jordan for the team? Would MJ be jealous? You bet he would, after all his EFFORTS. The second issue here is more painful. Why do we men distant our- selves from other men? It is simple...because we hate the male culture more than women do. Yet, we cannot run from it. Doing so only makes it worse. So, in our journey to confront it we become the very thing we despise and have been struggling against all our lives.  Every male re- lationship in this film takes a deep dive, lower and lower throughout and without exception. His relationship with Nick is based on a soft, empty memory. They were buddies in med school and, yet, Nick dropped out! So, why remember it in a positive note? Because men like to remember empty relationships as good since no fighting broke out just as 2 rocks lying on the ground must be having a great relationship as well.<br/><br/>Dr.Bill's relationships with the storekeeper, Sydney Pollack's character, and a person in the same predicament as he is whose fiancee comes on to him in front of her dead father all add to his isolation. And women? In their rage they react to feeling suffocated by men by seeking out someone cut from the same mold as the one she is with. Funny she didn't pick out a mailman to have a fantasy about!

","I saw this film at a studio preview held for West Coast journalists.  The film, much touted and anticipated was, at that time, still an unknown entity.  The two main stars, Kidman and Cruise, and its notorious director, Kubrick, brought a huge media buzz to the film, however.<br/><br/>
The film is photographed like a painting, and the camera moves like a dancer, gently embracing the characters as they move through the various scenes in the film.  The actors, stars and supporting cast, bring depth and honesty to their performances.  The one, fatal, tragic misstep in the film is the story.<br/><br/>Cruise's easy manner places him in a situation where his wife suspects him of cheating.  This prompts her, in a moment of alcohol driven honesty and angst, to confess to having seriously considered sleeping with a man she saw.  This confession has its intended effect, sending Cruise out into the night, at first in anger, then out for revenge.<br/><br/>Cruise is then exposed to a series of sexual opportunities, none of which he pursues.  Each one, it seems, brings him closer and closer to death.  Even the affable and attractive prostitute he meets, and follows back to her flat, turns out to be a ticking time-bomb of AIDS.<br/><br/>This theme, while a potentially interesting ostinato, becomes instead a clanging harangue that seems pointless and outdated.  It is only when Cruise is emotionally, and literally, stripped of his identity and brought to the brink of death, does he wake up enough to realize that his life, and his wife, are both wonderful.<br/><br/>In the end, I felt that his character was, frankly, stupid.

"radiofreeadam","Null","0","0","30 March 2001"," Let the re-evaluation begin.
","Trampled upon its initial release by audiences and critics alike, Stanley Kubrick's elegant and haunting final film Eyes Wide Shut will inevitably be rediscovered by a new generation of filmgoers and elevated to classic status. It's happened with almost all of Kubrick's other films, from Paths of Glory, to 2001: A Space Odyssey to A Clockwork Orange. And yes, I AM putting Eyes Wide Shut in their esteemed company, because, in terms of pure construction and stylistic invention, it is one of Kubrick's best films. I do not pretend to grasp every thematic nuance that Kubrick intended, --indeed, some seem as oblique and impenetrable as the man himself -- but there IS value to this film's method; it's an almost totally subjective movie, personalized to its characters moods and emotions rather then the audience's. Understandably, some were put off by this method, but patient viewers will be rewarded. I think too much has been made of the the film's ""was-it-all-dream"" ambiguity: Eyes Wide Shut total absurdist fantasy, but it also contains a great deal of emotional truth. The scene at the end of the film where Kidman and Cruise sit in their living room, seemingly after discussing a divorce, is one of the most realistic depictions of familial conflict I have ever seen.  By turns, I found it to be very moving and very scary, and the so-called ""artiness"" of several scenes was for me a logical extension of the film's --consistent -- atmosphere. And, even if it is somewhat exaggerated in its presentation, SO WHAT? It's a Kubrick movie, so of course it will be stylized. And on that count, it's an unqualified triumph: there are colours and images here that will haunt you for days. (My favourite is the wall of golden lights at the party in the opening scene that reappears on a store front later on.) The orgy scene is unforgettable in the way that docking of the shuttle is in 2001: it's a purely original vision that defies our mos confident expectations.  I also happen to love the score of this film, and I think that the performances -- particularly Tom Cruise, who did as good a job with his cipher of a character as anybody could have -- are perfectly attuned to the material. Is it a misogynistic film? Yes it is, to the extent that it comments on misogyny rather than practicing it. Remember that the orgy sequence is perceived subjective;y by Cruise, and not by us: the horror of the sex and the treatment of the women are constructions of his own biases and insecurities. And, on those terms, Eyes Wide Shut is not only not misogynistic, but bravely revealing of certain male attitudes towards sex. I do not find this to be an erotic or sexually exciting film, but I do think its observations and implications are very interesting. Kubrick aestheticizes sex so rigidly that it almost becomes comic...and, in many ways, Eyes Wide Shut is a very strange comedy. (Tom Cruise not getting laid in a film full of illicit sex? Get a few rewrites and hire Rob Reiner to direct, and you've got a holiday hit.) I have seen Eyes Wide Shut only a handful of times, but I have no doubt I will come back to it at least once a year. It's a richly textured, thought-provoking film that was unfairly bullied by American critics, who somehow were able to convince themselves that derivative and inferior films like American Beauty and Magnolia were enmblematic of filmmaking in 1999. Eyes Wide Shut was the best film of that year and hasn't really been matched since. I guarantee that it will soon be accorded the status it deserves, and not out of sympathy for the late Mr. Kubrick: he'll just be given his due."

","For a film that was advertised as the new 9 1/2 weeks, this is a very chilly film. The basic premise is that sex outside the sanctity of marriage will either kill or haunt you forever. There are some things to hate about this movie (that damned awful piano score) but also things to admire about it. If you feel this is Kubrick's worst movie, try sitting through Barry Lyndon. If Stanley was still alive I'd like to ask him what was up with Alan Cumming's character, was it supposed to be funny or just disturbing? I thought he was going to leap over the desk and kiss Cruise.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was a little suspenseful and NOT SEXY AT ALL. And the ending of the story with Kidman's promise to Cruise almost came off more like a threat. Or a life sentence. Whatever grandpa Stanley says, sex is not THAT scary.

","While I feel that Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut is  a good movie (although it falls short of such classics as Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange), I feel that it is a poor adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's short novel Traumnovelle. While I feel Eyes Wide Shut captures the sexual aspects of the novel quite well, I feel it fails to build upon one of the themes of the novel--the juxtaposition of dream and reality. I think this failure could be due to two factors. The first is moving the novel's setting of Vienna around the Twenties to New York City in the 1990s. For viewers watching the movie in the late Twentieth and early Twenty First centuries this can have the affect of making the movie's events seem more real and hence distancing them from the dreams discussed in the film. The second is what I perceive as Kubrick's failure to capitalize on the dreams related in Traumnovelle. Indeed, rather than simply having the characters more or less tell us about some of the dreams, he could have shown some of us the dreams (this is film, after all). In this way he could have taken advantage of one of the idea contained within the novel--the relationship of dreams to reality.<br/><br/>Regardless, Eyes Wide Shut is a must see movie, particularly for Kubrick fans. It is a disturbing journey through human sexuality, all done without judging the characters or pulling any punches. Although not up to some of Kubrick's earlier works (let's face it, they are hard acts to follow!), Eyes Wide Shut is a very interesting work."

","I won't hide the fact that I regard Kubrick as one of the great directors, and that I've never seen one of his films that I didn't find worthwhile, if not always overwhelming. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" certainly didn't overwhelm me, but it was evocative and absorbing throughout. I don't understand why it was puffed as an ""erotic"" film; I can hardly imagine a less erotic one--even with a couple of the more attractive stars and a lot of visible flesh, this came off to me as anti-erotic. I also find it puzzling that a lot of commentators here didn't grasp the fact that this was not supposed to reflect any kind of realistic or naturalistic world. It evoked an eerie otherworld, into which an irredeemably ordinary couple stumbles. I admire Cruise and Kidman for their willingness to commit themselves to what must have been an exhausting experience. (I also have to wonder whether Kubrick's obsessive perfectionism was not threatening to become a kind of black hole into which all his energies would be sucked forever.) Kubrick has never really been an actor's director, and the work of Cruise and Kidman, while they must have given it their all, is not what sets this film apart. What does is look, atmosphere, and, yes, music. Kubrick had a genius for finding published music that adds enormously to the total impact of a scene. The Ligeti music was especially effective in this regard. If you haven't seen this one, I'd go--but leave your top-drawer expectations at home and take it for what it is: an often fascinating, entertaining piece of expressionism. It does seem a shame that some of our greatest artists go out on a less than stellar note...and, if I regret anything about ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" that would be it."

The emotions that drive Dr. Bill are central to the movie, not his neighborhood!<br/><br/>The movie from start to finish is making a comment on love, fidelity, trust and communication.  Dr. Bill's misadventures are completely driven by the misplaced distrust between Alice and Him and their inability to communicate their emotions without being stoned.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie starts with Alice's fantasy from last year's summer vacation.  She joyfully tells the story as if she'd wish she'd acted on it.  Bill, obviously acting on more issues than just the fantasy roams the streets of the fantasy city looking to score.  In parallel to the fact that Alice didn't acutally cheat on him, he, twice is stopped, not entirely of his own volition, from cheating on her.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie mirrors the first half...starting with the scene where Alice tells Bill of her dream.  Though similar to the fantasy she confessed the night before, she is absolutely miserable about the dream. The repercussions of Bill's actions are just as trying.  They're falling apart, feeling the mal-results of the flaws in their marriage!!<br/><br/>Finally Bill's issues become too much to handle alone and the couple begins to do the right thing...he confesses everything and they talk it out.  The whole movie was about the effects of distrust and infidelity (or near infidelity) on love and marriage.  One of Nicole Kidman's last lines commented on it perfectly: ""I am [sure] that the reality of one night, let alone that of a whole life time, can never be the whole truth.""<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut succeeds in making a somewhat hidden point about love AND as an entertainingly bizarre dream of a movie."

It has so many clever little lines & symbols hidden in there reminding us of our cariculture & how well Mr Kubrick understands it.<br/><br/>Every scene is well acted, elegant & just dazzling. I dont know what you lot are complaning about when u say it was boring! When he steps into this cult like society for the first time the sense of mystery got me.<br/><br/>Is this a sex movie? No Is this a movie that loads of mass idiot punters will like?NO Is this a movie unlike many others for the eloquent fashion that it uses to weave a tale that actually holds the viewer? YES<br/><br/>Mr Kubrick should be happy knowing that he has created yet another masterpiece.<br/><br/>email me your opinions folks Nyrone (17)"

","I too loved A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Dr. Strangelove, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, et al, so I was totally confused on why I didn't like Eyes Wide Shut when I first saw it.  Nor the second time, or the third time.  I guess I couldn't see what Kubrick was trying to prove/portray, but after relaxing, and watching it for the FOURTH time (yes, I had to see it four times till I finally got it, though not all in one sitting), CLICK!!  I saw what Kubrick wanted us to see, and now I know why this is one of his most brilliant works.  It took a while for me to warm up to it, since everything is so subliminal.  Paying attention to detail is so important, it's almost claustrophobic.  Along with that, it is a very long and exhausting movie. However, once you start to put the pieces to the puzzle together, the resulting picture is very rewarding."

","After spending what seems like half a lifetime last night watching this endless film, I'm left with feelings of sympathy for Tom and Nicole. Fancy giving up nearly two years of your lives to make such a desperately flawed movie. I've read quite a few of the reviews to figure out if anybody else had any clues as to what it was about. The prevailing opinions are either that you are in some sort of intellectual class above anybody else, and that you get it and the plebes don't, or that it's beautifully filmed schlock. I'm of the second opinion. I get the premise that it's about how fragile relationships are, and that we have to trust each other, but did we have to sit through nearly three hours to make that point. Another problem I have with it is the mannered acting from just about everybody in it (ACTING !!! as John Lovitz would say). Nicole's portrayal of being stoned was over the top, maybe having to repeat the scene time after time for Kubrick had that effect. Every line seemed to take forever. I can't think of anybody in the film who came across as natural, apart from the nymphomaniac daughter of the Russian costume-store manager. The film really started to go down hill in the very first scenes where Nicole at first played along with, then rejected the advances of an ageing Hungarian lounge-lizard at a party. Why would she put up with his tawdry come-on lines? It doesn't ring true at all. As to the so-called orgy scene, everybody looked bored stiff - no pun intended; the women walked about in slow motion, was this supposed to enhance the eroticism?  And by the way, do these people have X-Ray vision? How could they possibly know that Cruise was an outsider behind his mask? Any tension Kubrick was trying to inject into the later part of the film was ruined by the incessant plonking on the piano that any toddler could manage. More quibbles: London cannot pass for Manhattan, the streets were much too tidy looking. Also I saw the same mail-box in several different locations, tagged with the same graffitti. I 495 does not go anywhere near Long Island, as far as I am aware - it's in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Maybe that mansion they were at was really in Newport R.I. in which case the film becomes even more unbelievable. The commute would be horrendous! These may seem nit-picking, but look at it this way: either Kubrick is a perfectionist genius, in which case he would have got those kinds of details right, or he's a human being who made some excellent films earlier in life, but unfortunately his final film was not up to his best."

","As a very interested person in Kubrick's works , after three times watching , I found ""Eyes Wide Shut"" unfinished !<br/><br/>Does the perfectionist Kubrick totalize the whole created suspense meanwhile the erotic masquerade (orgy party) until Bill's reading the newspaper (with Mandy's death news) , with a sequence of only the wicked Victor Ziegler's monologues ? Does the creator of great suspenses , such as : HAL9000's plot against Dr. Bowman in ""2001-..."" , or the Viet-Kong sniper sequences at the end of ""Full Metal Jacket"" , or ""Barry Lyndon"" 's duel ,  prepare the whole details for the masquerade , Bill Harford's detecting about Nick & Mandy & receiving two warnings from the hosts of the masquerade , to leave them all aborted ? What is the profit of magnifying the danger of the masquerade opposite to suffering from Aids (which Bill could be addicted to by that prostitute) ? On what intention does Kubrick emphasize on the man in balcony & his nodding at Bill in the masquerade ... or why does camera emphasize on Mandy's body in the beginning party at Ziegler's house , in the masquerade , & in the morgue of the hospital (after her death) ... or why does the masquerade begin with that kind of religious formality performance & why is the performer of the masquerade resemble to a religious man ... what does that INDIAN religious song (performed at the masquerade) mean & why is it used ??? If we are supposed to be satisfied with Ziegler's monologues , why does the reception man in Nick's hotel emphasize on escorting Nick by two angry men ? Does Kubrick intend to deceive his audience ? What is the intention of inserting these plans & sequences in the film ? Does he intend to prolong his film (he who repeated his shots even to 200 times) ? Is it probable that he has used some scenes  in vain ?<br/><br/>On the other hand , what is the profit of pursuing the dramatized affair of the masquerade ? Inserting any mystery in present structure of the film (Alice & Bill 's married life & the rights that everyone has in this kind of human relations) could lead to what result & would solve which problem ? Supposing more complete suspense & drama for the masquerade , Bill's odyssey along the night would reach to which different conclusion ? Does completing the suspense like other Kubrick's works , change the present conclusion (accepting individualistic abilities & choices in matrimony) ? Does Alice's mistake (or sin ?!!) & Bill's probable revenge could lead to a more dangerous result (than Aids) for Harfords family (Alice , Bill , & their little child) ? The danger of disgrace , shame , scandal , social situation damage , & perhaps family destruction & social injury at last .<br/><br/>In this supposition , Kubrick's permanent feature would happen : "" POWER & its dangerous consequences "" , this time in married life as the most personal relations in society which somehow could damage society . Kubrick has always pointed at this feature :<br/><br/><ul><li>Machinism &amp; its dangers in ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"".</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Harshness &amp; moral damage in people's behaviour &amp; its dangers in ""A Clockwork Orange"".</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Militarism &amp; martial power &amp; its dangers in ""Dr. Strangelove or :..."" &amp; ""Full Metal Jacket"" &amp; ""Paths of Glory"".</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Aristocracy &amp; noble traditions &amp; its dangers in ""Barry Lyndon"".</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Superstitions &amp; its dangers in ""The Shining"". &amp; ...</li></ul><br/><br/>Suppose to complete the suspense of the masquerade through an undesired scandal which happens to Bill , ruining his social situation & destroy his family , then we could see that Alice & Bill 's playing with fire would lead to a frightening firing out of their control . A fire in which they (& their little child) would burn . And as a family is a social unit , their family damage would be a social injury . A danger that ""INDIVIDUALISM"" would create for society , the power of personal abilities if they are not limited to any border (in this case , to moral limits) , the supposition which is more probable in Kubrick's works . Here , the suspension in the masquerade affair would be attractive for people to pursue the story , just like Omberto Echo's pivot in ""The Name of the Rose"" which has a more great role in transferring religious concepts than a criminal story .<br/><br/>In my opinion , the present structure of the film has numerous unusual sequences & plans to Kubrick's works while it has many missings inside . It was not finished ! Kubrick's unexpected passing by didn't permit him to finish his last symphony of ""POWER & its dangerous consequences"".<br/><br/>WHAT DO YOU THINK ?!!"

","Possible Spoilers:<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut makes some very heavy statements, and has a strong beginning: a happily married, successful couple in the prime of their lives, a doctor and an art curator, have a full life and a close marriage.  They attend socials and enjoy the occasional light recreational drugs together.  What can possibly go wrong?   Everything; and all based on a simple argument.  A suave European comes onto the wife at a social; she mentions this while they are both stoned after the party.   He gives his wife a compliment that of course he would find her attractive, because she is so beautiful.  Wrong thing to say.  She takes this as a deep insult that she cannot be attractive because of her mind;  also, she gets the impression that he is quite complacent about her fidelity.  As revenge, she proceeds to tell him in detail of a strong fantasy she had about a naval officer she saw at a distance on their honeymoon, not realizing how damaging this would be to him.  The next morning, she has forgotten about it; he has not, and starts questioning his entire marriage, seeking revenge on her by intending to go out and have a quick affair.  He comes across hookers, who he pays money to but can't go through with it; he loves his wife, and knows this will damage their marriage, and besides, she hadn't actually cheated on him.  Still, he cannot get the mental infidelity out of his mind, which makes a very strong comment about the expectations we have of our partner's faithfulness.<br/><br/>And then things really go to hell.  He gets a tip about a wild party, and goes to it in disguise, only to discover it is a hedonistic orgy with possible satanic overtones.  He is caught and revealed as an outsider. Threats to him and his wife are made.  <br/><br/>During these journeys leading up to this disaster, there are many disturbing scenes as he discovers the difference between sexual fantasy and sexual reality.  In one scene he buys a costume from an austere man whose 16 year-old daughter is an uncontrollable nymphomanic.  He tries to control her by locking her in the house, but never seeks professional help.  Later, the doctor discovers the man has decided to profit from his daughter's nymphomania by pimping her out.  This scene, short and quick, is more disturbing and with darker implications than anything else in the movie. <br/><br/>
After being left a rather obvious hint that he and his wife are being watched and followed, and terrified of possible violence to his wife, the husband confesses to his wife what happened; she is devastated, but they make up in the end, which is the movie's biggest problem:  after the messy betrayal, hurt, and damage they have done to each other, mostly by non-communication, they wrap everything up while Christmas-shopping with their daughter.  <br/><br/>The movie's most potent statements concern what we take for granted in our relationships, what we presume, and how our emotions which begin relationships can as quickly and stupidly destroy them.  It also shows how thin the line is between sexual fantasy and sexual nightmare, and how close sex, love, and trust are tied.  The problem with the movie is that after these elements are laid out, they are not pursued fully.  They are left where they are while convoluted story elements take place, such as a possible murder that may have happened, and other subplots.  And the ending wraps up threads way too disparate and tangled, way too neatly and quickly, leaving for a very unsatisfactory ending.  The most that could be hoped for in this mess would be the couple's willingness to pick up the pieces and communicate their feelings more honestly.<br/><br/>And perhaps, giving up the recreational drugs that started the mess in the first place.  Seven out of ten stars; it had the possibility of being ten out of ten.  One wonders what Kubrik might have changed about it if he had lived longer."

","Many critics and fans seem to be having trouble understanding Eye Wide Shut (EWS). Allow me to explain what is going on in this movie so that it can better appreciated. This information may be considered a spoiler although I personally don't think of this as a ""surprise"" movie or a ""thriller"" so it shouldn't matter much. EWS is a deep and erotic psychological study of sexual desire. <br/><br/>Most of the middle part of the movie is Bill's dream. Immediately after Nicole finishes telling Dr. Bill (in his bed) about her Naval officer crush to the time where he is back in bed crying and wanting to tell her everything, he has been asleep in his bed and dreaming. The first event of the dream is a phone call about the death of a patient and the last event is when he sees the mask on the bed. These events and all the events between are episodes in his dream. They are all surreal and they never really happened in Bill's life. The dream images are instigated by the events that Bill experienced earlier that evening including the party where he doesn't know anybody (which becomes the masked party in his dream), the sexual flirtations of the two women there, the near death of Victor's consort, and Nicole's revelations. The movie is concerned with the insecurities caused by sexual desire. Notice that after the dream, there is no reference in the movie to the mask (representing what Bill tries to portray to others as his false sexual indifference to anybody but his wife; his wife is more open and honest) or of Bill's strange ""experiences"". They were only part of Bill's dream.  There is much to this film.  Try to figure out what events in real life triggered which specific dream events. Enjoy."

","This film seemed to be composed of two parts. The first had Nicole Kidman seemingly in the picture simply for eye candy. The second, much more interesting storyline had Tom Cruise, and the mystery of the house. Trim Nicole Kidman's part drastically, or better yet cut her out of the film entirely, and this film has the potential to be great. Not to mention it would have been a much needed forty-five minutes shorter. The scenes in the house, while strong for some viewers, is not actually as scandalous as I was expecting from what I'd heard through word of mouth. In fact the only parts of the movie which were offensive to me where the dream sequences which featured Nicole Kidman and the nameless sailor. I found myself wondering what caused her to make such a poor choice in career judgement. The party at the beginning in which she danced with the Hungarian, was uneccessary, and entirely too long. Cut the whole thing. Make Tom Cruise single, or at least make his married life not quite so drawn out, maybe even give Nicole Kidman some intelligent, brief dialogue to deliver, and this would have been in the eight or nine category, instead of a slightly above average 6, for a good idea, which was off by one performance."

","Stanley Kubrick is a genius. I know this because we are told so by the advert for Mr Kubrick's website at the beginning of the rental video. And no adverts for other movies either, Stanley is much too much of a diety to be placed next to lesser efforts from mere mortals. But as far as I am concerned, Stanley (may I call you Stanley?) is not a genius because of his films which are frankly variable, but because he kept Tom Cruise off our screens for three years. This altruistic act alone should have seen him knighted. I am reliably informed by someone in the know that the reason Tom Cruise doesn't have to act is because he is the STAR of the picture he's been hired for. Well, you could have knocked me down with a feather. $20m just to STAR in the picture. Acting costs extra then. I am also reliably informed that 'The Shawshank Redemption' is the template by which everything in the known universe is measured against. If you don't like it then your critical faculties in evaluating whether Tom Cruise can act or not must be suspect. 'The Shawshank Redemption' comes from a great literary giant who writes about giant space spiders living in the sewers who also hold down day jobs as clowns. Blimey, I'm chastened. Now I know these great universal truths I can look at Cruise in a totally new light. Or without feeling nauseous, which would be a start. And it must have worked because Cruise is great in this film. He's just really funny. Not that he does any acting as such, it's a curious non-performance, but because the sheer incongruousness of good old American boy Cruise sleep walking around a bizarre european art flick is priceless to behold. The film is so weird that it's hard to tell whether he's actually good or bad. Nicole Kidman goes all out to convince us that she's awful, however, her arms flailing around like a brain damaged Dromedary. Hey, these two should get married. Anyway, you haven't lived till you've seen Cruise weeping to what sounds like a two year old banging random keys on a piano. They paid top dollar for this soundtrack. In fact, Cruise is cruelly stalked by a piano the entire film. He stands by the gate to a mansion for an interminable length of time and up and down the scales plinks that toddler until Cruise receives a letter from a mysterious valet. There's alway's a mysterious valet in a Kubrick movie. Cruise looks bemused, and we share his confusion. I think he needs to lie down, take a stress pill and think things through. I've always suspected that Stanley had a wicked sense of humour and this whole film comes across as an arch and knowing parody of art house drivel while simultaneously playing a practical joke on one of Hollywood's biggest stars. <br/><br/>The film has the usual irritating wide-angle lenses and ornamental interiors and numbing atmospherics bordering on inertia we expect of our Stanley. But boredom soon gives way to laughter, thank God. More fun can be had spotting British landmarks passed off as American, as our Stanley famously did not like to travel abroad. We've had palm trees in the docklands and boot camps in surrey. Hang on a minute, I recognise those revolving doors from somewhere. Sure enough, it's the Kensington and Chelsea hospital, although it's supposed to be New York. I've been to the mental Health unit there many times. I tell them that I'm Tom Cruise and that I can act and six orderlies wrestle me to the ground administering anti-psychotic medication.  Also the last scene in Hamley's toy store looks just like the one in Regent's Street. So you see, you can never get bored watching a Stanley Kubrick film. The biggest shock was seeing the orgy scene which to my astonishment was filmed in my house. That will teach me to leave the kitchen door unlocked. At least it explains those funny stains on the carpet. It's a shame Kubrick didn't leave the orgy scene as an enigma. He ruined the surreal and whacky atmosphere of the picture by taking it literally.<br/><br/>What can I say, this is a wonderful, wonderful film to go out on. Definately one of the all time funniest ever made, especially the very final line which is a killer. It had me doubled up and rolling around the floor in hysterics. Which is just as well as I needed to look for my contact lenses. I always take them off before a Tom Cruise film but not anymore. Tom Cruise is God, official. And Stanley Kubrick is a genius. Thanks for the memories, mate."

","Don't believe the hype surrounding this film prior to viewing it. This is a simple film examining marital truths Kubrick-style. Why this film took so long to shoot, I don't know. Original cast members Jennifer Jason Leigh and Harvey Keitel were replaced mid-shoot with Marie Richardson and Sidney Pollock. It would have been interesting to see their contributions to this film (DVD, anyone?). Plus the orgy scene which had to be masked with digitized figures to gain an R-rating was uncalled for. I've seen the uncut version and it isn't anything that hasn't been seen in worse movies. Arthouse films are always the fall guy for this ratings madness. Tom Cruise gives a carefully understated performance which is tricky to a film like this. He could have broke his cool and unleashed it in a violent manner. Or, as he did in the film, he could choose the alternative. Nicole Kidman steals the film with her one monologue. Why she was not nominated for an Oscar is beyond me. Alan Cummings has a scene-stealing role as a hotel clerk. Definitely another feather in Kubrick's hat."

","Understand Kubrick's message and you'll appreciate Eyes Wide Shut. The message is one spread across several of the director's films. There is not one interpretation of Kubrick's works. There are several. This is intentional and is most prominent at his film's ending scenes. 2001, Full Metal Jacket, A Clockwork Orange, The Shinning -- all with endings that were more or less unexpected, lacking traditional catharsis formula, and open to varied  interpretation. In Eyes Wide Shut he took this ending scene technique further than he had ever taken it before. This is what left some audiences confused or dissatisfied. You might say that his films enter the esoteric in their blatant refusal to follow conventional catharsis formulae. But as you walk out of the theater questions are left in your mind, for you to answer. That's important.<br/><br/>This film follows the Kubrick technique of wide angles, minimalist set designs and a slow to medium pace all used to create the feel of watching players on a stage. Kubrick's usually discerning selection of actors, minimalist technique and unyielding drive for perfecting his vision would make fancy production design, CGI and other ancillary devices only distract from his stories. This goes to prove his grasp of real filmmaking, giving us films that stand on their own without the help of technical embellishment."

My one gripe was the use of nudity. I'm not saying it was bad, I'm fine with nudity. It's just that I think Kubric used it in the wrong places. Like in the party scene with Mandy, she didnt really have to be completely nude. She could have had the towel on her the whole scene, not just at the end. And I really didnt need to see that dead girls nude figure. That overhead shot of her kinda discusted me. Other than that I loved the movie.

Granted, this will be hard to do given the amount of hype that has surrounded the film, but it's an absolute necessity.<br/><br/>This is not storytelling in typical Hollywood form. In fact, considering the film's length, there's actually very little story being told. Like most Kubrick films, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is more of a cerebral meditation on human nature, and as such, it is an open-ended and oblique exercise. Correspondingly, the final payoff ultimately depends on the viewer's participation.<br/><br/>Somewhat surprisingly, both Cruise and Kidman deliver absolutely brilliant, Oscar-calibre performances.

","In my review of ""Phantom Menace"" I wrote that perhaps a director is allowed only one cultural icon per lifetime. I had forgotten Stanley Kubrick. He produced them in spades.<br/><br/>Actually, to call ""Eyes Wide Shut"" an erotic thriller is to miss the point. True, sex and sexuality dominate its themes and it's structured like a thriller, but Kubrick's final film is far more. On the one hand it's pure Kubrick, replete with mind-shattering images. It also continues Kubrick's fascination with journeys. From the journey to destruction in ""Dr. Strangelove"" to journeys through social madness in ""Clockwork Orange"" and the nature of reality in ""The Shining,"" and culminating in humanity's search for enlightenment in ""2001,"" Kubrick's work has been concerned with such journeys. This time, a New York society doctor ventures into a socially constructed reality that few of us have seen or will admit.<br/><br/>Then again, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is one of those wonderful films that's more interesting for what it doesn't say than for what it says.<br/><br/>Through a bizarre series of coincidences, Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) discovers a hazy, ill-defined sexual underworld, one which may include murder. He meets a series of sleazy characters, all of whom seem to be involved with whatever it is. Sinister plot points and themes lurk just off camera but are not seen. This is Kubrick's genius: the ability to draw us into the mystery even as he tells us there is no solution.<br/><br/>The much-hyped cult-orgy scene occupies only a few minutes of screen time. Kubrick's imagery is stunning and Fellini-esquire, draped in an evocative chant using a sound technique borrowed from David Lynch. But again, what is interesting is what is not said. What do the strange rituals mean? Is it a religious cult? A secret society? Or just a sex club, by and for the very bored very rich? We aren't told. Can we believe the version he gets from a friend-member? The mask Harford wore--and later hid--appears beside his sleeping wife. Did she find it, or was it placed there? Does she know more than she says? Again, no information. Always there is the tantalizing hint of an answer just out of his (and our) reach. Though only a minute was cut out, Kubrick often leaves small markers in odd places within his films. One would wish that the version seen in more grown-up nations were available, rather than the eviscerated print allowed in the States.<br/><br/>Following this scene, the film's direction changes completely. The score becomes atmospheric and menacing; reality becomes distorted. As he struggles to learn the truth, Harford is told by one friend that he is ""out of his depth."" Indeed. He is found out because though he is part of the upper class, those he pursues turn out to be the unbelievably rich and powerful. Their reality is not his. Kubrick is telling us that ultimately, our social world builds our reality.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is the theme of ""Eyes Wide Shut""--that there exist social realities that are as unknowable to us as the incomprehensible events witnessed by Dr. Harford. As others have pointed out, his journey is much like the one that unfolds in Scorsese's ""After Hours""--we are never really told the whole story but we (and the characters) are left with the distinct feeling that Something Is Going On. ""After Hours"" can be hard to find, but try to see them both. Better yet, rent them the same night."

I must confess however after the film was over I read many reviews about the film as I was having some difficulty in deciding what if any ""meaning"" was being made by the film-makers....assuming they know  that themselves.(I am still waiting to learn what the aforementioned 2001 was really about). From the reviews i read all sorts of fruedian and other interpretations were espoused including a lot of pscho-babble. Anyhow, my main criticism about the film...and perhaps only criticism is that the 2 main male actors were mis-cast. Tom Cruise was out of his depth playing this role.....he never gave the impression of being a doctor in his ill-fitting suits...and looked more like a cocktail waitor.. and Sydney Pollack was unconvincing and almost half-hearted.(Jack Nicholson would have been superb in either of these two roles).Despite the criticism this film is still in the Master-Class league for its sheer power and richly textured intensity. Keeping my eyes wide open though and giving my own interpretation of this film(which I hope is uninfluenced by the reviews I read....this may be a spoiler...so its only for those who have already seen the film)....I reckon the wife ""set-up"" the husband to teach him a lesson for his philandering...and so with the help of the Hungarian dancer at the start of the film used the costume party etc to keep ""hubbie""faithful....hence the mask on the pillow near the end of the film.....

It's a shame that Stanley Kubrick passed away last year. We could have seen more of his work. Anyway, highly recommended for people who are fans of Tom Cruise or Mr. Kubrick. 10 out of 10"

Even through all the troubled times, You must make up & realize that we all sin & we're not perfect. We should confess those ideas to your loved ones, so dont leave your eyes shut. See this as it the great Kubrick's last film, its worth it. It may be a little long but its worth it. Kubrick did a good job with it, this may not be his best film but its very good.

","An intriguing tale of a beautiful everycouple who have it all: perfect looks, perfect daughter, perfect Park Avenue apartment. A perfect life, that is, until the night the everyman discovers that his everywoman...isn't. The wife's shocking revelation of adulterous temptations prompt the husband to embark on a ill-fated nocturnal attempt to shed his everyman status. What follows is a nightmarish odyssey that is both disturbing and mesmerizing. Exhibiting his trademark simultaneous melding of drama, satire, horror and irony, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a fitting memorial to Stanley Kubrick's extraordinary career. The casting of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman may seem like a gimmick or marketing ploy, but they easily acquit themselves, particularly Kidman who impresses in her handful of scenes. Cruise may seem colorless in his role but that is the intent--he's a straight-shooting do-gooder whose self-control is painfully incongruous next to the depravity around him. His attempted membership in seediness is revoked at every turn, hampered by his impenetrable virtue. The much-discussed ""orgy"" sequence is actually pretty tame (compared to like material in much harsher R-rated fare) due to the ridiculous post-production insertion of computer-generated characters discreetly masking certain areas within the frame. Unfortunately, what should have been a truly potent sequence is now distilled into a mere suggestion of the darker side of fortune. (Why Kubrick was not more averse to its alteration is a mystery in itself.) ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is, alas, not the masterpiece one had hoped for. But who said it has to be? Good Kubrick beats great anyone-else any day!"

Leaving the entire picture unrealized and unresolved is a travesty, especially when the events leading up to the ending are all at once intriguing, interesting, erotic, mysterious, so many things.

Images of a ritualistic swingers club and a build-up to a murder-mystery plot are paced a bit slowly, but on par with plot development in other Kubrick movies. Dr. Bill Harford's (Tom Cruise) wild jealousy over his wife's confession of her fantasy about another man provides the fuel for the events that unfold in a quirky and disturbing way.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman, who plays Bill's wife Alice, manages to suck the life out of many scenes with over-the-top acting, but still scrapes up an excellent performance in the ""confession"" scene. Also, the pattern of dialogue--the actors repeated the lines of the other actors frequently--became extremely obtrusive. But the gravestone of this movie was the ending.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is worth a look for solid film-making and editing. Don't expect to find closure; have a back-up movie handy.

"r23754","Null","0","0","20 May 2000"," What was Stanley Kubrick trying to do?
","Review of Eyes Wide Shut by Clarise Samuels<br/><br/>When a great director dies just before he releases his last film, it makes it hard for the critics to tear it to pieces. But in the minds of many viewers, Eyes Wide Shut was so boring and so difficult to grasp, even the untimely death of the legendary Kubrick was not enough to redeem it. What was Stanley Kubrick trying to do with this film? Having just seen the video, I'm going to venture my opinion.<br/><br/>The film was loosely based (or ""inspired"") by Arthur Schnitzler's Traumnovelle (Dream Novella). Schnitzler, an Austrian playwright (1862-1931), was influenced by Naturalism, Impressionism, and Expressionism. The Naturalists incorporated realistic literary themes that were previously not acceptable, such as alcoholism or suicide. From the Impressionists, Schnitzler became enchanted with the portrayal of passing moods and transient moments. The Expressionists desired to explore an inner reality, such as the shadowy underside of the human soul and most particularly the devastating effects of the human sex drive. Freud was teaching and publishing in Vienna during this period, and Schnitzler was attracted to the exploration of dreams and the unconscious.<br/><br/>Kubrick understood this Germanic quest to explore the dark side of human nature, and he was apparently enchanted with the artsy theatrical techniques used to create moods and impressions rather than action and conflict. I believe this is what he was after in Eyes Wide Shut. The theme is entirely based on dark, hidden sexuality--an upper-class couple (unsuccessfully transferred from late 19th-century Vienna to modern New York City), who are presumably happy, are plunged into a crisis when the wife (Kidman) candidly describes her secret lust for a stranger, who had temporarily swept her off her feet because of a casual encounter. This terrible confession unleashes a devastating reaction in the very bourgeois husband (Cruise), who prides himself on being a good husband, father, and doctor. Haunted by dreamlike images of his wife making love to another man, he takes to the streets at night, walking through dangerous and uncharted territory that corresponds to the sexuality that has been triggered by his unconscious.<br/><br/>First Cruise has to visit the apartment of a friend who has just died; there, in the same room as the deathbed, the daughter of the deceased suddenly falls upon him, professing a secret lust for him that she has hidden for years. (This is a very Schnitzler-like moment, but out of context, Kubrick couldn't pull it off.)  The good doctor, quite shaken, then resumes seeking refuge in the street late at night, where he finds himself roughed up by hoodlums, negotiating the cost of sex with a prostitute in a sleazy apartment house, and last but not least, ending up at a weird ritualistic orgy, where good citizens could play out their most obscene sexual fantasies, while hiding behind elaborate masks.<br/><br/>Kubrick didn't seem to know where to take this Freudian odyssey, and the innocent doctor stumbles around, flirting with danger and having long conversations with a lot of people, but somehow emerges unscathed, as if at the end, he finally awakens from a dream. I could see why people who are not scholars of Arthur Schnitzler were left sitting in the theatre saying ""Huh?"" if indeed they were still awake. But when understood in the context of German literature as a psychological exploration of moods and moments, the film becomes a noble failure, rather than a mind-boggling failure."
"conspracy-2","7","0","0","20 May 2000"," Kubrick has done it again - almost
","'Eyes Wide Shut' is a dense film. I'm not quite sure what means exactly. It's just the feeling you have after you've seen it. The atmosphere in this film is so thick, you could cut it with a knife. Even in the great halls of the ceremonial palaces, the thick atmosphere manages to fill every nook and cranny. It's incredibly engrossing.<br/><br/>As an example, consider the scene, where Alice (Nicole Kidman) and William (Tom Cruise) are kissing in front of a mirror in the beginning of the film. Alice is looking at herself in a horny, bad girl way. The light is orange. 'Baby did a bad bad thing' is blaring in the background. It's incredible. If you've seen it, you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick was one of the great directors. We all know this. His choice of musical score, lighting, camera angles were as effective as they were bold. Where this film fails to reach the heights of 'Dr. Strangelove','Full Metal Jacket','Clockwork Orange' and the other great Kubrick films, is in the plot. The direction is flawless. The acting, especially by Nicole Kidman, is astounding. Whenever she is in a scene, she lights up (or should I say darkens?) the film. The joint scene in particular - I never knew Kidman could actually act! (That said, Tom Cruise seems to be free-wheeling through this film).<br/><br/>But the plot. It's mysterious and exciting, but in the end it's disappointing. Again, if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about. It sort of falls flat. You're left with a feeling that nothing really happened, that no character really grew, and that the film was just a blip in the character's lives.<br/><br/>Ironic, really. I think Tom Cruise got a bigger story to tell from working with Stanley Kubrick on his last film, than his character in the film would have to tell about his experiences."

","I don't understand why the critics based Eyes Wide Shut. It was a good last movie by Kubric. Of course he has done better movies but like all his movies, and this one, you must watch every scene and sometimes not understand what he is trying to say. I can just see years from now, this movie will be disected in film classes. Yes, the main topic is sex and everything about it but Kubrick was trying to prove a point. This is the type of movie you must watch again to understand, which you may never fully do.<br/><br/>PLOT: Tom Cruise goes on a sexual journey when he finds out his wife- Nicole Kidman was thinking about cheating on him. He wants to hurt her as she hurt him.<br/><br/>VIEWS: Again, I don't know why the critics bashed Tom Cruise's acting. I think he did a great job as the tormented husband. yes, some of his adventures are surreal but it makes the movie more watchable and a topic of conversation. Maybe because Tom is not usually in this type of role, the critics didn't like it. But they were so praising about his role in Magnolia. I think he did a better job here.

","I have liked most of Kubrick's movies, so I had high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with most of the film.  I could have forgiven the plodding pace had the plot been more solid.  I could have enjoyed the visual appeal of the film had the dialogue not been so choppy and forced.  I would have applauded his use of sexuality in the film had the movie been remotely sexy (never have so many people bared so much with so little effect).  Most of all, though, I didn't care about any of the characters.  It wasn't just that I didn't really like them, it's that I didn't really care one way or the other for them.<br/><br/>Was this film filled with subliminal imagery?  Definitely.  If you're one of those people who like to ponder the meaning of cleverly placed props and what they may mean, you will probably like this movie.  There is a side of me that likes that kind of detail, but I wasn't pulled in enough to care. There are also a lot of weird/quirky characters, which I generally like in a film like this.  But they never seem to move the story forward and they were ultimately wasted.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but I thought his performance was one of the few high points.  Considering his character was generally restricted to awkward pauses and brooding silence, I thought he was fine.  When Kidman delivered her fantasy monologue I felt like I was watching an audition for a high school production.  Ugh!"

","Honestly, as much as I've enjoyed Kubrick's stuff through the years, I put off watching this one, just because I thought I was going to hate it.<br/><br/>I didn't.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a superb film. It isn't in the ""Strangelove/2001/Clockwork Orange"" stratosphere; I think the best comparison to another Kubrick film would be ""Barry Lyndon."" Both ""Eyes"" and ""Lyndon"" are period pieces, both are beautiful to look at, both move very slowly (and thus turn many people off), and both are only indirectly ""about"" anything. In ""Lyndon,"" we saw the life of a rags-to-riches-to-rags Irishmen. Here, we see a few days in the life of a wealthy American couple. What is the hardest thing to do in life today, if you're a wealthy person in our post-modern world? Stay interested? Separate reality from fantasy? That seems to be what Kubrick was saying, at least that's what I heard in the film. Of course, the sexual dynamic of man and woman is the most obvious theme, but I'll be different and state that I don't think that's really what the film is about. Kidman and Cruise's characters are so bored with life (and increasingly with each other) that they begin using sex as a weapon to tear into one another. Through a string of rather improbable events, they both ""survive"" intact, and at the end they both realize they've been lucky. Both of them step back from the fantasy-land they were driving each other to, and turn to each other in the end. Actually, for Kubrick, a remarkably conservative statement, I think.<br/><br/>Oh yes, maybe its just my somewhat indulgent sense of irony, but I for one think its wonderful that the last word ever spoken in a Stanley Kubrick film was ""fu_k."" <br/><br/>Here's to ya Stanley."

","Kubrick's last film is a good (not great) ending to a stellar career. What is interesting is that Kubrick's strongest moments in this film are precisely the sort of moments that he has been criticized for coming up short on in the past: the human moments, the character-driven moments. The private scenes between Kidman and Cruise are the highlights of this film--Kubrick's relentlessly voyeuristic camera records the tense and cruel moments between the couple with true sympathetic detachment. A montage of the mundane moments that make up the couple's time apart is sensitive and colored with Kubrick's usual eye for irony. (Those who worried that Kidman and Cruise were not worthy need not worry--they both come through better than I, for one, would have expected. They both do very well, making Bill and Alice two of the truest human beings in the Kubrick canon).<br/><br/>What is not as strong in this film, though, are those moments that Kubrick fans have been trained to expect: the haunting images that burn themselves into our brains, the intense and relentless tracking shots, the impeccable use of music. The much-anticipated orgy sequence is marred by digitally imposed images of onlookers--fig leafs that ensured Kubrick an R instead of an NC-17. And they are much like the fig leafs added to great paintings in the sense that they add a note of distraction and silliness to potentially striking moments. The entire masquerade/orgy sequence moves between brilliant and farcical, but in the end seems unnecessary. Kubrick would have done well to record marital jealousy and infidelity without the melodrama.<br/><br/>The philosophy behind the film will take some time to decipher. The dominant idea that sticks with me after two viewings is the repeated linking of sex and death--again and again the sexual act of creation is linked with death.<br/><br/>A good film, then, but a bit too long. In the end, it feels like a transitional work between the brilliantly visceral intensity of Kubrick's best work of the past and a new cinema more rooted in everyday life. It is doubly sad, then, that Kubrick died before he could more fully explore this new stage in his artistic career.<br/><br/>Thank you, Stanley. For everything."

"cinemel","7","0","0","17 July 1999"," A fitting finale to a classic career
","The final film of director, Stanley Kubrick, has finally been released to theaters. It is a fine finale to a career of classic filmmaking. Although Kubrick has been accused of creating films that were cold and hard with characters to match, ""Eyes Wide Shut"", adapted from a novel by Arthur Schnitzler, introduces us to his two major characters as they are preparing for a gala Christmas party given by their friend. Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) and Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) live a privileged existence in the posh circles of  Manhattan. Their lush apartment is filled with all the accouterments of such a life. As they dress for the party, their demeanor and oral responses to one another subtly reveal the relationship they have in their nine-year-old marriage. At the party itself we meet their host (Sidney Pollack). Here the couple each get involved in a flirtation, she with a Hungarian Lothario, and he with two lovely young models. This is just the beginning of their descent into the world of sexual obsession and fantasy.<br/><br/>Kubrick uses his camera as the voyeuristic eye of the audience, never really being clear as to whether certain scenes are real or fantasy. Bunuel did this in his classic French film, ""Belle DuJour"".  Except for a series of expository scenes relating the everyday routines of the husband at work and his wife at home, the rest of the film is sort of a fever dream drifting along deeper and deeper into the vortex of sex and violence that is a combination of their own obsessions and outside events beyond their control.<br/><br/>The rumors that have followed the three-year gestation of this movie are generally untrue. Although the film is about sex, curiously, it is not particularly erotic. The famous orgy, which occurs about two-thirds through the film (2 hours 40 minutes long), is slightly muted by the digital insertion of figures that obscure certain body parts and motions deemed unacceptable to the ratings board. Professional critics were shown both versions, but generally agreed that the effect was the same in both versions. Critic Roger Ebert suggested that both versions be exhibited in different theaters. The un-cut version will be shown in Europe. Hopefully, the American audience will see the original cut in its video incarnation next year.<br/><br/>Kubrick once said when asked what the ending of the classic, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", meant, that he wanted the audience to bring something of themselves to his films. Therefore, he would not reveal any concrete answer. He said that the reason for the Mona Lisa's smile is part of her mystery. She would lose some of her appeal if DaVinci said that she was smiling because she is thinking of her lover. One error he makes in this film is toward the end he has the Sidney Pollack character give some sort of objective explanation of what has occurred. One could assume he was trying to give in to those who complained about the ambiguity of some of his other films. Hitchcock made a similar mistake in the psychiatrist's explanation of Norman Bates' condition at the end of ""Psycho"". Even this compromise does not materially flaw an otherwise distinct vision.<br/><br/>Cruise and Kidman both give performances of which they can be proud. Kubrick's perfectionism is there on the screen. Kidman, in particular has a moving monologue in which she emotionally reveals to her husband, a fantasy she had years ago, which precipitates the rest of action in the film. Unfortunately, her character disappears for much of the remaining film, relegating her role to one basically supporting in nature.<br/><br/>The film was completely filmed in England on sets, except for a couple of establishing shots of New York and several long shots of taxis on the streets of Manhattan. New Yorkers will recognize these street scenes as unreal. However, possibly, Kubrick wanted these sets to have a certain surreal ambiance. The musical score also adds effectively to sweep the audience along in what is a series of long scenes of extended dialogue. One hopes that adult audiences will appreciate Kubrick's vision, and it will encourage viewers to discuss their views and reactions to the last of a series of a unique creative works."

","It's a shame that this movie didn't get a single Oscar nomination. It may not be the year's best picture, but it certainly ranks in the top ten, as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>There has been much negativity associated with this film since its release -- many people felt that it wasn't a fitting swan song for Stanley Kubrick, one of the greatest filmmakers that ever lived; many also felt that there was too much hype and the film simply didn't live up to it; others were of the opinion that it was too slow and long. That reminds me of the people I saw who walked out of a David Lynch movie because it was ""too weird."" It's David Freaking Lynch, what were you expecting? The guy doesn't make mainstream movies!<br/><br/>The same can be said for the late great Kubrick. He had a style all his own, and this film has his fingerprints all over it:  grainy, high contrast picture, bright primary colors, a chilling musical score, and an undercurrent of tension.<br/><br/>The film has the style of a thriller, but it's more of a psychological drama. Cruise and Kidman are a husband and wife who live an upper-class Manhattan lifestyle (he's a prominent doctor). During a night of pot smoking, Kidman confesses that she was nearly unfaithful with a Naval officer she met the previous summer. This sends Cruise into a tailspin of jealousy and confusion, as he spends the next couple of nights exploring New York's seamy sexual underbelly. Among his exploits is an evening spent at an extremely creepy orgy which takes place in a mansion outside the city. This is the kind of film where you never know what's going to happen next, and that's where the film's true enjoyment lies. It's also great to see all of the traditional Kubrick elements in place.<br/><br/>This is no ""Clockwork Orange,"" no ""2001,"" but it's still an enormously entertaining film. For those people who are put off by the film's generally negative reviews, remember this: almost all of Kubrick's films were initially panned. They seem to grow an appreciation over the years. I'm sure that in time, people will recognize EWS for what it is: a masterpiece and a fitting final work in Kubrick's career."
"W.P.","Null","0","0","16 July 1999"," Kubrick has done it again
","""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the best film of '99 so far, and I think it is safe to say that nothing else this year will even come close to equaling its genius. It is not a perfect film by any means, but it is a work of art.  It the kind of film that reminds me what cinema was made for.  The story and dialogue are so simple, but so cleverly carried out with such care and attention to detail that the very mechanics of a scene with Tom Cruise walking down the streets of New York becomes high art. Of course, what other director could carry this film off with so much care and attention to detail?  That has always been Stanley Kubrick's trademark style, and this, his last film, is no different. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" has the same balance of cold clinical evil set against shallow human beings who are doing their best to stay sane in a slightly askew world as several of Kubrick's other films, most notably ""2001: a space odyssey"" and ""A Clockwork Orange.""  Of course, this film also has shades of the one man's struggle (and eventual release to) sexual perversion of ""Lolita"" and the satire of human procedure of ""Dr. Strangelove."" What does this film have that makes it better than other psychological thrillers of the same vein?  Well, first of all, Kubrick, the master, is behind the camera, which accounts for the way the movie comes off as a well-oiled machine, performing the same actions just as perfectly no matter how many times you run the program. There are other factors at work here, though.  The acting is all top rate, especially the two lead roles.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play a husband and wife facing several physical and mental tests to their fidelity. Kidman shines in the first half of the film as Alice Harford, ex-art dealer and stay-home mother for her child.  Cruise's doctor character, Bill, seems not to be the focus in these first few moments, as Kidman takes over the screen with her beautifully timed, intricately spoken and self-assuredly delivered monologues. Soon, however, Kidman disappears as Cruise's character is overcome with jealousy, and sets out on an aimless search of the streets of New York for some sort of way to combat his feelings.  Previous to this point, the film had been steadily and laboriously moving forward with great care.  Once Cruise begins his adventures into the night, however, suspense and even a sort-of adventure enter the picture, and things start picking up. The middle section of the film played out like ""The Catcher in the Rye"" for me, with Cruise as the Caulfield character, aimlessly roaming the streets of New York, meeting several contacts, doing anything to keep from having to go home. While I won't reveal the events of Cruise's night out, I will state that it is a series of wide-ranging episodes all dealing with different facets of human sexuality.  The episodes range from slightly humorous to downright frightening, and at the end of the night and the beginning of a new day, the real terror begins as Cruise must face the consequences of what he has done, seen and heard. Is the movie perfect?  As stated above, no.  There are some pacing problems, which only really reveal themselves when Kubrick briefly finds a groove to work in, and then loses it again.  This exact same script, in the hands of any other director, may have seemed ridiculous and contrived. But, Kidman and Cruise rescue their main characters from mundanity, and Kubrick rescues the rest of the movie from the same.  From the first frame to the last, I was enthralled and completely engrossed in the film.  The material itself was mediocre, but the ways in which it was carried out was pure genius. A lot has been made of ""Eyes Wide Shut"", with few people even having seen it yet.  All I can say is that Cruise and Kidman have found themselves in the movie of their careers, and the movie is better for it.  I can also say that this film is more than worthy of being known as ""Kubrick's final masterpiece."" Not pretentious, not without meaning, cold and cynical while still showing evidence of a human heart beneath it all:  Kubrick has done it again."

","The much hyped ""Eyes Wide Shut"" didn't really meet my expectations as a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's works. While I am more enamored of his less artistic works to begin with, such as ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"", this movie didn't even meet the levels of ""2001"".<br/><br/>One of the best parts of most of Kubrick's work is that he keeps you enraptured throughout his films, never taking your eyes off the screen. Not so here. The first 45 minutes seem to stretch on endlessly. Nicole Kidman, especially, is simply playing a bad character. She isn't so much the wife on the protagonist, Tom Cruise's Dr. Bill Hartford, as much as she's another aspect of the libido we explore throughout the film. This is symbolized ad nauseam, mainly in the fact that Kidman takes about 30 seconds between every word she speaks, so as to give the impression of a far off angel, I suppose.<br/><br/>There are some good spots, when Cruise's character hits the street. Vinessa Shaw, a lady of the street, and Todd Field, an old friend who shows him another world of sorts, are very good. There are some moments that make you sit up and say ""Wow"", the kind of thing only Stanley Kubrick can do. The problem here is that Kubrick tries to inject too many of those moments into his film, instead of letting them come naturally, and it doesn't have the same effect. <br/><br/>All in all, this isn't a bad movie, but not as good as you might expect given some of the names working on out. There is layer upon layer of symbolism and insight, and sometimes it crashes upon itself, and you're left wondering what exactly Kubrick was aiming for with certain scenes. The movie is worth seeing, but don't go in with your expectations too high, especially if you're familiar with some of Kubrick's earlier works."

It is only natural that the two would come together in one of his own obsessions, bringing Arthur Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle"" to the screen. Since 1975 there have been rummors suggesting that he was working on this project. It is fitting that this is his last film, an end to one of his continuing obsessions.<br/><br/>The film appears to be a dream, a dream that most people in a serious relatonship have had.

Whether or not they choose to acknowledge those truths/falsehoods and then how they struggle with their decisions is the core of what this movie is about.

If people would formulate and listen to reviews with this foremost in their minds a great deal of frustration would be allieviated from critical discussions.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I cannot tell you why you should love this movie or hate it but I can give you a couple of guidelines I know Kubrick would agree with for enjoying his movies to a greater degree.<br/><br/>1)Since most Kubrick films are very personal you should see them by yourself or at most in theatre crowd in which you are a stranger.<br/><br/>2)Kubrick strived his entire career for secrecy because he understood that the most impressionable mind is the one that has no prejudgements.

This is not a sex film, it is a film about sex and fidelity and how these actions and ideas intertwine and create emotions, often highly irrational emotions, within people. One of the most incredible aspects of the film is the way the plot really does draw you in, whether you know it or not. By the time I got to the ""New York Underground Orgy"" scene which was so controversial, I was so engrossed in the plot that the sex did not get a reaction out of me, and that is a big achievement. Overall, Eyes Wide Shut is one of Kubrick's best films, with incredible acting, amazing directing, and a storyline and dialogue that should, and probably will, be taught in film schools."

","When I sat down in the movie theatre to watch this film I had a momentary vision. I roughly knew what the plot of this film  was going to be. I knew the ending too. And I could guess the last line as well before Nicole's character says it. And now I feel like this film didn't do anything that hadn't been seen earlier. The only thing that kept me really in suspense was to see if Stanley in his old days was going to break down in front of the commercial power of the starring duo and simply be happy to make a film without ambition. <br/><br/>I hope that is the case since this film didn't live up to my expectations. I just didn't like the story. On the other hand one can defend the film by saying that everyone sees it differently and that many of Kubricks films draw their greatest strength from individual scenes and sometimes from individual images and that only time will tell if this is a good film.<br/><br/>Kubrick has shown a lot of versatility in his career but somehow I have the feeling that acting has always been the weakest link of his films and although not a total failure Cruise and Kidman only manage to annoy me. I suppose the theme is sexuality and the Cruise character is in a way caught in the middle of this spectrum of sexuality and everything that goes with it. Sounds interesting but basically falls short of a good script. I didn't enjoy the music that much either. But even so the film is definately not bad, it is probably one of this years best films on the big screen."
"bhicks56","7","0","0","6 December 1999"," That's how the censors eyes were, I gather
","I happened to enjoy this film, probably because I saw it before many critics put it down. I'm a Stanley Kubrick fan, but I know when he doesn't hit his mark. He hits it here, but not dead on like, say, FULL METAL JACKET or A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.<br/><br/>At first you wonder where this film is going. It doesn't get moving until Tom Cruise takes a walk out of the house. I felt like I was right with Cruise in the New York City set in London (what was all that about?) and though critics snuffed his performance, I thought it was more than ""decent"", though Nicole Kidman had more to work with, since she had more emotions.<br/><br/>
The thing I didn't like were the crowds around the ""exhibitions"" going on in an underground society Cruise falls into. They were digitally added because Warner Bros. didn't have the guts to go with an NC-17 the MPAA had the nerve of giving this film with the uncensored ""watchers"". This completely ruins Kubrick's art. It also makes the so-called ""inappropriate"" imagery more distasteful and disturbing than it actually is.<br/><br/>There are parts in this movie that come out of leftfield (though most of them, I think, describe certain sexual opportunities and erotic fantasies) and that just adds onto the length of this long film. It does make the movie more interesting and unpredictable, but at the same time they seem unnecessary. <br/><br/>This film has been helmed as a disappointment. Maybe it is, in Kubrick standards. Maybe this isn't the cut he intended before his untimely death. But I can actually watch and enjoy this one again and again compared to, say, THE SHINING."

","I think the film mainly focuses on sexual relations in the civilized world. The players are so perfectly suited in their roles. Please look at Tom Cruise's development; from the teenager idol in ""Top Gun"" and ""Cocktail"" to a real good actor in ""Rainman"" and ""Interview with the Vampire"" and finally this movie. He is one of the industry's leading actors now. And Nicole Kidman. She has contributed much to the movie. As a result, the couple were wonderful.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick has taken a sharp look in husband-wife relations. I couldn't help myself evaluating my own ideas on this subject. Since all art masterpieces have the same effect on us to awaken our ideas and discussions, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" should easily be regarded as one of the best.<br/><br/>On the other side, the atmosphere was great. You can't even guess what was coming in the next scene or keep yourself out of the thrilling mood of dark NY streets. The scenes that were taking place in the ""orgy palace"" were so well-designed that I nearly believed that I was watching a different movie than the one up to those scenes.<br/><br/>I think Kubrick has made a very straightforward movie on human feelings about sex. It is rather complex and still so clear. Many ideas and different movie techniques come perfectly together in a single film so smoothly. This is the talent of the director and how sad that we can't expect new additions to his career. Such skill comes so rare and we should keep on experimenting the art pieces that have remained of them."

With each line of dialogue, Kubrick gradually turns the screws tighter and tighter until the tension becomes almost unbearable.  Only then, does he let the tension go, but not all of it.

"misternuts","10","0","0","3 November 1999"," America proved it could never learn a lesson from Stanley Kubrick.
","How many times must we trash a Stanley Kubrick movie when it comes out, only to sing its praises years after the thrill is gone? Does anyone out there remember how ""2001"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" were received in the 1960s? The man put a little piece of immortality into each of his movies. I have no doubt that this one will be remembered and studied for many years to come. Even though there won't be a better movie this year, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is already being shut out of the best picture race by popular opinion. One day, we'll all look back at 1999 and see what we had. From the very first scene, the imagery is totally gripping. The story lags behind, but hits us as a surprise when Nicole Kidman delivers her sure-to-be classic monologue. Tom Cruise's blank and disturbed stare sets in, and the audience can FEEL it. It never leaves throughout the rest of the movie. From that point on, we are over-run with his deeply-rooted obcession. We can see how thin the Harford's marriage is, and Bill's sexual revenge mission is quite disturbing. He fumbles around with his sense of security and his recklessness is overpowering. I thought Tom Cruise's performance was very under-rated for these reasons. His cold mental images of his wife having sex with another man chill to the bone, and THEN we have the orgy. There's no way to discuss this movie without talking about the orgy, so if you haven't seen it yet, you might not want to continue reading. I've heard many characterizations of this sequence, and I think pro or con, all are inaccurate. Stanley Kubrick has a great habit of confusing his audiences with the juxtapositioning of real plot and allegorical plot. What we see at the orgy is a representation of what Bill sees in his mind. Just because his wife has confessed that she has the potential to be unfaithful, his mind has been swarmed with confusing mixtures of sexual jealousy, frustration, fantasy, and more. The sex is not hot and steamy, with great purpose. The realm of infidelity is ugly. The people mindlessly bang away, faceless (also with good reason), and emotionless. The act of sex is reduced to the most watered-down physical activity possible. This is the dillution of Bill's mind. The resulting circumstances for his intrusion into this world stem from a mental state that transcends words. It's exciting, and quite pleasantly takes on a mystery format. Those that criticize Kubrick for the orgy scene seem to forget his other works. Were we really expected to believe that Dave Bowman physically walked through a hotel room in the nether regions of the universe? Were we really expected to accept the Star Child as something tangible we could see through a telescope? Absolutely not. Kubrick uses devices like this to point to greater themes and ideas. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a masterpiece, and his technique is absolutely riveting. The music is as effective as anything he's ever put to an image, and this is truly one of his greatest. The only movie he's made that tops it is the legendary ""2001."" Only the test of time can reverse the roles, and it's my bet that this film will go down as the last masterwork of the 1900s."

In the movie we recognize that the world of normality and the world of extreme pulsions are detached but not so far to let us forever outside.

","I have sat through this film twice in it's opening day and words themselves can't describe how brilliant Stanley Kubrick really is.  This is his 13th film, being known as the longest shoot in film history, and might just be as remembered by his fans right up there with A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br/><br/>From those who have seen the previews or trailers and feel very interested in seeing the film, don't read the reviews that give away anything.  The less you know about the film the better it is and that is why nothing has been given away about the film until now as the critics release their reviews all over the nation.  For the full experience of Eyes Wide Shut, go in there with your interested mind only, and see where Kubrick brings you in this ""thriller about jealousy and sexual obsession.""  Those should be the only words that should sum up the plot for you, anything else would reveal too much.<br/><br/>This is a film the Academy won't overlook.  Being the last film of Stanley's it's always to be remembered and I can see nominations already for Best Picture, Best Director (Kubrick), Best Actor (Cruise), Best Actress (Kidman), Best Supporting Actor (Pollack), Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing all being announced as the next awards show comes early next year.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we won't see the film Kubrick has intended us to see until it comes out on video.  It would have received an NC-17 which Warner Bros. was to afraid to accept so we must sit through a digitally-altered 65 second scene.  I don't think this film was intended for younger audiences in the first place, and defiantly not intended for film-goers who only want to see the sex between the two main leads.  This is an intelligent thriller, not an erotic pornography, so be prepared to see how far the film can take you. 10/10"

One felt it might generate particularly interesting discussion between a heterosexual couple.<br/><br/>Well, I should say that the film sufficed to meet at least one of my expectations, the generation of a good post-filmic dialogue. But I had some reservations, conditioned by what I perceived to be a key limitation in the treatment of the film's central premise:<br/><br/>The film explores, partly diagnoses, the neuroses of a married couple (Kidman and Cruise) towards the prospect of betrayal and deceit, either in the reality of their social circles or the reality of their imaginations.<br/><br/>The premise is hardly original; yet whilst the treatment could have been more so, it sufferred from the presupposition of some decidedly unimaginative moral norms. No doubt the kind of moral norms internalised by the majority of the secularised west, even the U. S., are decidedly unimaginative; yet to see these represented on film is a passport to induced apathy.<br/><br/>With unimaginative ideals about what could constitute a sexual morality, and what could constitute emotional honesty, came a limited treatment of what could constitute moral and emotional transgression."

Many couples have private feelings but cannot express them to each other but live out their fantasies in many different ways.  Kubrick showed us how one couple were able to do it and survive.

","Stanley Kubrick's last film is one of the most tense films I have ever viewed.  While watching it, I felt things were moving slow at times. Thinking back... I realize the tempo of this film was necessary. His directing style is similar to a composition played by a great musician. Just as the notes not played by a musician are as important as the notes played, Kubrick's sense of space and moments of silence are equally important. These quiet ""disturbing"" moments build tension, which would otherwise be lost, if continuous banter took place in its stead.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is very well done and appropriate, but the real star here is Kubrick. Everything in this film gels just right. The lighting, framing, and melding of scenes are just perfect. The music also suits this film perfectly. Never has one sustained note meant so much to a film.

Unplugged. <br/><br/>Cruise is great as the disillusioned husband and father, Dr. Bill Hartford (even the name is great), who one innocent, pot-smoking evening learns of his wife`s fantasies of another man. His safe, little world of living the 'good life' in the upper class (Central Park West apartment and all) is completely zapped and undermined. He wanders helplessly through and about the streets of New York, from one yellow taxi cab to another, from one confrontation to another, and gets himself entangled into an underworld of sex and murder. Or does he? <br/><br/>Opposite Cruise and at the core of the story is Kidman in a fascinating performance. She will make you cringe with wonder in your seat, uneasy at the power and realism she purveys. The two (married in real life)  especially in the shots they share  deliver some of the best screen time this side of Casablanca. We`ve seen Tom Cruise like this before, but he`s never had this edge or this fire in both speech and eyes. Kubrick really took him that step further and the natural chemistry between the real time couple can actually at times seem offensive, as you may feel like you are invading actual home life and privacy. <br/><br/>Sydney Pollack can be seen in a (typical Kubrick) perfectly cast supporting role, and the dark, neon-lit streets, alleys and buildings of New York (filmed mostly on location) makes for a great backdrop to the story.<br/><br/>
Images will float and visions will blunder, this plot of men and women, sex and love, life and meaning, reality and fantasy, is the kind of cinema we never knew we missed before we got it. <br/><br/>This is the good stuff. Movie making at it´s finest. Relevant and hypnotic, Eyes Wide Shut will be churning in your mind long after you leave the cinema. Food for thought. Delicately, yet honestly served.

Suffice to say, it's not a ""porno flick"", but nevertheless a feast for the eyes and also something that makes you think. A good example, is when Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are smoking pot and talking about their night at a friend's party. Nicole Kidman asks one of those questions that every man fears, since instinctively, you know that whatever you say is going to be the wrong answer. :)<br/><br/>There is nudity and some great bodies to look at if that is what you are looking for. But in addition, it also makes you think, can you really make sex impersonal? Can you have sex with a perfect stranger and not even know what they feel, what they look like? <br/><br/>The music score is excellent and adds to a very atmospheric film. A good example of this, is when the Tom Cruise character goes to the masked party and eventually gets demasked. Some people will come out of it and say it's a film that disappoints as Kubrik builds up a film to be a thriller then lets the air out of the balloon. Any other director would have made a Hollywood film out of it. I could just imagine the predictable ending that would have ruined the film. <br/><br/>Upon reflection, I found the film thought provoking and an enjoyable 3 hours... <br/><br/>(The film shown in Hong Kong was the unedited version, but I am not sure what things were cut out in the other releases)."

","Eyes Wide Shut is Stanley Kubrick's most mainstream and easily accessible movie. The Shining contained cold acting and cold sets, 2001 the same. These were great movies apart from the acting. They were the director's movies. What Kubrick delivers with Eyes Wide Shut is fabulous performances to accompany his always interesting direction.<br/><br/>Cruise is a revalation as Dr. Bill. His happy and seemingly perfect life is damaged by Kidman's revalation that she has dreamt of having sex with a naval officer she only caught a glimpse of. He declares that he is not jealous but he spends the rest of the night roaming the streets for sex and delves deep into a scary part of New York's nightlife. Cruise excels as the professional who does not know what's going on. He doesn't understand his wife, his friend the piano player or even himself. He has to keep telling others that he is a doctor, he is really reassuring himself.<br/><br/>Kidman's part is smaller and less revolatory. She plays drunk, drugged and the happy mother's role. Her descriptions of her sexual fantasies are lengthy and required credible acting to remain of interest. She pulls it off. Pollack, in a smaller role is effective as a kind of ""Deep Throat"". He fills in holes that have left Cruise confused but can we trust him? Pollack's nice guy approach to his role which contrasts his actions leave the question unanswered. <br/><br/>Of course, this is Kubrick's film and it finishes off a remarkable batch of movies. For years Walt Disney has been issuing titles with the title ""Walt Disney Classics"". Perhaps its time for ""Stanley Kubrick Classics"" to be released. If so Eyes Wide Shut would be more than worthy of such a declaration."

","Just because there is a lot of sex in the film does not mean that the film is ""about"" sex (or pornography, or whatever). IMNSHO EWS is ""about"" communication (or lack of it) in relationships, about the 7 year itch, about the impossible balance between saying too much and saying too little to your partner. Sex and sexual fantasies happen to be some of the most problematic areas to talk about (for some people, anyway). I remember reading an article about ""honesty in relationships"" where a panel of psychologists were given hypothetical ""should I tell my partner that .."" questions. The only all-negative recommendation was to the situation ""when we make love, I fantasize about (person)"" or similar. This, to me, is what EWS is about. It shows a couple going from slight discomfort, the ""something is wrong but I can't really put my finger on it"" feeling brilliantly portrayed at the party and just afterwards, through escalating crisis (though unrealistic and with occasional dreamlike qualities) and eventually to some sort of redemption. Some of these aspects (the important ones, for me anyway) must surely be familiar to anyone who has ever tried to make a long term relationship work, at least.<br/><br/>The downside is that this makes EWS a very uncomfortable film to watch with your long term partner. After the film you have the choice between discussing the weather, discussing the subject matter while maintaining a cowardly personal distance to it, or to just ask for trouble."

","If you haven't seen the film yet don't read on. On the whole I think it is a film for men and Kubrick's most intense since Clock Work Orange.<br/><br/>Why the male viewer? Well all the women are neatly arranged as ""Wife"" ""Mother"" ""Hooker"" ""Junkie"" ""Cafe Waitress"" and in the orgy scene ""robot"".<br/><br/>This is how Kubrick must have seen women.<br/><br/>To a Kubrick fan, the movie is packed with his style. Every few seconds I was thinking ""Oh, that's the lighting from Barry Lindon"" or ""That's the slow dissolve from The Shining"" which incidentally was not intrusive at all into the enjoyment of the film. The couple in the movie have been married for 9 years and so the scene where Nicole Kidman has been smoking pot and goes off into a badly written rant about the Navy guy did not ring true at all. The other poor scene is the one where Cruise is in the costume shop and the owner's daughter is caught with 2 men doing something or other - this scene was as bad as I have seen in any movie and Kubrick should be ashamed of it. It stinks of ""better put a laugh in here somewhere"". And its Xenophobic - why do movies teach us absolutely nothing about Oriental people? Vietnam perhaps.<br/><br/>The movie is of course a gigantic tease. There are the 2 predatory women in the 1st party scene before Cruise leaves. What were they going to do with him? The ritual orgy goes on just long enough so that we can see what's going on but don't stop to think about it for too long... and realise that if Bill Gates, Kofi Annan and The Pope really wanted to bang supermodels they wouldn't want a mask to get in the way of the fellatio. Here we are teased again. ""Undress"" Cruise is told, thereby mocking the Doctor's phrase, and for a moment America's #1 star is potentially about to be buggered by the World's most influential man in a mask.<br/><br/>But then no.<br/><br/>Any film maker could so easily have fallen down making this scene but the orgy is wonderful. The way that the numatic young women glide one guest each down the corridor at the same pace reminded me of a theme park ride. A lot of ideas borrowed from other movies here. (Wicker Man, Logan's Run, and I would not be surprised if Kubrick had seen Dr Who & the Robots of Death - it is very similar). A special treat for me came during the Jazz Club scene. ""Hey, the layout of this NY club is very similar to Madame Jo Jo's in London"" I thought and then a split second later ""It IS Madame Jo Jo's!"". Yes Tom Cruise sat at the table where I groped a young ladies boobs only a few months ago.<br/><br/>The second half of the film becomes a sort of X-files. The message at the gate was SO similar to e-mails you get when you are on the wrong side of someone you have never met.<br/><br/>Kubrick stitched himself up a bit with the music. Because a plot point involves music we are aware of it during the orgy. And so when it is used again to denote menace it is rather obvious.<br/><br/>Kubrick obviously made the film to be a dream rather than reality. The orgy is very clearly a metaphor for the Internet. In the film, masks are used to create anonymity. ""What is the password?"" Cruise is asked 3 times. So the film is a great success and if Kubrick had known he was dying then he has made the best work he possibly could. It tells us about film, Kubrick himself, a little about current human nature, and gives me at least, a 2.5 hour thrill."

","Eyes Wide Shut is a true tribute to the best director of this century. After bringing us such brilliance as Paths of Glory, 2001: A Space Oddyssey, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket and The Shining, Kubrick goes all out to make his most intriguing film yet. The ""tale of jealousy and sexual obsession"" is the most fascinating piece of film I've seen since A Clockwork Orange. Kubrick spends the first moments of the film portraying the perfect lives of rich doctor Tom Cruise and his unemployed wife Nicole Kidman. Every single scene in the movie has some way of exploring our sexuality from the well orchestrated orgy scene to the apparently pointless scene where a group of boys call Cruise a faggot. After he finds out that his wife came close to having an affair, he goes for a walk through the street at night where he comes across some incidents which would change him forever. Cruise is terrific from his psychotic deep stares into space from the darkly lit back seat of his taxi to his usual overacting which actually gives this cold, disturbing, humourless tale a human side. Kidman is equally brilliant as her seductive eyes stare out of the screen defining herself and her husband as some of the finest actors of their generation. Every incident sparks with a Christamas tree and in some way explores sex. It may be  the scene in which the gay hotel receptionist flirts with Cruise or the disturbing moment where we find out the costume store owner pimps his daughter, but each scene is as disturbing, intriguing and amazingly lit as the last. Cruise's journey is portrayed in a trance-like nightmare, especially the notorius (uncut in Ireland) orgy scene which is magnificent in every sense. The cult is disturbing, frightening and dangerous (a masked woman tells Cruise to ""go now while he still can"") but also plays a large part in the movie as Cruise discovers just what goes on inside. The music is haunting and perfect whether it is the chilling solo pianist or the dizzying ""shining-esque"" trance. A scary and disturbing exploration into the sexual obsessions of humans. Watch out for the Kubrick cameo (he's sitting at a table in a restaurant). Truly a magnificent modern masterpiece which is a tribute to who is definetely the greatest genius of cinema ever."

The piano score was infuriating, like sitting in the next room to a child practising his scales.  There were simply too few characters to sustain any mystery element.  Surely, everyone knew who the masked woman was??? Most of the film felt under-developed and dated.  The masked ball, the highlight, was an interesting section, but its aftermath lacked focus.  Then to top it all off, Sydney Pollack (who in no way was a better choice over Keitel) explains it all to Cruise in a breathtakingly over-developed scene.<br/><br/>Kubrick's track record secures his reputation as a genius, but this swansong was a disappointing bow.

","'Eyes Wide Shut' could be the best translation of 'Traumnovelle': one should have one's eyes shut to be able to dream. Kubrick gives his own version of cinema being the art-form of dreams, thus the unconscious. True, this middle-class couple is very common and so are their sexual fantasies. This perhaps explains the disappointment of many spectators. In a way, EWS is the opposite to 'A Clockwork Orange' where the hero was forced to keep his eyes wide open in order to watch movies. And true enough, his fantasies were not very common or civilized as the Harford's. The home movie Dr. Harford sees, when his eyes are shut, is always the same: a black and white clip of his wife making it with a stranger. The worse is, of course, that the episode never happened in 'real life'. Perhaps is she only taking her revenge because she saw her husband with a couple of beautiful girls.<br/><br/>He then discovers his wife is a complete stranger, a menacing presence, threatening his quiet existence. And suddenly, his life becomes a nightmare. Girls are HIV positive, or they OD, a father sells his own daughter to strangers, a pianist friend is murdered, he finds himself in the middle of a satanic orgy and, as in a nightmare (where you are naked among dressed strangers) he has to take off his mask. It's not important to know if the film is a nightmare or not. EWS shows the very stuff dreams are made of, which is to say, the very core of films as an art-form. EWS is truly a masterpiece. A very mature reflection on the moving image and its relation to our deepest emotions. The photography is absolutely brilliant: its grainy texture conveys 'life', as it would be experienced under the influence of a psychedelic drug. The technique, as always, is inventive without showing off its total command."

","While this movie clearly does have a sub-text of the relationship between love, sex, lust and marriage, it lacks a viable plot. Everything that happens to Mr Cruise is certainly explores different aspects to seedy underground sex. The main problem with this movie is that it showed little of the motivation for Cruise's travels: the relationship between him and his wife is never properly shown; the love there is never clear. As a result, the viewer isn't interested in how far Cruise is willing to go to satsify his craving; that said, what is his craving? Revenge? Desire? Curiosity? This is only ever hinted at in a short piece of black and white, and it isn't convincing. Kubrick's essential point in this movie is no doubt that society seems to be heading along the Babylonian track. Fine.

","Stanley Kubrick's last film EYES WIDE SHUT is his most 'human' film to date. This time Kubrick has placed the 'heart' of the film before the 'look'. What a loss he is to the world of cinema. It is two and a half hours of the most fascinating, absorbing cinema since David Cronenberg's CRASH. Both films deal with the many facets of human sexuality; Kubrick's film is 'warm' and may just have a happy ending whereas Cronenberg's film is most definitely 'cold' with nothing resolved before the final credits. Nicole Kidman's performance is excellent but it is Tom Cruise that carries the film; his 'Mr. Lost' character more akin to that of Jeff Bridges' characters in AGAINST ALL ODDS, THE FISHER KING and FEARLESS. Cinema has lost one of it's finest craftsmen."

","Having ridden the 3-hour course of Stanley Kubrick's final film, I regret to say I emerged from the cinema decidedly saddle-sore. To say this slight tale of a young professional couple's extra-marital fantasies is a long, drawn-out affair is an understatement. I can't help feeling the story (what little there is of it) could have been told in half the time. The situation is not helped by the actors' slow, drug-affected speech and the constant reiteration of each other's lines. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman both put in generally competent performances, although Cruise's intonation at times resembles that of Jack Nicholson's character in ""The Shining"" as he (Jack) descends into madness. The much hyped orgy scene fails to shock. In fact, I cannot think of any aspect of the movie which will linger in the mind, unlike the images of Kubrick's previous two works, ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""The Shining"". The one redeeming feature of this film is the music: Kubrick once again employs the music of Ligeti (the echoing single piano notes are most atmospheric) and this time Shostakovich's Jazz Suite, together with a too brief snippet of Chris Isaak's Baby Did A Bad Bad Thing to add colour to the visuals. Some of the director's well-known trademarks are still to be found... The stark white on black titles, and the ubiquitous bathroom scene (here, it occurs only 3 minutes into the film), but I cannot help thinking that the subject matter would be more suited to other directors... Martin Scorsese, perhaps? It is a thousand pities that Kubrick did not shelve this movie instead of the A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) project. Now that WOULD have been a work perfectly suited to Kubrick's attributes and surely a fitting swan song. Sadly, we will never know. If nothing else, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" demonstrates once again that success depends on three factors... screenplay, screenplay and screenplay. The final word of dialogue, spoken by Kidman, could be said to sum up the entire film. Sorry, but I DID try to like it....really."

","Let's face it - Stanley Kubrick's last film was always going to generate a lot of interest regardless of how good it was.  There are a number of reasons for this: firstly and most importantly, that all of Kubrick's other films are very, very good. Stanley was, by all accounts, an exacting director who demanded a lot, but gave a lot in return.  His death has deprived the film world of a rare genius; it will be a long time before we see his like again.<br/><br/>Leaving all this emotive stuff behind, what's the film actually like?  Well, it's quite slow to begin with: the music is lovely, the set is exquisite, but all the speeches are very drawn out, especially in the party sequence at the beginning of the movie. Indeed, as my friend pointed out, the party begins to develop just like a Ferrero Rocher advert - complete with dodgy Hungarian accent and arched eyebrows. All we're missing is an old waiter with superb balancing skills and ""Monsieur - with this Rocher you're really spoiling us!""  It's hard not to think that Stan's having a big celestial laugh - why all this melodrama?  After all, it apparently wasn't unheard of for Kubrick to re-shoot a scene fifty, sixty, seventy times - so nothing is left to chance: if Stanley doesn't like it, it ain't in the movie.  So, Kubrick must have wanted it that way. The point?  Pretentiousness?  Are we supposed to laugh at these people? Hmmmm. Don't know.  That's something you're going to have to be prepared for when you watch this movie (like the rest of Kubrick's films): thought.  Your thought and consideration is definitely required.<br/><br/>Things progress fluidly enough, and before you know it, there's a pot-fuelled revelation, a sexual proposition, and well-to-do people begin screwing like bunnies over luxurious decor.  It's all cracking stuff; the tense moments are almost unbearable, the acting is solid (more Kidman, please), and the lighting is absolutely fantastic - full marks go to cinematographer Larry Smith there.  Coupled with this, the colour schemes are very interesting, as is the fact that it was not shot in Cinemascope (the really wide widescreen format), as I had expected.  Interesting - I wonder why?<br/><br/>The British running time is two hours and forty minutes, so if you're not happy about sitting in the same place for that long, maybe this isn't the film for you. I can't honestly say that I was conscious of the huge length of the film, as it interested me a great deal.  But it's not the sort of movie to go and see if you're restless or have bladder problems.  As for nudity and sexual stuff, there is a fair bit, but I don't think it's hugely titillating - just a bit weird in places.  If you love Kubrick's other films, then you'll love this.  If you're wanting to watch your first film directed by Kubrick, but you've got no idea which one to choose from, it's worth bearing in mind that he directed a film in practically every genre.  So, while you're here at the IMDB, search under `Kubrick, Stanley', and take your pick - horror, war, sci-fi, costume drama, comedy, thriller - he's done em all (almost).<br/><br/>It's inevitable that Kubrick's death has generated a great deal of interest in this movie, combined with a very long movie shoot and troubled casting, so the stakes are high. But the long and the short of it is this: ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a good movie, Kidman and Cruise are excellent, and this is a thought-provoking, intelligent swansong from the genius who brought the world such classics as ""The Killing"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""The Shining"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" and many, many more.  Stanley - thank you.  I shall miss you."

","First, this movie has a great title. Secondly, the casting is superb. The supporting cast (especially Sydney Pollack) is good too. I liked seeing Alan Cummings as the hotel desk clerk. The somewhat disturbing aspects were the score and the actual plot. I think Stanley Kubrick, although a cinematic genius, has gone a bit too close to the edge. It seems as if he has made a porn movie, but with a message. I especially felt the last line of the movie to be quite offensive. But in respect for Kubrick, I feel he has made a bold cutting edge film. The hype for this film was a bit much. I don't feel that this film lives up to the same quality as his others, and I'm upset that this was his last film. In closing,the score was way too repetitive and quite dissonant.

","What better one line summary can one come up with than ""Kubrick""? Even beyond the grave he challenges people and creates dissension. This is not new when it comes to Kubrick. This latest piece of work is nothing less than a masterpiece. Yet again the focus is, somehow, not on the acting as such, but rather the plot. The plot is the real main character in this movie. As for the actors... Well I guess that most actors could have pulled off what Cruise and Kidman achieved. These are not the best actors in Hollywood. They are not bad, but there are better. But as I said: In this movie, it does not matter.<br/><br/>I can not remember the last time I heard music that was as haunting as the score for this movie. It gave the movie an ethereal, supernatural quality that almost made you wish that something supernatural would happen in the movie -- not so much consciously as subconsciously. The eerie piano playing its strange melody, accompanying Cruise in that weird mask, just standing there, saying nothing. It kept me at the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>As for the plot: It is a stroke of genius. Such a simple story as that of a couple who are in a rut. Nothing particularly exciting happens in their life. That is to say, before the movie truly begins. Then it becomes a fascinating look into emotional life, sexuality and psyche. The audience feels compelled both to loathe Cruise and to love him. All the while he explores his world, the world changes. <br/><br/>My hat off and a deep bow to one of the greatest directors that ever livéd in the tide of times.

","Kubrick was a master, so nobody had the guts to tell him that large sections of this film were risible. The corny dialogue, implausible behaviour and ridiculous characters. Kubrick was also a recluse and didn't get out much. It shows! Kidman's over long waltz with Bela Lugosi. Was he supposed to be a realistic character? Any 1990's woman would have laughed this cheesy pensioner back to transylvania. I kept expecting him to say "" the bridge is down, you'll have to spend the night"" The mirror sex scene. What a pity it was trailered on TV a dozen times ruining it for us. As it was exactly as on TV, I guessed correctly that that was it, and that was the end of the alleged bonk fest. Only another two hour of boredom to go fans. The orgy. Was this deliberately banal and dispassionate, or just as much as they thought they could get past the US censor ? Any real bacchanalia would have ensured no certificate. A dozen nude girls, and no willies and they could squeeze an 18 cert. The only real risk the producers took was having the nudes on display for minutes at a time rather than the few seconds normally allowed in mainstream films. Rich Dr. Cruise walks around the dodgy streets alone.Has he no car? No attempt was even made to tell us why he only used it once in the film. No maguffin was introduced to explain how he could be on foot to meet the prostitute, the gay bashers or the bald stalker. On he plods, just like the film, forgetting his mobile phone with which he could have called a cab. The only time he gets to drive is in the obviously english location where he revisits the house. Driving a Range Rover to a meeting with a Rolls Royce. A US plate on the Rolls being the only clue that we might be in America. The corniest dialogue in the film was saved for the toy shop scene at the end. This was so corny you could hear the the audience wincing. Even Cruise and Kidman looked unconvinced. I imagined that they just wanted to go home and forget the whole thing. Most of the audience wished that they had at my screening. I really get no pleasure writing this, as I loved 2001, Full Metal Jacket and Strangelove. This really is a sad note to end a career on."

I remember sitting in the cinema, breath taken away by the astonishing camera work and the sound, when a young couple left the cinema, probably murmuring something like: `Let´s get out of here as quick as possible, I´m afraid this movie demands thinking.' And they were right, of course. Anyone who responds to the big ""Cruise/Kidman-1000%-Sex'-Hype with curiosity, will be disappointed.

","Let me begin by saying that I am not the greatest fan of Kubrick's work so this may add weight to my review if anyone cares to read. The man is a genius at cinematography, atmospheric setting, and camera work. I'll concede that, however he is NOT the best storyteller in the world. I suppose that's not his intention. He would rather have his audience leave his films with a total sense of astonishment and force it upon them to fill in the gaps with their own interpretations, like an artist of oil paintings or exquisite sculptures.<br/><br/>I loved Strangelove, 2001, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, however Eyes Wide Shut left too much of an emptiness within me. The visual film elements are mesmerising, but the dialogue will drive you NUTS. Especially Nicole Kidman, who takes 5 minutes to complete every damn sentence for dramatic effect (partially due to being drunk in the opening party sequence and stoned in another key scene in their bedroom). This film explores a theme of jealousy and it's consequences. Although no actual extra-marital affairs exist in this film, Cruise's character is driven into an all-night journey into the sexual underworld because his wife wanted to be unfaithful to him when the couple was on vacation a year before these present events.<br/><br/>Cruise is emotionally devastated and wanders the night alone and then runs into all sorts of weirdos along the way and ends up in a very sinister mansion on Long Island where a cult-like masquerade ball orgy-fest occurs. I will divulge no further except to say that this half-hour sequence is the best part of the film and makes you sit up in your seat with enormous interest of what exactly is happening here and what is going to happen to Cruise. The plot could have really taken off from there, and in my opinion, could have turned the film into a seedy conspiracy-mystery crime thriller. Alas, no. All the potential that was drawn from the chain of events at this mysterious house was terribly wasted in the third act and the resolution to the whole thing was a serious let down. The ending turned what had become interesting and open to interpretation into a lame explanation that is too trite and tidy. The whole thing remained an almost three hour examination or thesis, if you will, on human reaction to jealousy and what one's imagination can do to a relationship.<br/><br/>To conclude, I really wanted Stanley's final gift to the movie-goer to be the masterpiece that the hype would have you believe. Sadly, it wasn't. Not the worst film he's made, but certainly nowhere near his best. Rest in peace, Mr. Kubrick..."

","I've heard people say ""If 'Eyes Wide Shut' was done by anyone else, people would be disappointed."" In my case, that is why I'm disappointed. Because Kubrick was unable to maintain his extreme brilliance in what ended up being his final film. It was not a bad movie. Despite popular opinion, Tom Cruise's performance was fine in my eyes. Also, Nicole's limited opportunities didn't exactly scream ""Oscar!"" (but what has in 1999?) The story was interesting to a point, but after 159 minutes, I had almost lost interest and noticed that many of the people in the theater had as well. Slightly over 2 hours would've been much better for the film's pace. The thoughts that ran through my mind:<br/><br/>-- Haven't I seen this before? A different plot but the same idea done in a better way by Martin Scorsese in ""After Hours."" True, ""AH"" might not be as profound, but that works to its advantage, anyway; EWS wasn't all that deep.<br/><br/>-- Kidman pulled off the stoned act rather well.

Even if this means overlooking two murders... all what Kidman could come up with in the end was to get back home and f*, much to the relieve of her husband. The fact that we are lead to identify ourselves with Cruise and Kidman, is part of the trap that Kubrick is setting for us to tap into at the end.

I thought I would be shifting in my seat a billion times and getting restless halfway through the film.  I think Kubrick is sporadic at best, with his films.

I give the utmost kudos for Mr. Kubrick for going out in style.  It had all the elements that movies today do not such as good acting, great cinematography, a good story, good direction and oh yeah.....It's original.<br/><br/>If you are usually intrigued by Kubrick but don't love him, go see this one, because you will like it.

","This movie is one of the ultimate mind games of all time. Although the main theme of this appears to be about sex, it starts to scare you almost half-way through.

She's captivating and you can't take your eyes off of her when she speaks or even just stands there.

","Eyes Wide Shut is an amazing mixture of the simple and complex.  Mr. Kubrick took as his premise the simple idea of marital infidelity.  As we know, the actual act of infidelity need not be physical but can be emotional and can be done very simply but the repercussions are complex. This film has so much to offer that it should be seen twice to mine all its gems.  So I will make only a few general observations.  The cinematography was unusual providing almost a surreal feeling.  At times it seemed as if it had been filmed in the '50's or 60's as there was not much color variation with an emphasis on the primaries.  It also seemed unusual that although the film is about two and a half hours that each scene in Dr. Bill Hartford's odyssey seemed almost self-contained and not necessary to the other parts but important to the whole.  The basic part of the soundtrack consisting of a one finger piano chord was highly effective as a mood setter.  The sex scenes which got so much pre-release press were neither gratuitous or erotic but were cold and depersonalizing.  One can only wonder why the need for computer generated images to cover what we're not sure to acquire the ""R"" rating for the North American version.  One more movie of the summer of '99 to debate the MPAA rating system.  To make more in depth comments I'll have to see this film again (which I will).  Recommended.  Three plus stars!!!"
"Adec","10","0","0","5 September 1999"," More than lives up to expectations...
","First off I must say that I was not expecting Eyes Wide Shut to live up to the rather lofty expectations placed upon it, after all how many films truly live up to their hype? Despite the fact that I am a big Kubrick fan I'm one of those people who never goes into a film expecting to see something mindblowing, true I expected Eyes Wide Shut to be a good, well made film but that was as high as I (ever) let my expectations go. Personal rule number one of enjoying films to their fullest: never, ever believe the hype, always make up your own mind. And make up my mind I have...<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is a spellbinding and utterly hypnotic decent into sexual obsession that in my mind is truly deserving of the tag instant classic. Without a doubt one of the best, most intricate and fascinating films that I have seen in some time and definitely one of the front runners (if not the front runner) for best film that I have seen this year. Not only is it superbly crafted and acted but it's also a distinctly Kubrick film, and Kubrick at his best. <br/><br/>The script (by Kubrick and Frederic Raphael) is very good and handles it's subject matter with a sense of honesty and believability that is rarely seen on screen, and then just when you think you have a handle on whats going on it takes an unexpected left turn and just keeps getting deeper and more complex. However the real reason for the films impact has to be put down to Stanley Kubricks terrific direction. <br/><br/>He was one of the true greats of cinema, and his images and the all encompassing atmosphere that he was able to bring to his films is evident in Eyes Wide Shut in spades. I can't imagine any other director being able to make this film this way, or being able to make such a mix of the bizarre and the believable so stunning and engrossing. The often foreboding atmosphere that Kubrick has managed to bring to this film is truly something to behold and if he isn't at least nominated as best director come awards time for his work here then there truly is no justice in this world.<br/><br/>Also of note is the terrific score by Jocelyn Pook which is at times quite minimalist in nature but just oozes atmosphere and dread and underpins the whole film perfectly, while the cinematography by Larry Smith again splendidly captures the mood that Kubrick was aiming for and is perfectly in sync with the world that Kubrick has created. <br/><br/>Also of significant note is the fantastic costume design by Marit Allen, whose work here is worthy of both plaudits and awards. The masks especially are just amazing and heighten the atmosphere of the film to almost breaking point, the intensity brimming just below the surface of the film really does become that intense, with the costume design adding greatly to the overall effect. <br/><br/>Acting is pretty much flawless throughout with Kubrick's well publicized perfection in ordering take after take bearing fruit and proving that all the effort was worth it in the long run. Nicole Kidman is fantastic as indeed many have stated but so is Tom Cruise, his performance here showing a definite maturity about it, and he manages to match Kidman in terms of performance. Both Cruise and Kidman have been perfectly cast here and their work deserves significant kudos as both have managed to walk the fine line of giving very strong performances without overwhelming the film or drawing attention away from the story which is quite an achievement in itself.<br/><br/>The supporting cast (almost) all give terrific performances, with Vinessa Shaw, Sydney Pollack, Todd Field, Julienne Davis, Rade Serbedzija, Fay Masterson and Leelee Sobieski (who despite having almost no dialogue still manages to make a hell on an impression on sheer charisma and screen presence alone) all of special note, while Jackie Sawiris, Leslie Lowe, Louise J. Taylor, Alan Cumming, Mariana Hewett and Thomas Gibson all provide strong support. The only misstep seems to be a slightly overplayed performance from Marie Richardson that just didn't really work as well as it should have. Richardson's performance isn't bad but given the inherent quality of most of the other performances hers stands out simply because it isn't great.<br/><br/>Haunting, highly original, at times surreal and always engrossing this is one of those films that I have no hesitations saying that any true film fan should at least see. It won't suit all tastes, in fact many may be bewildered by it at best, however this is still a unique and all too rare film experience. The fact is that this isn't a commercial film despite starring two A-list actors in the title roles, this is at it's heart an art house film painted on a much larger canvas and due to that fact it's overall appeal to general audiences is hard to gage. <br/><br/>There is a fantastic piece of cinema here and those willing (and able) to go along on the films journey and get engulfed in it's atmosphere will find a film that is more than worthy of it's running time and their money. Yes the running time is lengthy, or at least seems so in the telling but this is one of those truly rare films that I just sunk into completely, losing all sense of time as it just glided by naturally, my attention thoroughly captured by the film itself. <br/><br/>In short this is a must see film for anyone who loves cinema or who longs for something new, intelligent and truly unique. In fact the only people that should probably stay away from this film are those that are offended or embarrassed by sexual themes as the film is very frank and matter of fact about it's subject matter, and at times graphic in it's depiction of sex, jealousy, obsession and fidelity (though not nearly as graphic as had been rumoured). <br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is a film of such quality that it can proudly stand along side the many previous classic Kubrick films with it's head held high in the knowledge that it more than measures up to it's heritage. More than that this is not just a great 'Kubrick' film but simply a truly great film full stop. One of the very best and for once a film that not only lives up to the hype but far surpasses it.<br/><br/>An all too rare 10/10. One man's opinion."

","'Eyes Wide Shut' focuses Stanley Kubrick's incisive vision on the psychology of desire in the 1990s. The film displays classic Kubrick styling - from the drama which he imbues to everydayness, and heightens with the resonance of a simple cutting soundtrack, to a glimpse at mysterious and grandiose ritual behaviour - that leaves one not completely certain about what is real or a fabrication of the mind.<br/><br/>Like Philip Kaufman's 1990 film 'Henry and June', 'Eyes Wide Shut' illustrates how 'alternative' sexuality is a natural outgrowth of commonplace desire and fantasy. It focuses on the characters' explorations of their sexuality without becoming distracted by sex itself (which in all honesty is much more tame than ratings lead us to belive, and certainly will be no shock to European audiences).<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman's performance is honest and subtle with a beauty which does not collapse into mere elegance. The sets spare no expense in contributing to an overall sensory richness perfectly suited to the cinema, or the opera."

","Had Stanley Kubrick not passed away before the release of Eyes Wide Shut, the reviews of this film would be much different. Out of respect for the man, and remorse over his passing, fans and critics alike have been far too lenient on this movie.<br/><br/>The only remarkable thing about the film was the way it was filmed (the very dramatic of color) and the way Kubrick so effectively re-created NYC on an England soundstage down to the most minute detail.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing was the utter lack of incisiveness and depth in the storyline. This was meant to be a film that uncovered emotional truths about the fragile nature of relationships, jealousy, etc. But to me, at least, there were no revelations. Knowing that Kubrick filmed seventy takes of each scene and obsessed over minute details in dialogue. etc., makes the movie even more disappointing, because I see very little perfection attained here.<br/><br/>All in all, a disappointing film to end the career of an auteur like Kubrick. This film deserves no better than a 5 out of 10. All hype, little substance."

And then nothing did!  I had thought the movie would build up to an interesting climax and leave me with something to remember.  But just as the big climax was supposed to happen, it fizzled!  I heard that Kubrich had rewritten the ending not long before it was finished. I don't mean to be cruel, but I thought he must have passed away during the making of it, because it just fizzled out and died somewhere in the last half.  I am so sad that this had to be Kubrich's last film, because it had so much unused potential.  I actually walked away from the theater feeling teased, like Kubrich wanted us to know just how great of a loss future film making will be without him.  The sexual element of the film is more psychological than visual, and may appeal to women more than men.  Still, I would advise anyone half intelligent to see this, but with the knowledge that this film is a journey and not a destination."

","Not many films have managed to annoy me as much as Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut!<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is painfully slow, badly acted and immature. That's a real shame given that it was directed by the same master film maker who presented Dr Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange; movies that would have to rate highly in a list of the most innovative and thought provoking.<br/><br/>And what of the merchandising? Eyes Wide Shut is yet another recent example of the hard sell of a very soft product, along with Star Bores and Independence Day. It's a movie sold by subterfuge, a lousy film well promoted.<br/><br/>Here's the process. The film was made and viewed by the producers. They knew it was a turkey, but knowing that sex sells, billed it as soft (perhaps even hard core) porn starring the saleable Tom and Nicole, and then an added bonus occurred. Kubrick died!<br/><br/>The promoters worked the campaign using a few seconds of nude action from the stars, drawing patrons to the cinema with the same techniques used by the rough spruikers employed by Kings Cross strip joints; the same rude ruses used to drag drunk, shallow brained punters off the street to see naked women and ""live"" sex.<br/><br/>I'm no wowser. Real live sex is great, especially at home, and even at the cinema. I don't mind sex at the cinema as long as they keep it quiet and don't distract me too much from the film, but Eyes Wide Shut attempts to elevate sex, even an orgy, into some sort of stylistic art form.<br/><br/>
The sex act, even at its most enjoyable, is also pretty ridiculous. In real life it might be fun but it's hardly dignified. At it's best it's an expression of love or at least a hell of a giggle. As Woody Allen has said ""Sex is dirty. But only if you do it right.""<br/><br/>But if ever there was evidence that our culture, and in this case Hollywood, sometimes takes itself far too seriously then consider Eyes Wide Shut.<br/><br/>The big thing in Eyes Wide Shut is supposed to be the orgy but what's this? An orgy I would imagine would most likely be accompanied by a lot of alcohol, plenty of laughs and with a bit of luck a good deal of sweat.<br/><br/>I especially think it would be unlikely that an orgy would be as depicted in Eyes Wide Shut; as a stately jerk from jerks wearing high heels, masks and bored facial expressions.<br/><br/>The so called sex in Kubrick's film is sensationalist Hollywood sex; immature, schoolboy, back of the shelter shed stuff.  I would have hoped this sex wouldn't have had a hope in a hell of a brothel of selling a ticket at the cinema. Alas we're not that smart.<br/><br/>Schoolboy? Yes, and as we would expect, very misogynist and homophobic. There's no male nudity but one badly taken accusation of homosexuality against the Tom Cruise character Bill. All of the naked women are skinny and young. Throw in a camp hotel clerk who's played for laughs and we have a very biased world indeed.<br/><br/>Most of the above would have been fine though if the film had been at all entertaining. There have after all been plenty of worthy films that have been over promoted, homophobic and sexist, but Eyes Wide Shut is so slow and awkward it's plain boring.<br/><br/>It's based on a 1926 Viennese novel unsuccessfully reset to modern New York. Dr Bill Harford and his wife Alice (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) go to a rich man's (Sydney Pollack's) party where they are both flirtatious.<br/><br/>Later Alice tells Bill that she has fantasies about having sex with someone else. This upsets Bill and he, perhaps for revenge, delves into the seamy, sexy side of New York. <br/><br/>Bill meets and old friend Nick (Todd Field) who tells him about these strange orgies and Bill goes to one of them.<br/><br/>Apparently it's dangerous for Bill to be at the orgy although it's never really explained why. Bill later tells Alice, with a ludicrous result. End of film (thank God!!)<br/><br/>I often think that bad psycho dramas like this could have worked if they were turned into comedies, but in this case I think that Kubrick would have also have had to have got rid of Tom Cruise. Cruise is way out of his depth here.<br/><br/>But maybe Kubrick was the real problem because just about everything about Eyes Wide Shut stinks, except the sets which are pleasant.<br/><br/>Remember the time travel sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey? Well Eyes Wide Shut is almost as bad as 2 hours and 40 minutes of that. And I really am sick of seeing women peeing on toilets in movies. We used to see them in the shower in films. Now it's on the throne. Yuk!!"

","In his old age, the late great Stanley Kubric may well have gone off the deep end, much like a character in one of his last films, ""The Shining"", as this pointless and underdeveloped urban epic demonstrates. Does as banal a subject as martial fidelity problems require such a grandiose, overstuffed and overacted treatment ? Is a sequence where an 18th century venetian carnival is coupled with an orgiastic cult ritual have any relation to modern borgeuois America? Would prominent citizens or anyone for that matter actually want to engage in the kind of debauchery witnessed by Cruise ? Does a movie which opens with Nicole Kidman's bare behind and closes with her utterance of the f-word have reasonable merit? Odd characters who drop in and out of the plot, a ludicrous pseudo-suspense of the piano score, an extremely slow buildup which ends abruptly at about a third of its logical progression, are some of the picture's more baffling aspects. Indeed, the question that arises as the credits begin to roll is not ""what happened?"", but ""why?"" Why was Kubric compelled to make this ? Was it the voyeristic prospect of working with Nicole and scores of other nude women? Hopefully not just that. Regardless of his motives, the end result by no means makes the impression of a total waste, possessing the kind of lush camerawork we'd come to expect over the years, as well as a consistent level of interest that renders ""Eyes Wide Shut"", like all of the auteur's creative output, worthy of discussion and repeat viewing."

","Eyes Wide Shut is an amazing mixture of the simple and the complex.  Let me first say that I plan to see this film again as there is too much to absorb in one viewing.  For that reason my observations will be basic.  Mr. Kubrick took the simple premise of marital infidelity -- perceived or real -- and wove a complex story in which to see should not always be to believe.  I thought the filming was unusual at times providing almost a surreal feeling. It also felt as if it was filmed in the late '50's or '60's with little color variation and an emphasis on primary colors.  The film is well over two hours long but each scene in Dr. Bill Hartford's odyssey seemed almost free-standing not necessary to the other parts but only to the whole.  The soundtrack consisting of a one finger piano chord was a highly effective mood setter.  The sex scenes which got so much pre-release press were neither gratuitous or erotic but cold and depersonalizing.  What is the difference between the North American and the European versions?  Another film of summer of '99 to give cause for discussing MPAA ratings.  None of the aforementioned comments should be read as negative and only add to my interest in the film.  The lead performances by Mr. Cruise and Ms. Kidman were fantastic.  As I've said I will see this film again.  Recommended. Three plus stars!!!"

Way too slowly paced (even for those with a good attention spans) and it left too many unanswered questions.<br/><br/>There was definitely potential in the script but it mostly went unexplored. It almost seems like he couldn't decide between making a XXX movie with a good story line or an R rated film with a lot of sex.  The only problem was there was not enough sex for a XXX movie and not enough story for an R.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on that 'minimalist' piano score throughout the film, I was very over it after an hour by which time it just grated. (Although I will say that the cinema we saw it in seemed to have the volume turned up a bit too far which didn't really help the situation).  I will say that the lighting and camera work was a nice change compared to the majority of films that come out these days.<br/><br/>I know he's dead, but even so what's the point in glorifying this film.

","Even though it had been speculated that Stanley Kubrick had at least one more film up his sleeve that he was preparing after ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" a science fiction parable called ""AI,"" there are many motifs and hidden treasures in ""Eyes"" to suggest that he had a realization that this magnificent film may in fact be his swan song to the world as he knew it. The ending of the film, which takes place at a toy story around Christmas, shows the Hartfords - played by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, along with their young daughter - summarizing their carnival ride into hell as they come to grips with their subconscious desires to roam sexually.  This scene hits the jackpot as it not only boils all human behavior down to one primal motive - sex - but it seems to act as a precursor to a future world of ""impersonal robots"" or AI, having computer sex.  I think Kubrick was not only commenting on the couple's need to transcend their current state of indifference by having sex, but also making a sly reference to a future that would perhaps one day trivialize the idea of physical sex between human beings.  Furthermore, the girl chooses a teddy bear as her wish for a X-mas present.  This significantly echoes the story of ""Super Toys Last all Summer Long"" by Brian Aldiss, the short story which was reportedly the basis for Kubrick's opus ""AI."" In that story, a child is looked after by a teddy bear which acts as foster parent to it, as the mother and father still await a chance to have a real child from a futuristic society that allows for children only through a lottery system.  The story's climax ends with the realization that the child is in fact an android, or artificial, just like the teddy bear.  It is a poignant story that seems to act as a portense of things to come, especially considering that Eyes Wide Shut deals with a couple's marital difficulties, and how the child takes a backseat to the events unfolding in both of their lives.  The title of the movie, ""Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut"" seems to almost foretell the director's impending death.  What Kubrick has left us is a film for the ages, one that will undoubtedly be regarded as one of the supreme achievements in the history of film."

After watching the interview, I went to a staff preview at my local theatre, and was thoroughly enjoying the movie, realising that at any moment, the love scene between Bill and Alice would take place. Then the film ended, and I sat there for a moment wondering where that scene could have got to. Should it have been near the beginning of the movie, or perhaps at the end? Because apart from some serious kissing action, they really didn't get that close.

","I loved this movie. I thought it was great. The direction and screenplay were terrific and the acting was impressive.<br/><br/> It was a long film but the pacing was perfect. Things unfold slowly because much of the film is shot with a surreal, dream-like quality. The line between fantasy and reality is blurred wonderfully, without an obvious attempt to do so visible. <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is probably my favorite director of all time. His films are always thought-provoking and entertaining. They range from terrifying (The Shining) to hilarious (Dr. Strangelove) to wondrous (2001: A Space Odyssey) to disturbing (A Clockwork Orange). He once again succeeds here as both writer and director. The dialogue (especially in the final scene) is intelligent and well-written. And need I even mention how great the direction is? It remains relatively basic (at least for Kubrick) until the legendary orgy scene. <br/><br/>The orgy scene is hauntingly beautiful. It takes place in a marvelous mansion that provides a great setting for the occasion. The lighting, musical score, camera angles, setting, and positioning of the mask & cloak dressed extras make the scene an amazing example of film-making that is one to be remembered for years to come. Many complained that the way some of the scene was digitally altered (people having sex blocked by other party-goers watching) tainted the quality of it, but I don't think that it really spoiled it at all. If anything I thought it made it even creepier.<br/><br/>
After the orgy the film unfolds like a mystery movie. Bill (Tom Cruise) tries to figure out what happened that night and what happened to the people there afterwards. The rest of the film is intriguing. One revelation after another is discovered, yet the beloved trademark ambiguity remains intact, something Kubrick was always good at. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I think there is some misunderstanding about this film. Most people seem to think it's just a sex thriller or something, but it's much more than that. It's more about deception and psychology than sex. The nudity and sex scenes in the movie aren't erotic but rather have a  bizarre and creepy feeling to them. The only exception to this is Nicole Kidman, who besides being insanely beautiful puts forth a great performance as Alice, the wife whose sexual fantasies haunt her thoughts and dreams.<br/><br/>Although it has it's flaws (not many), and isn't Kubrick's best, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a beautiful, intriguing, excellent film.

I felt little sympathy for the protagonist (Mr. Harford).  It was apparent that he was aware of the dubious character of Mr. Seigel (sp?) and his associates (the costume shopkeeper or the guests at the country manor party), e.g., he walks in on a sweaty Seigel who is pulling up his pants while a model lies naked and unconscious in the introductory scene.  Mr. Harford's character is shown as being aware of these situations yet he implicitly or explicitly helps the apparent aggressors, e.g., he treats the model and admonishes her for her carelessness.  Is this meant to show that he has his ""eyes wide shut"" in a ""see no evil"" frame of mind?  As the film progresses, we see that Mr. Harford's complicity gets him into some troubling situations, but in the final analysis, he does not suffer from it.

All of his signature traits are here:  The pregnant pauses, the dramatic silences, the somber music, the stillness of the camera, and - most of all - the cold detachment.  It is highly Kubrickian (to coin a phrase) in its refusal to editorialize.  What is the point?  What is this film about?  Kubrick never tells us.  He simply presents us with the facts and lets us draw our own conclusions.  As a result, every viewer comes away with a  different message, because every viewer goes in with a different frame of reference.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the technical production of this film.  Yes, it is true that Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh were cut from the movie and recast.  Yes, it is true that Stanley Kubrick filmed numerous takes - sometimes more than 100.  Yes, the shoot lasted for several years.  Yes, it was filmed entirely in London, even though it is set in New York City. And yes, some of the cloaked figures in the orgy scene were digitally inserted to cover strategic areas and thereby earn an R rating - as opposed to an NC-17.  But none of this matters.  What matters is what ended up on the screen.  And what ended up on the screen is an artful, insightful, and mysterious film."

","My eyes were wide open throughout Eyes Wide Shut! I rate this film a 10 out of 10.  Academy Award caliber.  It is Rated R but I would have rated it X. It makes one pause and think about the strong influence of sexuality in our lives.  It held my interest from start to finish and I was surprised to see it was 2 hours and 45 minutes long.  A fascinating and suspenseful movie that I plan to see again.  I will also have fun finding the Christmas tree in each scene. An excellent vehicle for a husband and wife team like Nicole and Tom. They were fabulous.... especially Nicole.     {:-) May Director Stanley Kubrick rest in peace.  He died at age 70 in March 1999 shortly before the movie was released.

","I don't feel the pacing of Eyes Wide Shut is any different from any other Kubrick film.  I believe the rest of the industry has evolved to another standard of pacing. There are no wasted moments in this film.<br/><br/>The movie is beautiful to look at.  The lighting and camera work are eye candy.  All the individual lights in the ball room scene are in sharp focus at the center and gradually become more diffused as the move off the screen. Lots of contrasting warm and cool tones when kidman and cruise are in scenes together.<br/><br/>I got *really* tired of the piano underscore. I *like* minimalism but this was grating.<br/><br/>I don't feel the story, script and acting were up to the production quality of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The final word in the film is an interesting way to end Kubrick's career."

","For a Stanley Kubrick film, this one is very different to his earlier works, at least those that I've seen. It's disappointing to say that this final stroke is probably his worst film. Not to say that it's all bad, but it pales in comparison to films such as THE SHINING, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and DR STRANGELOVE. EYES WIDE SHUT tells the story of a married couple living in New York City who are experiencing some marital trauma. The husband, played by Tom Cruise, goes on a strange tour of the sexual underground of NYC, and although he never actually has sex with anyone but his wife, he becomes entangled with some bizarre cult populated by solemn figures in black cloaks, hoods and masks. We never get to find out much about this cult, but maybe that's a part of the film's alluring sense of the mysterious. It seems to represent a break away from the mundane drudgery of everyday life, and a risky dabble in the occult. But unfortunately it's nothing special; by far the most skilfully directed scene was the one in which Cruise infiltrates the cult and bears witness to their eerie and somewhat disturbing rituals, but the rest of the film had a somewhat plodding pace. Kidman's acting left much to be desired; even in scenes when she was supposed to be sober she had a habit of talking very slowly. Quite a mild film when compared to Kubrick's other works. Still quite entertaining and, as it were, a break away from the mundane drudgery of everyday Hollywood movies, and a risky dabble in more unusual films. Two and a half stars out of four."

Like all of Kubrick's work, the photography and visual style of this movie were terrific. But the payoff for the considerable dramatic tension in the first 2/3 of the film was weak -- a couple of lengthy speeches at the end of the movie seeks to tie everything together and wrap it up with a nice bow for the protagonist (and the audience). I realize we were running a bit long here, but...<br/><br/>And don't you think Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman already take themselves a little too seriously? <br/><br/>Nevertheless, thank you Stanley Kubrick.

","Stanley Kubrick creates an atmosphere that even Freud would have cherished. I have been a big lover of Kubrick movies for a long time.  Almost like Hitchcock, he paints films in such a way that makes the audience want to ""think"" rather than ""react"" (for example: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove, etc.)  In this film, he does the same thing.  This is a movie that clearly asks the question:  what is the purpose of marriage?  This is a film that is the flip side of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""

","Kubrick worked for two years in the final process, filming his last picture which is an appropriate swan song for those who understand his vision and those who don't.  That aspect of his work never changed throughout the decades and there's no reason to believe that Kubrick would change to conventional film making so late in life.  Kubrick would also stick to his re-occurring theme of dehumanization for his final film.<br/><br/>Carrying this film for the better part of the way the same as he did in 'Born on the Fourth of July' is Tom Cruise.  Forget his marketable name, forget his early juvenile films and give this man the credit he deserves. Cruise exhibits sexual frustration and a wrestling match with his conscience superbly in this film as a man with an unwavering amount of decency in the perverse world he discovers.  It's a challenge any actor would have difficulty with and Cruise holds his own with any other actor that could have played this role.  Two Oscar nominations and his ability to act equally as well opposite Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson and Paul Newman (who heaped well deserved praise on Cruise), make Cruise that rare commodity of actor AND movie star and those who don't see his talent can only hope to in the future."

"NoCode","Null","0","0","8 August 1999"," Rich movie, but too rich for me
","I'll admit I am far from a Kubrick fanatic - I have seen a few of his films, and found them intriguing without being overly excited.  I went into Eyes Wide Shut with reasonable expectations from reading numerous adulating reviews.  I definitely got something different from what I expected.<br/><br/>It must be stated that this film is arty.  There are so many subtleties and nuances that the average viewer will miss that it is almost wasted being shown in a cinema.  The overall effect for most will be 'Well, what was the big deal?  That was long and boring!', with the lesser percentage of viewers actually coming to terms with the film, realising the importance of each individual piece that made it up.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes were good - the whole confession scene near the beginning was superb (Tom Cruise actually managed to look suitably deadened by it) but much of it was not up to this standard.  Tom Cruise was just too brash at times for my liking, considering what he was out dabbling in. <br/><br/>
The soundtrack... my goodness, it was heavy and overbearing at best.  From cheesy jazz to those oh so ear drum bursting single piano strokes, it may have served its purpose in terms of creating atmosphere, but from a simply aesthetic point of view, it was awful to listen to.<br/><br/>There were many clever tools used to create the effect Kubrick desired.  For instance, the cover of the newspaper that Tom Cruise was reading while waiting for his cappuchino in the crowded cafe was brilliant.  The movie was filled with those sorts of touches.  <br/><br/>The problem is, as I said above, that the majority of viewers won't even digest them.  Watching this film reminds me of dissecting Shakespeare - the chore of doing it properly basically removes oneself from fully enjoying it. This is how I felt about the film.  I found the analysis so taxing much of the time that I either didn't enjoy it, or I gave up thinking and let it wash over me.  Shame for me, I suppose.  I acknowledge that it is a clever film, but I am probably not alone in my lack of tolerance to shred every moment of a movie for meaning (interesting social commentary there).  I can see this film being the subject of many college media studies debates, however.<br/><br/>So, the path for the average viewer is difficult - think about it and get a varicose vein in your forehead from the effort, or just watch and not understand the significance.  Either way, it's difficult to place this film on a pedestal."

","Okay, no-body reads the really long reviews, so I'll make this one short, even though it does deserve a lengthy essay. I have a few points to make. Firstly, this film is NOT a thriller. Anyone who claims it fails in this category is simply wrong, it is only claimed to be a thriller by confused tabloid idiots who got bored once their popcorn bucket was empty. Second, those that claim the film fails because it has no plot are wrong as well. Not every story has to have a narrative to have a plot. A plot can be a theme that is explored. In this film it is that of jealousy. Your average film goer has an attention span of a troubled child on cherry soda, so the claim of it being 'boring' are to be expected but can be easily ignored.<br/><br/>This film is very European in style and ideology. It's brilliant. Finally some art-house that the masses are flocking to."

","This isn't an easy film to sit through...slow-moving, laborious, and downright frustrating at over 2 1/2 hours...but strangely enough, it's a film you can't help thinking about days afterward.<br/><br/>The plot and underlying theme of this movie are simple...nothing is what it appears to be.  Tom and Nicole play a seemingly happily married couple with an extravagant life and a beautiful child; it all looks good on the surface. But a late-night argument with Nicole leads Tom to doubt the security of his marriage, sending him on an all-night mission to break his vow of monogamy.<br/><br/>As you watch the film, nothing much appears to happen.  At times, things move excruciatingly slow. When it's all over, though, you realize what you've been watching is an illusion and that you the viewer have been through a tremendous emotional experience.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman, one of today's most underrated actresses, is terrific as Alice Harford, a woman hiding her feelings behind a facade of matrimonial and matriarchal bliss.  Tom Cruise, on the other hand, can't quite pull off the darkness of Bill Harford. <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick uses the camera like a paintbrush, creating a beautiful visual and emotional landscape.  Now if he had only realized that it's 1999 and the vast majority of the movie-going audience tires quickly of naked Playboy bunny bodies on display, this film would have more appeal.  Instead, it seems as if Kubrick was obsessed with women's breasts and rear ends...to the point that he looked for any excuse to get them into frame."
"MetroRev","8","0","0","6 August 1999"," A deep, beautiful movie. Classic Kubrick.
","WARNING:  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN EYES WIDE SHUT<br/><br/>I'll start off by saying that ""Eyes Wide Shut""(EWS) is a Stanely Kubrick movie.  If you have not seen one of his films before do not start with this one as it is a very strange movie as compared to today's short attention span theater.  Now that I have cleared that I can begin. <br/><br/>
Where do you begin to talk about a movie that includes necrophilia, sex cults and orgies, prostitution, pedophilia and infidelity?  I guess what I want to do is spoil the surprise and  say that there is no infidelity. <br/><br/>
The most interesting thing about Kubrick's final film is through all the hoopla over the sex people missed the fact that the story revolves around two people who care for each other. Alice admitting to Bill that she has sexual fantasies, not involving him, was a blow to his ego(As it would be to most men).  He gets called away and gets involved in several sexual encounters.  A lot of which parallel some of Alice's fantasies. He never strays from Alice and in the end, when he does go back to the prostitute, he gets ""slapped"" with with a helping dose of reality.  Totally blown back by the fact that she is a victim of HIV.  The movie is masked (as the people at the sex cult) in this ""big sex  flick"" stereotype and that in itself is a joke by Kubrick.  Nearly everyone went to see a ""sex flick"" and came out bewildered because it was not.  It teases you(purposely) with taboos but the truth behind it is the relationship between Bill and Alice and a deep look into Bill's sense of his marriage and how that is rearranged and at the same time strengthened.  <br/><br/>Kubrick is a master film maker but unfortunately, like a Picasso or a Poe his work is greatly misunderstood, even worse today where people are making Will Smith a millionaire because he can spew cheesy one liners in front of digital bugs all the mean time while some one decides that the faster the cut and the more funky angles you have the ""cooler"" the movie is.  One amazing thing about Kubrick which today's people often talk about is that Kubrick is one of the few artists(Listening Lucas) that actually ""kept it real,"" never straying from his vision and his own sense of style.  In this modern era, where movies borrowed styles from MTv videos (Progress?) I welcome EWS with open arms."

","This is the last great film of the millennium. I waited patiently for twelve years for this film. So many people are critical of the length, the performances, and the ""epic-lessness"" of this film. First off, Kubrick always deliberately paced his films. This is a very intimate story, therefore it is aesthetically paced to build a simple understanding of the characters which are in a complex situation. The performances are so on target. Cruise's pent up emotion is brilliantly showcased through a grand subtlety. Kidman is so saturated with wit and displays emotions so openly it's mesmerizing. Her confession of her fantasy reminds me of Bibi Anderson's story of fulfilling a similar fantasy in ""Persona."" As always, Kubrick's choice of supporting characters nicely outlines the heart of the film.Larry Smith's photography is beautiful. He obviously learned a lot of what he knows from Kubrick and Kubrick's former lighting cameraman, the late, great John Alcott. Not to mention the excellent musical selections Kubrick had an intense visual ear for. I loved this movie so much I hate to mention that there are some technical goofs here and there, but that's the price you pay for doing hundreds of takes only to find out that the one that has the best performance also has a reflection of a crewman(as in this film) or has a shadow of a helicopter(as in ""The Shining."") I feel Kubrick is too much of a perfectionist to actually miss such errors, I feel he knew they were there, but sacrificed technical perfection for performance perfection. There you have it, the most I could ever possibly criticize Kubrick for. So for those of you that didn't care for ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" I recommend seeing it again because it is pure filmmaking, in concentrated form. It is film history. If the last thing you want to do is see it again, I at least have the comfort in knowing you'll never forget it."

Far from being bold and frank, EWS doesn't go nearly far enough. The ""orgy"" centerpiece scene comes across more silly than anything else. Most of the male characters are overplayed and exaggerated stereotypes, and most of the women are demure and interchangeable -- why? The lapses in logic are almost endless, yet I did find this film fascinating to watch. Kubrick is a marvelously skilled filmmaker -- he has to be to make claptrap like this as mesmerizing as it is.

","I am, or surely will be, an exile from the land of Kubrick!<br/><br/>
No, I do not denounce the Kubrick legacy as mere fluff nor fad.  I will always be a true Apostle of ""Kubrickian Genius""!  From Lolita to 2001: A Space Odyssey, from A Clockwork Orange to Full Metal Jacket I listened carefully to the master as he whispered secrets of his soul into my anxious and eager ears.  So it is with a significant degree of sorrow and heartache that I must now decree, ""Indeed - the king is butt naked!""<br/><br/>I will not go into any specific details of the film for I believe that it is much better to see it and judge for yourself; Especially for die hard fans of Stanley Kubrick - of which I am certainly one. For months, I should say years, I have awaited what I was sure to be the next work of magnificence from the undisputed grand maestro of cinematic art.  Eyes Wide Shut was sure to be, and by many expected to be, the finest thread in the fabric of Stanley Kubrick's lifetime garment of ingenious wizardry. With  the passing of the maestro early this year I was confident that Kubrick's last piece would be his final and true masterpiece. I can not with a clear conscience confess to having expectations that were too high, for it has always been somewhat of a pseudo tradition that Kubrick films leave a disturbed portion of the audience with a feeling of frustrated confusion, disillusionment and even discontentment.  In most cases one may attribute the aforementioned emotions to cases of simply not understanding the artistry of a great mind who was intellectually way ahead of his time.  Regrettably with Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick's last production seems to be more a compilation of unnecessarily long, almost drearily malapropos scenes which consistently seem to leave one wondering, ""Couldn't he have done without this?""<br/><br/>Sure, say what you will of the obvious psycho dramatic elements of the film; nightmarish infidelity demons waiting at the end of an obscure tunnel of curiosity and self-exploration.  Still, Eyes Wide Shut left me with an unshakable feeling of, ""No duh!"" We see this message all around us in every day life:  Sexually transmitted diseases, high (and low) profile dysfunctional marriages, emotionally damaged children and adults, as well as through countless television dramas, soap operas, and weepy dramatic tragedies not to mention many of our own personal real-life experiences.<br/><br/>
Should the ""message"" have been more profound, perhaps even more metaphysical? Perhaps, but not necessarily.  Even the most fanatical disciple of Stanley Kubrick (which I still believe myself to be) will not find it very difficult to look beyond all the classic technical and stylistic Kubrickian filmmaking characteristics to come to the conclusion that this film seems more full of time-filling fluff than remarkably ingenious Kubrickian ""stuff"".<br/><br/>In the end, perhaps I am indeed an outcast.  Obviously mine is a case where my personal taste ultimately objects to what the late great master has concocted.  Or maybe like the humble boy in the well known fable ""The Kings New Clothes"", I am one of the few to honestly declare that the last garment of the mighty king is sewn of artistic hype and apostolic-like delusion. And perhaps in his last parade, the king IS butt naked!<br/><br/>

","Kubrick's final film is a mesmerizing odyssey consisting of dreamlike images.  It was also not what I expected.  I was very surprised that a huge star like Tom Cruise agreed to do this film, because there is nothing at all commercial or mainstream about it--it is an arthouse film from beginning to end.  In fact, if it had been any director other than Kubrick, I'm sure he would've turned it down.  I'm glad he did it, though, because I was getting tired of his clean-cut crusader roles he's played throughout the '90's. This is his first difficult part since ""Born on the Fourth of July"".  The story takes place in New York City, even though, of course, it was shot in England.  The photography, by Larry Smith, is outstanding.  This is Kubrick's most beautifully shot film other than ""Barry Lyndon"".  Since the film is set during the Christmas holidays, there is great use of color throughout, especially from the numerous Christmas trees we see in just about every indoor location.  No wonder this film took forever to shoot. The story of the film isn't of great importance--what is important is the atmosphere, especially the amazingly surreal sequence at the mansion, which is the film's centerpiece.  There are darkly funny moments scattered throughout.  Although the film is long at some 2 hours, 40 minutes, it felt about a half hour shorter.  Like all of Kubrick's films, it's never boring, but many mainstream moviegoers will no doubt think so, especially Tom Cruise fans.  I was angry that the film was altered for American release but that the rest of the world gets to see the original version.  Let's hope DVD will set the record straight."

While Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, and the rest of this cast are all solid, the story, and especially the way it is delivered both takes forever to develop and frustrates. <br/><br/>
The dialogue takes forever for the actors to say, and I often felt like if I made hand gestures, it might help to speed up the story out of their mouths.<br/><br/>
Certain aspects of the story, characters, and entire scenes serve no purpose at all in this film, other than to elongate it.<br/><br/>However, as for the now-famous orgy scene, it is certainly one of the most fascinating and bizarre sequences in recent film.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel sorry for the cast and crew, who, while they put forth such a strong effort, end up in such a mess."

Dr. Bill is a true mechanical man, despite his job as a healer of bodies.  But he can't suppress dat ol' debbil.  Even worse, he can't forgive his wife Alice for her fantasied infidelity.  A study of men and women -- the woman holds the high ground because of her compassion, and her honesty, which includes her acceptance of her animality. The script's last word is K's last hope for returning to our lost essence. God, those skin tones!  Kubrick's use of available light and high speed film raises primitive technique to sublime sophistication. But that's the point, isn't it.  The naked ape creates stunning mechanisms -- laws, social norms, movies -- in a hopeless attempt to purify human existence. Kubrick grins sardonically, but can't stop joining in.  Here he creates another elegant and sad monument to the ridiculous human experiment.  A fitting wrap to the career of a genius."

As with the Shining this movie must be digested a couple of times before you catch all of the important aspects of the movie.

The Shining was just a simple every day horror film. Back in the day when I first heard that Stanley was making a horror film I expected something like THE EXORCIST, but no such luck just an insane killer film. Full Metal Jacket was a little closer to home but the comic relief should not be in a war film.  One of the could be best scenes of the movie was ruined when he had the platoon, who were positioned in the trench, deliver corny one liners to the panning camera. Yet Eyes Wide Shut was Kubricks best work since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, in fact I liked it better.  This is a masterpiece. One of the only films this decade to tackle important topics such as marital sex and betrayal.  It should be entitled EYES WIDE SHUT: a sexual odyssey.  The acting was fantastic as well as the cinematography, and the ending discussion about their experiences is moving and wonderful.  I think KUBRICK finished on a great note!  His best film was 2001.

","Kubrick has been making films since the 50's.  He has made two in my lifetime: Full Metal Jacket (1987) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999).  I was only seven when Full Metal Jacket came out and far too young, so it was a huge thrill for me to sit in that dark theatre and watch Kubrick's name appear on the screen.<br/><br/>There was far less sex in the movie than I had predicted.  Instead, Kubrick stuck to his reputation of psychological exploration.  Bill Harford, played by Tom Cruise, is the focus of this exploration.  The catalyst is a bold confession by his wife, Alice Harford, about her brief obsession with a sailor.  This launches Cruise into a self-destructive path as he approaches his marriage with unbridled nihilism.<br/><br/>Many events follow, the most bizarre being Bill's confrontation with masked nymphomaniacs.  This is really the final sexual event and so brings what I believe to be the conclusion about sex itself.  It does not portray animal sex as funny or beautiful, but instead casts it in the light of a Masonic or Satanic type of ritual.<br/><br/>While watching the movie, I could not help but think of Edgar Allen Poe's villain in The Tell-Tale Heart.  Bill Harford is not confused or sex-crazed and he is certainly not stupid.  Bill is an intellectual and approaches all of his situations with that type of arrogance that an intellectual has. Yet, when he sees that mask on his pillow, that's the defining moment, the thundering beat of a heart under the floorboards.  It is then when a previously confident intellectual crumbles under the realization of his own weakness and sexual obsession.  All that time, Bill Harford had walked through his own life with eyes wide shut.<br/><br/>I loved this movie.  And that's all I can say.  Those who were waiting for some shocking sexual act in the movie will be severely disappointed.  I don't know if this is his best, but if you are a fan of Kubrick films, you will not be disappointed."

","""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the most mesmerizing and haunting film Stanley Kubrick has ever made, and to find a better entry in his filmography, one would be forced to go back to 1968, and his magnum opus, ""2001: a space odyssey"". The performances by leads Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman represent the best work either actor has ever done, and, as always with Kubrick, the direction is masterful.  Also characteristic of Kubrick's best work, the themes present here are many and complex.  Not only is this Kubrick's best film in thirty years (and that itself is certainly saying a lot), but it's also his most fascinating, his most intriguing, his most confusing, and the one which best lends itself to critical and intellectual analysis.  In death, the greatest of all directors has left us with one final work which can be discussed and debated and puzzled over, and, hopefully, appreciated for a long, long time to come.  ""Outstanding"" doesn't even begin to describe it."

","The movie is about a married couple, Bill and Alice, who, while split up at a holiday party, get flirtatious with some partiers. After the party, in a frank conversation about sexual behaviour, Alice reveals an ongoing lustful fantasy she has about a Naval officer she once saw in a hotel, which Bill obsesses over and then starts contemplating, then realizing real extramarital activities with prostitutes and infiltrating some secret orgy society, which then discovers the imposter that Bill is, putting Bill, his friends and family in possible danger. This very long movie has all the Kubrick style trademarks, Soft bounce lighting indoors or overcast outdoor lighting, lots of bright onscreen light sources (similar to the bright lights in the Korova milk bar of ""Clockwork Orange""), very rich cinematography. Visually a stunning movie but the dialogue pacing is so slow and staccato it brings undue attention to it self. Nicole's character starts this practice  while stoned on pot, but then she continues to<br/><br/>utter....one.....word.....at....a.....time......for.....the...rest....of.... the....movie. Sydney Pollack continues this annoying speech pattern in a billiards room conversation with Tom. I thought the movie was overly long for the rather simple plot. Overall, a good movie, but it left many unanswered questions and the too tidy and neat ending was abrupt."

","I loved Nicole Kidman. Alice is a dynamic character and I believe this is a great role for Kidman to show a lot of range. I wish the same could be said for the rest of the characters. Bill Harford (Cruise) is a flat character through the entire movie. You hope for tragedy or heroism (or at least decisiveness), but all I could feel for this character was pity. He is not a character that engages the viewer.<br/><br/>This is not to say that Tom Cruise does a bad job. I believe he put the same dramatic talent into this as I saw in Jerry Maguire, a movie that I love. My complaint is that he plays Bill Harford too much like Jerry Maguire. He appears to have found a good character (somewhere around The Firm), and is now bringing it with him to each new job.<br/><br/>I am a great fan of extended dramatic pauses, and I believe EWS occasionally makes brilliant use of them. Kidman is not afraid to be silent when it's ""her turn to talk,"" and this is very effective. At least at one point, the audience is aware of things several minutes before the players, which creates a wonderful kind of tension. But as with anything, there can be too much of a good thing, and EWS often goes beyond dramatic pauses into just pauses. Beyond just being a long movie, there is a sense that it really isn't going anywhere. Events that occur during a single morning feel more like they stretch over several days. The slowness of plot might be acceptable if the characters were more engaging, but given that Cruise has so much of the screen time and provides so little for the audience to relate to, it can be hard to stay with the movie the whole time.<br/><br/>
Music is certainly a very important part of EWS, and the almost abstract nature of the piano pieces could have greatly added to the mood and suspense of the movie. Unfortunately it is often just too loud and jarring to do this effectively.<br/><br/>Kubrick fans should certainly see this movie. It is a significant part of a defining career. Those interested in film as an art form should also go see it. There is plenty of material for discussion whether you enjoy the movie or not. Those just interested in a good movie, though, should probably look elsewhere. And despite the amount of nudity in this file, those looking for erotica should definitely look elsewhere.<br/><br/>But I still loved Nicole Kidman."

","On the original Saturday Night Live Dan Akroyd use to do a skit as a pretencious film critic who only reviewed the worst movies, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" would have been a perfect candidate for that skit. There weren't many redeeming qualities in this movie. The acting was very flat and Nicole Kidman especaily turned in a performance that would not have gotten her a part in a high school production. The cinematography was annoying. Especially the scenes where the Tom Cruise character imagines his wife in a sexual liason with the Naval officer of her fantasy. The orgy scene was another disaster, with it's digital effects to cover sexual acts. I mean either shoot the scene with real people engaged in sexual activity and show it or find a better way to viel it without resorting to cheap technological tricks which look horrible. The sound track was marred by that truly annoying single note at a time piano part. The ending was absolutely absurd.

","Of course it's not a soft porn, even though we are blessed with the sight of Nicole's somewhat thin behind in the opening seconds of the movie.But, to tell the truth, I wasn't sure myself what this movie was until the unexpected turn it took in the middle part. It was too weird to believe, but whoever thought old Stan went crazy, soon was proven wrong. Nothing happened by accident in any of his movies, and EWS is not an exception. Yes, the scene in the mansion is weird enough, even with computer generated deceivers of our sex-lusted eyes. But what was it actually? Was it Tom's reality, or just Nicole's dream? You want answers from Kubrick? Not likely.<br/><br/>He's neither your moralistic Spielberg nor entertaining Sonnenfeld. Not even your relaxed but crisp Scorsese. Stan wants to make you think, come up with your own answers. And if at first you don't succeed, you are probably asking the wrong questions. There is no point in telling the story of the movie here, but I have to give kudos to the actors. I already heard the Oscar-buzz for Kidman, whose role is second in importance, but first in intensity. The real gem is the performance of Sydney Pollack as ridicilously rich and amoral friend of Cruise's. He's not in the movie for long, but he leaves a strong impression, as well as Rade Serbedzija. He plays the weird immigrant owner of the costume shop, and I felt kind of proud to have known his brilliant work for 20 yrs before he was discovered by American audience (he also played in ""Saint""). And, of course, there is Tom Cruise, who was not able to impress me in ""The Firm"", ""Rain Man"" or ""Born On the Fourth Of July"". But under steady guiding hand of Stanley Kubrick, he came so close. The transformation and the development of his character is very detailed and accurate, and he was able to carry the movie till the surprising end. And last but not least, this movie speaks volumes about the talents and visions of Stanley Kubrick himself. The grainy quality of the celluloid tape, gold and red colour filters, endless sequences without dialogue, bizarre settings, everything bears a visible Kubrick mark. Not to forget Gyorgy Ligeti, whose mysterious music can be found in two other Kubrick's masterpieces, ""2001"" and ""The Shining"". Whether the anemic Oscars acknowledge EWS as a true masterpiece, it will remain as a worthy ending to a brilliant career of one of the best directors in Hollywood history."

","Although it is haunting in places, this is a weak farewell for Kubrick. The film is derivative and never completely convincing--the drawn out, profanity-laden dialogue strains for drama but is simply boring. Aside from the US release electronic editing of the orgy scene, many earlier reported scenes are missing, although the motivations and characters remain.  The film plays like a big joke on Cruise's idol image and the gossip about his sexuality. Both he and Kidman, however, do fine acting given the often banal material, and several of the supporting cast steal the film (Alan Cumming!). The Kubrick style is so stated as to seem almost self-conscious.  One can easily ignore the narrative and just tally the bathrooms, dinner tables, corpses, nymphets, red colors, wide angle shots, overhead lighting, neo-classical interiors, etc. to keep busy until the film finally picks up steam in the final hour.  Regardless of what Cruise and WB may say, I'll bet there is a REAL director's cut somewhere (or elements thereof) which would certainly make this truncated mess the film it should have been.  In all of the footage shot there might well be a landmark vision of sexual frustration, experimentation and voyeurism that would have brought Schnitzler's brilliant original to the end of this century.

I do not believe that this movie had any good points, I found it terribly boring and I nearly fell asleep but for the banging of the piano. The plot was confusing, un_likable, and just did not make me care about the characters at all.

","This intense, often frustrating film details the pain, jealousy, and rationalizations of marriage.  This is not to say that it won't appeal to single people, but the movie will most likely resonate most powerfully with anyone who has been in the middle of a marital crisis, or even divorced.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (of course, a real-life married couple) play a couple, flirtatious with strangers, casually flexing their independence, all the while clinging to their marital bond rather for granted.  It's not until a marijuana-induced confession by Kidman's character of a sexual fantasy that the couple's crisis is unveiled, and Cruise's character takes to the streets of NYC looking for answers or relief (by way of any number of sexual situations).  <br/><br/>Neither character is given the saint treatment, and the ugly truth that marriage neither means undying devotion or even a promise not to think of sex with another is revealed.  <br/><br/>In the end, the characters come to grips with their actions, and attempt coming to grips with each other.  I suppose it's an optimistic ending, wherein they agree to stick with each other for as long as they can, and Kubrick has definitely never been so ""domestic"" on film. <br/><br/>
Of course, the film looks beautiful, and the music can be really effective at setting the mood.  The film is not an overly creepy movie, and I doubt many people are going to be tearing down theaters about the sex.  Truth be told, most people, unless drawn to Kubrick's technical mastery, will have little need to see the film more than once.

This being a vision of Stanley Kubrick; the visuals are at sometimes dreamlike and and at other times, utterly chilling.  Tom's performance is very convincing; adapting to his wife's actions and then later to the aftermath of his own actions.  Mrs. Tom Cruise, er, Nicole Kidman also does a fine job switching between the variences of her character (Wife-mode, Mother-mode, & Bitch-mode).  You'd swear she was playing different characters throught the film and not the same one.  In an all-too-brief, yet very revealing role, Leelee Sobieski give a dazzling performance as a obviously underage girl whom by circumstances Tom's character runs into.  Her character is one that is very sexually uninhibited and extroverted, even to the point of making a profit of her body with it, all with the gentle blessings of her father.  Yes, her father.  A final note on Leelee:  She looked damn hot bouncing around the screen in her flimsy little bra and panties.  With that said, I cannot have more respect for her performance.  She was supposed to give that effect.  The movie was, for me, disturbing at times as it dealt with the subject of infidelity and it's consequences in a couple's relationship.  I certainly would not recommend this as a date movie, unless you're in the mood for a never-ending discussion/fight afterwards.

","I sat on pins and needles the last couple of days.  I was going to do something I hadn't done since 1987, go to the theatre and see the new Kubrick picture.  Ladies and gentlemen, I was not disappointed!!  I came away from this film feeling both exhilarated and like I needed a shower. Of course, that was the power of Stanley Kubrick's work, never to let you rest on one emotion.<br/><br/>I hardly know where to begin in describing this film.  I won't give anything away, I promise.  I heard and read the adjective ""sexy"" a lot referring to this movie.  First of all, it is sexy, but I think we must clarify the term. This film is not sexy in the normal sense, but sexy in a desperate and, sometimes, dirty way.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a knock.  This movie shows us that sexy is not always defined by ""Playboy"" and romance.  Sex can be good, bad, or indifferent.  The physical act of love is, and always has been, second fiddle to the emotional.  The emotion is one of the things that makes sex good, bad, or indifferent.  The sex in this movie is shows that even love needs a helping hand once in awhile.  Sex can be about love, heat, secrecy, money, physical need, sport, business, casualness, and hate.  It can fill the voids in our hearts that we leave open in anticipation and it can fill the voids left as gaping wounds from injury.  Whatever it may mean to you at any given time, you must still make a choice.  You don't have to seek sex, it can find you; and when it does, you must make a decision.  Is your need great enough?  Is your wound deep enough?  What about the consequences?  Are all, or any, of these things real or imagined.  Are you awake or asleep?  How are you coming to these decisions; in your conscious or unconscious mind?<br/><br/>There is a wise, old saying that applies to both men and women, but especially men:  Don't ask about her past because you DO NOT want to know. Cruise's character doesn't ask about his wife's past, she instead freely relates a fantasy.  This fantasy never occurred, and will never occur, according to her, but the more he thinks about it, the more it insinuates itself into his mind.  He is jealous, furiously jealous, of a fantasy. Why? Perhaps because the thought that your woman could find anything more appealing than you, even if only in her dreams, is a near-fatal blow the male ego.<br/><br/>The production values are outstanding.  Every scene is rich in color and detail, especially reds, green, and blues.  This and the atmosphere outside lead you to connect with the emotions of the characters.  The score could not be more simple, or effective.  If those two adjectives don't seem to go together, close your eyes and replay the ""Jaws"" theme in your head.  The piano punctuates most of the non-dialogue scenes and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Therein lies the power of Kubrick's work.  Who could have ever thought that the subjects of sex and jealousy could be filmed and presented in such a way as to create a suspense thriller?  That is, without reducing itself to the violence of, say, ""Basic Instinct.""<br/><br/>The movie is rather long (approx. 2 1/2 hrs.), but the story will pick you up and carry you along.  I was aware, during the movie, that I knew I had been in the theatre a long time, I was aware of the passage of time.  It didn't distract me, though.  I was pulled in and held tight.  That's the true test of suspense.  Like all Kubrick films, you have to pay attention. If this is not a selling point for you, then perhaps you should see something else.  If, however, you want something to wash the bad taste of ""Wild, Wild West"" out of your mouth and relish in something that challenges, as well as surprises you, then have a great time at ""Eyes Wide Shut""!!!!!"

Cruise is impotent through most if not all of the movie, and engages the audience in the titillation of seeing but not touching that characterizes American attitudes toward sex.  He tries to play the hero but cannot, and only Kidman's character (and Pollack's, if we trust him) recognizes the warts on the face of the all-American boy.  Risky business, indeed!  Characters develop and grow deeper and more human before our eyes, amply justifying the danse macabre pace.

","My sister-in-law rates movies by how many times she looks at her watch. For me ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was a three-watcher. The movie starts abruptly with a full length shot of Nicole Kidman (Mrs. Tom Cruise) fully undressed--definitely an attention-getter. In fact, the lure of seeing the beautiful Ms. Kidman was a big reason to see the film--and ultimately also a reason not to see it. It's too late to tell Stanley Kubrick (he died earlier this year), but reality doesn't necessarily translate into art. And there is entirely too much reality in this film when it comes to seeing Kidman. We see her using the toilet then wiping herself; later she applies her deodorant and smells her armpits. What is this fascination with bathroom activities? Enough already! THIS IS NOT NECESSARY! THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINING! Additionally, we see Kidman stoned on pot and smoking cigarettes. I know this movie is intended for adult audiences, but many youths will sneak in to see it and her actions are definitely not good role modeling. <br/><br/>Perhaps the movie's greatest fault is that it is boring. Yes, BORING! I never thought a film by Kubrick, director of such classics as ""Paths of Glory,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,""""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining"" could make a boring movie. Not only boring but pointless, ponderous, circuitous, confusing, unbelievable and stupid. By now you've guessed I didn't like it.<br/><br/>
For years audiences have speculated about the potentially magnificent eroticism of a big-budget Hollywood porno movie with beautiful Oscar-caliber actors. Actors don't get more beautiful and handsome than Kidman and Cruise. And who better to direct such an experiment than Kubrick, whose work on ""A Clockwork Orange"" was stunning and shocking? Alas, ""Eyes"" disappoints. No eroticism and very little shock value (especially since the sexual couplings in the big orgy scene were effectively eliminated when Warner Bros. re-edited the film by placing digital actors in front of the live ones). <br/><br/>For the life of me, I can't figure out what the heck Kubrick was doing during the unusually-long two-year shooting schedule with Cruise and Kidman. Was he rehearsing the love scenes as part of a dirty old man's fantasy (his perfectionism is legendary)? Whatever he was doing certainly didn't show up on the screen, produce great acting performances or add to his legacy.<br/><br/>
Perhaps the fault lies with the screenplay. It provides no insight into the themes of sexual obsession and jealousy. Much of the dialogue is trite and uninspired (""OK, I'm going to be frank with you""). And the discussions between Cruise and Kidman about the nature of love and relationships fail to surpass the level of profundity found on an above-average television sitcom like ""Friends."""

The hype surrounding EYES WIDE SHUT and the irony of Kubrick's death before the movie even came close to opening brought out the butterflies in my stomach as I walked to the box office and purchased my ticket. I even had to wait a week after it came out to go so that I could see it with my girlfriend who couldn't go see it with me the week before. We wanted to tickle our imaginations by seeing Kubrick's ""final masterpiece"". I walked out of the theater utterly disappointed. I like movies with intellectual stimulation. Movies that don't impress the viewer with computerized special effects (the Mummy) or gross-out comedy (There's something about mary) though those movies can be really great to see once...I like movies that become better and better every time you see them and leave you walking out of the theater thinking about the story.<br/><br/>EYES WIDE SHUT left me walking out of the theater saying...what just happened. I've concluded...nothing. Nothing happened. This movie tried to create a complex web of internal angst but it was only confusion. Tom Cruise gets mad at his wife for having fantasies so he walks the streets for 2 days, shell out about $1000 loosely, doesn't take advantage of the two opportunities to get back at his wife which is his mission in the first place. He stumbles across a nightmarish orgy which is totally unrealistic and a complete a completely opposite turn from the way this movie was going. The orgy seemed to pose a threat to him and his family but near the end we find out that it was only to scare him into staying quiet.<br/><br/>When all is said in done, nothing had happened. This movie fired blanks! I waited the entire movie for a plot and it just wasn't there. The sexual content of this movie was used in excess. Sex was everywhere and in such unusual and degrading forms that it made 'making love' look like a thing of the past. The closing line by nicole kidman ""we have to do something we haven't done in a while...f**k"" left me totally hating this movie. Even sex with his own wife is considered animalistic and degrading.<br/><br/>EYES WIDE SHUT did not deliver at all. In the end, everything was the same as it was at the beginning except that tom and nicole (bill and alice) had a marriage that was even rockier than in the beginning. This movie had a chance to be great but failed dismally...a little bit of it was enjoyable but for the most part, if I wanted to spend 2 1/2 hours watching nothing happen, I'd watch paint dry!"

","The storyline of this movie comes out of no where and hits you like a mack truck!  The whole 2 hours and 40 minutes of this movie has you constantly questioning what you are actually seeing on the screen.  Both Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise are excellent in the portrayal of their characters, no two could have done the job better!  A must see!"
"Plectrum-2","4","0","0","26 July 1999"," A fitting final chapter indeed
","EYES WIDE SHUT is a fitting final chapter to the Kubrick filmography, a beautifully crafted, sleekly designed piece of cinema that is ultimately overwhelmed by its faults. Nicole Kidman, while stunningly photographed, has too much screen time.  Think of it this way: to have the screen is to have the film.  Quite a few people now expect to see her onscreen longer than Gwyneth Paltrow was in SEVEN (a better take on much the same subject, with more at stake), even though this is essentially the same role.  But this is not her film. Tom Cruise is uncomfortably out of his realm here.  Not uncomfortable performance-wise--he did his best work since BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY--but he's not as believable as Tom Hanks or Cuba Gooding Jr. (the best part of INSTINCT) would be here: imagine them falling from grace!  Even Kubrick's original choice, Steve Martin, would have handled the ambiguity and quirks of fate that EYES dishes out with the tenuous restraint and explosive collapse that was needed, and still be able to establish empathy with the audience.  In what could have been his VERTIGO, Cruise instead rises to high emotions too soon, especially in a movie that screams ""languorous."" Which leads to pacing.  The strength of Kubrick movies such as 2001, THE SHINING and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is the length of takes, allowing the story to develop before your eyes.  But that is the weakness of a movie set in New York--a place where the speed of light isn't fast enough.  There are some beautiful moments captured here off the streets--the dreamy orgy scene is fabulously decadent--but the long takes in the middle of the City That Never Sleeps are not true to the setting, ironically the filmmaker's beloved hometown. There are bright spots: Sydney Pollack ratchets the ambiguity level higher, Rade Serbedzija is a twisted masterpiece, Leelee Sobieski is a blackened cherub and Alan Cumming is outright comic perfection.  But there are too many misses for each of these hits. I would recommend this film to those who enjoy playing ""what if,"" for if there's nothing else to be said of Kubrick's films, including EYES WIDE SHUT, they were meant to be talked about. <br/><br/>Too bad"

","I had wanted to see ""Eyes Wide Shut"" ever since I saw the first advertisement.  My main reason for wanting to see the movie was curiosity. The movie trailer didn't give you much of an idea of what the movie was about. I am sorry to say that I left the theater a little disappointed.<br/><br/>In my movie watching experience I have noticed that some of the movies that get the most promotion and hype don't live up to their praise.  I wouldn't say that it was a bad movie but, it was lacking in something.  Something I am unsure of.  The beginning was slow and it wasn't until about the middle that my attention was caught.  It is hard to describe with out giving away some of the movie but it was just ""strange."" I can't think of any other words to describe it.  The end also left me unsure of what had happened in the movie.  They never fully explained the main incident in the movie.  I like closure when I see a movie.  Even movies that you know will have a sequel have closure.  <br/><br/>But I do agree with a fellow critic.  The music was well chosen and adds to the mystery and intrigue of the plot.  All in all ""Eyes Wide Shut"" wasn't a favorite for me but I don't discourage anyone from seeing it.  For those who like abstract movies that leave you to do the figuring out, you will enjoy it.  At times the nudity and sexuality is somewhat graphic and revealing. So for those who prefer not to see such things I discourage you from going. To each his own. :-)"
"Boyd-8","Null","0","0","25 July 1999"," Kubrick's new movie filled with great little moments...
","I just got back from seeing ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  I'm haunted by the movie in the same way I was haunted by ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  Whereas I felt ""The Shining"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" were great flicks, I was happy to see that  ""Eyes"" reminded me most of ""Clockwork""...with its surrealistic qualities bolstered by various classical compositions one would normally consider proper and non-surreal.   With ""Clockwork"", he gave a whole new meaning to popular classics like ""Beethoven's 9th"" and ""Singin' In the Rain"", associating cruel and sadistic violence with wonderful, cheery music.  Here, he does it again. <br/><br/>
Oddly enough, what I loved most about this film is the Shostakovich waltz that was played earlier in the film and in the final credits...it was a lilting little tune that intensified the madness on the screen with its deliberate innocence.  And, more importantly, it was Kubrick at his best again, making movies in his own eccentric style and with no compromises. (Believe it or not, I actually predicted early in the film that Kubrick would use this tune for his end credits...and I was right!  I like to think I have a connection with Stanley.)<br/><br/>Another scene that I liked and that I thought evoked Kubrick's style is the scene where the old man drives to the front gate of the mansion where the orgy was held, and hands Tom Cruise the note.  When the old man gets out of his car and walks to the gate, I was instantly reminded of the aging Keir Dullea character at the end of ""2001"", walking across the floor to see who's looking at him from behind.  The reason I was reminded of this is that, for one, the actor looked a lot like Dullea from a distance.  Also, it was the same type of deliberate walk that Dullea made in ""Odyssey"".  (Kubrick's actors all seem to have certain looks and mannerisms about them, although one look that I was waiting to see and didn't was the ever-menacing downward-tilted-head-with-eyes-looking-directly-up-at-the-camera.  No matter.  He must have decided to give it up.  All of you Kubrick fans know what I'm talking about.)  Kubrick shined through brilliantly in the segment at the gate, as he did in all of the other segments of the film.  Little moments like these make it all worthwhile for me, and this movie is his best since ""Clockwork"".  I am sad that this is the last Kubrick film that will ever be made.<br/><br/>I have to stress one point, however, that cannot be overlooked.  I have a problem with the digital enhancements that apparently took place during the orgy.  I have to believe that Kubrick would not have let the studio talk him into censuring his film with artificial footage in order to save us from actually seeing female private parts.  It is an essentially non-Kubrickian philosophy.  However, I have read where he tentatively agreed to it before he died.  Hopefully so, because I would hate to think I'm watching a film that was butchered after he died and ultimately against his wishes. <br/><br/>
That said, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is an experience I won't soon forget, and I'll need to see it more and more times to get all I can out of it.   Great film, Stanley."

"DuChamp-3","Null","0","0","25 July 1999"," a challenge to the audience
","Stanley Kubrick made films that proved opinions about people and society. He proved that we are: Self-destructive buffoons (Strangelove), Arrogant (2001), Vicious and Unrepentant (Clockwork), Fragile and Destructive(Shining), Cowards and Ugly Heroes(Full Metal.) Seems many have walked into Eyes Wide Shut thinking this is the film where he shows us how Horny we are.  I'm afraid not.  This is a movie about how Selfish we are. The film is a stew of  honesty, lies, dream and reality  - and how each can intermingle and mix - and ultimately, that it may not matter which is which. In his final statement as an artist, Kubrick made a movie that does not pander to the audience. Many moral lines are drawn and erased in this film, and there are no moments of clarity where you have no question what to feel. Or what the director intends.  Movies are a massive tool of manipulation, and in this film, Kubrick doesn't tell us how to feel - he asks us to figure that out. This film is incredibly beautiful.  Its motion flows.  Brightly-lit colors and shadows are used for great emotional effect. Compositions are near-perfect.  It's visually amazing in the most subtle way.  It's rare to find a major motion picture that is as reluctant to loudly define itself to the audience as EWS is.  Tom and Nicole impressed the hell out of me. Through Kubrick's lense, Cruise is neither as handsome nor as strong as we remember him.  Kidman is the opposite - never more perfect, sometimes to the detriment of her character's likability.  I have no doubt that was intentional - there was nothing this director did that wasn't, for good or ill.   Accusations have been made that there is a lack of intimacy and chemistry between the married actors.  They have the chemistry of two people who were once very close, who think they know the other very well, but have driven each other away.  The characters have a clinical distance between them, even in ""love-making"".  This could easily be mistaken on the surface for ""lack of chemistry"".  It's a subtle distinction some audience members may not have the patience to find. Unlike Kubrick other films, this film casts little satire or moral judgement on its characters or the audience. I'm not sure yet whether I enjoyed this film.  At times, it is meandering and confusing.  It forces you to either pay close attention or get bored.  I obviously respect it.  The fact that I'm still trying to determine my opinion 24 hours later says a lot about this film."
"GV-2","Null","0","0","25 July 1999"," Interminable, pretentious nonsense from a spent director.
","Never has the gulf between a film's hype and its reality been greater. This would have been a guaranteed straight-to-video dud had it not also been newsworthy as Kubrick's last film, conceived and completed in pointless secrecy. Marketed as an intellectual sex romp it is as dumb as it is unerotic. It resembles nothing so much as a 60s porn movie without the porn sequences...which just leaves the wooden linking dialogue and static dramatic interludes that go nowhere. The movie's only real treasure is Tom Cruise's sensationally bad performance, all hesitation, long pauses and pained expressions. He was never worse and probably never will be, but this is surely the performance he will never live down. Summarising the plot is unnecessary: all you need to know is that it starts badly, gets worse and only when you are feeling a lot older does it finally end, abruptly and - appropriately - with an anticlimax."

","When I first saw Eyes Wide shut I didn't really know what to think, but looking back I think it was an interesting and an exciting film to watch. It really includes all the elements that make a film or book exciting to watch: love, sex, adultery, mystery, murder.  I can remember the theater that I was had a problem with the film in the middle and I was upset because I was anxious to know where it was going.<br/><br/>But I think because of the sexual controversy people miss the point of the film.  I think that it is proves a great point about how people don't always know everything about the ones they love, the people they know, or the world that exists around them.<br/><br/>I also thought the music within the movie, just adds to the suspense as Cruise finds himself getting deeper and deeper into unchartered territory."

","The viewer is taken on a time compressed journey that is fueled by a need for spontaneity that seems to come from the protagonist's emotional trauma of hearing that his wife has positively considered the idea of being unfaithful. This young couple lives a well planned life that sacrifices impulse behavior for success. When the foundation of their marriage is rocked by the wife's admission of desired infidelity that she has kept secret, our young doctor is thrown into a tailspin that necessitates retaliation and impulse behavior of his own.<br/><br/>The journey is pure Kubrick, with each scene a vignette that is thematically connected and part of the superstructure of a story that itself is like a garden in Kubrick's country of choice.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's face has never been used as expressively as it is used in this piece. Nicole Kidmann's body has never been used to such effect as it is used here.

It's not hard to picture Kubrick shooting and reshooting scenes time after time, in order to capture just the right angle, just the right shadow, just the right expression. <br/><br/>I was captivated from the start by this story which plunges the very depths of human sexuality, yet makes a strong statement for marriage and family as being the genuine answer to the more base and carnal lusts within us all. <br/><br/>I looked at my wife at one point, and she had her hands over her ears as the piano played (you'll understand when you see it). Kubrick's use of imagery and music to torture while informing his viewer had me on the edge of my seat for the entire movie.

I am aware of Stanley Kubrick's unique style of film making and perhaps that is why I feel that only true fans of the mastermind will appreciate his final work.  I came out of the film with more questions than reasonable comments.  I do not see why this film took three years to make and why it was kept so tightly under wraps.

","Eyes wide shut is the kind of movie that is made for discussing. I watched it in a nearly deserted theater and halfway through the film some people were starting to joke and laugh due to loss of interest while others (myself included) continued to watch with no little interest. Some of the comments overheard were ""what the hell was that?"" and ""magnificent...""<br/><br/>A lush, visual movie filmed in amber and golden tones with a dark background, much like the plot itself: set in beautiful magnificent scenery, while darkly brooding, corrupt characters dance about.<br/><br/>Are our dreams less important than our actions? Can  anyone have a meaningful relationship in today's society? If you have thought and fantasized of being unfaithful instead of actually trying to be unfaithful are you less accountable for your actions?<br/><br/>These are some of the questions Eyes Wide Shut asks. And in true Kubrik fashion those questions linger long after the movie is over. That is the true importance of this movie and what gives it its appeal: it has substance along with aesthetics while many other art house movies (which eyes wide shut is no matter how comercialized WB tries to make it) offer a pretty package with no gift inside.<br/><br/>On the subject of acting, I think it was quite appropriate for the movie, Cruise delivered his lines like Kubrik intended them. He's the kind of director that you either do it the right way or its the highway. The whole movie is played out like a slow deliberate theater play which ties in with some of the movies imagery concerning charades and masks.<br/><br/>And finally this movie is unapologetically erotic and there is one particular scene were WB used digital characters to cover some actions that would have made the movie NC17, I think this was in poor taste.

The only difference is that since the video didn't have Kubrick's name in the credits, people would have laughed at Abdul's similar failure at sensuality, which was shot a decade ago.  Other ridiculous elements in this film include the irritating score which fails at creating suspense by constantly hitting one piano key; a hilarious recreation of New York City -- everyone has British accents and one street corner had three U.S. post boxes; and a child who's character seems to serve no purpose but to poorly act."

Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman did not impress me with their acting ability, but the movie was a very thought provoking and intriguing look into what seems to be a happy marriage. Stanley Kubrick in his typical shocking style used excessive nudity, and an annoying series of piano strokes that did not bear any semblance to music. A further note on the movie soundtrack was the disappointing lack of one. The trailer used an appropriate blues song, which was cut extremely short in the movie leaving the viewer wanting more.

If this movie were made in the sixties, I'm sure it would have caused quite a stir, but not now.<br/><br/>As far as the pacing goes, the late Mr. Kubrick tries so hard to create tension with how the timing runs, but instead it left this viewer wanting to shout at the screen, ""Act faster!"".  The dialog was delivered slowly, endless scenes of Tom walking around the city slowly, people staring at each other for interminable amounts of time... I was literally yawning thirty minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>The only reason to see this movie is for the beautiful naked bodies. Trust me, however, that is a very compelling reason to see it!  Nicole Kidman looks as good as I imagined she would (keep your eyes open for the two dimples on her back, worth the $7.50 right there!), and the rest of the cast were just as easy on the eyes.<br/><br/>Overall, unless you have a burning desire to see Nicole Kidman nude 15 feet tall in front of you, wait for the video."

","Wow! Truly a must see! Kubrick's final film delivers an amazingly emotional and psychological experience unlike any film to date. At first glance, the simple plot and lack of dialogue appear to make for a pretty dry movie. Kubrick though, true to form, teases, prods and uneases his viewers through an unbelievably perfect ballet of sight and sound. At some points in the film, the music rips at your nerves with merely a few keys on the piano. At others the music provides an eerie subtlety to the immoral chagrin forced upon the viewer by Kubrick's intense visuals. The dialogue, though scarce, follows the music and imagery in that the viewer becomes entirely enveloped in the emotions that the carefully chosen discourse drags them through, especially during Kidman's monologues. Conversely, Cruise portrays his intensity through painful facial expressions and tortured demeanor. Both hollywood superstars gave an amazing, unique performance, even though this is not a hollywood picture. This is not a Tom Cruise film. This is not a Nicole Kidman film.

","Like any serious student of film for me ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was easily the most anticipated film of the year and maybe the decade. Stanley Kubrick directed my favorite film of all-time, ""2001"", another Top 10, ""A Clockwork Orange"", and all-time classics, ""Dr.Strangelove..."", ""Paths Of Glory"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"". But alas EWS falls far short of those dizzying high points. It begins brilliantly with a fascinating and dreamy party where the psycho-sexual landscape is set up as precisely as a chessboard and the play is engaged between Dr. Harford and his wife Alice. The opening moves are typical Kubrick and therefore masterful, but then it devolves into a game I really didn't care about. The much talked about orgy scene looks like it came from Red Shoes Diaries. There are some great looking bodies in it (even in the altered US version --which is another story in itself), but what was intended to be shocking was less adventurous than things we've seen on HBO's Real Sex series. I didn't care about Harford and his wife. Tom Cruise does well with what he can in his role but like most of Kubrick's main characters he is an icon rather than a real person. Stanley has gotten away with this more than any other director in history, but here it doesn't work. Nicole Kidman is the best thing about the movie but she dissappears in the second half of it except to come on in time to utter what will go down as one of the most memorable closing lines ever. Kubrick's death is a huge loss for film and filmgoers. His passing hit me harder far more than Di, JFK Jr. and John Lennon, but it doesn't make EWS more than a better than average movie. I would've love to have seen AI."

Though perhaps not Kubrick's greatest film (I've always been partial to 2001 and Strangelove), it would be a lifetime achievement for most other directors. I can see where this film might not appeal to many people under 40 -- it is quite simply that ""adult"" in the true meaning of the word.  The movie nearly begs for previous life experience to understand it on a psychological level. And it is SO Creepy.  That surprised me more than anything, though maybe it shouldn't have.

","In Stanley Kubrick's last picture he takes us not to the deep reaches of the cosmos or to the depths of madness on a battlefield but to a more familiar and common ground, love. People say this film is about jealousy and sex. But really what Kubrick does in this film is amazing, he goes were he has never ventured before. Instead of his usual themes he goes to a more subtile and personal story. He of course would never let you know that by just seeing the trailer, like most Hollywood films do by revealing the important plot points through the trailor. No not Kubrick, he treats his audience with more respect and admiration than Hollywood does with their ridiculously easy to figure out movies cramming the story down our collective throats with big block letters. Kubrick's strong suit has always been his photography and Eyes dosen't disappoint. The rich light emanating from the opening party sequence only gets better as the film follows Cruises character through a mysterious world where he goes from strange to stranger and finally to glorious weirdness that only Kubrick could make so inviting to the eyes. Aside from the flawless cinematograghy is the intriguing story. It always has you guessing what will happen next? A master of modern cinema has brought us a brave and ultimately rewarding film that only Stanley Kubrick can deliver to our eyes."

Kidman is reduced to a couple of good scenes but little screen time (and almost no screen time when she isn't on display); Cruise just walks around looking perplexed.  Of course it LOOKS great; it was shot by Stanley Kubrick.  But after so many significant films, it's sad he ends his career with this minor piece of fluff.

","Eyes Wide Shut is not a movie for everybody. You will either be repulsed or intrigued by its icy exploration of the psychology of sex. There is little middle ground. The movie deals with raw sexual emotions that most people experience but do not want to face. For that it should be praised. It's an adult film dealing with an adult topic, and that is rare in this day and age. In many ways I wish it was rated NC-17; it would label it a serious movie.<br/><br/>This movie will be the start for many interesting conversations as movie goers head home. That said, be sure you watch this movie with people you are comfortable talking about sex -- not just locker room talk but real conversations about your sexual desires. This probably isn't a great movie to see with someone you are just starting to date or someone you are just starting to have sex with unless you are ready to deal with some pretty heavy issues.<br/><br/>One negative comment... for such a high-profile movie, the numerous editing errors surprised me. I know Kubrick died before he could refine some of the shot sequences, but the errors were pretty noticeable in many cases."
"Yankee-3","8","0","0","21 July 1999"," Gripping
","It's not really a movie you enjoy;  it's more a movie you experience.<br/><br/>First of all, it definitely should have been NC-17, with or without the digital figures blocking out all the serious sexual activity. The orgy scene is still incredibly adult, and it is still clear what is going on. Parents who take their kids to it are out of their minds.<br/><br/>The acting, directing, and other production values are excellent. Cruise has less emoting to do than Kidman, so it is a little easier to notice her performance, but his is remarkable in its own, subtle way. I've never seen a Kubrick movie before, but I understand he has a history of using long shots and pauses to achieve creepiness, and this is no exception. Color, music, and even extras are all used to emotional effect. For instance, fewer and fewer extras on the city streets as the movie continues and Bill finds fewer and fewer of the people he encounters are so innocent as they seem.<br/><br/>As for the plot, well, I can't exactly say I liked it, because that would imply the movie was a cheerful experience, and it was not. However, I did find it gripping and well-executed up until the end, at which point Sidney Pollack's character explained too much. It would have been better for him to throw Tom a few cryptic lines, leaving him and the intelligent viewer to figure it out for themselves. I already knew everything Sid said in that scene--the only real revelation he provided had more to do with Tom's response to everything. All in all, though, there was much humor, plenty of nice touches, and even a few understated running jokes.<br/><br/>
I think the bottom line is whether the themes and their depiction work for you or not. They worked for me. The movie reminded me of the Hawthorne story ""Young Goodman Brown"" with a few touches of ""Caligula"" thrown in. I spent $8.50 to see it and I don't feel shafted--what more can one say?"

After all the hype, after all the so-called suspense, it ultimately falls flat, much like an unfulfilling sexual encounter. The pacing is slow enough to be almost non-existent, we see nothing new from the actors,  and The Director's cold,sterile approach to humanity finally wears so thin that you can see right through it. The lighting scheme is right out of Dick Tracy with its obsessive primary colors, and the irrelevant blind alleys in the plot make Twin Peaks seem coherent. Even the minimalist soundtrack offers no escape from the mundaneness. As for the ironic title, it's unintentionally appropriate, in an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" kind of way."

This is a movie about trust, betrayal, jealousy, curiosity, all feeling that most people have experienced which is why this movie can hit so dangerously close to home.

Alan Cumming in particular was adorable and funny as the gay desk clerk obviously interested in Cruise."
"Hamlet23","10","0","0","21 July 1999"," Amazing. Absolutely amazing.
","This movie may well be Stanley Kubrick's best.  Like his other movies -- maybe even more so -- this one is a diamond, and Kubrick wore the jeweler's glass. Every facet, every detail seems to have been considered and carefully calculated.  The colors and the sets -- both of which are incredible -- stand out in this regard.  Each one means something and expresses it.  The score is the same way -- to me, it surpasses even the Psycho score in its contribution to the more frightening moments of the movie.  Towards the end of the film -- at the climax, in fact, when I should have been used to it -- I jumped at those piano shrieks.  Twice.  When this movie decided to be scary, it was the most scary and disturbing movie I have ever seen. The sex in this movie -- though I think it is a study of sex -- is of secondary note.  This is not a porno, and the sex in it is not steamy or sexual.  Most of it is downright eerie. If this movie does not win at least two Oscars -- Best Picture and Best Director (neither of which a Kubrick film has ever won, much to my astonishment) -- I will never pay attention to the academy again, because this will be final proof that it has no taste.  Also, I have learned two things about the censoring of this picture: (1) Kubrick realized that he would have to add the digital characters to get an R rating, and planned to do so.  Though they were added after he died, it was according to his wishes, and (2) I didn't even notice the digitally added characters. They affected the movie or the scene in no way at all.  Though the MPAA are Puritannical Retards, and I am disappointed that I live in the only country in the world that made him add these things, even the MPAA could not damage Kubrick's work.  Besides, I am sure that an NC-17 version will at least come out on video, and that will settle that. This final film -- most aptly described by Janet Maslin as ""haunting"" -- gets an 11 from me.  Kubrick was entirely in a class by himself.  The film is forever diminished by his loss, but at least he left us with a collection of movies to watch in awe forever.  Eyes Wide Shut is definitely a worthy addition to this collection.  Thank you, Stanley."

Kubrick left us with a triumphant, brilliant, provocative movie deserving not only high praise, but serious, ruminative thought by all those who see it.<br/><br/>There are other fine films with excellent acting, strong scripts and magnificent direction which cannot raise in me the ardor of ""Eyes."" It is the manifold layered complexity of this movie, the interwoven nuance, which I find so compelling.<br/><br/>The title ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not only a telling description of the protagonists' condition - it is also a taunt to moviegoers too meek or superficially inclined to open their irises and observe what is really going in this film.<br/><br/>The movie begins in the cut-and-dry, black and white world of ""reality"" (which is really just an idealized dream) and progresses into the many-hued surreality of what is, in actuality, reality (hmmm). Directing one's attention to Kubrick's use of the colors red and blue (and the rainbow interposed betwixt these spectral limits) yields important clues to the film's content.<br/><br/>When Bill enters the rainbow (escorted into it by those catty red and blue cloaked models) he begins, slowly by slowly, to open his eyes. Things are no longer what they seem. His close friend reveals himself to be a wanton profligate, a beautiful woman, in a state of drug-induced catatonia, seems endeavored to pursue her own destruction, and his own wife of nine years admits to being beset by a gnawing extramarital desire.<br/><br/>Frightened and somewhat naive, Bill bumbles and stumbles into the rainbow. Here begins to see clearly, for the first time, death, destruction, evil and the superposition of ironic extremes - in other words the chromatic dissonance of human reality.<br/><br/>Through the misadventures of everyman Bill Harford, Kubrick's dazzlingly rendered rainbow challenges viewers to unmask and examine their own obscured  desires, and through this process, to keep their eyes wide open."

","Kubrick has delivered again and as fate would have it for the last time. I was very anxious to see Eyes Wide Shut but at the same time I knew I had to be patient when the movie began. All of Kubrick's movies require you to watch patiently until the credits roll for you to truly get a feel for what you have just witnessed. Eyes Wide Shut falls right in line with this style. The light he uses is very similar to what Scorsese used in many of the scenes in Casino. This gave the film a visual painting of characters and added so much life and emotion to scenes that would have been empty without it. The films drips of the subtle daring side of sex. You can also feel a real sense of a foreplay effect that the movie emotes to the audience. Almost every scene involving sex in some way felt like Kubrick was tempting the audience slowly and deliberately with a hint of danger and then yanking it away. Watching Cruise go through this ritual of sticking his hand close to the fire and pulling it away was done to perfection. Kidman's role was less than I expected but she did a grand job of pushing Cruise to seek pleasure because of jealousy, but at what cost? Famous orgy scene was hypnotic, dark, mid evil and very dreamlike. Why not just go for the NC-17 is the question everybody keeps asking. What normal parent is going to bring their kid to see this movie? I would have rather seen it in its purist form but it didn't make as much of a difference as I felt was present with the two versions of Basic Instinct (You know what is going on behind the digital characters!). Two things to remember. Approach with a patient attitude, this isn't Rambo you're going to see. Last thing watch out for the ending it comes real quick and if you blink you might miss the last line which is perfect. Rest in peace Stanley and thanks for great movies that will go on forever!!"
"Cru3","Null","0","0","16 July 1999"," A film that works a dark little spell on its audience
","Stanley Kubrick's final film is a fitting close to a director whose career was based on creating films that stepped out of the norm and treated their audiences in an intelligent fashion. The Kubrick trademarks - lush, long tracking shots; cavernous sets; and extended sequences without dialogue where the story unfolds and advances as a visual exposition - are all here, and so absolutely refreshing to see in a day and age where directors feel the need to make a cut every few seconds to supposedly satisfy short attention spans.<br/><br/>Casting Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, arguably the industry's most beautiful couple...as beautiful young professionals whose marriage is about to turn a corner into darker territory...is brilliance in itself, and they handle their roles with both honesty and bravery.  Kidman's is the more openly emotional of the two roles, whereas Cruise is required to reflect his increasingly troubled psyche in a largely internal manor.  Kubrick pairs the audience with Cruise on his nocturnal odyssey and allows them to know only as much as he knows, and as his character strays further from his marriage, we're the voyeurs with him all the way.<br/><br/>Sydney Pollack also deserves credit for his performance in the film; it's a finely tuned, unusual characterization of a man with more money than morals. He only pops up in films as an actor once in a blue moon, but he certainly makes it worthwhile.<br/><br/>Richly composed and a joy to watch, ""Eyes"" is the best film to have come out this summer, and a reminder of just how much Stanley Kubrick will be missed."

","This film is certainly not a masterpiece.  Nevertheless, it's not terrible. It's a long and slow-moving film.  As a result, I felt sleepy while watching this film.  But the film was OK.  I don't really understand what Stanley Kubrick was trying to get across with this film.  This is an erotica film, and it's basically all about Tom Cruise's character (I originally thought that the film was going to be more about Nicole's character).  I liked Tom's performance in this film.  I like the way that his character evolves. However, I really was not impressed by Nicole's performance--in fact, there was nothing impressive about the character itself.  At first she's drunk, then she's high, then she's sitting in their nice Central Park West apartment.  In most of those scenes, she shows her naked body.  I didn't like the interruption of the scene where Nicole and Tom are kissing in front of a mirror: during the scene you hear Chris Isaak's song, only to have that scene automatically interrupted and the song replaced with classical music. Another thing I didn't like was the grainy aspect of the film--what was the point of that???  Perhaps what really hurt the film more than anything else was the ending--a disappointing ending that'll make you say ""that's it???"" On another note, I thought that the orgy scene was done really well.  The orgy scene was the best scene in the movie--not for its content, but because it was done in a stunning way.  However, censorship destroyed the orgy scene (computer generated ""people"" were put in to block the sexual acts taking place in the scene).  Overall this film is, like I said, OK.  Some people say that Kubrick films require repeated viewings to really appreciate and ""understand"" the films.  But with this one, seeing it once is just fine."

","Eyes Wide Shut is an excellent example of complex, multi-layered film making at its best. It is a tragedy for his voice to be silenced with so much left to be said. Not a ""chick-flick"" a ""date-flick"" or for that matter a ""guy-flick"", the subject matter is deadly earnest and stirs very primal emotions. Starting with a simple confession of a fantasy unfullfilled, Tom Cruise's characters takes a head first spin into a wonderland gone awry (a coincidence that his wife's name is Alice?) and runs, rather than walks to the abyss only to return closer and closer until his own fantasies, mixed with the bizarre surroundings nearly consume him. It is extraordinary the way that Kubrick was able to spin this story into one of great suspense. Although reminiscent of Scorsese's ""After Hours"", the film seeps into a genre all its own. Since it appears to be an essential part of seeing a Kubrick film, after film discussions could easily dredge up similar consequences as happens in the film. The meticulous attention to detail that hallmarks every Kubrick film is here...and then some with the best set decorations that I've seen in years. Acting is top notch especially Nicole Kidman and Sidney Pollack. Due to Tom Cruise's type casting as a cocky-hip urbanite, it's difficult to see past this. Although awards for this film will be scance due to its subject matter (as with Boogie Nights) this is a must-see film by anyone who adores rich full cinema."

My only complaint is the casting of Tom Cruise.  He seems sorely out of place in a Kubrick film.  Most actors seem to blend quite well into the ""Kubrick-world,"" but he sticks out terribly and I never truly believed his performance.  That aside, I enjoyed this film tremendously.

He could have shown what happens when a married couple indulges in their fantasies to the point of their personal and professional destruction but he chose the safe route of having the woman's fantasy simply being that and having the male character wander the streets searching for what? I still don't know because he didn't do anything.<br/><br/>As far as the mansion was concerned nothing illegal was going on that any threats were nessesary, so that part of the story didn't ring true.

","Kubrick's final movie wasn't perfect, but it was a good entertainment, and it made me think.  Although by now the plot is well known, I will suggest that in viewing it you could be aware of a few things:  1) The movie is a symbolic journey into the underworld, much as the travels of Orpheus into Hades to rescue his true love.  2)  All the women in the movie are a part of Dr. Hartford's wife.  3)  The movie is about jealousy, but it is mostly about how little we know of other people.  It's about how all we see are masks (looks for this), the tip of the iceburg of unconscious fantasy and desire.  It's about the trauma of sudden, unexpected revelation of sexual desire, a Freudian theme.  4)  Look for the use of color as a symbol of state of mind, of the use of intoxicants as a signal of changing state of being.  5)  Who is the inquisitor in the orgy scene, how does he relate to Lew, Dr. Hartford's friend?  In any case, the movie, like any good fiction, resists simple messages and morals.  The fun of it for me was to go and see it, which was an enjoyable 2.5 hours that passed too quickly (the movie is visually beautiful, as are Cruise and Kidman) and then have something interesting to puzzle over for a while.  By the way, the acting isn't at all as bad"

","While not his best film (my subjective view is that 2001 is his best ever), nor the best film all year (I'm wary of saying that, but I suspect THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT will be better), it will win Best Picture and Best Director next March, and at least grab nominations for Cruise and Kidman, if not net her the Oscar itself.<br/><br/>It's a smart, savvy film that makes its audience think. If you're looking for dumb entertainment, go see AUSTIN POWERS 2 (dull and a husk of the original movie); if you're looking for well-designed and implemented entertainment, go see STAR WARS (just remember it's the first two hours of a 14+ hour movie - any lack of plot or characterization is purposefully put in the movie and will be drawn out in the next two); if you're looking for art, go see EYES WIDE SHUT.<br/><br/>Almost any couple who's had strife in their relationship will see bits and pieces of themselves in the film.

"wally-55","7","0","0","20 July 1999"," A slow beginning, a beautiful middle, but a weak end
","This movie has the feel of not having been completed. There are sub-plots that seem to have been abandoned, questions brought up in the film that go unanswered, and editing that seems sloppy in some places while brilliant in others.<br/><br/>Some scenes, such as the one where Cruise walks into the room with the cloaked figures in a circle, seem vintage Kubrick. He captures a surreal view with perfect timing. Other scenes, though, seem poorly shot. The scene in which Kidman starts laughing and drops to the floor, then lays face down on the floor, then sets upright, then lays down again seems markedly ill shot. The camera is in for a close shot on her and follows her down to the floor, it then jerks back up when she sits up, and then follows her back to the floor again. This seems poor camera work. If she is going to flop up and down, the camera should have made a wide shot. If the scene called for a close up, it should have had a cut to Cruise interspersed to avoid having to jerk the camera down, up, and back down again. This was a bad enough shooting sequence that it stood out disturbingly in an otherwise excellent scene. I have seen amateurs with video cameras follow movement more smoothly.<br/><br/>The editing also seemed rushed. Several scenes seem to have the film footage of one scene just spliced right on to the end of the footage of the previous scene with no transition footage at all. This may be all right for music videos, but I would expect better editing in a feature film.<br/><br/>There are also several subplots that are introduced, developed, then simply dropped. Kidman's dance partner in the party segment has a lot of screen time invested in him with a commiserate interest by the viewer. What happened? This was far too much time to just set up Kidman's view on fidelity. The viewer expects something of this to come back, but nothing ever does. Cruise's pianist friend's fate is never disclosed. A simple call to the West coast would discover if he was sent home, murdered, disappeared, or something. Admittedly he was a minor character, but the audience has some time and interest invested in him and it would like to know his fate. Kubrick doesn't always give answers, but he does give enough information for the viewer to deduce what is going on. Not this time, though. The same could be said of the dead woman from the party. Murder, suicide, accident? Cruise's character is a doctor, it shouldn't be that hard to look for forensic evidence to discover the truth. But the movie is silent on this matter.<br/><br/>I have seen nearly all of Kubrick's movies, most of them several times, and this is by far the worst edited and constructed of them all. The subject matter may be in the mind of the characters and actual factual matters don't matter, but it is still disconcerting to the viewer. My personal opinion of this film is that Kubrick himself never finished it. The editing and scene selection seemed very inconsistent with any thing he had done before. The story line seems unfinished with loose ends dangling through out. I think what we have is three fourths of a Kubrick film and one fourth of something else. The recognizable Kubrick parts are brilliant in places, the rest is not."

","Eyes Wide Shut is a movie that keeps getting interesting without ever actually getting interesting.<br/><br/>Anticipation, titillation, innuendo, foreboding and foreshadowing pervade the film but I felt I never got the payoff that the story seemed to be promising.<br/><br/>Manhattan physician Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his beautiful wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) attend a Chistmas party where they both flirt with other people.<br/><br/>Discussing the party afterwards, Alice tells Bill about a chance encounter in their past that led her to fantasize about another man. This seems to upset Bill, and it sets him up to pursue an opportunity to attend a mysterious masked ball that involves a lot of beautiful naked women. If this sounds a bit confusing, well, it is.<br/><br/>For the life of me, I cannot imagine what director Stanley Kubrick (who also co-wrote the screenplay) was trying to say. I wonder if he knew. Eyes Wide Shut is pretty and sexy but utterly pointless. In the end it's not that you don't care what happened to the characters--you're not even sure WHAT happened to them.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that this is the same director who gave us The Killing, Dr. Strangelove, Lolita and 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br/><br/>If this this movie is Kubrick's epitaph, his life ended not with a bang, but a whimper."

","This movie was a tremendous pleasure to watch.  It took its time, set up the tensions and arguments with authority, and gave me a chance to feel those tensions along with Cruise's tortured character.  Kubrick did a marvelous job of re-creating Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle"" and, as he often has with other works, managed to improve upon it.  He gave us a portrait of a man who is following his strongest dreams-- the ones that show him what he cannot be.  Nicole Kidman was perfect as the doctor's wife.  Some critics have complained that she didn't get enough screen time.  I would say she had all she needed.  Every word she said cut Cruise deeply enough to keep him bleeding throughout the film.   I enjoyed the work immensely.  When the credits rolled, I was surprised to find that three hours had passed.<br/><br/>There are critics who have reported that the film wasn't as sexy or conventionally thrilling as they expected.  To them I would say ""Grow up."" This is a film that meditates on the meaning of fidelity to a man's nature. Why are we faithful?  What are we giving up when we turn away an offer from a stranger?    It will haunt and provoke for decades to come, long after Joe Eszterhas and Brian DePalma have faded from our memories.  If you want stroke material, there are movie houses that cater to that taste.

"filmict","9","0","0","19 July 1999"," Had different expectations
","Eyes started as a great film and had all the makings of another Kubrick masterpiece, but about halfway through the film, the film sort of changed directions and lost its way.  I guess what I expected from the film was an exploration of the relationship and deception between the couple after their experiences, both real and fantasized.  However, instead of doing that, Kubrick chose to divert the film into almost a suspense thriller.  That remains the biggest disappointment of the film.  You do not want Kubrick to waste his time (and now we will not see any new film from him) making a suspense thriller, and not a good one at that.  He could leave that genre up to the lesser directors.<br/><br/>In a film which is supposed to explore the relationship between a couple, one half of the couple, Nicole Kidman, was missing from most of the latter part of the film - except for two or three sequences - which was unfortunate, because she gave a much better performance than her husband. In my opinion, Tom Cruise was a miscast.  It is unfortunate Kubrick could not find anyone better to play Bill Harford.  If Stanley had not been such a recluse, maybe he would have found someone better, rather than rely on his agents.  One could not help notice how much time Tom spent with his face fully or partially - one can understand Kubrick directing him that way to hide the expressions, or the lack thereof, on Tom's face in critical situations.<br/><br/>Since he died after doing the first editing draft of the film, the editing also left a lot to be desired.  However, Kubrick's mastery of the art form shows through at many places.  The opening sequence is great, the cinematography, specially the use of colors to depict moods, was excellent. In the first half of the film till the scene of the orgy, you were never in doubt that this was a master at work."

It is a true disservice to everyone to call this film a masterpiece just due to the fact that the director died before it's release and it stars two supposedly good actors. Somehow I feel that the critics would not be so kind to this film if Mr Kubrick were alive today. The fact that Kubrick was an outcast is very obvious from this movie. None of the scenes ring true and the overall production is extremely (I mean EXTREMELY) boring. A visit to the dentist is more erotic and exciting then this film. I feel ashamed to have been taken in by the hype and false advertising and actually paid full price to see this supreme  dud. Are all the critics seeing a different movie then I am?? I wonder what the hoopla is about. Could it be the painful bad acting of everyone involved? (especially Cruise, Kidman, Pollock and Marie Richardson) The ludicrous and non sexy orgy scene, the absolutely pointless dragging on of scenes and about the worst music and dialogue every commited to film?

","Okay, so I am fairly dissappointed with IMDb's choice of critc reviews for this film.  It seems to be highly underrated.  Kubrick's genius when it comes to illustrating the darker side of human behavior, is interpreted as dehumanization, when it encompasses the essence of being human.  I would like to ask these critics what ""Mistakes"" this film is full of...Kubrick himself said ""Let the film speak for itself.""  This one does.  It is a fascinating journey, intertwining symbolism, vivid dream-like sequences, a high level of suspense and still maintains a very real message.  The importance of intimacy and communication in marriage would be the theme of Eyes, if you had to pick a theme.  Also is the question: Is fantasizing or thinking about cheating as bad as the act itself?  Or is it worse?  Kidman reaches into her backpack of films to pull out the most intense emotional performance of her life.  And Cruise fits this role like a glove.  His brooding sets the stage, as well as the mood, for the entire film.  Eyes has been added to my ""Greatest Movies Ever Made"" list."

His practice is successful and he and his wife get invited to a party in which they go their separate ways. Kindman does a great job as the doctor's wife who is also having sexual thoughts of her own.

It was stimulating sensually and intellectually.  I like Tom Cruise and look forward to his performances.  He's a very good actor.

That sounds like faint praise, but its not - these are more than solid performances. Elements of real sexism are few.  Both sexes are treated essentially as sex objects, although the women are much more often undressed - one female is nude throughout, but it is acceptable considering the circumstances.  The women are for the most part gorgeous.  This is Kubrick's best work since Clockwork Orange - better than The Shining or Full Metal Jacket.

What kind of sexploitation is Stanley Kubrick up to.  But this is not any director, this is Kubrick the master and there is method to his madness.  His last film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"",  follows the lineage of hyperbole and unconventional presentation that we remember so well from ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Clockwork Orange"" to ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" to ""Full Metal Jacket"".  Kubrick has fittingly chosen his finale to be, hold-on-to-your-hat,  positive on the institution of marriage, and he has chosen the hippest, most glamorous married movie couple to do his bidding, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.  How unpredictable but how well thought out. This is a slowly-evolving, long (almost three hours) but truly satisfying story of two people's quest for love and fidelity in today's society.  Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise), wife Alice (Nicole Kidman), and daughter Helena would seem to epitomize the successful family.  He, a medical doctor, with lots of money and patients in New York City; she the beautiful and loving wife and mother.  But as we learn from a Christmas party they attend, Dr. Bill is not above hitting on two lovely models and Alice, intoxicated with champagne, is easily seduced by a scoundrel on the dance floor who believes marriage to be an invention to lose one's virginity so that the woman can carry on affairs with whomever she pleases.  In a long and well-played scene that says a lot about how men feel about women and how women feel about men, Alice is irritated that her husband never gets jealous of her and confides to Bill that she romanticizes in dreams about an affair with a naval officer she briefly met last summer.  Infuriated, Bill proceeds to go out on the prowl late at night in New York City and has as much calamity as Griffin Dunne did in ""After Hours"". Women everywhere seem to have the hots for him and everyone tempts him in their own special way.  Kubrick is not above throwing in a male hotel clerk with much sexual innuendoes.  The most suspenseful and elaborate part of the film is the sexual ceremony in a secluded mansion that Bill innocently stumbles upon through a close friend. Comparisons are in order to the hot water Cruise suffered in ""Risky Business"" but more so in a deadly and moralistic way.  Again, Kubrick has paired the two most believable people to play Bill and Alice and both Cruise and Kidman do a superb job of acting.  So what do we learn after sitting through a mind-boggling exercise in trusting one's marriage partner?  I think Kubrick would say that relationships are not forever, but with an open mind and a loving heart, they can be as permanent as one is willing to make it.

As such, it provides us the opportunity to consider Kubrick's, ahem, evolution as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Between the two works, Kubrick seems to suggest mankind hasn't advanced very far from his primal animal nature. Civilization started with a brutal boning in ""2001"" and, well, forgive the crudeness of the pun and analogy, but ""Eyes Wide Shut"" shows humanity doing pretty much the same thing -- but trying to attach the veneer of culture to it through fancy ritual.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a fair amount of sex in this movie, but it is Kubrick sex -- which is to say, not that sexy, and probably not about the sex.<br/><br/>In short, it's a thought-provoking movie; not perfect, perhaps, but certainly worth seeing."

","I saw this picture five days ago, and it still resonates.  It's rated R, probably because of nudity and occasional naughty words, but the sexiest scenes (to me) were the G rated fully clothed and detailed flirtations which Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise independently indulge in at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Kidman is simply sensational when she starts pulling apart some of Cruise's basic assumptions about their relationship, propelling Cruise into his all night adventure in which the prostitute, the costuming, the ritualistic orgy all lead to fear, some surprises, and perhaps a kind of reconciliation.<br/><br/>

","This film is not what it's hyped to be. It is certainly not pornography, it is not even particularly sexy. In fact, there's not very much sex in it! If that's what you come to this film looking for, you'll be very disappointed.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you're looking for a thoroughly crafted, thoughtful and provocative, beautifully conceived, acted and presented film experience, then you'll hardly do better. Kubrick's films have often gotten indifferent, dismissive and outright negative reviews. Media critics tend to react this way when media events don't live up to the hype they themselves have created. Sadly but not surprisingly, the reviews are so much more predictable than the film itself.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is a film about sex, and about what sex does to us where we live, which is between the ears. The script is rich, tantalizing, playful and full of suspense. The cinematography, design and art direction are sumptuous. The acting is dead on in every single role, and much credit is due Kubrick and Raphael for the body and fullness written into so many of the minor characters.<br/><br/>I became a full-fledged Kubrick fan more than 30 years ago at my first viewing of 2001. I've been on his bandwagon ever since, waiting ever longer periods in between his offerings. None of his films has ever presented me with precisely what I thought I was waiting for, and Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. Whatever my initial reaction to his films, I've always found that one, two and five years later they've grown on me, and I've discovered more in them than I first beheld. This one will be savored for a long time. It's a beautiful piece of work!<br/><br/>I only wish I could expect that after another long, long wait,  Kubrick would do this to me again! BRAVO Stanley, wherever you are!"
"Dave-300","9","0","0","20 July 1999"," And Lead Us Not into Temptation
","In a society that often refuses to acknowledge the conflict between good and evil in our world, EYES WIDE SHUT is a refreshing if not somewhat depressing expression of the conflict that resides in each of us.  I'll not summarize the plot, for it would not do justice to the allegory that Kubrick spins as he directs his protagonist toward the abyss of his soul.  I will note, however, that he does it magnificently.  The music is hauntingly beautiful; colors merge and reflect the dissonance of the conflict; the actors are most convincing as they wrestle with their humanity...with their eyes wide shut. <br/><br/>
Certainly, there are problems with the film.  Kubrick is often deliberately, yet, agonizingly slow.  As is the case with all allegory, there are moments of confusion regarding the development of the plot.  Nevertheless, after having had a few days to reflect on the film, I plan to see it again...with my eyes wide open.  It is one of the best films of the year."
"Schmee","Null","0","0","20 July 1999"," Good like a banana split?
","I'll start out with what I didn't like, then I'll get to what I did. Today's analogy will be the banana split.<br/><br/>At the bottom of a banana split, you get a whole mess of goo that really isn't as good as it was before it melted. This I would consider to be the beginning of the film. Now, you can't have a banana split without the goo, but I like to keep it to a minimum. During one of the first scenes, namely the dance party, I was extremely worried that I was going to hate this film. I didn't, but it scared the hell out of me. That scene really didn't fit the rest of the movie, either, and a good thing, too. Kubrick over lighted the backdrops flooding the lens, and I felt the actor dancing with Nicole was really poor. Sadly, also, I didn't like Kidman's drunk behavior, especially as an introduction to this character who turns out to be nothing like that. Anyway, that was the only scene that really bothered me.<br/><br/>Then on most banana splits you've got the pineapple. I've never liked pineapple, but some people do. This film's pineapple flavoring mostly included, the score (if you can call it that) and the film. The score had some individual simply pounded on a piano key which really took me out of the film. I guess the point of the this was to keep me uncomfortable, but instead it separated me from the action on the screen and didn't add anything to it. Also, the film image would be clear and colorful, and then grainy, and then old looking... This may have been an artifact from the fact that the film was made over a period of several years or maybe it was purposeful, but it bothered me.<br/><br/>The last problem that you can have with banana splits is too much chocolate. I like chocolate, but not so much that by the time I'm done I am sick to death of chocolate. The pacing during the first hour or so. I'm not saying that what happened during the first hour isn't important, I just wanted it to be presented in a more steady fashion. For those that saw it, I would say everything after the word FIDELIO appears occurs at a great pace. I would venture to say I could cut 20 minutes out of the beginning of this film, show it to those of you that saw it last night and you could not tell me what had been removed.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong, I like banana splits. In spite of the things I didn't like, the film works. Actually, I am impressed that it could overcome those above mentioned nasties and entertain me. I was always looking forward to what might happen next and was surprised when it did.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were the two scopes of vanilla. There were some very powerful scenes and I believed them through every one of them. When Kidman is speaking of there past summer's holiday both her story telling and Tom's listening are intense. The most difficult scenes in this film were those between Tom and Nicole, and they played them beautifully.<br/><br/>Then there was the sex, the banana if you will (try not to read too much into this analogy, okay?). When you buy a banana split, you ever notice that they're advertising it as banana. The banana is a very small portion of the treat. This movie was so hyped because of the sex and nudity. Really, though, there is only one scene that goes further than most movies, and there is nothing disturbing about any of these scenes. It appears that no character is in a place that they do not wish to be. There is more sex in this film than, for example, ""A Clockwork Orange"", but it is always consensual and (I'd say) in good taste. Mostly, I believe they should not pump this movie as a sex film and instead as a serious drama.<br/><br/>And could Kubrick have ended this film with any other sentence, any other word? It just plops the cherry right on top of the whipped cream, don't it?<br/><br/>I give the film 3 stars out of 4. The film may not be suited towards some people, and those people are simply missing out (expand your horizons, people! :-)  )"

Sydney Pollack's supporting role is icing on the cake.<br/><br/>It's fortunate that the guts of the movie were kept under wraps as long as they were because the story itself is not only suspenseful, but actually about the suspense of the mind: our acid jealousies, the personal dangers we impose on ourselves, morbid curiosity, and crippling insecurities. A bold, stirring score intensifies all of the above.<br/><br/>It's full of enough pregnant pauses to repopulate the earth, enough humor to keep 'em all chuckling.

","This is a film that truly should not be missed; it has that rarely seen or felt power to capture the essence of the human heart laid bare.  Kubrick analyzes an amazingly wide range of emotions throughout the film: fear, jealousy, love, anger, desire, and deceit.  This is a film that asks perhaps more questions about human relationships than it actually answers, and it asks the audience to ask themselves the same questions.  It is a film that deals with our greatest fears about love and commitment, and it delves into all of the unconscious thoughts, fantasies and desires we all have, but never, ever, dare to tell each other.  The heart of the film lies in the consequences of finally revealing such thoughts.  Cruise, Kidman, and Pollack all give excellent performances, and the real-life marriage between the two stars adds an incredibly heightened sense of urgency to their performances.  This is a difficult film, and I believe that many people will find it's dark tone to be possibly too dark.  It would be a true shame if this film languishes because of unfair hype or misleading tabloid expectations.  See this movie twice, and then see it again, because it may be the only film this year that will stay with you, that will affect you both physically and emotionally."

","It's little wonder that such incredible secrecy surrounded ""Eyes Wide Shut"" before it opened. Had anyone known anything about this film, they would have been able to avoid it. Unfortunately for us all, millions of well-intentioned souls (including myself) went to the multiplex wondering what the fuss was about and ended up getting burned.<br/><br/>The billing that this is a Stanley Kubrick picture is a major misnomer. Anyone who's seen other Kubrick work will agree this is an AWFUL letdown and a horrible end to a fine career. A fifth grader with a camcorder and a piano (that constant one-note in the soundtrack was very annoying) could have produced this film--in fact, could have produced a much finer piece of cinema.<br/><br/>The major problem with the film, as you will agree, is Nicole Kidman. The first image we see in the movie is Kidman's naked posterior, and the camera basically pans over her semi-nude frame the entire two and a half hours. There really isn't a moment in the movie when Kidman's nipples (cute, I must admit) aren't on display. My question is: if Nicole wanted so badly to display her body to the public, why didn't she just make a home video like Pamela Lee? The acting in the Lee family video was more heartfelt and honest than anything in ""Eyes Wide Shut.""<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the cinematic equivalent of sitting at a bus station, watching people come and go. Scores of potentially interesting people walk onscreen in the film, but they are never around long enough for us to find out anything about them. Instead, we are treated to Nicole as pothead, Nicole as pinup girl, Nicole laughing hysterically, schoolmarmish Nicole eating breakfast.<br/><br/>The ""brain trust"" (I use that term loosely) behind this movie obviously intended it as a touching exploration of the issues of honesty, trust, fidelity and sexuality. Unfortunately, that could never be accomplished with this cast of characters--there is not a single likable soul in this film. The aforementioned Nicole, Dr. Tom (would you trust your health to a guy who smokes pot and tries to sleep with hookers?), the creepy business types who serve as foils for Tom in an effort to make him look noble, and a completely pointless cameo by Leelee Sobieski in bra and panties that sends the movie on a totally unrelated tangent. (Are her boobs really that small?) It all adds up to two and a half hours of confusion, agitation and frustration for the moviegoer."

","This final masterpiece of the late genius Stanley Kubrick is both audacious and captivating. Eyes Wide Shut proves to be a must for any Kubrick fan but is not recommended for the average viewer of escapist entertainment. My only complaint is that the MPAA made WB change 65 seconds of the film for the goal of receiving an R rating. Several digital characters were added to the print during an orgy scene. Their intended purpose was to cover up any random genitalia that might have been exposed. I wouldn't have any problems with this under normal circumstances, but Kubrick had no say in this. He died only four days after turning in the final negative to WB. They had no right to change his work. They should have kept it the way it was to preserve his memory.<br/><br/>I am sorry for my little rant but I feel very strongly about this. The moronic MPAA have been on Kubrick's case from Lolita to Clockwork Orange. Despite all of this, the movie is definitely worth seeing. It is fairly long (159 min. (9 reels)) but it doesn't seem it (unlike Titanic). It produces some comical scenes and lines but will be remembered for its mysterious and surreal plot, dialogue and camera shots.

","What words can describe the vision of the late Stanley Kubrick? Eyes Wide Shut draws its viewers in from beginning to end.  Simple flirtation at the beginning of the movie compels Kidman to confess a sexual desire unknown to Cruise. Deeper and deeper we follow Dr. William (Cruise) as he wanders through a sexual odyssey as each passing moment he is reminded of his wife's desire leading him into a maze of bizarre sexual encounters and mysteries which may never be solved. Majestic lighting and signature camera techniques add to the subtle layers of this film. We find ourselves sympathizing with Cruise's character and understand why he goes through this adventure. Supporting characters push the film further down the maze guiding Dr. William to his next encounter. Not one character left untouched by him. In the end we are left not just to question the relationship of the two main characters but to question our own.

","When you sit down to venture into the world captivated in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" you have to look deep within yourself and see the vision. Director Stanley Kubrick's last great masterpiece is just that a masterpiece. The common thread in Kubrick is the imagery of ""an unknown force taking away the control of an average man's life and slowly driving him insane until he learns a life lesson from it."" This thread has been in other Kubrick classics such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""A Clockwork Orange"". And it is so evident in ""Eyes Wide Shut"".<br/><br/>The film's stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman pour their lives out as they portray a couple grasping to hold together after some tightly kept secrets are let out of the bag. Cruise and Kidman begin to doubt each other's fidelity and honor to one and other. But what keeps this film together has to be the haunting three key score that accents to a lot of the actor's movements and at times heavily accents their haunted lives. Some of images portrayed in this film are so far out of left field it looks as if Kubrick has a lesson to give even in death. To summarize the film's originality, I can only state two words, ""Subtly Intense"". So go out and see Kubrick's final lesson and don't forget to kiss your wife when it's over.

","It's hard for me to really describe Eyes Wide Shut.  I see LOTS of films ranging from mindless to avante garde, but I am generally able to come to a focused take on them as a film.  But after leaving Eyes Wide Shut I could only describe it as being like a giant, complex painting hanging in an empty gallery.  I feel as though I apprached this hanging painting and gazed into it for 3 hours paying sharp attention to each and every minute detail. The outcome?  This film is an amazing piece of work. I found its message of the possible evils of sexual, how do we say, experimentation, liberation (any term lacking better words) to  be perfectly clear from start to finish. Though many of those I attended the film with found absolutely no point in what they were watching, I found that its point was perfectly clear. It is so hard to fully describe how I feel about this film.  It is not that I thought the acting was great.  I thought Tom Cruise (and I like Cruise's work) wasn't so perfect for the part. He had the boyish looks to pull off his character's youthful, naive struggle.  But overall he was somewhat lacking the depth to fully delve into such a complex character.  Nicole Kidman on the other hand, I found to be a low-point in the film.  I thought her performance was at times laughably bad and over-the-top. How annoying and self-centered can one girl be after drinking some champagne or smoking a little pot?  Her character had surprisingly little film time, and after seeing the film it is quite understandable why she was placed on the back burner. Aside from the acting, I didn't think the writing was of any spectacular caliber either. But what's amazing about Eyes Wide Shut is that the story and mostly Kubrick's portrayal of that story easily overcome any of the film's other shortcomings. I dunno...I don't want to get caught in a tangent describing each individual aspect.  What does need mentioning is the filmd Carnival-like 'Poe-esque' orgy scene.  Truly memorable, guaranteed to go down in film-history.  It was one of the most oddly-horrifying scenes I have witnessed. In closing, I can just say again that the film was an incredible artistic portrayal, not meant to entertain all, but to paint a vivid picture of a story of greed, desire, and mistrust."

And even the rush I felt as I watched the big yellow words ""Star Wars"" zoom away on The Phantom Menace's opening night pales in comparison to what I was going through in the minutes before this, Kubrick's final release, unspooled before me.  Roughly an hour later, though, I had pretty much forgotten about the great director and settled into the depths of William Harford's mind and conflicts.  While it lasts, this movie completely immerses its audience.  But somehow, Eyes Wide Shut isn't like Kubrick at all; while his stories usually only use characters to prove a point or make some statement about society, this film attempts to achieve psychological realism in its portrayal of a doctor's sexual escapades and their effects on his marriage.  It's as though the whole movie is just one giant experiment, like Kubrick wanted to see if he could really create a believable human character.  There's still meaning and messages and all that good stuff, but they seem tacked on to the complicated plot and occasionally shocking sexual imagery (which was shamelessly softened to avoid an NC-17 after Kubrick's death by the use of Austin Powers-esque ""covering"" techniques-- let's pray to God they give us the original version on video).

That's what I love about America.<br/><br/>This movie is VERY UNSEXY. I think Kubrick purposely deadened the eroticism in order for the audience to engage (if there are any members of the audience willing to engage) in the psychological aspects of the story. If you're going to see a sexfest with Tom and Nicole, you are definitely in the wrong place.<br/><br/>Here's my interpretation: (which will describe the complete plot, but it's not like there's some big ""rosebud"" at the end here) Tom is an erotically unaware person. The first line is his wife asking how she looks, and he answers ""great"" without looking at her.<br/><br/>They go to a party, where they get split up. She gets drunk and flirts with a suave Hungarian, who makes no bones about that he wants to do her. She refuses. At one point she looks over and sees Tom flirting with two other women.<br/><br/>The next night Tom and Nicole get stoned, and she picks a fight, asking him why he wasn't jealous of her with that man. He says ""because you're my wife."" She is incensed that he doesn't appreciate the devotion she is showing him, and he assumes her fidelity is just a matter of course. She tells him of a naval officer she once saw who she fantasized about, and whom thought she would have given up Tom and their child for one night with.<br/><br/>At this point it's as though Tom's eyes are opened to an entire level of sexuality that he has previously been blind to. He walks the streets, encountering various people and situations, while he goes through feelings of anger and revenge as he processes the feelings this unknown side of his wife has brought up.<br/><br/>Something happens out there to scare him very deeply, and it is made clear to him that his peaceful life with his wife is not at all assured, and is something he must appreciate and fight for. They have a final conversation, in which they decide that they must be still have their dreams and fantasies, but also keep their eyes open to what the implications of those fantasies are (hence the title).<br/><br/>To me it's a very sweet, personal and ultimately loving film. I think it's also important that the main characters be as flat as possible, while the supporting characters are quite vivid. Ultimately I think it was a wonderful, very psychological and literary film.<br/><br/>But if you want sex and thrills, this is definitely NOT your movie.<br/><br/>--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com"

","Stanley Kubrick's final film is a broodingly psychological, frightening and dark work.<br/><br/>In a way, it is an interesting opus to end a legendary career, since his past masterpieces (i.e. 2001: A Space Odyssey; A Clockwork Orange; Dr. Strangelove; etc.) had several Freudian meanings toward the larger picture, whether it was a satire on crime or a grand view of the universe.<br/><br/>
And as a finale, Eyes Wide Shut's sexual flavor puts all of his works in full circle in that aspect. But each frame of the film is so cluttered with symbolism and abstract messages (as typical of Kubrick) that the poetic facet of his films are also given a concluding spin.<br/><br/>As with his other pieces, the photography is wonderous, capturing the aura of the raw emotions, the terror of the escapades and the maddening facets of lust. And as usual, the music is placed so skillfully that it encompasses the passions of each aspect of the scene.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is truly a remarkable ending of a truly remarkable career. The themes of his past works resurface, subtly, but tightly resolved as the Freudian final word is uttered."

","Eyes Wide Shut will imediately alienate or entice its viewers. Walking out of the theatre, there were many people commenting on how bad it was. For a person looking for a porn film, I guess Eyes Wide Shut had too much plot and too little sex. For a person looking for an erotic thriller, I guess Eyes Wide Shut had too many open-ended questions and too few climatic scenes filled with answers. But for a person looking for a peek into the mind, into that Freudian unconscious, Eyes Wide Shut had plenty of images to contemplate.<br/><br/>First of all, like all of Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is about images, visuals. Durring Cruise's ""night on the town"" Kubrick's grainy film mixed with his extensive backlighting creates a dream-like state. The camera is slow and methodic. It shows us all we need to see in this urban dreamscape (minus those pesky digital images!). Because thats what Eyes Wide Shut is: a tour of the human dreamscape, or at least the seedier side of it.<br/><br/>The plot moves slowly not concerned that it has left some questions unanswered, because this isn't a film about answers. Here we see another Kubrick signature, the open-ended ending. When those credits role, you'll probably still have questions or maybe you'll want to know what just hit you. Where did Kubrick just take you? What did you just see? I must say that one viewing, which is all that I have had, is insufficient to answer those questions completely.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is an excellent movie that makes you think. Not like The Usual Suspects, but like Persona or 2001 or Blue Velvet, another dream caught up in dreams. It doesn't keep you guessing, it keeps you thinking...well after the credits role. One thing is clear though, this is a must see finale to a wonderful career."

There's a lonnnnnng build up to something that never happens.  There's nothing shocking.  There's TV drama dialog.  There's ridiculous people and illogical situations.  The nudity isn't even stimulating.  It's a couple of people whom you think would be interesting, one of whom (Kidman) goes on to live a lifeless two days and the other (Cruise) who drives himself to dabble on the darkside -- without success -- while IMAGINING his wife is cheating on him. ZZZZZZzzzzzzz....<br/><br/>I'll admit, I am not a Tom Cruise fan.  I've only liked him in three movies (Risky Business, Top Gun and Jerry Maquire), and in this role, Kubrick apparently told him to act like the self-assured dunce he does in 90 percent of his movies.  He at least could have been made to LOOK like a doctor in this.. and come to think of it, why does he have to flash his doctor credentials like an FBI agent to everyone he meets?<br/><br/>I am sorry this marks the end of the life and career of Stanley Kubrick.

Kubrick spent years on this project and every little detail is significant. Note that all the side and supporting characters are paid great attention to. In the second viewing I noticed details such as Cruise (as doctor) over the dead father: Cruise puts his hand on the dead man's head and the lighting produces the effect of the Godlike doctor. Another fascinating detail is his incorporation of many genres. The most interesting is when Cruise receives the letter of warning at the house - if you listen to the music and look at how we are meant to view the words of the letter - it sees like a silent movie (but only for maybe 10-15 seconds). Nothing has ever been better and I sit here at work with my eyes wide shut anticipating my next (third) viewing as I am well aware that as much as I have seen there is so much I still have to open my eyes to Really see."

The characters are bizarrely sterotypical.  Subtle plot lines that could have been exploited to make the film more interesting are dismissed out of hand.  The redeeming quality of this film is Kubrick's use of the medium.  It is exquistely filmed, lush sets and excellent use of music to set the mood.

It is too weird for most people. Most commercial audiences will either love it or just not get it.

The woman, Alice (Nicole Kidman) reveals to her husband a fantasy she had about a man who stayed at a hotel with them a few years back.  She tells him the harsh details of her sexual fantasies.  The husband, (Tom Cruise), ends up going on a sexual adventure of his own, testing his fidelity to his wife.  William (Tom Cruise) finds himself in a secret meeting of a sexual cult, and ends up getting more than he bargained for. But in the end, they confront each other with their fantastic stories.

"Brogan","10","0","0","18 July 1999"," A brilliant farewell from a brilliant director.
","Let me start by saying that last March, I was deeply saddened by the death of Stanley Kubrick.  I never met the man, but with reading his biographies and watching his movies countless times, I can understand what the man is trying to say through his films.  I was upset that we will never see the much awaited Kubrick film titled ""A.I."" (ARTIFICIAL INTELLENGENCE), but I am pleased that we will see one more film of Kubrick's titled ""EYES WIDE SHUT."" For months, even before Kubrick's death, I was highly eager for this film.  One of the best director's of all time first film in twelve years (since 1987 FULL METAL JACKET).  And it came no surprise that the film kept getting delayed, (from December of 1998, to March 1999, and finally July 16, 1999).  But I knew Kubrick would do that. One of his most famous tales is that the MGM executives were upset at Kubrick for delaying ""2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.""  One of the MGM exceutives asked Kubrick, ""is that the title of the movie, or when it's coming out?"" But the time has come, July 16th has finally arrived.  Before I saw a exclusive sneak of EYES WIDE SHUT, I hyped myself up for this film.  I watched parts of 2001, and all of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE on my DVD player at home, the night before I saw EYES WIDE SHUT.  And when I saw EYES WIDE SHUT, I was prepared. My heart was racing when I saw the Warner Bros. symbol, then the words ""Warner Bros. Presents"" ""Tom Cruise"" ""Nicole Kidman"" ""In A Stanely Kubrick Film.""  The eerie carnival-waltz music playing in the background, while the viewer sees the back-side of Nicole Kidman, as she's undressing.  The viewer sees Kidman, undress until she's completely nude.  Then the words ""EYES WIDE SHUT"" appear.  And from there on, I went though the most complex plot and thought provoking film that I have seen since ""THE MATRIX.""  This film really took me out of my theater seat, and into the world of Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise). This is a brilliant film from a brilliant director!  Stanley Kubrick proved that throughout his carrer, he didn't make one bad movie.  And I feel that EYES WIDE SHUT should be placed with Kubrick's other classics: DR. STRANGELOVE, THE KILLING, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, 2001, THE SHINING, and the rest of his films.  This is a film that you have to go to, and please bring your intellegence, otherwise, it won't make any sense.  After watching this film with a couple of friends, we discussed how complex the plot was of this film.  And days later, we still talk about certain scenes and plot points in the film. It's like going to a crime scene, and trying to figure out who did the murder, and what was the motive. What other director can do this to a film!  Kubrick tells both so much, and so little.  He let's the viewer think about what's going on, but doesn't show it.  He'll let the viewer think about what's going to happen, but won't say.  Very few director's in Hollywood or in the film industry will do this.  Instead they would rather ""entertain"" the viewer. They tell the story, let the viewer know what happend, and what's going to happen to them in the future, and then give them a happy ending.  Kubrick isn't like that, he doesn't make entertainment, he makes art.  2001 is one of the few films that I would say, deserves a gold frame around it's screen, and placed in the Louve in Paris. EYES WIDE SHUT is another film that deserves that same treatment.  This is a work of art,the editing, the cinematography, the acting, the errie music, and the story are all done with a touch of brillance.  This is a worthy film of Kubrick's. Unlike other film critic's I respect Stanley Kubrick and his family very much.  So out of respect, I will not reveal any of the plot points or discuss the plot.  The plot of the film is both too simple and complex to discuss.  It's something that needs to been seen, to understand.  But I will mention this, Kubrick fans will notice Kubrick using some of his famous directing moves in this film. The Christmas party in EYES WIDE SHUT looks very similar to the Gold Ballroom scene in THE SHINING.  The following the character around the huge building without cutting, or doing a different camera angle.  The unique camera angles, the very rapid long shot to extreme close up shot (done in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE when Alex sees his old droogs become officer's.  And in THE SHINING when Wendy sees the shocking mirror reflection of the word ""murder"").  And the single character standing alone in a big room, or walking down the street. No surprise, I found this not only one of the best films of the year, but also of all time.  I'm sad that were not going to see another Kubrick film.  But I am glad that I lived in a time to see his work.  To be both influenced and astonished at the same time, while watching his movies. Farewell Stanley, thank you very much for the works of art, and may you rest in peace.   ***** (out of five)"

","Stanley Kubrick last film is great. I am a Kubrick fan and a big cinema fan. Kubrick abandon a bit his style that he has use since 2001 A Space Odyssey for a more new style who let me remember the great Martin Scorsese. And, by the way, the whole film has an atmosphere of Taxi Driver Kubrick's version.<br/><br/>The message of the movie is difficult to understand (well, it is Kubrick). It is one of his less commercial film in the range of Lolita. This is an unerotic movie with a lot of sexual content. One of the most weird movie that I have seen in all my life (David Lynch's Blue Velvet is another).<br/><br/>The actors are good. Tom Cruise, in my opinion, is not a great actor, but in this movie he seems credible. Kidman is at his best as always. She is really one of the greatest hollywoodian actress. Sydney Pollack is also credible even if his last scene (the non-explicative scene with Tom Cruise) is a tough one for the audiance to beleive.<br/><br/>I must say that I attended to see the greatest film of my life and I was personnaly disappointed, buy it is obvious that it is a film to watch and rewatch again and again like all the Kubrick movies. The problem with me and the movie was that the central theme of the movie was not a theme that really cared about... well rare are the director who let me appreciate a movie with a theme that you don't personnaly care... I can think a few names.....Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Terrence Malick, David Lean, Steven Speilberg and Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>Remember it is not a commercial movie, so may LOVE it or you may HATE it.

","Which was exactly what this film was.  Like many people, I'm not really sure WHAT I think of this film right now.  It was odd yet it was constantly compelling.  And as for the sex:  got news for ya folks, there ain't a lot of it.  Save for the orgy scene(s), some fantasy stuff and the scene which the teaser trailer came from (the one with the Cruises making out in front of the mirror), it's mainly a lot of subplots that are based around sex and that are about sex but not necessarily featuring sex itself.<br/><br/>As for the performances themselves, I'll try to give a brief ""review"" of each of the main actor's roles.  First, Tom.  Tom is AMAZING in this film. His character portrays such a wide variety of emotions---everything from pure horniness to shameful tears---that you're pulled deeper and deeper into his character's life with each outburst of emotion.  As for Nicole...she should've been in more of the film.  However, her role is great.  Alice is portrayed as everything---a slut, a bitch, a loving mother, etc.---and you do really feel sorry for her during what I call her ""dream confessional."" She has a great role to work with and has the best line in the final scene...you'll know what I mean when she actually mutters it.  Sydney Pollack seems like a prime candidate for a Best Supporting Actor nomination come spring and it would be well-deserved.  He has a great character and a great role.  Marie Richardson---the woman who took over Jennifer Jason Leigh's role---really doesn't have much of a role.  5-6 minutes and she's gone.  And, unfortunately, a lot of the characters have that problem. Especially poor Leelee Sobieski who only has one or two lines throughout the whole movie.  Her nympho act is pretty convincing though, I must admit. Vinessa Shaw---a prostitute in the film---has a nice, meaty role to play...too bad she doesn't have a larger part.  And her character turns out with a bad...well, you'll see.  And Thomas Gibson---who plays Clark, Marie Richardson's fiance in the film---has a really, really small part---4 minutes overall, I'd say.  And finally, Madison Eginton, who plays Tom and Nicole's daughter, is absolutely adorable.  Even though she has a small role, hers is pivotal to her parents lives and you'll see what I mean when you watch the film yourself.<br/><br/>The orgy scene could've gone un-edited if you really want the truth. Nothing you probably haven't seen on SKINemax once or twice.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Eyes Wide Shut' was very enjoyable.  Just don't be looking for a wild sex romp."
"gonzo-43","10","0","0","18 July 1999"," Kubrick's final masterpiece
","EYES WIDE SHUT is Kubrick's final masterpiece. This has been his best cinematic psychology thesis since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I'm pretty confident that any fan of Stanley Kubrick will not be disappointed. It has the basic elements of any of his masterpieces: dark mood, surreal backdrops, violent nature and a psychological lesson to talk amongst the more cerebral moviegoer.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the mood ,which is classic Kubrick, is dark and mesmerizing.  From the first shot of Nicole Kidman's naked back, the eyes are drawn into the celluloid screen. His use of neon and city lights only add more to the sexual and dangerous atmosphere that he's created. From the beginning, his camera eye throws the audience into each scene as a vulnerable bystander.<br/><br/>Second, the characters have a strong sense of detachment. Where some people may have a problem with this and may be accused of being two-dimensional, Kubrick fans should not be surprised.  The characters in his previous films displayed the same sense of detachment. (History shows that only a handful of actors have been nominated for awards.) And once again, this is all Kubrick.  However, I must note that Nicole Kidman gives her best performance of her career, thus far.<br/><br/>And also, the music is top-notch. The piano and strings become the blood stream for the film's intense moments. (Watch out for the music played in the masquerade scene. It literally SCARED me.)<br/><br/>I really don't seen any flaws in this picture. Seeing Tom Cruise in such a controversal film does not shock me thanks to his role as a vampire in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. The story was original, creative and as usual he does not provide a ""Hollywood"" ending which is unusual for a summer movie. However, Sidney Polluck's character should have had a surrealistic edge to him.  Something like Peter Sellers in LOLITA. Sidney Polluck acted like...Sidney Polluck.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the wait was worth it.  I realize that there are many negative reviews about it but I believe it's because it's not a ""Hollywood"" movie and also because the movie is different than what most people expected. I think they'll like and accept it after another well-deserved look.<br/><br/>One last note:  thank you Mr. Kubrick.  You are an inspiration to those who expect a lot more from the films they enjoy watching."

As pretentious as this sounds, the actors register across the board, with particularly excellent work by Kidman.

"Todd M","9","0","0","18 July 1999"," A fitting farewell to the master
","To all of you out there who are eager to discover the closely guarded plot of Eyes Wide Shut, fear not, for I won't ruin any of it for you. Rather, I will say that you will be seeing a brilliant film, the final work of history's finest film director, Stanley Kubrick.  In an age where so many films are over the top and far-fetched, Eyes Wide Shut takes a long hard look at the taboo of extramarital sexual attraction. In this film, Stanley Kubrick bravely delves into the realm of the taboo as we follow Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) on a journey to discover the part of himself he was afraid to admit existed, his own capacity to fantasize about women other than his wife (Nicole Kidman).  This is not a B-rate T&A film and it's not pornography.  Rather, Eyes Wide Shut is a captivating, and at times deeply troubling, look at human emotions.  The script dynamically juxtaposes the sacred with the taboo, mixing Christian symbols with raw sexuality.  The result is a film which cannot help but make the viewer feel the strength of Cruise's moral conflict. More than anything, Eyes Wide Shut is brutally honest.  Kubrick takes a journey into a man's soul and forces you to join him.  Technically, the film is superb with a score that accentuates the emotion of every frame of film and lighting that creates the ambiance necessary to pull off some of Eyes Wide Shut's most etherial scenes.  Finally, praise to Stanley Kubrick, whose final film, and first in twelve years, shows that he never lost a step in 40 years as a filmmaker.  In the hands of almost any other director, the complex story of Eyes Wide Shut would stand the risk of becoming a pretentious and raunchy diatribe.  But the brilliantly subtle style of Kubrick, it is a masterpiece."
"shakes-14","10","0","0","18 July 1999"," Very good movie.
","Eyes Wide Shut is classic Kubrick. The music and lighting of the film sets the mood as did that of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey.  Nicole Kidman plays the best performance of her life in my opinion.  Tom Cruise is wonderful as Bill Harford. Sydney Pollack also plays a good part. Some people say that the movie would have been better if Harvey Keitel had played the part and say that Sydney Pollack's performance was the only flaw in the movie.  I do not agree though I admit it would be interesting to see Harvey Keitel play the part. The movie takes you many visually provocative locations and introduces you to many provocative characters emphasizing the MANY.  Among them there is one played by the beautiful and talented Leelee Sobieski who was also good in the TV movie Joan of Arc though her part is meager in this film and I don't even think you hear her say one line she captures her character well.  Within every character the spirit of this movie is captured and that is one of the many beauties of it.  Well to conclude I'm going to say something that you've probably already heard but by all means that doesn't make it not true.  Before his death Stanley Kubrick has given all movie lovers one final masterpiece."

","Being a confirmed Kubrick fan, I would say yes. The pacing is a bit off near the end, though I think this has more to do with the script and the inordinate amount of weight placed on a climactic dialogue scene that doesn't reveal much. But then, that could be intentional. The whole movie feels like Kubrick's perverse joke on anyone expecting a hot, fast sex thriller starring Tom and Nicole. Generally the movie never gives the audience what it came for. This will annoy some viewers (perhaps many), but Kubrick did something similar with THE SHINING, which is basically an anti-horror film. He didn't obey genre rules and he dared to risk losing the audience. A true rebel."

","This film is definitely worth a look and from a stylistic standpoint is trademark Kubrik.  However, I doubt this film will be viewed as another Kubrik masterpiece or some cult film.  For all its style I don't think it has the substance for that.  On the other hand, this film is so lavishly filmed that it would be a shame to simply try to rate it on a basic star or number scale.<br/><br/>In any case, this was a hard movie for me to review.  It's very well done; the acting, the cinematography, the direction, the filming locations, the extravagant architecture, the lighting, the mood, the list goes on and on. However, I think the plot is to some degree open to interpretation.<br/><br/>Basically the story depicts infidelity experienced within the context of dreams, or perhaps drug induced hallucinations, which allow the characters to walk a line between fantasy and reality. What we the viewer are seeing in the majority of the film, except for the beginning and ending, aren't happening in reality.  Instead, it's the sexual fantasy induced by the two getting high which acts as sort of a catalyst.  This dream or nightmare like state is stylistically and conceptually reminiscent of the eerie scene in ""The Shining"" where Jack Torrance, played by Jack Nicholson, is alone in the bar and later has visions of murder.<br/><br/>For all its media hype, the nudity is just, well, just really no big deal. I don't know how much editing was done to obstruct some of the scenes, but after viewing it I'm certain it was probably a knee jerk reaction by the part of the movie rating system folks."

This feels like the sort of film that will be hailed as a masterpiece solely on its reverent pacing and the reputation of its director...not based on what it actually is.<br/><br/>The cinematography and lighting were gorgeous and Nicole Kidman had some interesting moments near the beginning but everything felt so forced, so deliberate...its as if everyone in every scene was too aware the entire time of the importance of the project so anything idiosyncratic or spontaneous has been stamped out.

When Dr. Bill is insulted-turned on-driven by Alice's (his wife) story of her enormous attraction to a naval officer (""I was willing to give up everything... for the promise of just one night with him."") he departs on a fruitless journey in which he attempts to dive into carnality.

","This was truly a great film on the whole, however, some ambivalence in the direction made it hesitant and uncertain. Overall, this is a fantastic exploration on our culture's attitude towards sexuality and our fear and attraction to it. One point that I think has been missed is that this is not actually promoting conservative values. In some ways, it mocks them. If this film has a flaw, the major one is the struggle between having a plot, and simply being a personal exploration. I think that some of the latter sequences involving Cruises ""investigation"" into the orgy(after the fact) were useless, and didn't add anything. Particularly, the second Sidney Pollack(the other mistake of the film- Keitel would have been much better) scene was over-explaining what would have been better as a mystery.<br/><br/>On the whole, it was a beautifully made examination of love and lust."

But there is no doubt that there was genius at work here. Kubrick accomplishes what I think he intended; namely, to make us think about--and ""feel""--the consequences of sexual compulsion.  Like ""A Clockwork Orange"" no answers are provided, but a resolution is reached, and when this happened, it felt like a fever breaking.  Cruise and Kidman reached deeply to provide heartfelt performances, but there were lapses on occasion, and one or two scenes seemed strained.  Similarly, the film itself was masterful in building an ever ominous, suspenseful tone, but also lapsed occasionally (for example, the repeated use of a jarring solo piano to underscore tense moments, though initially effective, became overkill after awhile).  All in all, this was adult filmmaking in the best sense of the word: thought provoking, original, and unafraid.  Kubrick will be missed."

","Well I can't say that I'm a major Kubric fan overall anyway but he does have a couple of good ones out there so I had hopes for this.  Unfortunately this movie lives up to pretty much nothing.  Not even what the trailer makes it out to be.  Which for me was a type of sexual thriller.  NOT!!!!  For about the first near hour the it's just totally boring.  But then something interesting starts and for the next hour and a half your strung along by your nose expecting something grand to happen.  He feeds you little tidbits just to keep you on the edge of interest and then ends the movie with a great big nothing.  A total dud.  I don't even think this movie had any reason to be made.  Other than ""basically"" good acting done by Kidman and Cruise, this movie doesn't stand out in any way.  And even their acting wasn't anything to talk about.  I know they are both excellent actors so I can only attribute their performance to both a poorly written script and somewhat tired directing.  I know that Kubric has done some good movies like THE SHINING and 2001 so I can only think that maybe it was his overall health that lead to this unfortunate travesty of a film.  And after seeing the film, it boggles the mind that it took three years to make.  I even heard on entertainment shows on t.v. that this was one of the most grueling films for Tom and Nichole to make and the it took a toll on them and wore them out.  If that's true, there is only one question to ask; Why!?  What was tuff out this movie.  There is no action; no stunts that either had to do, and as for emotionally, well, there wasn't anything emotional about it either.  So again I ask why.  Maybe it was just the demanding nature of Kubric or something.  Anyway, honestly, I wouldn't bother going to see this film if you haven't already.  It's not a thriller to keep you on the edge of your seat;  It's not an intriguing story for you to try to figure out(although it does keep you guessing just a little in one part, but not enough to warrant any kudos); and it's not a love story for you to cry about or be happy over.

"Jerilynn","Null","0","0","18 July 1999"," ""Stanley Did a Bad, Bad Thing . . . ""--but Critics Call it ""ART""
","Save your money or pay the $3.95 to rent the Playboy channel for a night on Pay-per-View. This 3-hour sleeper is a disappointing farce of profanity, sexism, nudity, and a half-witted script. Tom Cruise stars as the sissified but handsome, wealthy doctor who delves into a sexual underworld upon learning that his ditsy wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) has fantasized about a stranger. Alice is a former art director who is ""looking for a job"" and basically just says the word f- - - - and talks REALLY SLOWLY throughout the movie. Opportunities for the gritty dialog we have come to expect from Kubrick are filled with edgy music and images of Nicole putting on a black bra, pulling up stockings or baring her backside. Tom Cruise is predictable, boring, and just a bit too goody-goody to be real. Nicole is beautiful but crude, stupid and inane. She claims that men have no idea about a woman's sexual fantasies and explains (ridiculously) how she would have given up her marriage, child, and her comfortable (almost somnolent) existence in NYC to sleep with a naval officer she saw on holiday. Yet the movie says nothing about female sexuality. All women are hookers or Tom's patients or somehow disenfranchised from society.  We have junkie hookers, HIV infected hookers, wanna-be hookers and 14 year-old hookers, but not one real, modern or concrete image of female sexuality. After almost two hours of Tom walking the streets of New York and passing money to everyone he ALMOST sleeps with, we get the vestiges of a thinly veiled plot.  One of Tom's forays into  the underworld leads him into a brothel in upstate NY, one where the idenitities of NY's elite are concealed. It is unclear whether Tom's failure to consummate his dark fantasy results in a hooker getting killed or if the hooker simply takes a drug overdose in the end.  The underlying (albeit cryptic message ) is that ""things are real which are real in their consequences"".  Was the whole brothel a masque or a charade? Is Nicole's fantasy reality or just normal desire unrealized?  Is her desire as sordid as his aborted trysts with several hookers whom he kisses?  By the end of the 3 hours you won't care. All the breasts and buttocks, finely sculpted and pert and shaped, look alike and all the ju-ju bees are gone. In sum, this is a disappointment for all. Kubrick is capable of far better, as we've seen in Full Metal Jacket and other films. Tom Cruise is no longer the consummate actor we see in Born on the Fourth of July or the well developed character of Jerry Maguire. And Nicole is just playing TO DIE for again with less of a dialog. I close with two thumbs down and a sardonic grin as I wait for the influx of electronic hate mail .  .  ."

","At last, after 12 years of waiting, Stanley Kubrick's new film is in theaters. Alas, it's also Kubrick's final movie... The great one died in March shortly after finishing work on ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star in a dreamy, surreal exploration of human sexuality, love and jealousy. Like all Kubrick films, ""EWS"" will only be understood and truly appreciated after repeated viewings, but I offer here a few first impressions. This is a gorgeous movie, full of intense primary colors, lovely natural lighting and the wonderful tracking shots Kubrick has made famous. The performances by Kidman and Cruise are both exceptional, but the supporting cast is possibly even more impressive. Those looking for titillation won't find it here; instead, this is a serious study of the intense emotions that lurk just below the surface in most if not all marriages. The story begins with our sexy couple going to a party, where they get separated and both engage in some serious flirtation, but nothing more. Later, back at home, they discuss the evening in one of the movies strongest scenes. Perhaps to make Cruise jealous, Kidman tells her husband about a man she has been fantasizing about for months, a Naval officer she saw only in passing, but who she says she would have given up everything for if he had only asked her to. Before Cruise can react to Kidman's riveting speech, he's called out on business (he's a doctor,) launching him into a night of bizarre sexual and romantic encounters that play like a feverish nightmare. It culminates with a bizarre masked orgy at which Dr. Bill is deemed to be an interloper and is threatened with death if he reveals what he has seen. Back at home, Kidman tells him about a sexual dream she has had in his absence, and as the rest of the movie unfolds, we begin to wonder what is real and what is a dream. I won't reveal more of the plot, but will say the movie ends on a hopeful, romantic note, something Kubrick fans have seldom seen before. Some critics say the ending is a sell-out, but I kind of liked it. The final word spoken before the ""Directed By"" credit is, it seems to me, a fitting epitaph for Kubrick, the most cerebral yet sensual director America has yet produced. A note for casual movie fans: this is not for you. Audiences used to the pace of sitcoms and ""Armageddon""-type films will not be able to sit still for this 2-and-a-half hour meditation on the human condition. People behind me in the opening-night packed house bitched and moaned throughout about the pace, that nothing ever happened, etc. What's more, they laughed at totally inappropriate places. Obviously meant to see ""Big Daddy"" instead."
"Mooby","Null","0","0","16 July 1999"," A jarring film.
","""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a piece that tiptoes on intensity and jumps at you with wordless, embittered actors.  The plot is a tad ambiguous, but without giving anything away:<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman plays the wife of William Harford, a doctor who has just learned that his betrothed has had serious and barely not-acted-upon thoughts of infidelity.  She tells him of a could/would-have-been fling that turns his perception of his marraige upside down, and in passive-aggressive retaliation, he journeys onto the cold, rainy streets of Manhattan for a sexual deviancy tale of his own.  Through pure happenstance, William is referenced to a party by his friend Nick, a jazz pianist who is a friend from college.  Hinting of haughtiness is intriguing enough for the good doctor to go through extreme measures required to attend the engagement. The party, well, the party is a ritualistic orgy where a mask and the word ""Fidelio"" are tickets to entry.  The uninvited are unwelcome and once Bill's naivete is revealed to all members of the party, he is harshly reprimanded and warned never to speak of what he has seen again.  The rest of the film's goings-on are either a bi-product of Harford's curiosity as to what lied beneath the mask of the eerie social gathering or the dream-like opportunities for sexual exploration that the handsome main character receives from the women he aligns with throughout the story.<br/><br/>All of this hangs under a raincloud of the late director Stanley Kubrick's morbid and exact vision of the Arthur Schnitzler's book ""Traumnovelle"". And Kubrick leaves nothing to chance.  Having had a notorious shooting schedule (something like 15 months), every facial tick, every hand gesture is obviously just how the director wants.  However, the question I ask is if the film is as appealing to the general public as it was the Stanley Kubrick.  Although it does have a bag of moments that share grandiose and impacting depth and cinematic brilliance, a large chunk is a little too unexplained(or, dare I say, uncompleted) for anyone but truth-seeking, goateed film students donning black turtlenecks to have the energy to want to understand.<br/><br/>Should you go see it?  Definitely.  But don't go see it for the hyped and ultimately tame ""sex"" scenes.  And don't go see it expecting any ""Jerry Maguire""-like smugness out of Cruise.  And I advise you against going and expecting the second coming of Christ.  Because you'll be disappointed. What you will find however is a honestly good and intriguing film that may be iffy in some areas, but cannot be called bad.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"", artistically speaking, is solid but culturally, lacks the same kind of studio hooks presented in some of Tom Cruise's prior popcorn vehicles.  It is only fair to my enjoyment of ""Shut"" to point out that some people hear the word ""artistically"" and immediately conjure up stuffy, boring dramas that seem to never end.  That is not the case here.  It might run a little long, but this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat despite its refusal to ""sell out"".  That is part of many of the complaints about the film.  In a society where we have been conditioned on the same ""table of contents""-like plots in our summer fare, here's one that actually risks dangling the explanation in front of our faces with Manchurian pacing, making sure we trot along in hopes of eventually being privvied to complete discretion.  This has always been a metaphor for the filmmaker's own professional practices, which makes ""Eyes Wide Shut"" all the more a poetic homage to the stubborn genius of Stanley Kubrick."

"Michael Bennett Cohn","6","0","0","17 July 1999"," has its moments, but overall a disappointment
","I have had the pleasure of seeing every single Kubrick film on the big screen. While some were better than others, each one surprised with its unconventional storytelling, and usually with innovative visuals that stay with the viewer long after leaving the theater. Most Kubrick films are adapted from novels, but Kubrick felt quite free to vastly alter the original story for his own purposes. Films like Lolita and A Clockwork Orange use intriguing imagery to give physicality to books which have more to do with the workings of the protagonist's mind than his interaction with his surroundings.<br/><br/>How strange, then, that Kubrick would adapt Traumnovelle, a story that takes place almost completely inside the protagonist's head, and that the adaptation would be so literal...setting aside, of course, the fact that Eyes Wide Shut takes place a century later than the novel. Bill Hareford (Tom Cruise) is clearly growing more and more obsessed about both his wife's sexual fantasies and a world full of sexual practices foreign -and inexplicable- to him. And yet, excepting black and white hallucinations of his wife with another man, his obsession, his confusion, is mostly implied, his specific thoughts and theories mostly left for us to be guessed at. And that's irritating, not just because we as an audience want to understand the character we're watching, but also because Kubrick has such a reputation for inventive dialog and imagery that simultaneously entertains and advances the story, while also giving us insight into what the characters are thinking. Of course, very often, as in 2001 or Lolita or Full Metal Jacket, not much context is required to understand the thoughts and motivations of any given character: they are driven by lust, survival, fear. But its harder to tell what Bill Hareford is driven by. Why does he go to the costume party? In the novel, it's a way of dealing with his growing irritation that perhaps he isn't as suave and cosmopolitan as he thought. In the movie, it's less clear. In the hands of a master storyteller like Kubrick, ambiguity can be quite appropriate, but in this film there is too much of it, or it's in the wrong places, or something. All I can say now, less than twenty-four hours after viewing the film, that the placement of ambiguity often felt intuitively wrong to me.<br/><br/>The scenery is colorful and well-lit, the costumes are chic, the acting is good, and there are plenty of attractive naked women to look at, but with one notable exception - the already-famous costume party ordeal in the middle of the film - there is little here that is going to stick in my mind for very long. And...how...slow...Nicole...Kidman...talked....I...realize...it...was...on.. .purpose...but...it...got...old.<br/><br/>What was so great about these scenes that they had to be filmed over so many times? And the hubub about the sexiness of the film is really misplaced...there have been much bolder, sexier, more shocking movies, many of them with an R rating. I would have liked to see the unedited NC-17 cut, but I fear genitalia and graphic sex would regrettably not make the story any more interesting."

","If you're looking for a brilliant art piece of cinema, it will definitely more than fulfill your desires.  it is very well shot, with oh-so-artistic grainy film and lots of incredible visuals.  If you're looking for plot, it may or may not have one.  it's not so obvious, but you can play it in your head after it's over and figure it out.  it doesn't outright ever give a reasoning for any of the incidents or actions, and they're not so obvious that you'd pick it up while watching for the first time.  if you're looking for resolution, go elsewhere. not much changes over the course of three days (movie time) or 2:50 (real time).  maybe a little peace of mind for the main characters, but that's about it.  their lives aren't any better off, nor is there some incredible climax or mind-shattering event.  if you're looking for tom cruise, it's here, in abundance.  the same can't be said for nicole kidman (a much better actor), nor any of the other minor characters.  there are parts that will chill you (the ritual scene), parts that will make you laugh (little quips from kidman towards cruise, mostly in the beginning), and of course you will get your fill of nudity and sex.  the movie is very long and slowly paced (almost 3 hours), but I didn't feel bored at any time, and I also found myself wanting more at the end, just because it was very pretty to watch.  character development was also very slow, and you really didn't get an idea of how these people were until late in the movie. the only character who has a lot of development is cruise's, but you at least get a hint of other characters.  my only complaint with the movie is that although artistically, it's every bit ""2001"", it doesn't make the impact that kubrick's other films have.  if this was a film by anyone else (barring other masters such as Scorcese, Lynch or Spielberg) it would be a masterpiece.

","This was my first and last time seeing a Stanley Kubrick film in a theatre -- and that's a shame. A lot of Tom & Nicole fans probably won't know quite what to make of this movie. But Cruise & Kidman, to paraphrase Chris Isaak, did a good, good thing by exposing Kubrick's work to a lot of people who might otherwise never have seen it.<br/><br/>I was amused to read that some critics didn't think it was ""sexy"" enough, which misses the point completely. What makes sex sexy is intimacy, which almost all the characters in the movie are lacking. The tender scenes with the prostitute and (late in the film) with his wife are more compelling than any of the ""sexy"" scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>I hope that someday we'll able to see it as Kubrick originally intended - without the computerized revelers in the orgy scenes. Cruise's character is on a voyeuristic journey for an hour and a half, only to have digital bodies inserted in front of what he really wanted to see. His breakdown in front of his wife afterward would have been much more compelling had we seen the horrors that he did. Again, simulated violence is more palatable to the MPAA than simulated sex is. This is an adult film for adults, and their pressure to change Kubrick's film protects no one."

","Eyes Wide Shut is an lengthy exploration of the marriage of two affluent New Yorkers. Alice and Bill have a beautiful apartment, a lovely 7 year old daughter, a Range Rover, pots of money, they are portrayed by Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise...yet something is lacking. Just as there are several things lacking in this meticulously constructed movie.<br/><br/>She confesses to a powerful infatuation with a naval officer (but they do not have sex).  She dances in a very flirtatious manner with a older, handsome Hungarian at a lavish party in a millionaire  friend's home (but they do not have sex).<br/><br/>At the same party Bill goes off arm-in-arm with two models (but they do not have sex). He embarks on a weird journey around New York. The daughter of a just-deceased patient kisses him in the same room where her dead pa is lying in bed (but they do not have sex). He goes to a hooker's decrepit apartment and pays her $150 (but they do not have sex). At considerable expense and trouble, Bill then goes to an very exclusive orgy at a magnificent out-of-town mansion (where everyone but he has sex). If this is not proof that doctors are grossly overpaid, I do not know what is.<br/><br/>As George Bernard Shaw said about the institution of marriage, Bill's horribly expensive trip combines the maximum of temptation with the maximum of opportunity. Yet he is either too scared or too faithful to his wife (who is far more gorgeous than any of his potential illicit sexual partners) to take advantage of any of the chances laid before him. He constantly flies close the flame, but does not quite get burnt.<br/><br/>The film is obviously ambitious in so many ways: its meticulous recreation of New York within an English studio, the lavish sets, the impeccable performances from the entire cast, its superlative craftmanship. I particularly appreciated the SOUND...the ticking of the clock in the dead patient's bedroom, the thump of the wooden staff on the floor during the quasi-religious ritual before the orgy. Stanley Kubrick elicits the most intense and moving performance I have ever seen from Tom Cruise. Admittedly, this is like talking about the hottest day ever in Finland, but praise where praise is due.<br/><br/>The story becomes progressively more enthralling, if you can tolerate its 2.5+ hours of plot development. The scenes at the ""masked ball"" ritual and orgy reek with menace, before and after Bill's exposure before the wealthy degenerates -especially when they threaten him and his family. Their diabolical threats are seemingly underlined in the utterly chilling scene where Bill enters his bedroom after the ball....<br/><br/>Yet the film as a whole is oddly disappointing. It contains so many unresolved elements, such as the costume shop owner and his ""daughter""'s apparently promiscuous conduct. Is she really his daughter? Why does her ""father"" act as the outraged father when he finds her with two men during the night, yet as an ingratiating pimp the next morning? Does the luckless pianist Nick survive the degenerates' wrath after telling Bill about the time and venue of the  orgy? Is Bill's evil millionaire friend (well played by Sidney Pollock) telling the truth about Nick and the deceased party girl? Why does Bill react in such a bizarre manner to his adored wife's honest confessions of sexual fantasies - NOT physical infidelities? The atheist Kubrick seems to be adopting the Biblical principle that to look at a woman (or man) lustfully is the same as actual fornication.<br/><br/>Possibly, as one reviewer suggested, Alice is merely inflaming the rather dull Bill's sexual imagination, rather than his jealousy. In which case, why not indulge his libido with his beautiful, loving, faithful and lawfully wedded spouse? For a guy bright enough to be a successful doctor, he is too dumb to recognise a good thing under his own nose.<br/><br/>If these loose ends were present in a film by any other director, they would be criticised as sloppiness. As it is the late great Kubrick, we are supposedly expected to regard them as profound or enigmatic. It is all the more disappointing in view of the extraordinary length of the project's creation...the longest film shoot in history, talk of 100 takes for every scene. If a fraction of that time and effort had gone into a more coherent screenplay, I am sure the end result would have been more satisfactory.<br/><br/>It is worthwhile correcting some of the crazier rumours which circulated before the film's release. Bill and Alice are respectively an ordinary doctor and an ex-art gallery manager - NOT psychiatrists/sexologists. Tom Cruise does NOT wear a blue dress...pity, it might have enlivened the stodgier early half of the movie.<br/><br/>After seeing most of Kubrick's films, I remember them as an indispensable part of my film education and the best times I have spent in cinemas. I keenly anticipated Eyes Wide Shut. I loved parts of it, but feel sad that he did not leave a better farewell letter."

I won't give too much away, but what basically, Bill (tom) has a desire to cheat on his wife Alice ( nicole), and Bill stumbles upon a cult.<br/><br/>The way the movie was made was very well done.  Stanley Kubrick, like in Barry Lyndon, used mostly natural light, to light most of the scenes.  The direction is simple, yet artistic, and Kubricks trademark steadicam movements ring true. The music is very well done, and at times, very spooky, especially the organ music during the cult sequences.  Tom and Nicoles acting is first rate, and i won't be suprised if they win oscars for their acting, especially Nicole.  Nicole's acting was very impressive.<br/><br/>What suprised me was, that it wasn't just an erotic thriller, but I found the film to be a minor Dark Comedy.  The film was unusually funny at times, shocking other times.  The ending is just like Kubricks other films: abrupt, which i absouletly love, because you can think for yourselves what will happen next.  I predict that Eyes Wide Shut will do very well during the Oscars. I consider this one of Mr. Kubricks best! Go see this film.

","Even though I have loved nearly every Kubrick film ever made, I could not stand Eyes Wide Shut.  Why he felt the need to invent such a comically contrived plot and setting to examine such a basic and realistic subject -- marital fidelity and its attendant emotional baggage -- is beyond me. Kubrick, who by all accounts was an  isolated and detached man, simply does not seem capable of realistically portraying a marriage in jeopardy.  I have a happy marriage, but something tells me that it would not take 100 millionaires dressed as monks, 50 prostitutes, and a possible murder cover-up for me to realize that the wife and I had difficulties we needed to discuss. Apparently Kubrick felt that that was necessary to get his points across.  Instead of making me think, he made me laugh. Unfortunately, that was probably not his intention."

The storyline was a little over-the-top. Why the strong reaction over his wife's fantasy? Clearly, this is not a movie for the masses.

Was it worth the wait?<br/><br/>The answer is an astounding yes.  To reveal any of the film's circumstance would be criminal.  To say the least, the trailers and television commercials give away nothing.  Everything you've read in the press beforehand - about Cruise in a dress, Kidman fully nude, the two of them having explicit sex and using exotic drugs - that's all nonsense.  The film doesn't stray anywhere near pornographic, and the digital masking used to hide some of the sexual activity is the biggest joke I've ever heard from the MPAA.  I thought South Park nearly getting an NC-17 would take the cake. But I was wrong.  Fortunately, the digital masking was prepared by Kubrick, so you're not seeing something unfaithful to his vision, and the message still remains intact.  Nothing is lost in it, but I'm sure a few right wing people who believe that sex and language will destroy mankind, but think that guns are harmless, will probably sleep better tonight.  But I'll be up thinking about every little subtle thing in this film, and what a genius Kubrick was.  I'm sure he died and became the Starchild, from his masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br/><br/>Kubrick said before his death that this was, in his opinion, his best film ever.

"antisnka","Null","0","0","18 July 1999"," Brilliant in all respects, mesmerizing, surreal, haunting... Kubrick's best film.
","Two words come to mind when I think of Stanley Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut.  Those words are ""masterpiece"" and ""perfection"".  The film is so skillfully constructed that often times I was lulled by the mesmerizing visuals on screen into a hypnotic sort of trance.<br/><br/>The movie is the story of Bill and Alice Harford's (Cruise and Kidman) experiences over a four day period.  Cruise is in every scene in the movie and Kidman is not, and although her performance might be considered supporting, come award time, I'd put her in the lead actress category.  The film would be nothing without her character.  The film would be nothing without Kidman, in fact.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch; Kidman's performance deserves an Oscar, and Cruise delivers better in this movie than he has ever in the past. Sydney Pollack is exceptional as a lustful millionaire who invites the couple to a party and later reenters Bill's life in an unexpected way.  Marie Richardson takes on what was once Jennifer Jason Leigh's role and pulls it off nicely.<br/><br/>The soon to be (in)famous orgy scene is impossible to discuss without mentioning the way in which the studio (with or without Kubrick is unknown, at least to me) digitally added figures to cover certain sex acts that were deemed too explicit by the MPAA.  In my opinion, this alteration was not all that distracting; if no one had mentioned to me that it had been altered, I would have noticed nothing.  In fact, the way that people were watching those acts the way they did (men in cloaks, nude women arm in arm, etc.) was rather chilling.<br/><br/>Either way, the scene works, and the film succeeds.  The score is haunting and appropriate (I especially enjoyed the use of an accordion-style waltz accompanying the opening credits).  Eyes Wide Shut is a landmark as a visual achievement: The sets are remarkable, from the modern apartment of Bill and Alice to the gothic period piece in which the orgy takes place.  Larry Smith's camera varies from claustrophobic closeups and stills to floating dream-like imagery (although I suspect Kubrick shot many of the scenes himself).<br/><br/>A film that takes tremendous risks such as Eyes Wide Shut can only be one by an indubitably brave filmmaker.  Stanley Kubrick said on his deathbed that he had made the best film of his career.  I think I might have to agree. This film is exceptional in every atom of its being."

","Okay, I'll confess now.  I'm a diehard Kubrick fan.  I knew I was going to like this film before I knew it existed.  Even so, this movie did not disappoint.<br/><br/>First off, Cruise and Kidman have the comfortable married thing down cold. Many of the subtleties and nuances in their common discourse may be lost, however, on those without any marital experience.  No one will miss the sexual tension brought on by the first party they attend together (although ""together"" may not be the right word, as they spend nearly every minute of it apart).  Every giggle from Kidman, every smile from Cruise, makes the taboo of marital infidelity so much more real.  Unlike the cartoon characters of soaps, these characters have feelings for each other in addition to the animalistic desires (often for those other than our spouses) that cause Man's ultimate demise.  That love for each other makes the fall all the more traumatic and, in this film, dramatic, as you have little idea what will happen next.<br/><br/>After Kidman lights the powderkeg that will become Cruise's decent into sexual depravity, the viewer has to wonder who the victim is here.  Is it the faithful, though flirtatious, wife who merely fantasizes about infidelity?  Or is it the naive, unattentive husband, driven into a libidinous stupor by the vitriolic fantasies to which his wife subjects him? Whomever one chooses, this film takes the viewer on a phantasmagoric journey through the minefield which is human sexuality -- one where not only the flesh of one partner is at stake, but the soul of a marriage as well."

"matt-201","Null","0","0","18 July 1999"," Wild Orchid 2 with soaring aspirations
","The last and least of Kubrick's twelve extant features, EYES WIDE SHUT suggests a wistful postscript to the theme that dominated the director's career: the turning of men into machines. In EYES, the machinelike master director yearns to be a man--to make a non-misogynistic, non-misanthropic movie that sits at eye level with its characters, viewing them with empathy rather than lordly detachment. <br/><br/>That the attempt is a sad botch stems first from Kubrick's choice of scenarist. Frederic Raphael is a witty and craftsmanlike British screenwriter who left the movie scene (more or less) after writing DARLING and TWO FOR THE ROAD. One can only speculate that Kubrick chose the sixtyish Brit to tell the story of an attractive, upwardly mobile Central Park West couple (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) because he wanted a brainy but controllable foot soldier to do his bidding. (Kubrick touched up Raphael's script.)<br/><br/>Kubrick's and Raphael's incomprehension of contemporary sexual mores, the details of behavior and language that are specific to late-nineties America, gives this adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle"" a generic, uninvestigated, sketched-in feel. Unlike the phony-looking Vietnam backdrops shot in England for FULL METAL JACKET, the upscale-Manhattan ambience of EYES isn't meant to be deliberately stylized and out-of-time; it just rings phony, flat. And the flatfooted approach to scene-building that's charming in a movie like THE SHINING--where, in beginner's fashion, Kubrick opens scenes with handshakes and hellos and ends them with goodbyes--squashes whatever atmospherics Kubrick intends here. A fairly simple night-on-the-wild-side tale is molasses'd into coma by Kubrick's plodding.<br/><br/>Visually generally undistinguished--except for a near-autistic fascination with the trippy properties of Christmas-tree lights--and clotted with dreadful bit players (Kubrick's favorite style of acting seems to be found in the featured parts in Hammer horror movies), EYES suggests a grotesquely attenuated episode of RED SHOE DIARIES. The problem is that our experience of sexuality has changed since Kubrick first announced plans for this movie, before the release of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE--but somehow the period stretching from amyl nitrate and herpes to Monica's cigar didn't reach Kubrick Manor, where the height of id-run-amok is depicted as a group of medieval-styled swingers staging a sort of Benedictine theme orgy. <br/><br/>When the hero is meant to be chastened and shattered by his experience of Sex Untrammeled, you can only stare at the screen in bafflement. Are we really meant to think that a wealthy, good-looking doctor--surely a one-time raging frat boy--has spent his adult life in New York City and never encountered drag queens, fetish balls, subway perverts, winking hookers? Tom Cruise's performance as the regular guy undone is the best thing about the movie. His boyishness and air of unsinkability, so dull when placed in synch with a go-for-it Simpson-Bruckheimer movie, gives energy and poignancy to what would otherwise be a strictly academic exercise. Nicole Kidman is an able actress who's wrecked by Kubrick's direction--which seems to be modeled after the ticking metronome David Mamet uses to hypnotize his actors like chickens. Her giggly-airhead business in the first scenes seems to be roiling toward a boil, but then Kubrick hands her a pot-smoking big-revelation scene that seems to have been paced after the fashion of an exposition-fest in an Ed Wood movie. Blam--Kidman gets vaporised by the doomsday machine.<br/><br/>What's touching about EYES WIDE SHUT is both that the Schnitzler material seems to have meant a lot to Kubrick, and that he had no idea what it meant. Kubrick just didn't trust himself, or didn't trust that it would be commercially sound, to give Schnitzler's ideas their proper language--free-form Expressionist poetry. Fearing becoming David Lynch, he turned himself into Adrian Lyne. Kubrick clearly took pains to make a movie that wasn't ""clinical,"" sex-negative, girly-objectifying. But he also seems to have lost what he wanted the material to say. What's left is an ""erotic thriller"" paced like a late Rossellini movie. It's possible that Kubrick, a valedictorian at thesis-making, didn't have the understanding of the soft insides of human beings to make this kind of movie. Or, sadder still, nearing the age of seventy, he didn't have the energy to bring it together."

But it is NOT an erotic movie, despite the titillating aspect of frequent nudity. You soon get used to the nudity (intentionally, I think) and hopefully get over it so you can begin to digest the REAL story - that emotional and physical aspects of the human psyche are so intertwined with our ""normal"" daily-life-selves, they are inseparable, volatile; and affect us in ways we don't think about often, until a situation comes about that brings the issue to the forefront. And the real story in this film is presented & handled masterfully by the ensemble, under the absolute GENIUS of Mr. Kubrick. This certainly should've earned him that elusive ""Best Director"" Oscar; but thanks to the improper type-casting (of genre, ""near pornographic""??!?) the media has pronounced upon this film, that seems unlikely.

"PurityofEssence100","4","0","0","18 July 1999"," Great effort wasted on bad story
","Stanley Kubrick once said of making a good film, ""if you have good actors and a good story it almost doesn't matter how you put the thing together."" In case you ever wanted to know what kind of film you might get if you happen to have good actors and a bad story we now have an answer.  It's called Eyes Wide Shut.<br/><br/>More than any other director Kubrick was always able to sniff out a great story.  Often the stories he chose to make became emblems for an entire a generation: witness such works as 2001, Dr Strangelove, or a Clockwork Orange.  One can only wonder then what on Earth was he thinking when he decided to make this film.  For the story premise of Eyes Wide Shut is singularly awful.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around the psychological and emotional tailspin Tom Cruise's character is thrown into when his wife (Nicole Kidman) confesses a sexual fantasy she once had for a sailor.  A fantasy, I might add, she never acted upon.  It is the imagined picture of his wife being humped by an unknown sailor that is, if you'll pardon the pun, the driving narrative force, propelling Cruise, as a New York doctor, on a journey to lift the lid on the many dimensions of his own repressed sexual desires - necrophilia, and so on.<br/><br/>Now to start with, what's absolutely unconvincing is this film's very premise - that his wife's confession could throw Tom into such turmoil.  I'm sorry I just don't buy it.  And each time the film cuts again, and again to the black and white image of the Kidman/sailor imagined humpfest the more unconvincing the premise gets.  Then, what's even worse is the sexual/psychological journey Tom end ups actually traveling - from heart of gold prostitute, to nutty costume shop owner, to masked orgy.  It's simultaneously so trite and so bizarre as to be laughable.  Which is really too bad because much of the rest of the film is pretty good.  I mean, Kubrick certainly knows how to make a movie.  Technically the film is a pleasure to watch.  The camera movements, the sets, the lighting, even the acting is marvelous.   And some scenes in and of themselves are great.  There's a wonderful bit between Cruise and a gay hotel clerk.  And another one between Cruise and a grieving woman which borders on David Lynch.  As the woman sits next to her father's corpse, and Cruise tries to comfort her, she suddenly confess her love (and lust) and begins to shove her tongue down Tom's throat.  It's all really quite funny.<br/><br/>There is some good stuff here.  It's just too bad it's all held together by such a miserable and unconvincing premise."

","When a couple have been married for nine years, as the ones portrayed by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in Stanley Kubrick's final film, one supposes that they know all the intimate details of each others lives. But such is not the case in this engrossing study of a marriage.<br/><br/>Kubrick weaves a tapestry that is rich in symbolism, set on the margins of reality, and lushly filmed in a New York City which looks slightly alien, erotic and mysterious. In fact, the events of the script leave a wide margin of doubt as to where reality ends and one's dream fantasy life begins.<br/><br/>With a deliberate, slow pace, the audience and the players are constantly teased, led down false paths, confused, all in an effort to strip away the layers and layers of protection that we all construct in our relationships and in our lives, literally the very masks with which we present ourselves to the outside world, and even in our most intimate liaisons.<br/><br/>Reminding me of earlier works by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, including ""Persona"" and ""Wild Strawberries"", the psychological novels and social commentaries of Henry James and Edith Warton, the film has Kubrick's unique imprint composed of endless details, lushly lighted sets that look like Rembrandt or Vermeer paintings, and dark street scenes evoking menace and mystery, and not unlike scenes from ""Blade Runner"" or even the cult classic ""Around Midnight"".<br/><br/>The women that fascinate Cruise's character in the film are all variations of his cinematic and real-life wife, Nicole Kidman, in eroticism, hair color and other body features. In one screening, it is very difficult to recall all the nuances and revelations of meaning. Like some other Kubrick masterpieces, including ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""2001"", and ""Full Metal Jacket"" each viewing should unlock new layers of truths. I give Eyes Wide Shut very high marks for serious cinema fare, though many might enjoy it just for its stunning look and beautiful actors."

","The first half of an hour of Eyes Wide Shut sets the mood for the entire film by engrossing the audience in a spectacular looking and sounding ballroom scene.

Kubrick's formal elements only enhance the deep yet simplistic story of Bill Harford's (Cruise) contemplation of whether a couple can love each other both physically and emotionally.  The story does not have the typical rising action and climactic plot-line as in many movies; instead it involves a number of sequences that helps Bill make his final decision.  Unfortunately the atypical structure will leave many audience members wondering what is happening and where everything leads.  The infamous orgy scene leads to a number of possibilities, but, as in real life, not everything is a detective thriller and not everything ties together.  Overall, the movie does not let down the person looking for more than just a simple tell-me-the-meaning film, instead it plays way above the lowest-denominator audience and begs the viewer to actually think about the meaning of the story and generate their own opinions."

","I was extremely disappointed with ""Eyes Wide Shut"", for a number of reasons. The first, which is unfortunately no fault of Kubrick, Cruise, or Kidman, is that part of the marketing campaign was to NOT disavow any of the rumors about the plot of this movie.  My understanding, at the time I was walking into the theater, was that I was about to see a movie about a married couple, both of whom happen to be sex therapists, who explore their mutual sexual fantasies.  Sorry to spoil things for you, folks... the movie has nothing to do with that.  in fact (sorry ladies) Tom Cruise never has sex in this film.  Granted, it's equally disappointing when a movie trailer reveals the best scenes of a movie, but in this instance, i felt totally misled.<br/><br/>Reason number two:  3 hours of very slow, dragging, film.  I felt there were numerous scenes that could have been trimmed.  There were a number of supporting characters who have moderately lengthy scenes, for no payoff whatsoever.  Why the lengthy scene at the costume rental shop, when we could just see Cruise in a costume, and ASSUME he managed to get one?<br/><br/>Reason number 3:  I had little or no emotional attachment to the cold, machine-like Cruise, and no sympathy for Kidman, who laughs at her husband while revealing a past sexual fantasy with another man, and her willingness to jeopardize her own marriage over it.<br/><br/>There are aspects of this movie that are deep and interesting.  Even in the 24 hours since I've seen the film, I've found some deeper insight after reflecting on it.  However, I'd recommend that you wait for this to hit the $1.50 rental rack, instead of rushing to the multiplex to catch it!"

The digital alterations during the ""Orgy"" sequence, while not disruptive, have corrupted the director's vision. The Studio's decision to add these images has betrayed the viewers and the very principle Kubrick worked his whole life to convey. This, and the shoebox ending, are possibly its only flaws.

","Eyes Wide Shut is a very different film to say the least. You can gather that by the title alone. It's supposed to be. It has an almost old-school style that involves an odyssey for the main character through the streets of New York. There are almost two threads to this movie, one of the adventures during a 24 hour period through Bill's mind and also his connection to his wife Alice. They won't come together until the end. The result is a film that has almost two climaxes, one in the middle and one near the end. Both are great scenes, especially the one in the middle, it has to be one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever put on film. You might not see the climax at the end coming, or wonder how it could be even possible, but it's incredibly appropriate. You also get a film that has meticulously crafted interiors that you see both in the night and the morning after. The problem of having a thematic climax in the middle is that the ""morning after"" scenario can get a little boring, but that contrasts the great rising action in the first half. But by the second half you have even more to think about.<br/><br/>The film is a great way of expressing the philosophy through colors; there are references to rainbows and colors that go out of their way to be symbolic. This is definitely one of the best ""dream worlds"" ever pictured. While some of the dialogue is a little far-fetched (like the philosophical argument husband and wife get into) much of it is very realistic communication. You really get the idea that the characters don't know what they are going to say next. The film has a wit all of its own. Eyes Wide Shut is an experimental film that uses an old framework (an odyssey, chronicles of secondary characters that are met on the way, and even chorus elements) that you won't see very much of today in movies and it succeeds. Eyes Wide Shut is a film where the chorus (the secret society) is able to communicate with and control the main character. If you want philosophy you can keep coming back to, this film is for you. If you want entertainment and happen to be a patient person, I guarantee this will hold your attention. It's especially absorbing the first time through. Don't expect a sexual romp, though. People are just starting to think this one out, one day it will probably be regarded as 2001 is today, though it may never have the same mainstream appeal because of its content matter."

Those who don't ""get"" EWS I dismiss as uncultured couch potatoes who should stick to watching Maury Povich.<br/><br/>Peter Greenaway made a profound statement about art. He said: ""Think of what a work of art demands of it's audience"". And Peter was absolutely correct. If you know ANYTHING about Kubrick, you know that he does things on his terms. The casual moviegoer who munches his popcorn looking to have 2 hours killed by being CATERED to came to the wrong movie.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is an unquestioned masterpiece which I could not stop thinking about for a MONTH after I left the theatre. Tom Cruise I feel topped his acting job in Born on the Fourth of July (which I felt strongly he could NEVER do). The ignorance of the ""Academy"" is staggering. EWS was the best film of the 90's (followed closely by Akira Kurosawa's Dreams & Trainspotting).<br/><br/>Kubrick engages the viewer who (to quote Spielberg) ""gives it up"" for his vision. You will be richly rewarded if you will suspend all preconceived notions of what this movie ""will be like"". It is so different, so beautiful, and so INTERESTING that I cannot find fault with it.

"evilmatt-3","9","0","0","17 July 1999"," An exceedingly complex film that demands multiple viewings
","Anyone familiar with Kubrick knows going in what to expect: a surreal world in which characters interact in what on the surface seem to be inconsequential ways, while beneath the surface other conflicts and storylines rage and churn. So it is: it seemed to me that although in the strictest sense nothing really happens in this film, the conflict and tension are greater than almost any other film I've seen.<br/><br/>Kubrick has this way of expanding the film experience to the viewer, and nowhere is it more apparent than here. We are hit with a barrage of stimuli and expected to piece together the story and thematic elements ourselves. Only a truly masterful film such as this one can attempt such a thing and succeed so well. For example, Kubrick's use of colors (and rainbows of course) to represent emotional states or silence to indicate an inescapable situation are as universal as they are powerful.<br/><br/>One really needs to see this film multiple times. By the time you figure out exactly what the film is doing, you've missed enough elements that another viewing is imperative.

","""What a bunch of weird crap"" I loudly proclaimed after we watched ""Eyes Wide Shut""; but I cannot get it out of my head and I'm writing this in the hope that it will make it go away. This is a very grown up movie. Kubrick takes his characters, his actors and his adult audience places they all know about but don't want to go, at least not in ""decent company"".<br/><br/>
I never did understand ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), but I guessed it was about life, the universe and everything. I wish I couldn't understand ""Eyes Wide Shut"" because it's about everyman (generic!), with Kubrick playing psychotherapist. Under our clothes we are all naked, and even the Queen starts the day on the throne, toilet paper in hand. We put on our uniforms to pretend we are different, and so we don't have to confront the reality underneath. Kubrick's titles sequence uses these facts and tells us we're in for a rough ride.<br/><br/>Is the plot thin? Does the plot matter? Like Bogart and Bacall's ""The Big Sleep"" (1946), it's not the plot that matters here, but rather what is really going on in individual scenes as snapshots of different angles of everyman's psyche. If you want a more substantial plot, add what has gone before for yourself .... if you know. (Alice's last words may be a clue). In any event, Kubrick's view was that ""a film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.""<br/><br/>As a mirror held up to our dark side, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" did not disturb me as profoundly as did ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" (1977) - but it came close. As for the exotic, Peter Greenaway probably does it better in ""Prospero's Books"" (1991) or ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover"" (1989). Where it is really dangerous, is in the confusion it inevitably generates between its characters and the real life people who portray them. In this it is reminiscent of Taylor and Burton in ""The Taming of the Shrew"" (1967) and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (1966). Only I'm convinced this confusion in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is deliberate; Kubrick is too good for it to be otherwise. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, Kubrick didn't live long enough to see the extent to which he had scored a direct hit.<br/><br/>Is this a good movie? Without doubt. Did I enjoy it? I'm not sure I was meant to. Did I understand it? I'm not saying! Will most adults understand it? Yes, probably - but I really don't want to know that."

","Stanley Kubrick was a director who was said to have made a number of masterpieces among his movies.I don't consider ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to be<br/><br/>among them.<br/><br/>Although Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman(who is nicely photographed in this movie,although some of the shots of her become tiresome after a while)were still married in real life when this movie was made, they appear to lack passion together in this movie.<br/><br/>When I first found out about this movie,I went to see it in the movies and walked out part of the way through because I found it<br/><br/>to be too slow and not interesting.I saw it on video,however,and although it seemed slightly less slow on tape than it did in<br/><br/>the theater,it is still a disappointing movie,I think,for several<br/><br/>other reasons.<br/><br/>1) It is a movie that could have been a half hour shorter and been more effective. 2) The plot is not all that strong;Cruise's sexual odyssey is not an overly big deal in that more doesn't happen with him<br/><br/>than does,although he is on that odyssey in reaction to what his wife DIDN'T do with the sailor.Also,the last third of the<br/><br/>movie rings flat,especially with the scenes where the mask that Cruise wore at the orgy is in bed next to Kidman and where<br/><br/>Cruise met with Sydney Pollack at the end(which was a weak ""wrap up"" scene,so to speak.) 3) Although the women looked fairly good and there was a lot of nudity and sex in this movie,it WAS NOT a movie that was erotic,in my opinion.I think that the promotion for this movie was in OVERKILL mode over how erotic this movie was going to be.It was a cold movie and not anything that would be that exciting,so to speak.The orgy scene was more weird than anything that would be a turn on,not to mention that the music is overbearing. 4) Finally,the ending was one of those scenes that could be described as a case of ""What?"".That was a weak ending to a movie that is on the ridiculous side and seems to have run out of steam before the end.<br/><br/>In short,this was not a terrible movie,but not the greatest of endings for Kubrick's career and a disappointing movie for both Cruise and Kidman,although they both can act very well and have done so in their movies.I give this movie a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.<br/><br/>One final comment on ""Eyes Wide Shut"",DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! well.The story was not there for them this time."

","The first thing you see is Kidman dropping her dress, then the title, Eyes Wide Shut.  This really sets the pace for the rest of the film.  It is true Kubrick.  The entire movie is engrossed in dreamscapes and warm, washed colors.  I can safely say I've never seen anything like it, which is much of its appeal, never knowing what is going to happen next.  Every scene is massive and compelling.  I never knew Kidman could act this well.  There are no wasted lines or images, everything has meaning.  Everything in this movie is so purposeful, it's a joy to watch.  It's all very realistic, much of the film feels not like a movie but like watching the darker sides of real life. It is a masterpiece."

","I used to wonder why some people would want to post two or even more comments on the same movie on IMDB, but when I bought a copy of Eyes Wide Shut the other day and saw the film for a fourth time, I decided to update my comment from last year, which, although it goes on just about forever, seemed a bit inconclusive.<br/><br/>I still stand by my original rating: a seven, or, having switched to star -or asterisk- rating: *** out of ****.<br/><br/>This film is open for interpretation, and your appreciation of this film is largely depending on how you interpret it. A lot of people on this pages have interpret this film in an intellectual way that works for them; unfortunately many of these people feel sublime and openly resent the people who didn't like this film. Many of the people who gave this film a negative review are more down to earth and DO have a point when they state that if Kubrick hadn't been involved in the film, it wouldn't have received so much attention.<br/><br/>Many people are quite harsh on Cruise's performance, calling his performance wooden, a performance on the automatic pilot. I think Cruise's acting is just fine -- it's his character who is wooden. Dr. Bill is a passive individual who makes the impression that he didn't spend enough time on the streets. He constantly flashes his medical license, as if to justify his every move to others; he repeats almost everything that is said to him, suggesting his insecurity; his many smiles are forced, insincere; he constantly crosses his arms, another sign of insecurity, a sign of shutting himself off. This is a person who watches, but does not dare touch. 'I'm in your hands', he tells the friendly prostitute he stumbles upon. The story of his life. Not a very enterprising chap.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, although Dr. Bill might be one complex dude, it doesn't make him particularly interesting (or challenging for the actor) -- and he is in almost every frame of this 160 minute film. His sexual odyssey isn't all that interesting either. There is no firework in this film. Stephen King called ""The Shining"" a firecracker that failed to go off in the end, but EWS exist entirely of scenes that go out with a wimp. Every scene is a joke without a punchline, without dramatic payoff. I think this, too, was done intentionally: the presence of Alan Cumming's roundly criticized gay hotel clerk and the clinical, detached orgy with its not very erotic parade of Baywatch-extras are a direct result of Dr. Bill's state of mind. It has been suggested that a lot of Dr. Bill's odyssey takes place in his head. With his superficial and not very creative mind, he reduces everyone, including his wife Alice, to stereotypes he's seen on television or read about in a book. Bill says Alice looks great without looking (he just expects her to look perfect, to be the faithful wife and mother) and when she tells him a perfectly innocent seven year itch fantasy, he simply can't handle it. (not unlike the Heather Donahue character from ""Blair Witch"", Dr. Bill takes a lot for granted; expects things to go a certain way, and when it doesn't, he doesn't know what to do, he looses his grip).<br/><br/>Thus begins his journey through nightly Manhattan and his encounters with erotic cliche's: the Julia Roberts-esque hooker whom you'd actually like to take home and introduce to mom; the Lolita; the feminine homosexual; the orgy where girls straight out of Playboy magazine have suggestive, Playboy channel-style sex. (and don't forget Bill's visualisation of his wife's adultary, which looks like a straight-to-video cheapy). But, in the cold light of day, reality comes crashing in. He learns the friendly hooker has aids and Lolita's father doesn't disapprove of his daughter's behavior anymore; on the contrary, he's even more than happy to cash in on his daughter's premature sexual activities.<br/><br/>Again, enough room for a variety of interpretations, but the film itself never becomes really interesting or stirring.<br/><br/>I agree with the people who say the film is too long. I didn't really care for the boring 'let's wrap it up in a neat package'-scene with Pollack and Cruise (although it is for us to decide whether the lad was or wasn't telling Dr. Bill the truth). This scene came about 2 1/2 hours in the film; at a point where I just didn't care anymore. I think this is the longest dialogue-scene in Kubrick's oeuvre, and it made painfully obvious that the man was a visual director, not an actor's director. (those who read co-writer Frederick Raphael's insipid memoir ""Eyes Wide Open"" know who's really to blame for the inclusion of this scene). After that long, long scene, it still wasn't over yet. I saw the movie twice in the theatre and at this point, many people became extremely restless and clearly wanted it to come to an end. When the screen finally went to black, most people uttered a sigh of relief and immediately got out of there. Four or five people stayed for the closing credits.<br/><br/>I also agree with the many, many people who found this film's musical theme, Ligeti's Musica Ricercata II, very annoying. It really gets on your nerves. This film's main theme should have been Liszt's Grey Clouds, a similar but much more subtle piece that can be heard in the morgue scene.<br/><br/>So, as is the case with most of Kubrick's films, there's lots of room for interpretation. But whereas those films are also powerful and rewarding when you just sit back for the experience, that's not the case with EWS. Kubrick's 2001, for example, was far more enigmatic, but few people felt the need to analyze it as the film's sincerity and brilliance was clear and present. Analyzing EWS isn't the bonus of enjoying the film on another level; coming up with our own intellectual interpretation of the weak material is the only way to convince ourselves that EWS, too, is a masterpiece. But in resolving to this form of auto-eroticism for the mind, we actually allow ourselves to live in denial, to keep our own eyes wide shut.<br/><br/>Even Kubrick's best work has its share of minor flaws, but in the case of EWS there are very few merits.<br/><br/>Then why do I still give this film *** out of ****? I guess because I recognized a lot of myself in Cruise's behavior and mannerisms. That was sorta nice and it worked therapeutically. And there are some fine scenes in this film: the smoking dope scene had its moments; the run-in with the 'rowdy college students' is a fine moment; the scene in the morgue and the short scene where Cruise comes home from work and chats with his wife an daughter, are all echoes of Kubrick's genius and seem to belong in a better film.<br/><br/>Keeping in mind that Kubrick often worked on a film even after it premiered, I think, that if he hadn't died on March the 8th 1999, he probably would have reduced EWS's runningtime, tightening its pacing and perhaps even deleting Pollack's long, long explanation.<br/><br/>Anyway, liking or disliking EWS has got nothing to with how intelligent you are. If you were disappointed by the film, I really can't blame you; if you DID like the film, you apparently had the time and willingness to consider this film as the sort of puzzle where, in the end, you had to decide for yourself if you solved it or not.<br/><br/>Again, *** out of ****"

","Stanley Kubrick has finally answered the question asked in my college Lit-Crit class: If somebody is a genius, are they ALWAYS a genius?<br/><br/>Apparently, NO.<br/><br/>If you don't like gratuitous nudity and lots of it (which, by the way I do!) then this movie has little to offer. I won't rehash the plot here, except to say that the same script, same cast, same director could have played this as a farce, and had a heck of a film on their hands.

"Auselan","Null","0","0","19 August 2001"," A shame it ruined their marriage
","This film is like an opera, with its the classical soundtrack complementing the staged, almost balletic, ballroom party and séance scenes.  It's use of suspense is not cheap, but very deliberate in its restraint: the audience does not hold its breath in anticipation of an unlikely murder but in fear lest Nicole Kidman's soliloquy should reveal a past infidelity.  This is the suspense of real life, and it is powerful.  Infidelity is one of the greatest fear lovers can entertain, and, as such, Kubrick does not need to elaborately assault ones pulses with anything more sensational to get an intense response from his audience.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is a narrative hyperbole of a couple having a fight; a modern day rendering of an ancient blame story.  Eve welcomes evil into her bosom and into humanity when she decides to test Adam's love (if you love me, she suggests, you will eat the apple).  Adam, the focus of the story, is innocent and unprotected.  As with the Garden of Eden story, it is the woman in Kubrick's tale, with all her testing ways, that initiates sin: from the very start, the audience is made suspicious of the woman who is portrayed as the instigator of the bad feeling as she indelicately goes to the toilet while her husband is sorting out his tie.<br/><br/>The couple (unemployed Kidman and Dr Cruise) leave for a party where they do their social duty, separate and go mingle.  Kidman goes off in her state of pent up frustration, inebriates herself on champagne and tolerates the addresses of a slimy Bulgarian who slow dances with her and whispers insinuations in her ears (like the snake whispering in Eve's ear).  Yet the fact that he is too old to be any real attraction suggests that her flirtations are designed for a different end: to aggravate her husband.<br/><br/>She warily spots him receiving the attentions of two beautiful models while she is slow dancing, and her motives for making him jealous are thus subtly linked to her own insecurities and fears.  Yet neither of them commit adultery and they go home in one piece.  He kisses her, while she, with psychotic wide-eyed frustration, allows him: she is in a dangerous mood. Up until the fight the main tension - the carrot held before our noses - is the apprehension that adultery will be committed and that this couple will be destroyed.  It is truly terrifying for we actually care about them and value their relationship: they seem to have a lot to loose.<br/><br/>In the fight scenario she gives the age old complaint that the only reason why he does not cheat on her is because he doesn't want to hurt her, not because he doesn't desire other women.  He expresses the age old failure of the uninitiated male to take into account the effect other men's desire must inevitably have on her if she really is a creature that simply responds to male desire.  If she simply responds to his desire, doesn't she instinctively respond to other men's desire too?  These are her testing insinuations.  What follows is perhaps one of the most excruciatingly tense scenes in cinematic history as we wait with baited breath as Nicole, ever so slowly (the film is tantalisingly slow), relates what seems geared towards becoming an awful confession of adultery.  In fact it does not conclude like this but turns out to be a mere fantasy of adultery.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the damage has been done to our nerves as it has been done to the traumatised Cruise's (the film is experienced from his perspective). The fear of adultery lessens, partly because she has just committed it in her mind and partly because we loose faith in the director's control as we presume that adultery is now inevitably necessary if any more emotion is to be extracted from us.  From then on one does not watch with such nerve edge tension but from a numbed blunted distance.  At this point in the film the adultery carrot has been prematurely devoured.  The fear of adultery has already been consummated.  Indeed, another carrot is added to the plot (the fear for the characters very lives) but the old adultery carrot is still the main, if shredded, one.<br/><br/>After the epiphany of Kidman's fantasy, Cruise leaves.  What follows that night is a bizarre chain of events for the doctor.  These include gate crashing a psycho orgy séance wherein an elaborate, crime and detective plot enters the film.  This plot cleverly calls into question the nature of illusion and reality: is it all the offspring of the doctor's disturbed imagination or, if real, is it pathetic (some sad aging perverts playing make believe) or sinister (some serious criminals).  Kubrick, to an extent, leaves the choice up to you.  I think there is more evidence for it all being a big farce: one of the main themes of the film is disguise or make believe (it is all a dream-nightmare for Cruise who's eyes are wide shut'). Cruise and the leak get out of the whole thing alive and the crucial corpse has simply died of a drugs overdose.  Nevertheless the connection between fantasy/dreaming and real life is subtly merged.  Playing with sex/violence (and they are synonymous when on screen) is both silly charade and serious perversion.<br/><br/>The sex/violence is, as in A Clockwork Orange, ritualised.  This makes it not quite as violent as sex usually is on screen.  The control of the act makes it dispassionate and, paradoxically, the lack of love in it makes it less violent  it is a performance.  Love is the violently passionate force in this film as in life.  It is Cruise and Kidman's love that is the dynamic force behind all of the terror and desire (whether true or false).  There is no romantic s***e: the adultery' scenes make one sick (as they would if they had happened to you).  There is no sense that betrayal is a turn on: it is a horrible nightmare world of deadened sensations, an un-sensual wallowing in unhappiness and self disgust.<br/><br/>The film is better than most.  But despite its intelligence and originality it does suffer from the old ironic' clichés.  The much overused undermining of Christmas was not particularly enlightening: yes Christmas is a family time of holiness, joy and peace and no it is not particularly shocking to discover that bad things happen at this time of year too and no it is not particularly disillusioning to discover a wholesome Christian couple worrying about adultery while keeping up a face of Christmas cheer for their child.  Get over it Hollywood, really.  It's not that clever.<br/><br/>The film verges on the pornographic  with sex scenes that are graphic, though easy to watch."

","I don't recall when I became a fanatical follower of Kubrick's.  Perhaps it was The Shining, or perhaps A Clockwork Orange.  What I do recall, though, is the fact that I was enthralled by such a technique; a technique which relinquishes all thought of art.  A movie is general, generic, but what Kubrick did was art, but in his own right it was film, he made film.  He exposed it, he framed it, he thought about it, he pondered it, he took it over and over and over again until it reached the level of being exhaustive....but when it was bathed in its chemical bath, that is when the celluloid turned into film, when it turned into a relative state of art.<br/><br/>Now I must admit, when I first heard that this piece was coming out, I could not believe it.  I respect Tom Cruise, the man has worked with some of the finest directors in American History, that has to say something.  When he was chosen, when I heard, I could not wait.  Actually, it was much more than that, but my words fail me at the moment, unfortunately.  Fast forward two years-plus, and you have Friday, June 16, 1999.  I thought I would die before I'd ever get to see this film.  Fortunately, I did not, I saw it and I was indifferent.  Since that time I have pondered about the film, have seen it two other times at the cinema and once more on DVD.  It was not his greatest work, I will be the first to admit that, but it was not a crap either.  Many were disappointed when 2001 came out, too abstract: now, it is untouchable, it is infallable.  EWS may not have been all that great, and analysts in the years to come may find excuses.  But here is one, and a darn good one:  It is Kubrick.  Kubrick made the film.  If anyone else would have attempted to make it, I would disagree, but, there are touches that he (Kubrick) had made throughout his career, that were evident on the piece. Therefore, enjoying Kubrick is to enjoy this film, and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Two years have already passed, and tonight, for the first time in a year, I will return to see it.  This is a plea, to all those who I am sure, ""know"" films: take a second shot at it.  Look at it again...but this time with eyes wide open."

When he laughs off her pot-inspired accusations, she tells him a story of a time when she really wanted to be unfaithful--not a time when she actually was, mind you, just a time she thought about it (and if Kidman weren't dressed in flimsy lingerie during the scene, it would have no interest at all--as it is, it's a dirty old man's mild wet dream). Cruise deals with his wife's shattering non-revelation by wandering the city at night, tentatively attempting to hunt up some stray bootie.<br/><br/>
As plot, only two sequences hold any surprises or interest. One involves Leelee Sobeskie in her underwear--I won't spoil it. The other is he famous setpiece which takes place at a super-secret party where everyone wears druid robes and ""Amadeus"" masks while they watch people screw (this is the scene which was infamously toned down with digitally superimposed figures covering up the simulated sex acts). <br/><br/>Neither sequence can save the film from its dull, ponderous pretend pretensions, however.

","I always ask myself two questions when crticizing a film. The first question is, ""What is this film trying to be?"". And the second, ""Did it succeed?"". In other words, I judge films on whether or not I feel that filmmaker accomplished what he set out to do. Holding films to a certain standard doesn't work for me - there's no point in comparing ""Porky's"" to ""Citizen Kane"". One is a intriguing portrait of an almost unknowable character, brilliantly painted through flashbacks of his associates with a thread of mystery thoughout which is finally revealed to the audience, but not the characters in the film, at the very end. The other is a rip-snorting goofball beer-and-pizza T and A movie with some pretty hilarious, if pedestrian, humor. Both films become exactly what they set out to be.<br/><br/>Given that method, I'm undecided about Stanley Kubrick's final film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"". This is not to say that I think it's a bad film. I was completely absorbed during the entire film...at times by the psychological conflict between the characters, at others by the bizarre suspense offered, but at all times by the photography. It is a magnificently crafted film. However, I'm not sure what Kubrick intended ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to be. It's not a character movie, although the characters are intriguing. It's not pornography, although the film is perpetually sexual. It's not a thriller, although there is suspense and tension. And it's not a horror movie, although at times it's very disturbing. Kubrick's films are usually fairly specific in tone or message, with technology running amok in ""2001: A Space Oddysey"", society run amok in ""A Clockwork Orange"", and stupidity running amok in ""Dr. Strangelove"". ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is certainly thought-provoking, but I'm not sure what Kubrick was going for. If his intention was to jar the viewer from one emotional state to another, the film is a great success.<br/><br/>
A fascinating aspect  and example of the emotional ping-ponging of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is that there is much sexuality in the film and much nudity, but rarely are the two occurring simutaneously. The entire film has an undercurrent of raw sexuality, however the nude scenes are mostly cold, clinical, or disturbing. The only time nudity and sexuality occur together, the actors involved are far from the camera and only peripherally part of the scene. The close up, in-your-face nude scenes are scenes of tension or peril, almost as if Kubrick was saying ""I'm going to wave this gorgeous nude woman before your eyes and not allow you to enjoy it!"" . Also, I should mention that as far as the nudity is concerned, this is a film for the guys: I can't remember if there was male nudity in the film...if there was, it was buried (so to speak) in the female nudity. So ladies, I can only tell you that there's not too much for you to look at as far as beefcake is concerned. But guys, I can only say two words to you: Nicole Kidman. And she ain't all there is in that department, either.<br/><br/>The photography, as in all of Kubrick's films, is at once stunning and exsquisite. I still can't quite identify exactly how Kubrick achieved the look of all his films, but the cinematography in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is distinctly Kubrick: it's so good that it's almost distracting. The lighting in this film is especially well done. It is either meticulously crafted to look like available light, or it actually is available light perfectly captured. It's really too good to tell. <br/><br/>It's difficult to say what I thought of ""Eyes Wide Shut"". It's definitely not for everyone, although I think it's a fitting farewell from the late Stanley Kubrick. Like life, dreams, nightmares and even death,  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is enigmatic and defies definition. It must be experienced personally."

","Delightful, if lugubrious, motion picture is so chock full of symbolism -- or so it would seem -- that the critics got tangled up, confused, and missed the big pic. Tom Cruise is Kubrick's ""A-Gay"" doctor, the kind of clean, prissy, masculine, smoldering -- and here's the point: -- urban homosexual who, succesful and glimpsing into the old-boys' decadence of privilege in the big city, gets the itch to see the rest of things. It's that urge we have to feel into our fathers' shoes, a big fat Freudian sex symbol.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is so fun to watch -- G*d only knows all the anguish some viewers got in their guts watching it, because Kubrick fully employs his now toungue-in-cheek style of existential doom and sobriety like so many lights on the Christmas trees in the film. Let it go, he says in this story, and feast on something as unsettling as a guy wanting sex, AIDS, buggery, lies, overdoses, anything that his partner can't have, or because the partner wants it!<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman, as the partner, deliver's one of Gaydom's hottest contemporary fantasies, the naval officer. (Remember Richard Gere in ""Officer...""?) The partner is an underused psychosexual term for one's wife or boyfriend or lover, who, in their efforts to integrate in relationship, unwittingly offer chances to be undermined as an individual. As with most of Kubrick's films, there is plenty of time to think about it amid the strangely grained visuals. It's like the deliberately muffled dialogue in ""Alien"" in reverse: Think and listen rather than view. Let the visuals lull you to think. A fun and intelligent story, like ""Eloise"" at the Plaza Hotel. Cruise, like Jodie Foster, is a well-thought-out careerist. Their movies flow through their lives like a logistics system. How's THAT for working the system?<br/><br/>Relax and enjoy a perverse and easy fable!"

What a shame! <br/><br/>The way in which the finishing scenes lacked some special ingredient makes me question whether Kubrick was still around in the final moments of the film's production.<br/><br/>The film could have done with being several minutes longer, so that the points it made could have been delivered more slowly allowing the tension to be ease off less abruptly."

","Eyes Wide Shut is not your ordinary story.  No simple exposition, no rising actions, no real climax to speak of, and one of the most awkward conclusions I've ever seen.  But if you've seen Stanley Kubrick's films you know that he doesn't direct a story, he directs a theme.  The theme of Eyes Wide Shut is sex and control.<br/><br/>To summarize the plot, (or rather, oversimplify) Tom Cruise plays a doctor named Bill, who goes on jealousy-driven quest for sexual retribution after his (hot) wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) heartlessly informs him that she has had explicit fantasies about another man.  What further ensues is something only a guy can understand and sympathize with(sorry ladies, but this film is clearly directed at us men).<br/><br/>Here's the crux of this movie.  When Alice describes her fantasy to her husband, it's more to her than just a fleeting attraction, more than a lingering lustful fancy, it's control.  She basically tells him that she can make a fool out of her husband by cheating on him, and there's nothing he can do about it.  She emasculates him and renders him powerless (what a b*tch).  It's not so much that she fantasized about a total stranger that bothers Bill, it's how much that fantasy captured his wife.  This is one of the most riveting and disturbing sequences for a guy, ever caught on film (second only to the `squeal-like-a-pig  scene in Deliverance).  The way this scene is done, it seems worse than hearing that your wife of 20 years has faked every orgasm, fantasizes about your brother while making love to you, and is now leaving you for another woman.  Kubrick, Cruise, and Kidman do this scene so well, nothing in reality can touch it.<br/><br/>From there, Dr. Bill launches a late night reconnaissance for his masculinity as defined by his sexuality.  He purchases a hooker, but doesn't follow through.  His conscience deals another blow to his male ego.  He gets harassed by a group of thugs who call him `faggot' and play him gay.  Yet another blow.  Desperate to one-up his wife's virtual folly, he sneaks in to an exclusive, ritualistic orgy (this sequence gave me the creeps for days). He gets caught after sneaking in and is humiliated in front of the whole orgy party.  Once again, his sense of control and ego are dealt another bruise.<br/><br/>The next morning, Dr. Bill revisits most all the people and places of the night before and discovers the illusion of validation and control by way of sex.<br/><br/>What I loved about the film is how Kubrick subtly sprinkles sex and erotica throughout the scenery.  The party scene early in the film has hanging Christmas lights seemingly unintentionally arranged to resemble breasts and nipples, or pairs of spread legs.  Dr. Bill cares for a bare-chested female patient.  Though innocent in nature, the viewer can't help but become aroused by exposed breasts and the idea of `playing doctor' with that beautiful patient.  And it's no mistake that the carpet, the dresses, the pool table, the neon lights, the curtains at the orgy. . . everything is RED.  Wonderful!<br/><br/>See this film.  Do not see it for the plot, the fast-paced dialogue and action, or the intriguing story line in the sense of a tradional film, because you will be disappointed  If you really want to see the value in Eyes Wide Shut, you have to look closer. . ."

I believe that unlocking this mystery largely answers the 'about' question and therefore makes it a much more enjoyable film.<br/><br/>One criticism that I think is objectively wrong is the notion that it is ""too long"".

So I popped it in my DVD player and 2 hours and 38 minutes later I was left confused, intrigued, curious, and in general wondering what to make of this.  I was skeptical of the Cruise Kidman combo but I thought they did a fine job.

"troy-16","Null","0","0","6 April 2001"," A different take
","This film is about sex and human culture, perhaps sex AS human culture. It's saying that sex is a far deeper part of our society than we want to accept. Not sex for procreation, sex for the sake of sex. In a subtler way, it's about everyone's battle between sowing their seeds and maintaining a steady relationship. Of the two principal characters, the married couple Bill and Alice, it's every bit as much about Alice's battle as is it about Bill's. In fact, it is Bill who's stunned to find out that Alice even has such fantasies. It's important to note that although Alice and Bill are both highly sought after by the opposite sex the only people they make love to in the movie are each other. They may talk about others, they may even dabble, but in the end nothing is ever consummated with anyone else. Bill isn't saved from cheating by a miraculous set of circumstances. Bill doesn't cheat, because in his heart he doesn't want to cheat. He found excuses to get out of the situations he could have just as easily found excuses to stay in the situations.<br/><br/>As in any most stories, the outer conflict was just a mirror image of the inner struggle. If just going to the orgy was ""way over [Bill's] head"" and puts his life in danger, just imagine what consummating the deal would have meant! His search for the details behind the orgy are analogous to his own soul search. Part of himself desperately wanted in and the other part was desperately trying to keep him out.<br/><br/>I would like to clear up an often misrepresented situation, after Alice tells Bill about her crush on the Navy man Bill does not leave the house to find some action in revenge. In fact, he goes to see a recently deceased patient and his daughter. Soon the daughter reveals that she feels EXACTLY the same about him as Alice felt about the Navy man. He even tries to brush off the hooker he meets thereafter. Falling into situations, and extricating oneself, are a far cry from seeking out those situations.<br/><br/>To my mind some of the most important scenes were those at the costume shop. The owner is furious when he finds his daughter with a few Asian gentlemen, but it's fine the next day. Apparently, he didn't care what his daughter was doing, he just wanted to make sure he was paid for it. The owner even offers his daughter to Bill. In fact, everyone in the entire movie except Alice and Bill seem to act his way. The owner's lack of concern for his daughter juxtaposes splendidly with the soul searching Bill has endured.<br/><br/>Two other points of note: It's interesting that Bill and Alice have a daughter but she's in maybe 2 minutes of this 2 1/2 hour film. In fact, the babysitter's a more prominent character. It's a land where the act of sex is important, but the results of sex aren't. Lastly, Alice's reaction after hearing Bill's story and giving it a lot of thought is to want to go home and have sex. Even at the end, all their trials and tribulations just come down to sex, even as their daughter roams free in the aisles of the toys store."

","Being a Kubrick film, there is much that is fascinating here, the climatic central scene is amazing---but overall this is a big disappointment. Overly long, ponderous and often boring. The  ultimate import of what the characters had to say did not justify the amount of time it usually took to say it!  I was always waiting for something amazing to happen, but it all pretty much wound down without much to get excited about. There is plenty of (female) nudity, but the reports of incredible sex scenes are way over blown. (Not that really matters). Had the potential to be much more stunning that it was. Too bad."

","Kubrick attains the apex of a style he helped create-- a brooding, dreamlike cinema with just enough grounding in reality to make its descent all the more disturbing. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a film that penetrates internal mysteries without explaining them; like ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" it refuses to make any sort of conventional sense. It raises the sort and quality of questions that it would not presume to be able to answer. I found myself thinking of Kieslowski's Three Colors Trilogy-- at the end of their lives, Kubrick and Kieslowski both found everyday existence ephemera, and the mystery supreme."
"Blueghost","2","4","12","9 February 2012"," ""Stanley Kubrick made one film too many...""
","Sayeth the sandwich maker who worked at the corner deli run by Koreans. And you know what? Dude was right.<br/><br/>I don't get affairs. Nor ritualized sex. And apparently neither did Kubrick when he made this film. To me this film is one made by a man who had too much cinematic power, and was probably trying to stay on top of the burgeoning ""adult video"" market that was becoming more accessible to mainstream America by virtue of net commerce.<br/><br/>It's well shot, of that there is no doubt. Technical marks all hit their cues, and are right on target. But the story itself? Wow. Pretty vapid stuff if you ask me.<br/><br/>I think the problem here is that the question of why do people have affairs is pretty straight forward. People have sexual interests in one another, and sometimes if they're married they're willing to take their chances on breaking a legal bond with their spouse. There's not much more to it than that. It's part of why women put men through so many test during courtship.<br/><br/>I think Kubrick, and perhaps a good portion of cuckolds or non-sexually active society are tantalized and interested in sex, so this movie was made.<br/><br/>Me, I haven't laughed so hard at certain points in the film since ""Used Cars"". I just truly think this is a ridiculous film on a number of levels, and it's not something I would ever make nor watch again. A couple that has fallen off the beaten track either has an abusive situation going on, or one of them lacks character. Again, it's pretty simple stuff. No film can really capture the ""magic"" of an affair, because affairs aren't magical to begin with. They're acts of betrayal. <br/><br/>Like I said, it's not a film I'll ever see again, nor would I like to work on this kind of project (paycheque depending). Hell, if I were forced to shoot something like this, I'd end it with a bunch of special forces men rappelling down from helicopters during the orgy scene and raiding the place. Just me *insert smile here*.<br/><br/>Not everyone can have a really good looking spouse, nor have steamy conjugal relations on a regular basis. So the urge is repressed, and when someone mentions the idea to another person, these stupid, cult like, ""religious"" swingers societies develop. And I imagine people get hurt. I don't really know as I've no experience in that matter.<br/><br/>But, Kubrick wants us to look at his version of a couple ""gone swinging""; one that has sexual exploration in mind. To me it's more of a comedy than anything else. I used to love seeing a Kubirck film because of his static yet compelling cinematography. The shots and assemblage of images from a former photo-journalist are supreme in execution. And yet, even so, even though Stanley Kubrick has been elevated to legendary status among industry and cine-files alike, he was, after all, only mortal. As is evident by this film.<br/><br/>Skip this one. If you need to see sex on the screen, then hit one of the adult websites of your choice.<br/><br/>Watch at your own risk.<br/><br/>p.s. you don't betray the one you love. Ever.<br/><br/>p.p.s. the other theme here is keeping interest in the one you love. Don't lose interest.<br/><br/>*EDIT* Final edit here; the thrust of this film was to get the husband to rekindle interest in his wife. Her concern may have been since he lost interest in other women by actively suppressing his desire, he thus lost interest in her. It became her objective to reinvigorate his desire for her. Kubrick tried to make a noire ""adult film"", but, and maybe it's because I'm not married, I just couldn't connect with it. Still, it was well shot. See it for that alone."

","Yeah, yeah, Kubrick's a genius. Or was he? Did he ever innovate anything? Barely if at all. But the guy sure did his homework, which set him light years apart from reliable studio hacks...so compared to a Joel Schumacher, er, maybe Kubrick was a genius. But what the heck's up with his swansong? ""Eyes Wide Shut"" opened promisingly enough. Medium shot of Nicole Kidman's butt, touchdown. Never considered her a decent actress, never considered her attractive, but always considered her creepy, too bony and not feminine enough. Wowzers, though, what a backyard. If only Kubrick kept the camera rolling on Kidman's spectacular pooper. Oh well.<br/><br/>What Kubrick did film was a mystery. Figuratively speaking. As in, ""T'hell's the film ABOUT?"" Short answer: It's about three freakin' hours, man. Three freakin' hours.<br/><br/>Conceptually? Fidelity or betrayal or something vague delivered like a melting glacier. Although, coming from the calculating director who upstaged Scatman Carrothers with a can of Calumet baking power in ""The Shining,"" was there something more going on? Did Kubrick intend ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to be a farce? Tom Cruise and Kidman were their spectacular lightweight selves, emotions ranged from A to B. Stuck out like sore thumbs amidst naturalistic, talented performers. Was that the joke?? Perhaps looking for farce is reaching too far for subtext. But why the heck else would Kubrick cast movie stars in the leads instead of actors?? Don't know about you, but I'm tired of posing questions regarding ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Art's art and fun's fun but comes a point when something impenetrable becomes a bore. Self-indulgent bore, to boot.<br/><br/>Yes, only Kubrick could make ""Eyes Wide Shot."" But then, only Kubrick could make sex boring. And I mean boring. Aside from one genuinely creepy scene full of dramatic tension in a costume shop after hours, rest of the film's an unsatisfying snoozebomb.<br/><br/>And the ending? My interpretation (on the basic plot level) differed completely from that of two other people. So three different people viewing at the same time came up with three completely different reasons for the final scene. Testament to a fantastic filmmaker who challenges the imagination? Not as much as a ludicrous narrative that had no place to go logically. Big difference.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Kubrick kicked some out of the park. ""Clockwork,"" ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""2001"" showed what he could do on his best day. Unfortunately ""Eyes"" wasn't one of those days."

","Bill Harford is a young doctor, who ventures out of his luxurious apartment on the Park, into the decrepit neighborhood,after his beautiful wife Alice, admitted to him she fantasizes to cheat him with another man. His quest for sexual encounters leads him to a troubling experience that could cost him more than his vertu. <br/><br/>At the beginning I didn't think much about this movie, I figured that Alice would be the focus of the movie as she fantasizes about having sex with another man. So naturally I was expecting her to initiate herself and her husband to new sexual experiences. Instead she's one-dimensional and plays an uninteresting person with silly lines. The movie lingers on and on, Harford wanders in the streets and then decides to hook up with a prostitute at her apartment until his wife calls him. Then he decides to leave and check into the club where an old college friend ( Nick Nightingale ) plays, which of course was 25 yards away. So basically Nick reveals that he is hired to play blind-folded at a very private party and commits the rookie mistake to give him the address of the party. It's a costumed party, and Harford manages to buy late-night a costume and get there a little late with a cloak and a mask. <br/><br/>There, he is welcomed by a fleet of staff, in front of a grandiose house- all of them are men by the way. He discovers it's an orgie and we ask ourselves: why and what exactly does Kubrick want to share to us about this exaggerated baroque orgie ? Maybe that the bourgeois have the means to create their sexual opera ? The struggle of hedonism ? The consequences of desire ? The inanity of passions ? The quest for liberties over a conquest ? <br/><br/>There is nothing spectacular about even the orgie - believe it or not there are already clubs who provide these kinds of sexual orientations. Kubrick clearly committed a mistake of ignorance. Harford does not participate in any activities, he has been spotted as an intruder. A hooker urges him to leave the party before he can be identified. A whole twisted staged plot encircles Harford who is threatened to stay shut. We then ask ourselves again: what is the big deal about this orgie ? Is this party worth the secrecy of identity ? <br/><br/>But after that the movie fails to develop the climax. Harford reads in the newspaper about a prostitute who overdosed early in the morning. He is convinced that he is being the center of a hit ? That's not a sufficient intrigue.<br/><br/>The movie then ends in a confrontation between Victor, an older friend of Bill. Victor was there that night at the house. The outcome is greatly disappointing. All evolves around the secrecy of this orgie, the extreme measures that have been taken to protect the fetichism of the wealthiest corny men in New York. Yes, rich men like to hire escorts for their kinky fantasies, it is not tabou, it is everyday in the newspapers after another scandal surfaces. <br/><br/>It's all shortcuts, incoherences. How does a pianist who just moved in N.Y., gets contacted to play at this orgie ? How did he get contacted in the first place ? How many times has he been there ? Why would an outsider recommend a pianist to people who have to means to hire 30 staff employees ? Are you telling me they can't hire themselves a pianist ? <br/><br/>The quest for sexual identity seems to be the subject of the movie but really the characters mistake themselves on their own identity. Since they do not know what they want, they convince themselves they are seeking sexual experiences, in order to have a purpose. All seem to enjoy the idea of fantasizing and playing, and that is why Bill follows a hooker to her place (which he never touches) and amuses on adultery. <br/><br/>For a movie that apparently wants to shock or excite, it massively fails."

","Stanley Kubrick's final film plays slightly better this second full time through, but at the same time its too frigging long.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie that never ends (made in a shoot that never ended) is about a rich doctor who is haunted by a story his wife tells him of infidelity. This leads him on an odd odyssey that shakes up his world even further.<br/><br/>When I saw this in the theaters on the night it opened I was so bored by it I left after the much over rated sex scenes at the masked ball. I made one later attempt at seeing it when it came out on home video and got all the way through it. Other visits with the film have come on cable where I criss crossed through the films recesses in odd clips. Recently I had a long discussion with a friend who loves the film and figured I'd try it again. To be certain his remarks, probably the most intelligent I've ever heard concerning the film, made me hopeful that I had missed something. I don't think so.<br/><br/>The film concerns obsession and what a perceived infidelity will and can do to a man or woman. Cruise's dark journey all hinges on the fact that he can't get what his wife tells him out of his mind. Seeing it again for the first time in almost ten years I see little things that I probably missed the first time out. There is real power in the early scenes of Cruise and Kidman together and even apart as Kidman's unhappiness leads to flirtations and lustful thoughts that upset Cruise's sense of the world. I don't think that the whole masked cabal thing works, even on an allegorical level since the giant set piece of people having sex and performing rites seems to have been pulled in from a Hammer horror film. Whats even more deadly to the film is its over length and snail like pace. this is a two and a half hour film that feels twice that.<br/><br/>Personally I wish Kubrick had lived a little longer since I'd have love to hear what his take on all of this was. At times the film seems like it wants to be a black comedy, at other times a porn film. Its a thriller at other times, though it really doesn't have a pay off, or if it does certainly not one that is worth fighting sleep for the better part of three hours. Seeing it again, I'm of the opinion that with the exception of one person I think most people who love this film are doing so because its Kubrick and they think he must have known what he was doing. I would argue that he didn't"

","I have read so much about this film that i decided to see it at last.What a disappointment!Ignore all the bla-bla about this being a masterpiece or so-deep-that-you-can't understand-it.This is a silly and totally unconvincing film.What is remarkable about it is the hype(no,the SUPERHYPE)surrounding it.The fact that Kubrick died after making the film and the divorce between Cruise and Kidman a short time after it made an enormous fuss about what is basically a pretentious piece of snobbery.The film is maddeningly long (about 3 hours )and the action is soooooo slow that it is almost unbearable at the end.But the funniest things are the ideas and motives of the film which are so petty and trivial that i wonder how a serious filmmaker can waste his talent,time and efforts for such a miserable thing.Above all it is about sex-that sex is everything to us(Kidman's character declares that she will abandon everything even her daughter for a night with a total stranger-can you imagine something more absurd???)and that the fact that we cannot live our sexual fantasies makes us miserable.And that banality is lengthened for 3 hours!!!Yes,Cruise and Kidman are good actors(Kidman overacts sometimes)but what can they do to save such a stupid film from its own stupidity?Everything that happens in the film is just unbelievable and inexplicable-it is like a dream.At times I even laughed at the absurdities presented as intellectual ""insights"".My advice:don't waste your time,get a walk in the park instead!"
"raphrousseau","1","3","8","7 February 2005"," One of the worst movies ever in the history of cinema
","!!!WATCH OUT, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>I won't waste my time to sum up the story. The script is slow and stupid, giving birth to one of the most boring film I have ever seen in my life. I am not surprised that Kubrick died before finishing it because it's so bad that he spent 9 years of his life working on it, and he died before putting a final hand to it. The script is incredibly idiot. For example, Tom Cruise's character is supposed to be a great Doctor and, when he goes to see a prostitute he doesn't even use a condom! So he gets HIV positive.<br/><br/>The image has a very good quality and this aspect of this Z-rated-late-night-TV-Show kind of film, is probably the best. The colors are really worked. But the action and the dialogs are so flat that even if there are good actors, they don't have any occasion to prove it here.<br/><br/>The good thing is I didn't go to the theater to see this movie. A friend of mine lent it to me, on tape. I almost fell asleep in front of it. This is such a bad movie that I'm sorry that it was Kubrick's last one. He could do much better. It's a bad souvenir left by a great director getting too old. Do yourself a favor: Don't waste your time and money and don't see this movie--cold, slow and empty as it is."
"andy-mccloskey","1","3","8","11 November 2004"," An Accidental Comedy
","I truly believe Stanley Kubrick was in the midst of soon-to-be-dead dementia while making this film.<br/><br/>A little dementia can be a good thing, but I think all the marbles were gone by the time the call of ""It's a wrap"" went up.<br/><br/>Completely uninvolved characters. Wooden performances. Pretentious dialog. You name it, this big-budget gobbles almost as furiously as I laughed at it.<br/><br/>The scene where Cruise wanders through the secret ""orgy"" is the most embarrassing scene I've ever sat through in a film. I watched this film alone, & during that scene....I fiddled with things in my living room as to not acknowledge my own embarrassment. After getting over my initial embarrassment, I just start laughing.<br/><br/>I give this film a 1 out of 10.<br/><br/>But, as a comedy....I give it a SEVEN."
"audrablum","1","3","9","6 October 2018"," Just another piece of smut disguised as cinema
","This week I watched Eyes Wide Shut (1999). To be be frank it was nothing short of smut wrapped in the title of ""cinema."" Storytellers everywhere should be embarrassed that we continually get away with this. There was nothing interesting about this film and I'm surprised that Kubrick would ever had thought this was his ""finest work."" There was probably ten minutes of well written story and the rest was just smut scenes. Let's say we get away from the smut for a minute, the rest of the story was really stale, surface level, and pathetic. The characters were extremely immature and uninteresting and it felt like there were major loopholes in these characters. For example, the way that Alice speaks isn't at all how women speak to the people they are with. The only time words like hers exit a female's mouth is when a man is sharing his fears with her and claiming that's what she said to him in his dream/thoughts, etc. Not only is her dialogue clearly written by a man, but she seems to be suffering some sort of mental disorder, and the doctor, who is likely trained in medical matters, marries this mentally ill character anyways? I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but let's go ahead and chalk this film up to what it really is an unapologetic man-tasy (male fantasy). Now, this supposed doctor, who has had to master the art of psychological disciplines like maintaining focus on sleep he likely only got days ago, among the other mental toughness of a doctor, psychoanalytic training, etc, can't deal with something his mentally ill wife said to him, so he, being highly emotionally unstable for some reason, gives himself license to have an affair? Okay, let's just run with it. Now, every important female in the movie is a cookie cutter version of Kubrick's fantasies. Everyone of them has the same body-type, the same color hair, and similar facial features. If you wanted to continue arguing that somehow this smut is ""art"" then you at least need to change up your ""artistic elements"" or you're really just validating the case for sexual eroticism for the sake of pleasure. I would also be more sold on this being of ""artistic value"" if somehow the playing field was equal, but, lo, it is not. T and A is available in just about every scene, but heaven forbid we see a man's dongle. It is merely ever suggested that a male character's manliness was ever exposed, whilst women had the privilege of exposing themselves fully. If you want to cry ""art"" then you should have fully exposed both sexes, otherwise it just comes across as derogatory and chauvinistic. There is no substance to this film. If it wasn't an assignment I would have shut it off in the first ten minutes and never looked back."

","I'm not sure why people think this is such a great movie. Just because it's Stanley Kubrick? I don't know. The acting is stilted and, at best, bland, as is the dialog. Maybe even the actors couldn't find a way to make the writing more interesting so, even their acting came off badly.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no chemistry between anyone. The ""orgy"" scenes are laughable and couldn't be any less sexy if they tried. Even the sex scenes are boring! Some people said it was filmed beautifully. Where? Harsh, yet kind of gauzy. It just seemed to be both glaring at you and out of focus at the same time.<br/><br/>This is not a masterpiece. Oh, it wants to be. And it tries to be so provocative, smart and forward thinking. Instead, it comes of as an old fashion 70s porn film - and not even as sexy as one of those! It was ridiculous. I did sit through the whole thing when it first came out. I kept expecting it to get better, I guess. And I tried to watch it again recently. It's even worse now. It has not aged well.<br/><br/>One to skip unless you are just curious. A really, really bad film - don't let the ""10s"" fool you!"

Some scene set ups and lighting still had something of the detail-obsessed film maker Stanley was.Like the ever present Xmas lighting throughout the movie.Everywhere there is the combination of red,green and white Xmas lamps...creating a beatrangening Kubrickian effect. And of course the music worked fantastically in some scenes. Acting , characters and story where very meager though. The least-good Kubrick film i'v seen so far."
"MovieAddict2016","4","3","9","7 June 2004"," Look Closer
","There's more to this movie than t & a. It was really made famous during its release because Tom and Nicole split. I doubt this was coincidental - they knew that splitting would cause more controversy over an already-controversial film. I'm not saying that they only split up because they wanted more attention for their film, but I have a feeling that they would have split up much sooner if not for the film. (Rumor has it they were bickering during filming and had to have instructions on how to create sexual tension, although Cruise - always quick to put down lurking insinuations of his sexuality - denied this.)<br/><br/>It is the late, great Stanley Kubrick's last film, and one of his worst, but it is unfairly regarded as an X-rated R-rated movie (so to speak) when it really is a piece of tame masterwork. It's not as great as A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1973), 2001 (1968) or my personal favorite of Kubrick's, THE SHINING (1980), but it's better than FULL METAL JACKET (1987) and beautifully filmed.<br/><br/>The plot: Cruise and Kidman are married in the film. She admits to him one night after getting stoned that she almost slept with a military figure years ago, so her husband haves a minor breakdown and slips into a bizarre sexual odyssey.<br/><br/>The movie is packed with nudity and sex and even the advertising had an aroma of sleaze surrounding it, but it really is an important piece of work, and significant in the fact that it was Kubrick's final farewell to cinema. I wouldn't say it's underrated but I think that it's misinterpreted - it's far more than just a sleazy sex story with two huge sex symbols. Sure, watching Nicole shed her clothes off is great, but to say that's the ONLY point of the film is absurd. Quoting the tagline for AMERICAN BEAUTY: ""Look closer..."""
"Vortex-6","1","3","9","18 July 1999"," A bad, annoying, nearly 3 hour episode of All My Children.
","Eyes Wide Shut is a shallow, appalling mess of a film which will no doubt be hailed as high art by the baby boom crowd. I suppose this sort of thing is what white bread America, particularly the repressed crowd I saw it with, imagines to be avant garde. Some phrases I heard from those around me in the theater: ""I can't believe we're going to see this!"" ""This is too weird!"" ""Is that marijuana?"" ""Is she a prostitute?"" ""Oh, she isn't worthy of him!"" ""Thank God he didn't have sex with her!"" ""Oh, look. That's a nice apartment."" Please. I've had racier things go on in my car than any of the sex or so-called orgy scenes in this film, and yet it was giving the fat, status-obsessed yuppies around me a case of the vapors. Eyes wide shut, indeed. An endless, overwrought, melodramatic morality play about sex and guilt. Nothing more. Imagine being taken on a tour of Studio 54 in its heyday while being flogged by a nun. The women in this film ranged from coked-out whores to merely dysfunctional housewives looking for some on the side. The one gay character with lines was stereotyped as a mincing little queen made almost faint by the overwhelming sexual prowess of Tom Cruise. Give me a break! Racial stereotyping was also pervasive, and not one moment of this film's so-called plot was unpredictable. If Kubrick hadn't croaked, this movie would have received all the rotten (and more to the point, honest) reviews it is due. Hell, the pace alone probably killed him. Anyway, if you enjoy being tortured for almost three hours, go see this film. If you're as fortunate as myself, you will get to see it with a bunch of sanctimonious Midwesterners, in which case you will find the audience's reaction more entertaining than what's on the screen."

","I watched almost every single movie from great S.K. except this one. For years, I was hearing about it, I saw it quoted multiple times in pop culture.<br/><br/>Finally, I was able to watched it and after two and a half hours of screen time I said to myself - That's it? Really?<br/><br/>I don't know where all the praise is coming from, a masterpiece - really? Yes, its far from being bad but its also nothing special. Take Kubrick name from it and it would be forgotten. If I didn't know I would never suspect it could be directed by him.
There wasn't even any of Kubrick's iconic cinematography in it.<br/><br/>Everything was just... average. At least now I know one movie by Kubrick that I don't like."
"michaelarmer","6","2","5","16 December 2019"," 9 Year Itch
","I looked at the reviews on here before watching this and oh my, how wrong most people are.<br/><br/>Some are dismissing it as rubbish and others are pretending they are not looking at it as a sex film and pretend they know about its psychology and art, they looking too deeply into it and rating it higher than it deserves when really they are just getting off on the naked women in it. And what they say about it is mostly fantasy (not the sexual fantasy in the movie) but a fantasy that is in their own minds.<br/><br/>This film is not about sexual fantasy's at all, it is a porno dressed up as a drama come thriller, about a married couple coming to a point in their relationship where its got a bit stale and it needed something like this to sort themselves out, a bit like a 7 year itch (in this case they are married for 9 years), the problem was that they were too truthful with each other. She had a sex fantasy after being ""hit on"" at a party and when she told him he decided to try a bit himself, there's nothing dark or mysterious about it, with some people it happens. But they have added a lot of nakedness to spice it up a bit.<br/><br/>The movie started out as a drama, and turned into a kind of thriller, after Cruise stumbled upon an orgy involving high up people who did not want it to be found out, but nothing too serious, they just wanted to (and succeeded) scare him off.<br/><br/>The acting from Cruise and Kidman was very good, the cameo by the noted Director Sydney Pollak was also good, the few supporting actors were ok, you did not see a lot of them because many had masks on. Direction was average, Stanley Kubrick was on his last film, and although he has made some good films, he has also made some poor ones, this is about middle for him. The music was a bit dreary though and it moved too slow, some of the dialogue was very slow, not like real, it was trying to be over dramatic. It is 2hr 40 mins in length and was too long, it was a bit boring most of the time, they could have shortened it without losing much and it would have been better, or they could have put more in, made the thriller part a bit more thrilling with more intrigue and a bit of action, just a bit and it would have been ok for the length.<br/><br/>Personally I believe many of the High rated reviews are because they are repressed sex pests and were just excited to see a few sexy female bodies, and did not see much else, because they were inaccurate about some of the details. Maybe its why they made it like that to attract the perverts? Another thing I noticed was that you hardly saw any naked men (blurred in distance) and all the women on this film are tall, blonde and leggy, and almost all are stripping off with good views of their bums, is this a Stanley Kubrick fetish ? Did he make this film just so he could masturbate over his favourite type of woman ? Was he a Harvey Weinstein type ?<br/><br/>I gave it a 6 for the intrigue and good acting, if a bit shorter or more exciting, or not for the porn angle it would have been higher.<br/><br/>I am pretty sure that the perverts who pretend it is stylistic will diss me for my comments, it's because they don't like it when someone points out the obvious."

","Having recently re-watched ""Eyes wide shut"" I find it strikingly juvenile. Like a stag party. The producers writing credit name that the film is ""inspired by the novel by Arthur Schnitzler "" implicitly ""Traumnovelle / Dream Story"" from 1926. Given the temporal update, the film's script closely follows Arthur Schnitzler's text. On the other hand, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is also inspired by Wolfgang Glück's film ""Traumnovelle"" from 1969. How on earth did the Kubrick come up with the idea of recruiting T.C. for the lead? And did he ever feel he made the right choice? Tom Cruise does what he does. Millins of fans is proof of that. But to involve him in a delicate story by Arthur Schnitzler? One morning William wakes up to find that his life has changed. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the ""dream"" off him, but finds it doesn't work, when his wife Alice walks into the bathroom, and screams, he explains to her that the man in front of the mirror is him."

"juancorrea503","10","2","5","2 March 2011"," Misunderstood
","I think Eyes Wide Shut is highly misunderstood. The movie is wrapped in symbolism, which I don't think a lot of people, looking to see a blockbuster with Tom and Nicole, really understood.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is about social status and the power that comes with it. The movie uses secret societies, paganism with the winter solstice to tell its story. Every prop, color that has been chosen, every human interaction is done deliberately by Krubrikc to tell the story, which is why he is a master at his art.<br/><br/>The Christmas Tree, the color purple and gold, animal print all represent fertility. Alice is resentful for her husbands social status and longs to be an animal that ""fucks."" The best thing about this movie is that it provokes more mysteries and questions than it feeds our curiosity. For example, when they are having the orgy we don't really get to focus too much on what's really going on and we always peer into to other rooms getting only a small taste of what's going on.<br/><br/>This movie is--like I said--about social status, human sexuality (we are only animals who our real purpose is to ""fuck"")and of course secret societies, which provokes the question: are we just living as pawns to feed the interest of the social elite's twisted games?<br/><br/>This movie is extremely deep, and at times, I wish it had more to satisfy my curiosity, but that was Krubrick's intention."
"elshikh4","Null","2","5","22 December 2008"," Dead Film about Death !
","This film caused me some confusion as being unidentified. OK, it's a comedy. A real good one about a husband who wants desperately to cheat on his wife in the most inauspicious night in his life! But I always thought that (Tom Cruise) can't do comedy. To tell you the truth, according to its making's circumstances, which ate up 2 years of its leads' ages, then it's a black comedy already! Hmmm, maybe it's a horror, for sure when I review my memory of watching it, I discover how it's a ruthless horror indeed, it even managed to give me nightmares later; and ironically I'm not kidding!<br/><br/>Actually, it could be one of the most anti-western civilization films ever, condemning the killer materialism, and unspiritual thinking, which led the human to immerse into ""sex"", and get lost through its deepest aberrant ways. (Stanley Kubrick) wanted to make a different satire against the wide eyes shut's belief, disgracing all of his community by the shame of being wildly blind, crazy about coitus with or without love, being bodies that kill each other or themselves for fun; as if humans became the worst animals. The film tried to be an ominous of this civilization's end. And that's great. Yet theoretically. Because Mr. perfectionist-in-a-very-sick-way (Stanley Kubrick)'s ultimate result out of that was something totally uninteresting, and highly disappointing. Humdrum, tasteless, and one of the blandest. The list would go endlessly.<br/><br/>Originally, it's highly thoughtful, but obviously not as great as what it handles. At first, you'd feel how the story was sort of expressing as a simple and symbolic one that could epitomize its cosmos, lampoon it, and insinuate to its death. Though, it sounded eventually forced and spiritless. The long, very long, shots weren't for the sake of scrutiny, inasmuch as the sake of being sleepy or unbearable. The editing transformed the whole matter into one big slow tooth extraction. (Tom Cruise) is the best paradox when it comes to soil the American dream or looking misguided childish, but despite how he tried, he wasn't that important actor to represent any possible depths. Some of the image details looked primitive (the newspaper's title: ""How lucky that you're alive"" or some things like that!). Everything ranges rather between ambiguous or naive. That dreamlike sense was done so dully. All the mind games that (Kubrick) loves to play, like deliberate image goofs, went to nothing, or maybe they were just goofs after all! Even the piano music, so the classic records, were very monotonous and blank, stealing the movie's spirit. It looked wholly lifeless. I don't think, at any rate, that making a film about dead life must be lifeless.. or deadly!<br/><br/>I believe that there was a certain paranoia or megalomania in (Kubrick) which affected his vision badly, so I'm sure that a poor film like this seemed The Iconic Cinema from his point of view. And it shows. I recall what my friend likened the movie with when we first saw it: ""This is not a film, this is a documentary!"". I agree with that, as a live painful documentary about how to lose a good idea, torture your cast, and your audience, be absent for years, and waste more years on what's lower than what you already did. And you know what the worst of it is? It feels like a documentary!<br/><br/>(Eyes Wide Shut) ended up having the sad irony of good premise, bad film. It's where the only actual good thing about it, else being creepy, is the moment of (Nicole Kidman) saying the ""F"" word in the end so tenderly. Although it's a smart, very cynical, ending for such a film about a world that relishes its death, and sees sex as the cure of everything. Nevertheless, it can't save a film that relishes its death, and doesn't ""see"" in the first place. Sorrowfully, (Kubrick) did it wide eyes shut himself!"

","While perusing the Jeff Rense-Benjamin Fulford interview transcript in researching Chinese secret society that have issued the threat to exterminate members of the Illuminati over nefarious New World Order plans, I came across this portion.<br/><br/>""FULFORD: ...They are not going to get away with this. They'd better realize it. It's game up. They've been exposed. People know about them. They are onto their game. And it's not going to work.<br/><br/>All you've got to do is target the Eye. Hollywood - the people in Hollywood have been trying to warn the Americans for years! If you look at Tolkien's movie, you have this Eye on the top of a mountain. Destroy the Eye and save the world.<br/><br/>Or (destroy) the masters. Stanley Kubrick gave up his life to expose these people. . . .<br/><br/>RENSE: What happened to Stanley Kubrick? I don't mean the precise cause of death, but where was he going that got him into trouble with these people?<br/><br/>FULFORD: It was the movie Eyes Wide Shut, exposing the Masonic orgies. They showed that there were people being killed. This is probably based on real events.<br/><br/>I haven't done the proper research, but there is an old man who dies in Eyes Wide Shut. If I'm not mistaken, the man in the movie died exactly the way Stanley Kubrick died in real life, just as he finished the movie.<br/><br/>RENSE: It is also suggested that Kubrick was involved in creating the - at least some hoaxed Apollo moon footage, and knew all about that. His wife has intimated as much since his death."" <br/><br/>I consider myself a fan of Stanley Kubrick, and I find this revelation, while outlandish, fascinating.<br/><br/>Admittedly, when I was a young man, I did not enjoy Eyes Wide Shut as a plodding and ludicrously turgid movie.<br/><br/>The strange circumstance of Kubrick's March 7, 1999 death at his home -- and the family refuse to release the exact cause of death other than natural cause (may be sudden cardiac arrest) -- shortly after approving the lock on final cut and before the film was released in theatres in North America and some regions on July 16 provide a new perspective that might explain his reclusive & somewhat eccentric lifestyle beginning in the early 70's and why it led naturally to the subject of his final film.<br/><br/>While Kubrick's genius was undoubted to some who appreciate stimulating cinematic art, he chose to relocate to Great Britain to settle as his permanent home beginning in about 1962 after having endured the experience of dealing with the stress and frustration of Hollywood large-scale production & demanding actors (Spartacus). He had not set foot on American soil sometime after the 60's since (he attended April 1968 premiere of 2001: A Space Odyssey in New York City), if the assumption is correct.<br/><br/>Kubrick was famous for the perfectionist style in cold, detached, subliminal, psychologically inhumane and challenging cinematic aesthetics and his preferred approach to adapt the published materials for the screen. He chose Arthur Schnitzler's obscure psychosexual drama novella Traumnovelle (alternatively called Dream Story) to form the basis of the film production removed from general comprehension in plot depth more complex than his previous films.<br/><br/>It's been several years since I saw Eyes Wide Shut for the second time, in my vain attempt to evaluate the movie on its merit in story and theme comprehension. Now that years have passed and my knowledge of the Illuminati and Zionism acquired, I have learned, by viewing the video on YouTube, the appliance of occult symbols in purposefully obscured ""satirical context"" to accentuate Kubrick's cleverly veiled use of theme on the deadly contagion of mind control, lust, corruption, avarice, deceit, treachery and power vested in the secret society conspiring to swindle, debaunch, brutalize, violate and enslave humanity in Eyes Wide Shut.<br/><br/>While (perhaps rightly) condemned by the mystified and bored audiences for its sheer tedium and incomprehensibility of the bizarre, nonsensical story, Eyes Wide Shut may have a valid point that emerged belatedly, as the truth of the disturbing events and facts divulged and theorized in the alternative media and on the information superhighway of the Internet give our conscious mind food for thought -- the events tracing to the secret societies involving ambitious power to control financial and political businesses in governing the national and international affairs, intelligence services and occult participation within the ranks of the Illuminati, et cetera.<br/><br/>This is precisely Mr. Kubrick's intention. The interpretation of his prophetic warnings can also be found in another film A.I. (themes of searching for maternal love, inhumanity and human extinction) which Steven Spielberg studiously developed for production soon after his friend's untimely passing.<br/><br/>As far as the circumstance of Kubrick's death at the age of 70 is concerned, I may never know whether his death, which is still a great loss for modern cinema nine years later, was a retribution by one of the secret societies angry at the expose of the supposedly discreet activities to bring awareness to the general audience.<br/><br/>The general audience's poor reception of Eyes Wide Shut in reaction -- complaining about the slow-moving tedium and weirdly idiotic story (especially the bedroom scene of a long-winded marital communication in drugged state, escape from the cult's grip & the last scene involving the singular utterance of F-word) -- may have brought relief to the Illuminati that depend on the trust of the controlled media not to shed the light on the treasonous activity in the long-term plan to usurp power and introduce globalist totalitarian tyranny.<br/><br/>May Stanley Kubrick rest in eternal peace, having departed this mortal plane to leave behind his illuminating message to mankind the warning on the rise of occult tyranny and optimism in renewed hope and faith in the good of humanity.<br/><br/>Postscript: YouTube ""kubrick illuminati symbology"" for a 9-minute video that interpret Kubrick's warning as intended."
"n-mo","5","2","5","7 October 2007"," An excellent drunken date after-party
","Eyes Wide Shut is a bad movie, but not in the sense that you couldn't enjoy it in a kind of mystery science theater setting. I asked my buddy what on Earth had possessed him to buy this DVD, and he responded that his (now ex-)girlfriend had seen it in the store and that she had been curious to watch it. I responded that ""this DOES seem like a Walter and Fiona (names changed to protect the innocent) movie,"" especially considering that girl was a mental headcase. (In fact, according to Walter, the conversation that punctuated a wildly funny scene of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman toking it up and fondling each other rather resembled his conversations with Fiona.)<br/><br/>And that's just the thing about this type of film: if anyone actually thought this was amazing, he would probably not be the kind of person you would want to meet. But the sort of people who THINK they should like this belong to the bored, bland, postmodern American bourgeoisie so easily duped into believing that to watch decadent pictures set against beautiful Italianate and beaux-arts architecture and sprinkled with profanity will bring enlightenment and sophistication. There are few things more hilarious or entertaining than to watch American yuppies ape this shallow conception of European culture.<br/><br/>To be sure, Eyes Wide Shut is stunningly filmed, though it was difficult for me to place the location at first. I was not surprised to learn subsequently that Stanley Kubrick filmed this on sets rather than the actual streets of New York. The outdoor shots clearly lack the requisite atmosphere--though perhaps that was done intentionally so as to convey the ""dreamy"" sensibility so dwelt upon by fawning reviewers.<br/><br/>Genuine or not, however, great cinematography cannot save this inordinately poorly written story. We are expected to believe that Cruise is so seriously traumatized by the discovery that his wife had fantasized about sleeping with another man (and had been relieved when he had left and removed the temptation) that he must go on a quest to understand the dark side of human sexuality. To the filmmakers' credit, they resist the temptation to make him give in to this darkness, which would have been all too easy in the era of moral nihilism. Still, this is a shaky premise at best, implying that for a physician, Cruise's character is terribly naïve about fleshly impulses.<br/><br/>A similarly shoddy point deals with the antics of Kidman, who only dreams about what her husband witnesses. Awakened from her fit of laughter, she laments her horrifying nightmare where ""people were ****ing! And I was ****ing them! And I was making FUN of you!"" But this is so stupid as to actually be quite enjoyable: I would like to know, was she crying because she was traumatized by the thought of betraying her husband, or because she awoke from a rather pleasant dream to see her beloved at her side? Cruise and Kidman are not known for their acting abilities, but when they get the chance to ham it up at these campy moments, which are littered throughout the script, they shine, and brighten the movie just that much more. The last line was an absolute hoot, and ironically, the only logical ending to this preposterous mess.<br/><br/>One more aspect ought to be dealt with: the nudity. Even with the U.S. edits to pass for an ""R"" rating, in my mind this still qualifies, quite easily, for NC-17. The gratuitousness of it all further dilutes and overwhelms what should have been Cruise's remarkable resistance to the subsuming forces of sexual deviance. Granting that it is difficult to depict a stylish, ritualized orgy, so central to this plot, without removing the actors' clothing, one has to question whether, if such drastic measures are necessary, there is really anything meaningful to say with this story (there is not). And the fact that this was one long in-your-face flesh fest from the opening act proves that it was meant to provoke and to ""be bad,"" which is no longer that shocking by today's lowered standards. Neither is the whole premise of an exclusive, high-society sex cult really that outlandish--most conspiracy theories are false, of course, but I've heard enough sordid tales of the American élite to know that some must be true. A well-educated urbanite like Cruise shouldn't be so shocked.<br/><br/>Apparently this is based on a late-nineteenth century Austrian novella, which I have not read. I'm not sure how it was in its own context--perhaps it was nothing more than provocation or perversion--but this version is irredeemably marred by sloppy writing and wanton pretension to seriousness. In response to the reviewer(s) who said, ""Be prepared to think!"" I say, don't waste too many brain cells. The sheer volume of profanity, campiness and nudity precludes any possibility that a real human being could take this seriously, but watching Kubrick trip over himself to attain that end will produce no small amount of laughter. So just enjoy the guilty ride."

If you expected this to be a posthumous masterwork given to humanity by a genius in his death bed, or simply have a nice time, forget it.<br/><br/>As a man, I had never seen so many pretty naked girls together and felt so much boredom and watched so many uninspiring erotic scenes as in this movie. The characters, their psychology, is so strange to human condition that only fully grown weirdos can recognize themselves in the childish woman that feels so dazzled about the most unimaginative of fantasies and the hot poor rich boy that never meets the goal.<br/><br/>The 'peak' scenes seem part of one of those soft-core porn sketches starred by Hugh Pfeffner's monthly Playmates, and Cruise is exactly the kind of guy you REALLY WANT to be vexed and killed instead of a chick, to save you from seeing him the rest of the movie, so unbearable he is.<br/><br/>The movie really needed to command it in the title: ""Eyes wide shut!"". You had to remember that command constantly to actually avoid closing your eyes and bothering the tiny-beard pipe-smoking smart boys of the forward row with your snores.<br/><br/>Rent a true porn movie instead, interpretations are the same as bad, but at least the guy in the film gets the prize and looks more relieved than than the stressed Cruise.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, but the work is technically impressive in its sheer academic-ism."

","Despite the pre-release hype about how this film was to be on the cutting edge of sexual explicitness, Eyes Wide Shut isn't about having sex. It is about NOT having sex. Like Dudley Moore before him, Tom Cruise sets out to have an affair and, despite encountering a variety of eager women (and one man), can't seem to even get his pants unzipped. The result is a comedy of errors with no laughs; a porn film with no sex and a thriller with no suspense. Kubrick seems to have been hopelessly stuck in the early sixties as far has his view of eroticism is concerned. From Alan Cummings oh-so limp wristed homosexual to the orgy where everyone prances around in maskes and costumes, Kubrick seems to have thought he would shock the audience with something new and daring. But time passed Stanley by -- even soft-core porn offers more explicit material then presented here and daytime soaps have more insightful examinations of infidelity and maritial angst. This film is stylishly, but utterly gutless in addressing the issues it pretends to be exploring. And don't get me started on the truly awful musical score...."

The poor saps who bought into the whole media blitz that promised a raunchy film must have been very disappointed, indeed, as this is about the least sexy movie I remember seeing in a very long time. The plot, what there is of it, is tedious. The acting is awful, which can't really be blamed on Kidman and Cruise, who didn't have much to work with, in the first place. The outdoor scenes look about as much as new York City as those back-lot NYC scenes you see on Seinfeld.

I thought the scene where Alice was stoned and talking about her dream was NEVER GOING TO END. Sorry for shouting but I see that this film has 25% of people rating it 10. That's not good, the film is flawed in so may ways (the sex isn't even arousing for instance, and when William breaks down and cries after finding the mask on the pillow you just wish he would grow up) that it's not worth a 10, or even 5, I wished I'd not wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life on this durn rubbish.

","This movie *deep breath*, where to start... Ok. It is probably the worst movie I have seen in the theater, ever.<br/><br/>I see a LOT of movies. I enjoy watching every other Kubric movie. This thing I did not. How horrible. Lets see:<br/><br/>NO plot. None. Not anywhere to be found. If you read the taglines maybe you'll see some ephemeral something somewhere. Detestable main characters. No suspense. Cinematography I sincerely believe was done by Kubric's corpse or something.<br/><br/>The centerline wavered so badly in one scene (when whiny-boy was lumbering along the street towards his one evil brush with a group of homophobic college kids milling about an empty street) that I'm sure it was Kubric-corpse holding the camera.<br/><br/>The soundtrack got on my nerves, badly. That one fingered drunken casio-piano noise really got under my skin.<br/><br/>Every time they built up ANY kind of suspense... they killed it dead. The sex-club was a HUGE joke. I really don't think anyone thinks that tame-ol-thing was risque. (I hope.) We are supposed to feel sorry for Pretty-whiny-rich-boy whose solution to problems = shelling out $100 bills from his wallet. Oooooh. Damn. I wish I could have his problems. And I wish I could be the drooling guy that could swagger up to Nicole Kidman and guzzle her drink and spout such cool lines as (paraphrased) ""Yes, I know it was your drink."" If he were coming onto my wife, I'd laugh so hard I'd probably keel over dead. And the scene drug on and on and on... ad nauseum.<br/><br/>I sat stunned after the movie was over... then applauded. It was so damned bad that not one person in the theatre had the audacity to even give me a sharp look. How could they? I'm sure they read the ""enlightened"" reviews of just how ""deep and neat"" Kubric's last film could be.<br/><br/>If you were to happen upon a copy for free somewhere (some luckless shlep bought it and is trying to give it away before friends and family see it) do yourself a favor... watch the first couple of minutes to see Nicole's touche. Fast forward to see her get fondled a couple of times. Find the scene where Poor-Richie falls flacid when confronted with an ultra-beautiful woman that wants to have sex with him. Laugh at him. Oggle her. She is the most beautiful creature in the film. Then give the movie a quick flip into the garbage can. There really is nothing to see.<br/><br/>Manos, Hands of Fate has it beat on all fronts.<br/><br/>Now, you will hear the pseudo sub-intellectual crowd that hangs out in front of Borders trying to tell you that it had deep meaning. So does my belly button. But my belly button does have better cinematography. I could take a polaroid. It'd eclipse anything in THAT film. However, while my stomach is much more interesting than this film, I'd never submit to such seemingly endless torture for it either.<br/><br/>That being said, if you want to watch it, go ahead. Just don't have any expectations. In fact, watch it with a date. He/She'll be so bored that watching plants grow would be entertaining.

","This movie is a sad illustration of how a wonderful book and an extremely interesting idea can be massacred into a ridiculous movie. Poorly directed and artificially filled with useless, time consuming scenes, this movie also ""benefits"" from incredibly bad acting. I would definitely rate it R for ridiculous.<br/><br/>Or maybe it is me. Maybe I had too high expectancies. To be honest, I was dying to see how the complex micro-universe of the couple is seen under the magnifying glass of erotism. I expected to see two interesting characters able to redefine (sexual) happiness in their couple. I thought I would witness two sexually aware people facing the decision of holding their eyes ""wide shut"" and learning to live with their fantasies. All that directed by Kubrick should have been quite a treat, shouldn't it?<br/><br/>
The only good scene of the movie, that of the orgy, is entirely copied from Fellini. All the rest of the movie is doomed to silliness and ridicule.<br/><br/>
Nicole Kidman is unable to articulate herself in normally-paced English and almost all her scenes are  absolutely ridiculous. The last scene is a masterpiece in this direction. "" I... think... that... we... should... be... grateful."" That takes her 5 minutes. After that, exhausted by the effort of putting into words her abysmal feelings, she utters the F word again. Which word is so much abused in this movie that it loses even its vulgarity. Everything was bad enough, but that ending was also annoying.<br/><br/>
The movie could have ended with the scene of her sleeping with the Venetian mask and saved us from another few scenes of pathetic stupidity and poor taste. Well, we weren't that lucky.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's acting was far beyond any critique. I have a hard time believing that he was aware of the fact that he was in a movie. It's pretty difficult to pick up such thing as his worst scene, but I guess he was particularly efficient in making the last scene with Victor Ziegler absolutely laughable.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick, whom I still admire for some of his films, must have died out of shame for having directed such a profligate assault to the cinematographic good taste. Or maybe, knowing that that was his last movie, he did not want us to regret him too much as an artist. Whichever it was, he was tremendously successful, at least as far as I am concerned."

","Perhaps the worst movie I've ever sat through in a theater, much less paid good money for. Only did it cause I (usually) love Kubrick. Whole thing was overblown, hypocritical, misogynist morality tale that played like a short story lifted from a 1950's issue of Playboy. Sleazy without reason, ridiculous and convoluted, wooden/artificial acting from the two leads, heavy handed atmosphere and redundant themes, all to serve a central plot which was as compelling as a frustrated teenager's diary. Sex, desire, mystery, violent urges, perversion, betrayal, all of these things put in an appearance, some longer than others but all similarly shallow.<br/><br/>No beauty, terror, passion, or haunting moods - nothing about Kubrick shone through this mess except some familiar lighting effects and camera uses. Ultimately, this belongs on late night cable next to the rest of the erotic thrillers with artistic pretensions. Most insulting is the consistent masculine reduction of women into whores, as though sexuality still has only one point of view, only one motivating force, and it is Mr. Rich White Male. Marquis de Sade played those same games, but he admitted what he was doing, was conscious of his allocation of power. This movie gives Nicole Kidman a few dramatic, annoying scenes to establish a conflict, but her character is ultimately a nil - the sum of her husband's fantasies and projections. If you're interested in sexual power plays, read Marquis de Sade. If you get off on seeing high-heeled, thong-wearing models strutting around to Gregorian chants, you may enjoy a few minutes of this tedious farce."

","It's amazing that a film this long and drawn out would actually leave so much unsaid and unclear. What's also amazing is that although I am a huge cinemaniac, I am willing to dare to say that the god of cinema snobs, Stanley Kubrick, made a film that was far from perfect. The bottom line is that although the plot was very interesting, the film was simply too low energy, too long and too over-stylized.<br/><br/>I must stop to make a horrible confession. Despite having now done over 9000 reviews for IMDb, I have very, very mixed feelings about Kubrick's films and the following are my insane opinions about many of his more famous films. Some are masterpieces--such as ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Paths of Glory"" and ""The Killing"". Others, exceptional but flawed--""Spartacus"" went on too long and should have ended at the 'I am Spartacus' scene (then it would have been perfect). Others, way, way, way overrated--""2001"" is is definitely so. And others are so long and dull it boggles the mind--""Barry Lyndon"" made we want to scream it moved so slowly.<br/><br/>As for ""Eyes Wide Shut"", it is far from Kubrick's best work and it is painfully slow...but it does merit watching. The basic story idea is, at times, intriguing. There is a lot to like. But, the film shows a certain painfully obsessive quality--a need to show EVERYTHING--every emotion, every grimace...almost every breath! Considering that Mr. Kubrick was well-known for his OCD-like qualities (often shooting scenes again and again and again as well as going months or years past deadlines), this isn't too surprising. Plus, by the time he made the film he was a bit of a film guru--and adored so much that no one would dare question why this movie clocks in at almost 168 minutes--whereas another director might complete the film in less than 120.<br/><br/>There is also one thing that boggled my mind about the movie. Although the film should have received an NC-17 rating (again, I assume this was withheld because it was a Kubrick film), even with gobs of full-frontal nudity, it managed to make sex boring! The way some of the sex scenes were so over-choreographed (especially at the party at the mansion where Cruise was the interloper) made me wish that despite the gorgeous women that they'd just cut much of it. As a result, while it's not a film I'd rush to show a teenager, it's almost sanitary enough that you could.<br/><br/>As far as the performances go, the best in the film was by Sidney Pollack. Unlike most everyone else in the film, he actually had some energy--like he was the only one awake among a half-asleep cast. I sure wanted to see more acting like this--and perhaps, in a way, Pollack was directing himself a bit.<br/><br/>So far, it really sounds like I disliked the film, though this isn't exactly true--I mostly just disliked the way it was directed (ahhh....I must be a heretic). As for the extremely sexy story, some of it was great. I liked how the film explored what might happen if couples are too open about their sexual fantasies and the irreparable harm it can cause. I liked the idea of a secret society made up of the rich and powerful. I liked the way that you never knew exactly whether or not Cruise might die. But, I also think I've seen much of this done better in John Frankenheimer's ""Seconds"". I know that Frankenheimer is a very, very well-respected director but know few would say he was better than Kubrick--but in this particular case I think he did a better job mostly because his film was more direct, less self-indulgent and lacked the occasionally annoying soundtrack. The bottom line is that I liked the film but far from loved it. And, for the most part, that was the reaction to the film when it debuted. Aside from the Kubrick worshipers, most seem to feel it was one of his lesser films.<br/><br/>Worth seeing but think three or four times about having your kids watch it!"

","Before ""Eyes Wide Shut"" came out, there was a lot of hype about it, given that Stanley Kubrick had died before the release, and the possibility that stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman might get EXTREMELY intimate in some scene or another.<br/><br/>WHAT A LETDOWN!!!!!!!!! The movie was boring at best. So let's say for a minute that it was talking about sexual fantasies. If so, then they only focused on male sexual fantasies. Kubrick should have known better.<br/><br/>It wasn't until a took a film class that I even figured out how to have a serious discussion about the movie: there's a lot of duality. There are two Eastern Europeans (a Hungarian and a Serb)*, Tom Cruise twice goes to the Serb (and the first time, he gets angry at his daughter for having sex, but later it looks like he's pimping her), Tom Cruise twice goes to the strange house, and some other things. Also, the Bugs Bunny cartoon that they watch in one scene functions in sort of the same way that the Road Runner cartoon in ""The Shining"" does.<br/><br/>In an interview, Martin Scorsese said that this movie almost seems to be about New York in a dreamlike state. Either way, it still feels like it's dragging. A lousy end for the director who gave us ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""2001"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining"".<br/><br/>*Presumably, this could be a remnant of ""Traumnovelle"", the novel on which the movie was based. The novel was written by an Austrian person in the 1920s. As the Austro-Hungarian Empire had just broken up, there may have been a number of people in Austria from throughout that empire, including Hungarians and Serbs."

"Buddy-51","6","2","6","29 July 1999"," flawed Kubrick opus
","Is it heresy or sacrilege to suggest at this late date - and particularly in light of his recent death -  that Stanley Kubrick's films have almost always been better at promising than delivering greatness?  Almost without exception, Kubrick's carefully crafted works have emerged as brilliantly clinical ""exercises"" rather than fully involving works of timeless art. Audacious, visionary, always willing to push the envelope and challenge an audience to go where it may not want to - these are the hallmarks of Kubrick's directorial genius.  But, along with these virtues, comes a heavy list of counterweighing weaknesses that somehow distance an audience emotionally from what is occurring on the screen:  pretentiousness, laborious pacing, narrative choppiness, often static camerawork.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" fits perfectly into this standard Kubrick mold.  Starting with a fascinating premise, Kubrick takes his audience into unexpected and challenging directions, yet fails to really cope with the complexities of the theme and make the audience care.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman portray a young, upwardly mobil couple, who live in New York City with their young daughter.  When Kidman, in one of the year's best scenes, reveals in a wrenching monologue that she has had serious thoughts of infidelity, Cruise discovers he can't cope with the visions this admission conjurs up.  Thus, he embarks on a sexual odyssey through the streets of the city which leads him into many bizarre and unexpected avenues of depravity including a club made up of the idle rich dressed in costumes and masks who stage orgies replete with secret passwords and portentous organ music.  The problem lies essentially with the Kubrick/Frederick Rafael screenplay which can't seem to connect these scenes of flamboyant nastiness with the theme that is at the film's core.  Cruise drifts into each of his adventures out of an understandable urge to experience this world of sexual perversity, but he seems to end up as a passive observer each time, with little or no revelation registered.  This concept - of examining the effect that even implied infidelity can have on relationship - is such a rich one that it becomes a shame to see it buried under these scenes of often extraneous ostentation.  Kubrick seems so enamored of his little ""visions"" that they begin to dominate the proceedings and bury the theme and the characters. This weakness is reflected in the film's far too tidy resolution, which is thoroughly unconvincing from a psychological viewpoint and makes one wonder how Kubrick could linger so long over scenes with no purpose beyond the sensational yet take so little time with the one that truly matters.  Cruise and Kidman both turn in fine performances, but Sydney Pollack, as a wealthy friend who later in the film sets Cruise straight, hams it up shamelessly. The music is hauntingly effective and helps immeasureably to establish and sustain an atmosphere of portentous weirdness. The title ""Eyes Wide Shut"" will not describe most people in the audience - Kubrick is too skilled at creating an always riveting visual motif for that - but, for me, it will serve as a lasting testament less to his genius than to his maddening inability to fulfill his always great promise."
"LynneSin","1","2","6","25 July 1999"," What a disappointment
","What a disappointment!!  Anyone who rated this movie higher than a 5 probably did so cause they liked all the nudity.  But let me tell you, this movie was just down right horrible.  And I love Stanley Kubrick films! Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket are both in my top 20 of favorite films.  This is probably in the bottom 5 and I can't believe I sat through all 2 3/4 hours of this movie.  As I left the theatre, it turns out I was not the only one who felt extremely disappointment by this movie.  Everyone was complaining about this movie (for those who actually stuck out the entire film, there were several walk outs too).<br/><br/>Where did the movie go wrong?  Well, first he cast Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise as the couple.  Let's face it, Nicole and Tom are incredible actors on their own.  (Kidman - To Die For, Portrait of a Lady, Dead Calm and Cruise - Rain Main, Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men just to name a few).  But the other 2 films that Cruise/Kidman starred together in (Days of Thunder and Far & Away) they just have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever.  This movie just proved it one more time.  If either of them is to ever win an Oscar, they should stop starring in movies together.  <br/><br/>Second, personally I do think that Kidman is the better of the 2 actors and yet she was practically delegated to a supporting role.  She is a strong actress and deserves a much better role than what this movie had to offer her.  Did she have to be drunk during the dance scene?  All this talk of the sex between her and Cruise was nothing compared to her porn-star romp with the Navy officer.  Nicole, you deserve a much better part than what this movie offered.  Tell your husband you love him and go find a movie script and a co-star that will help earn you an Oscar.<br/><br/>And Cruise, first, what's this with Doctor's flashing their badges everywhere they go?  He was just not believable as a doctor?  That whole badge thing was like ""Hey, I'm a doctor here's my badge, now can you do something to help me get this plot out of a rut?""<br/><br/>Finally, just a few other things that bugged me.  Was it necessary that the prositute have to have HIV?  I realize that safe sex and HIV/AIDS awareness is an important topic, but it added nothing to this movie.  I was slightly offended at the 13 year-old prostitute, just felt it wasn't necessary and quite disturbing.  And yes, what's the big deal about having to block out the orgy scene?  I mean, we saw the sex, we saw total frontal nudity.  And let's face it, this movie should be NC-17 rated.  No parents in their right mind would let their kids go see this movie.  Then again, no parents in their right mind should go see this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a sad finale for Stanley Kubrick.  He's had a marvoulous film history with some of the most memorable, visual, thought-provoking movies of our time.  It's a shame this had to be his last hurrah.  If you've never seen any of Kubrick's other films, please rent them so you can appreciate the fact that he was a brililant director.<br/><br/>Well, that's my say.  Oh, and get ride of that horrible music in the movie too.  That was the most treacherous sound to my ears."

","Being a fan of Kubrick, I anxiously awaited the release of this movie only to be disappointed. It was horrible . . . dialogue, acting, soundtrack (or lack thereof), and the pointless plot. Nicole Kidman was unbelievable. Tom Cruise was a walking shell. The only signs of life were the costume shop owner and Nick Nightingale. The packed Saturday evening audience was snickering and talking to the screen halfway through the movie. What was the point of only full female nudity? I guess men stay clothed. The one Kubrick detail I loved was making Christmas trees look ominous. Other than that, a waste of $4.75 and 3 hours of my life."

"juujuuuujj","5","1","2","6 March 2020"," Predictable and memorable, simplistic and dreamlike
","I figured out the plot twist about half-way into the movie. This doesn't mean that the film was bad, but it was neither a masterpiece, nor a flop. Kubrick's skill as a director of memorable scenes shines through, but so does his inability to create convincing human behavior and interactions. Here are some of the positives and negatives of the film:
<ul><li>The characters of the doctor and his wife are not well-developed. Their child serves as an inanimate prop during the whole movie, and even disappears during the last scene, as her parents, and the viewer forget she ever existed. The conspiratorial motives of the wife and the personal dilemma and temptations of the doctor are not well written or well-acted. Their behavior seems drugged and dreamlike, even in scenes where they are supposed to be alert.</li></ul>+ The scenes of the masquerade were truly memorable and creepy - people who have watched this film a long time ago still remember these scenes and not much else. But unlike ""The Shining"", where the story is also memorable, this is pretty much all they remember.
<ul><li>The moral of the film is immediately apparent after the first ten minutes. The wife is able to overcome her temptations and remain loyal, whereas the husband is a clueless a-hole who needs to be tested and justly re-educated. As soon as the doctor starts to behave immorally towards his former schoolmate and his wife, we understand that the aim of the movie is to punish and re-educate the antihero. The doctor is frightened to death by his wife's ruse - she has staged the whole thing in order to test him, spark jealousy, and make him fear for her and appreciate her. He does. But he never gets a true understanding of what his wife wanted him to learn in the first place (to understand a woman's temptations, to appreciate her loyalty and feel jealous because of that).</li></ul>+ The plot twist is never explicitly stated - the wife's plot is never revealed, and it is up to the discerning viewer to spot the easter eggs and turn the cogwheels in their mind. With enough imagination, the viewer can even create alternative explanations, but overall, the wife's collusion with the masked men is more than apparent throughout the movie.
<ul><li>The movie is too slow, and I usually enjoy slow movies. But the plot could well be fitted into a 40-minute ""Twilight Zone""episode, without considerable change in the pace. The dialogue felt choppy, with lots of unnecessary pauses, and this added to the unnatural behavior of the actors. The slow pace was great in the lead-up to the masquerade scene, not so much in the doctor's sleepwalking around the city.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, it's a film that can make you feel smart, but this doesn't mean it's a masterpiece. A 5 out of 10 is a fair average between the overly positive and overly negative reviews on IMDB."

Repeated viewings reveal many highly improbable scenes (a woman whose father died a few hours ago hitting on his physician, a costume store owner who prostitutes his daughter, etc.). I wish Kubrick had focused on the wife's fantasy about the naval officer and the husband's attendance at the orgy. Then Kubrick could have ended with the wife acting out her husband's fantasy by dressing like one of the women entertainers at the orgy and the husband acting out his wife's fantasy by dressing like a naval officer. It would have been a nice message - sharing fantasies and role playing can add a lot of fun to a marriage."
"jgcorrea","10","1","2","24 October 2019"," A delightfully weird, poignant piece of satire on twisted morals
","Critical disappointment with Eyes Wide Shut was unanimous, and the complaint was always the same: it isn't not sexy, it debases human relations. Reviewers sounded like gymnasium practitioners who had gotten out of the theater three hours later feeling horny, frustrated, and fooled: Kubrick was old, out of key with his time. The movie's sexual mores and taboos, extracted straightly from Arthur Schnitzler's fin-de-siecle Viennese Dream Play - jealousy over fantasies played out, guilt-ridden visits to prostitutes, tense discussions of HIV tests that echoed the old terror of syphilis - seemed apparently timid and naif by 1999 standards .
By 2019 , however, the ongoing backlash against the film is blamed on its cynical, miscalculated ad campaign.
Really? The movie's title told us that we were not to really see what we were staring at. In other words, Eyes Wide Shut was neither about sex nor porn. Its real obscenity was in the depiction of the shameless wealth of playful Manhattan, and its effect on society and the human soul. In fact, Kubrick once said he wanted to make a film about doctors because ""everyone hates doctors."" The Harfords do not, like typical Hollywood villains, speak with a foreign accent: they are ""nice"" people - attractive and well-educated, - a couple who collect art and listen to erudite music. The author's point was, evil among the elite is often a question of ignorance, passivity & blindness rather than of cruel alienation. Stanley Kubrick only emphasized - once again in his unique oeuvre - that culture and erudition may have little to do with goodness or depth of character."

","The story follows a New York City doctor as he embarks on a night-long journey, after his wife reveals a painful secret to him, during which he infiltrates a massive masked orgy of an unnamed secret society.<br/><br/>The last movie of one of the greatest directors to have ever lived, Stanley Kubrick. This movie is a genuine cinematic masterpiece. The movie builds very slowly as Kubrick takes his time with every scene to show us each little detail he had in his mind. This is typical for a Kubrick movie to slowly but surely build suspense and other various feelings he wants to wake in us. But the scenes, however long they are, are stunning and gripping. The cinematography in this movie is one of the best ever in my opinion, the dialogue is, to me, brilliant, slow, but brilliant, the casting, I think, is perfect and the story is mesmerizing.
I have to say that this movie isn't for everybody and you shouldn't go watch this movie if you're sleepy or not fully invested in it. But for those who put themselves and almost 3 hours of their time into this movie will see the true genius of Stanley Kubrick."

","Many people perceive or may have a hint that there's more to the world than what is seen and understood. Life isn't as black and white as most would like it to be. Grey permeates every corner of existence, blurring reality and concealing the truth from us, making it ever elusive and more complicated than it should be.<br/><br/>Dr. William Hartford is a successful doctor practicing and residing in New York City. A devoted family man, his marriage to an attractive and complex woman runs into a snag in a night of revelation. Deeply troubled and unable to shake off this new found thorn in the relationship he finds himself in a twist of fate that sends him into a downward spiral where he ends up with more than he bargained for. Perhaps Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" showcases the legendary director's trademarks. The symbolism, the distinguished acting, flawless cinematography and the steady, gradual pacing that leads to the climax. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are well cast as the troubled and attractive couple who go through the challenges of marriage as their world is shaken to its core by matters beyond their control. But the most compelling and haunting factor of the film is the mystery that lies behind the circumstances of the events and what may have transpired. Secret societies, the Illuminati, sinister and deviant rituals, the elite and the other conspiracy theories that have made this film one of the most discussed and dissected works in cinema history. While somewhat slow-going made more by one too many unnecessary scenes, this final bow by Kubrick is a testament to the power of cinema to entertain and to make one think on the reality of the world one lives in while searching for the truth to find meaning and purpose in our lives."

Then again, who am I to tell Kubrick how to do his job? He's a director that has crafted some of the most brilliant films of his time, this one just doesn't work as well as others (it's still better than 90% of the movies I see today, which is why it still earns a 4 star rating from me).

","Despite being subconsciously aware of just how in over his head he is, the sheer secrecy and audacity of the activities taking
place in the rustic andornate chateau outside of New York City was far too captivating for Dr. Harford to pull away from.
Perhaps not considered his best work (while some seem entrapped in discovering patterns and symbolism of his earlier works -
where it seemed more of focus, I believe Eyes Wide Shut (EWS) provided a better glimpse in Kubrick's visionary ability to convey
a real-life adult fairy tale while never breaking the concrete confines of the real world in which it is set), Kubrick undoubtedly
""gave it his all"" in what many refer to as the ""orgy scene"" near the middle of Eyes Wide Shut. The buildup to this moment
might've seemed intense,with exposure to the concept of sexuality from many different angles, but as Dr. Harford makes his
arrangement with the cabbie to request he stay put until his return - the viewer can't help but to get excited. As he shares the
password, one can only use their best guess as to what lies beyond the mansion doors. The initial effect when viewed first time
is jaw-dropping: the dark lighting, the deep red of the carpeting and drapery, the entire scene screams at a very primitive and
human ceremonial event. The only missing ingredient that ensures ""separation of church and flesh,"" would be the costumes -
notably the masks worn by the event's attendees. When Dr. Harford finds his way to the main ballroom and feasts his eyes
on the incense burning, the crowds, and the kneeling women - there is no mistaking his inability to grasp the realities of where
he's found himself while also feeling entirely captivated. Perhaps most memorable - though excusable if one is unable to recall
due to the intense visuals, is the Gregorian chant heard throughout. The masks become increasingly important in relation to
this chant because although it seems more than likely that it would become from the man in the red cape - one can only assume
with a roomful of masked and robed figures. The two major closeups - like bookends - occur when Dr. Harford is first noticed
by a male and female couple from above. The importance here is that they are keenly aware of his uninvited presence,
though not of who he actually is. Once Dr. Harford is required to remove his mask, it is clear that everyone in the room
now knows of his visage, but the only positive reaction - and second closeup - is that of a masked female from above. The story
would later come full circle when it is realized that she chose to sacrifice for him because he had saved her life previously.
I believe the lighting in each of these closeups tells its own story, one of darkness and one of light, respectively, providing a
sort of ""microcosm"" for the rest of the film - one that begins in darkness and unfulfilled desire, and one of light, being saved,
and finding one's way back to their lover."

Hellfire Clubs are meeting places of persons of high quality (politicians, Hollywood executives, etc) who want to take part in extremely immoral acts. Their activities included mock religious ceremonies, devil worship, and occult rituals.<br/><br/>The music in the movie changes drastically when Cruise arrives at the Hellfire mansion. Right after Cruise enters this mansion, the very odd song heard in the background is called ""Backwards Priests"" and features Romanian Orthodox Divine Liturgy played backward.

By having this Christian liturgy played backward right before widespread fornication, it's a way of stating that the ""elite of the world"" is nothing less than satanic!<br/><br/>Although none of this is actually mentioned in Eyes Wide Shut, the entire movie can be interpreted as one big ""magick sex"" journey, characterized by a back-and-forth between opposing forces: life and death - pleasure and pain - male and female - light and darkness!

"darioilg","9","1","2","23 January 2017"," Kubrick's last gift to cinema lovers
","Stanley Kubrick died four days after showing Warner Bros. the alleged final cut of ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Those close to him claim that he considered it his best work ever, like many great authors do in their old age. I can certainly see why Kubrick thought so (if he actually did): EWS is the absolute, perfect representation of his kind of approach to cinema. Disoriented characters, an eerie duality, in this specific case between the world of daylight and that of nighttime, broken pieces of dialogues, loss of control over one's own purposes. In one sentence, Bill is THE Kubrickian character. The story itself, another adaptation from a novel, is hauntingly mysterious, with its apparently random encounters of strange characters, from the menacing unnamed follower to the sketchy owner of the ""Rainbow"" shop. The night wanderings by Bill reminded me of a simple, yet smart film by Martin Scorsese, ""After Hours"", which could be an inspiration for some of it. Another engaging aspect are the many inner links between different scenes that eventually add up to nothing but give a weird sense of connection and of a bigger scheme behind Bill's actions: the one that struck me most was the ""Place under the rainbow"" reference made by the two models at the party, which connects to a locale under the ""Rainbow"" shop where Bill buys his costume. As in most his films, Kubrick has a taste for the esoteric, hinting at many things without explaining anything clearly, which is to me his most interesting style feature. Ironically, I think that in this film Kubrick was so explicit while attempting to show us his own way of cinema that it loses some of the wonder the viewer has in his most ingenious works, first of all ""2001"", where the idea behind the film is so hidden and unclear that to understand it makes for one of the greatest experiences cinema can offer.<br/><br/>Kubrick's style choices for this picture are more similar to those made in ""Barry Lyndon"" than it may seem, for two reasons. Most scenes are shot with the impression of using only ""natural"" light, meaning there is no stage illumination but only lamps, Christmas lights and so on. Christmas trees are everywhere and their multicolored lights take us back to the ""rainbow"" theme, meaning the bright side of the world, under which lies the darkness of raw desire (see the models...). Secondly, Tom Cruise is used more like a mask himself than an actual man: his expressions are recurring and almost unnatural, as he tries to find his way in the labyrinth of his perceptions. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were married at the time of shooting, which reinforces the fact that Kubrick loved the interaction between reality and fiction. If in ""A Clockwork Orange"" the viewer actually goes through the Ludwig cure, here he has the opportunity of seeing unveil a crisis in a couple played by one of the most famous couples of the time. While I loved Cruise's acting, Kidman's felt a little too obvious and extreme, although I don't know how much of a fault she has in it, as Kubrick always had total control over his works."

My film professor (who admittedly is not a Kubrick fan anyway) claimed it was too bizarre for him and that he barely knew anyone who even liked it. My mother (who has never even seen it) claimed the critics ""hated it at the time"" and that ""the sex scenes are supposed to be boring and the plot looks stu-pid!"" Many on IMDb have already expressed their boredom and estrangement. Nevertheless I went in with an open mind.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut (1999) is nothing but a masterpiece; maybe not the best of Kubrick's films, but a gem in his oeuvre nevertheless. If you are looking for smut or an erotic thriller, then this is not for you. Eyes Wide Shut is more interested in examining the link between sex, love, and fidelity than supplying smutty material in any form. The sex and nudity in particular are portrayed in the coldest, most clinical manner, so hardly any of it is arousing anyway. The whole films is uncomfortable yes; the hazy colors and moody score often lend it the feel of a strange, slow nightmare.<br/><br/>Like A Clockwork Orange or 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film brings up big questions about the human condition and never supplies answers. I was not even sure if Bill and Alice's marriage would even survive for much longer by the end of the film. The ambiguity is just brilliant. It's the kind of movie that will have you discussing it for a long time afterward, long after lesser movies have been forgotten. By the time the credits were finished, I was left with a great sense of sadness because after this, we have no more Stanley Kubrick films to look forward to. What a tragedy for film lovers! Still I am grateful for the thirteen movies he did give us and this one is no exception."

","""Eyes Wide Shut"" is one of the best Christmas movies of all time! But, it isn't a movie for the whole family to get together and watch next to a warm campfire on a snowy Christmas Eve. In fact, it barley has anything to do with Christmas, it just seem to take place around the holiday. But, it is an excellent film nonetheless.<br/><br/>Starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, this is a psychological thriller from master director Stanley Kubrick. It is both Kubrick's final film, and one of his absolute greatest, using elements of drama, horror, mystery, and, even really dark comedy. It is a masterful film on every level, with great acting, plot, and filmmaking.<br/><br/>The strange cult sequence is definitely the highlight. It has a horribly nightmarish feel to it, especially because of the eerie score and set up. I made my experience watching that sequence even more disturbing, since I imagined MYSELF in the same scenario, which always adds an extra level of horror while watching a thriller like ""Eyes Wide Shut""."
"videorama-759-859391","8","1","2","4 January 2014"," This one may open people' s eyes
","I must admit this film, angered me, on it's first viewing. Yes I was disappointed. Though it was engrossing, I expected much much much more. When seeing it again, months later, I enjoyed it a lot more. I should of known, being a Kubrick film, it would be out of the ordinary. I had known about the film since 1995, which took 15 months to make, and had wondered about it's progress. It actually made the Guinness book of records as the longest movie shoot. Kubrick must of really got into Tom and Nic's heads, a director who demands perfection. It doesn't feel that way when watching their performances, Nicole's, better than Tom's. He's average, nothing more. Eyes Wide Shut, is like stepping into a dream. It's one way you can take this film. It opens your eyes up to infidelity, and what makes us tic, and how we can correct our mistakes that would make us avoid cheating. We more so take the journey with Cruise, a doctor pulls an all nighter after making a respectful house call, at the death of a patient. From there he roams the streets. He goes back with a prostitute. He has second thoughts about going ahead with.... you know, but still pays her. Idiot. He wastes money again later, too. He goes to a jazz bar, to meet up with an old uni friend, now a pianist. He's told of this place, a secret, elite club, involving a sex cult, and Tom just has to go. What happens here, changes his life erratically. Eyes Wide Shut, is beautiful movie visually, especially the naked orgy scene, or Tom going off with some hot models, but you have to take it with patience, thus making the journey worthwhile. How the lengthy scenes work at the stories slow telling of 153 minutes, is truly something magical, that blindsided me. I could hardly take my eyes off the screen. Despite what I thought of it not having the best endings, quite a downer, actually, this movie really makes you think. Although it isn't Kubrick's best work and will chafe quite a few, may'be give it another viewing, just to see if it still has a much undesired effect."

"danduda1","7","1","2","18 June 2013"," An intriguing mystery
","The thing that struck me most the first time I saw this was what a good movie mystery it is. We're following a character down the street; something's around the corner, we don't know what it is, neither does he...<br/><br/>That's still one of my favorite things about it. It's also a lot about sex - but it all feels very cold for us in the audience; nothing ever feels sexy. When I thought over Kubrick's films, this at first seemed an odd choice. Then I realized he has depicted sex a lot - but always in very non-erotic ways. For instance, ""Lolita"" is about an older man's desperate desire for a young girl. But it's his doomed attempt at finding happiness through possessing her that endures in the mind, not anything sexual.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" depicts many characters trying to, or having sex with each other - but never in ways that seem sexy. One undercurrent is that people are, or are trying to, feed on one another, in an almost animal-like way.<br/><br/>Another theme is a husband, Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) trying to find a safe sexual outlet outside of his marriage, outside his wife (Nicole Kidman). Perhaps reflecting the fears of the times, almost every one he finds turn out to be potentially deadly.<br/><br/>There's also a secret society engaged in satanic sex rituals.<br/><br/>We are left questioning whether or not a woman was murdered after she offered herself as some kind of sacrifice in the doctor's place, when he is uncovered as an outsider who doesn't belong at their party. Questions left unanswered include: why do they allow the doctor to see and learn so much about them? And why would this woman do this (if, in fact, she does)?<br/><br/>Sydney Pollack's character Victor Ziegler may be the clue to our unraveling what's happening just on a simple narrative level. Take a close look at what he's doing right before doctor Bill enters his upstairs chamber, at the first party . For me, it confirmed my fears of about what Ziegler tells the doctor towards the end of the film (a scene that has my vote as the most frightening, diabolical dialogue scene of the decade). We'd like to believe Ziegler is telling Dr. Harford the truth - but the assurance we would feel if we knew he was is denied us.<br/><br/>The mystery surrounding the secret society is more compelling than the story that frames it, so when the conclusion returns to the issues the doctor and his wife are trying to resolve, things feel less interesting. Maybe this was another joke Kubrick was making - obsessions over sex can sometimes leave one with anti-climactic feelings."
"screenman","6","1","2","6 August 2011"," Disappointing
","I'm a Tom Cruise fan, but certainly not a Nicole Kidman fan; so I came to this movie with very mixed expectations. Stanley Kubrick is a director who enjoyed such acclaim since his 2001-Space Odyssey as to assume a position that is almost beyond criticism. In short, if one finds fault in his work; oneself is assumed to be at fault.<br/><br/>This movie certainly answers to his skill in terms of technical prowess. Yet the overall effect for me is disappointment. Cruise has invariably enjoyed a reputation as an action man - here he's anything but. Kidman's common femme-fatale persona is supplanted by a confusing amalgam of seductress and thinking-man's crumpet. For me, that doesn't quite wash either.<br/><br/>It seems as if Cruise is constantly on the edge of something more visceral, but he is never allowed to break out; whilst Kidman appears permanently frustrated by lack of opportunity to flaunt her ample charms. One can't help feeling that the dislocation of their personal relationship is being acted out on the screen.<br/><br/>This is a very dialogue-driven work, yet the script is never intelligent, witty or ironic enough to hold one's attention alone. So it drags from time to time. There are moments of incoherency. At one point, Cruise's character gate-crashes an intriguing little masked ball. There are hints of a demonic rite. But nothing comes of it. His cover is blown and he is warned to keep quiet or else. A piano-playing friend who tipped him off about the party disappears without trace under very suspicious circumstances. Meanwhile, a girl at the party who warns him he is under suspicion and that her life is at risk by just telling him, winds up dead also under suspicious circumstances. It looks like the plot is finally taking-off, yet nothing derives from these events. Why all the secrecy? It was only a glorified gang-bang after all. Another friend (who was there) warns him against any further inquiry in a crassly amateurish way, reasoning that his friend has probably just skipped town, and that the girl was just a drug-addicted prostitute anyway (she died from an overdose), so there was really nothing suspicious. But if they were in the habit of inviting itinerant druggie whores to their little get-togethers, how could they even hope for absolute secrecy? The story just didn't stack up.<br/><br/>I personally like ambiguous denouements just as much as neat summations. But this movie just seems to limp along presenting one idea after another to little plausible effect, ultimately drawing to conclusion for no other apparent reason than that the celluloid seemed to run out.<br/><br/>It is less than the sum of its parts, and they each seem to small enough purpose, Cruise, Kidman and Kubrick notwithstanding. A lavish presentation with nothing to say that is really worth hearing."

","Over ten years later Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is released to the world. I was only four years old at the time, but I could imagine the hype. The final film of arguably the greatest film director to have ever lived. The final cut of Eyes Wide Shut was delivered to Warner Brothers four days prior to Stanley's mysterious death. Stanley called the film his ""greatest contribution to the art of cinema"" but it was greeted with hostility and it's easy to see why. Eyes Wide Shut is arguably his most impenetrable film. The average cinemagoer can appreciate the horror of The Shining and the comedy of Dr. Strangelove without digging deeper into them. However, Eyes Wide Shut is very difficult to enjoy without unlocking those hidden meanings and symbols.<br/><br/>It's possibly his most enigmatic and mysterious film, arguably even more so than 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining. The eye-popping finale to 2001 has more or less been unlocked, but the secrets that lie within Eyes Wide Shut still remain closed and debated upon just like The Shining still is today. However, whilst The Shining is universally lauded as a masterpiece, Eyes Wide Shut is still yet to receive the recognition it deserves. I remember when I first saw the film one night, on my own and finding it incredibly slow but intriguing. I also remember finding a lot of it very frightening.<br/><br/>Last night I gave it a re-watch with my sister and mother by my side. My sister switched off about twenty minutes in and started playing on her phone, whilst my mother said once it finished ""Well, I'm not surprised he died after making that shite!"" which of course makes no sense, but you don't know my Mum. I definitely found a new appreciation for it though. There's so much going on in the film that it's impossible to take it all in on your first viewing. You'll probably end up disliking it, but give it a few days and you'll find yourself pondering over it. You may even find yourself becoming haunted by it like Dr. Bill's guilty conscience.<br/><br/>At its core, Eyes Wide Shut is a Lynchian mystery set in a dreamy New York City. Most know all the bizarre plot twists and turns now, but the less you know the better. Like most Stanley films, Eyes Wide Shut is more of an experience that can't be put into words. It's not the type of film you can dip in and out of, you have to watch it all the way through and give it your full attention. Watching Tom cruise walking down the street shouldn't be interesting, but something about it keeps you inexplicably transfixed to the screen. Similarly, the seemingly never ending monologues carry a hypnotic grip on your senses, such as Nicole's dreamy drug-fuelled confession which kick starts the entire story.<br/><br/>The film holds the record for the longest continual film shoot at four hundred days so the directing is of course beyond masterful. Every single shot is carefully considered and the trademark tracking shots are as dizzying as ever. The mise-en-scene in each scene is also extremely important to consider. There are so many things hidden in the background, such as the recurring multi-coloured Christmas trees which disappear once Tom Cruise enters the mysterious cult. Could this relate to the 'end of the rainbow' as stated earlier in the film? It's little details like this which make Eyes Wide Shut endlessly fascinating to analyse. Only until you analyse the film can you appreciate the painstaking details and intelligent intricacies.<br/><br/>Stanley's final film is often claimed to be a limp ending to a phenomenal filmography, however I'd strongly disagree. Any true Stanley lover will recognise the obscure genius of Eyes Wide Shut. Conspiracy theorists will thrive off the illuminati and Satanist symbolism, but I think there's more to it than that. It's a wonderfully mysterious film with a brooding dreamlike atmosphere. I also have to mention the brilliantly creepy (yet incredibly simple) piano score which has to be the scariest use of a few notes since the Jaws theme tune. Whilst the film isn't quite up to the impossibly high standards of 2001, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, it isn't miles off. Maybe after some repeated views I might hold it in even higher regards."

","Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star in the final film from director Stanley Kubrick, Eyes wide shut. Kuberick didn't exactly save the best for last, but Eyes wide shut is still a worthy entry in this great director's resum'e.<br/><br/>Cruise and Kidman, who were married, play a married couple. One night while they're high, they get into an argument and this leads for her to admit that she ALMOST had an affair once. So, he leaves and goes to find someone else to sleep with.<br/><br/>But this is probably the weirdest night of his life(and those of you have watch the film). After a couple of interesting stops, he meets an old friend who invites him to a mansion,where, there is a sex party going on. And the morning after, he has to unlock the mysteries of it.<br/><br/>A lot goes on in Eyes wide shut that could've been told in an hour and forty-five minutes, but its in 2 and a half hours. The scenes between Kidman and Cruise seems to last an eternity. Actually, a lot of the scenes feel that way. Also, some of the film doesn't add up. What you think will happen, actually doesn't, and you feel sort of let down.<br/><br/>But I was interested in the film. I had more fun predicting the outcome than I actually did in the film. I think Eyes wide shut goes back to Kuberick's A clockwork orange time and runs with it. Eyes wide shut is a dark, bizarre, and interesting thriller. Despite its flaws.<br/><br/>B+"
"kickaxerrr","Null","1","2","16 July 2011"," Maybe not what you think
","I am a huge! Kubrick fan but I think that maybe this movie was less than some people think it was.<br/><br/>Yes it is an exploration of people's sexuality, and yes it is about a man's descent into depravity and even violence (indirectly), but I think it was also the last gasp of a man who wanted to make a film about sex when he was too old to grasp the actual facts of what it is like to be obsessed with sex. It seems to me to be more about the idea of sexuality than the realism of it.<br/><br/>A few graphic sex scenes do not make a good erotic film, which I believe this was supposed to be. A far better example of this would be ""Last Tango in Paris."", which is about the most perfect erotic movie ever made. To me that is what it seems like Kubrick was trying to make. ""Last Tango"" in America or London.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, some of the scenes in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" are beautiful and well thought out and well shot, like the walk through the sex club, edited or not. That is magnificent.<br/><br/>Kubrick definitely had an eye for the camera, I don't think anyone would dispute that (least of all me), but all in all the story ,through dialogue or through visuals, is lacking. The raw, sexual power that could have been portrayed, just isn't. One of the best scenes, visually, is the scene where Cruise is asked to tend to a woman who had a drug overdose, but it just ends up being a naked woman who had a drug overdose. Not very sexy.<br/><br/>I hate to beat a dead horse but, in ""Last Tango"", the scene with the butter is far more realistic and erotic than anything in ""EWS"". Kubrick could have made the most erotic and most provocative film ever if he was 30 years younger. I would love to see what he would have done with this script then. Now, I think he was doing his best, but just didn't have the same intensity that was required for this film. It required a younger director to really bring the sexual parts of this movie to life.<br/><br/>As always, the scenes are meticulous and breathtaking. The lights in the club are just amazing. Cruise walking through the city is remarkable. But the sexual element is missing, and that is supposed to be the main theme of the film.<br/><br/>If you had given a camera to Kubrick when he was 18 and told him to make an erotic movie, it probably would have been one of the most amazing things seen on film, but now, it seems to be just an excercise that does not live up to it's potential."
"hall895","6","1","2","12 May 2011"," A long, strange trip
","Stanley Kubrick's last film, a mere twelve years after his previous one. Bringing Eyes Wide Shut to the screen was a long, strange trip for Kubrick. The idea had been floating around inside his head for many, many years. So much preparation went into it. When shooting finally began it seemed as if it would never end, the noted perfectionist director presiding over one of the longest film shoots ever. And after all of this what was the one thing Kubrick needed most of all? More time. The first cut he produced surely would not have been the end product. The noted tinkerer would have surely been tweaking his film right up to its release date. But death robbed him of that opportunity. And left his final film a bit messy. With some clear, rather easy fixes Eyes Wide Shut could have been a real success. But Kubrick wasn't around to patch it together. And the result is a film which is a bit of a letdown.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is often labeled an erotic thriller. It's a label which doesn't fit. There's nothing particularly erotic about it. Unfortunately not much thrilling either. It's a story of Dr. Bill Harford's journey into a bizarre sexual underground, a world in which he clearly does not belong. What does Bill hope to find? He's sent careening along this path by the revelation that his wife fantasized about cheating on him. Just thought about it, she didn't actually do anything. And this throws Bill completely for a loop. Which strains credulity a bit as you would think the seemingly grounded doctor should be able to handle this revelation which isn't much of a revelation at all. Instead he goes out looking for...something. He doesn't really know what. What he finds himself caught up in is not at all what he bargained for.<br/><br/>There's a sense of mystery to Bill's journey, especially once he stumbles his way inside a bizarre sexual cult. Yes, it's that scene, the scene which got all the attention when the movie was released. The infinitely bizarre, mysterious orgy scene. What the heck is going on here? Who are these people? And what price will Bill pay for his intrusion? The tension in this sequence is thick. But ultimately, much like the movie as a whole, it fizzles out with a very anticlimactic feel. There are more mysteries and possible conspiracies to come but by this point in the movie we'd really like Kubrick to make some sense of all of this. And he never really manages to do so satisfactorily. The movie is very slowly paced. A long, at times laborious, trip. And the ending falls rather flat. With more time to work on the film Kubrick may well have been able to tighten things up. The ending was never really going to work but if he got to that ending in a different way, with a little more energy driving the film forward, the overall experience would have been much improved. As it is there are enough good things here to remind you why Kubrick was so revered but his final film falls disappointingly short of greatness.<br/><br/>Getting this film made was a long, hard journey for Kubrick. And for his stars. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman put a lot into this movie. Cruise is to be commended, his portrayal of Bill is quite good. In playing Bill's wife Kidman hams it up a bit, especially in early scenes where she's drunk or stoned. But she has some good moments too before her character essentially gets out of the way and cedes the stage to Cruise's Bill and his strange journey of discovery. Cruise is really left to carry the film largely by himself, the story belongs to his character. The character doesn't always convince, Bill does some things which quite frankly it is very hard to see a man in his position doing. But Cruise does convince, you buy him as the character even as you question many of the things the character is doing. Kidman is OK with what little she is given to do, Sydney Pollack makes a good impression in a supporting role, but the film really is Cruise's. And Kubrick's of course. The great director's swan song is not exactly what you, or probably he, would have hoped. The story of the making of Eyes Wide Shut was a long, strange one. The movie itself is ultimately a long, strange one. It has its moments but it never quite all comes together."
"tanelteder","8","1","2","2 January 2011"," like a dream
","Suspense and sex are the keywords here. The movie is about one of the most interesting topics and it's sex. It shows how sex can affect a relationship between a nice and young couple and how big influence sex has on how we act to different situations. The one night story which the film follows is suspenseful and sexy so that makes it attractive. Nevertheless, there is not that much nudity or sex on-screen.<br/><br/>In my opinion, all the Stanley Kubrick's films are must see. The Glare, long takes, close-ups of emotional faces, three-way conflicts etc are all something of an unique. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are a perfect couple here. They deliver quite well.<br/><br/>The story told here is like a strange dream. Something completely different happens which tests your senses and you'd want to know why. But you certainly don't want to wake up because you'd want to know where it ends."
"Sophoclaw","7","1","2","2 January 2011"," Bill is existing but not living, takes the world for granted.
","Unfortunately Kubrick didn't have the chance to finish this film. But if he had I'm sure we would've had a chance to grasp its meaning better. My guess, after having watched the film several times, is that Kubrick would've have wanted us to get the following message: Bill (Cruise) is living in a kind of virtual existence and doesn't appreciate what he has or better said what he has inherited as a member of the western civilization. Alice (Kidman) is portrayed as a victim in her role as a member of the woman gender. This comes clear as the film develops when we see how women are treated all along the film. If they are not nice, faithful and obedient housewives, they are hookers that can be bought and misused more or less like animals or slaves. It is their flesh we are interested in. Almost all of the main scenes in this film focus on these concepts. Bill ignores his wife until she confesses some thoughts and flirtations on other men. He reacts as if some of his possessions were about to be robbed and immediately tries to take revenge by being himself unfaithful to her. Suddenly she is real and exists but instead of giving her love, only tries to cheat on her in a miserable and in the end in a failed manner. Now, this is a very difficult theme for a film at any level and Kubrick as a perfectionist as he was, embarked it in an analytical level going slowly step by step, scene by scene systematically to make us understand the implications of the plot. Unfortunately this gives a rather theatric and passive feeling about the whole thing. It seems we are watching a heavy Ibsen theatric play from the 18th century and not a film that is supposed to be modern. This fact is also reflected on the end that is supposed to be a climax after all these steps. It is not, it is tame and disappointedly anticlimax. It is just showing us the indifference or the difficulty about solving the issues this film is dealing with. If just Kubrick had lived enough time to finish it properly."

","Meeting the in-laws for the first time can be uncomfortable, especially watching a film that guarantees the awkward fidgeting to kick in. Luckily I wasn't presented with this scenario, so as a future warning it's probably best to stick with The Sound of Music rather than suggest this.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut, other than being mentally scaring to the people who ban the word 'Willy' in their home, is a very odd movie indeed. In fact other than bordering the porn genre and making the American Pie films seem worthy of a U rating (even the rubbish new ones), it's hard to know what to make of it.<br/><br/>Doctor Bill has everything. Pretty wife, great job, family lifestyle and even looks as handsome as Tom Cruise. Oh err, yes that's right it is Tom Cruise. That is until his wife - Kidman, who quite literally gives plenty of meat to her role, confesses to almost cheating on Bill.<br/><br/>Obviously when such a situation occurs it is best to get as laid as possible with anyone with a pulse, rather than talk his issues through with dear wife Alice. Or that's what Bill wants to happen. None of this is particularly odd, only that Bill would rather spend time outdoors in New York City than be with his frequently-undresses-as-soon-as-the-camera-comes-within-a-mile-of-her wife.<br/><br/>The mid way point when it takes a Rocky Horror type turn for location and mystery, and where it all gets very peculiar. Still no spoilers from here onwards, so if you want to know what happens this is worth a rent (again reminder, not with the in-laws).<br/><br/>It's recommended not to be borrowed from a teenage boy, since if you know of the annoyance of a scene from a DVD being vastly overplayed and becoming blotchy, you will definitely find the first one hour thirty minutes a bumpy ride - and unsurprisingly not for the plot. Ahem.<br/><br/>The ending will separate viewers so much into mixed opinions, that doing julienne on an onion would have less division. You'll end up feeling you have either wasted two sexually fuelled hours of your life or that you can't quite understand what to make of it or you'll love it or you'll hate it or you'll spend another two hours afterwards Googleing Nicole Kidman. Maybe you should just leave it several years to re-watch to see what you think, if the in-laws feel up to it."

","Eyes Wide shut is a very interesting film. The film hasn't got any big plots, but has a lot of long, gentle scenes which have a very obvious theme; sex and sexuality. <br/><br/>The film evolves around a couple who have been married for over 8 years. They have a luxurious house and a young daughter. They seem to have it all, until early in the film Alice (Nicole Kidman) opens up to her husband, Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) about how she feels about sexual lust and how it's affecting their relationship. After an unbelievable unreal truth from his wife, he leaves their apartment. And in this night of pondering and confusion, he encounters parts of the town filled with sexual culture, frustration and desperation. As he experiences, he learns frightening truths along the way.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the film hasn't got a direct plot, but it shows different parts of human sexuality and sexual relationships. It kind of throws it in your face sometimes, because it barely gives you a break. Either you can think of this as very interesting or very exhausting as you might get the ""I get the point"" in your head. I for myself am not sure what I make of this, but I really learnt and understood different aspects for different types of sexual topics (Such as; homosexuality, prostitution, pedophilia and fantasies) It also asks the question of how important sex is in a relationship and how many people might confuse the two. <br/><br/>Other than that, I felt that the character studies of Dr. Harford were very captivating. It kind of answered some of my other questions, which was how a person with high intelligence and full of love can still not fully understand the other part of the relationship which lacks spark and excitement.<br/><br/>All in all a film worth seeing with a message and theme which is more than ever relevant in the world we live in today."
"phryx","10","1","2","23 November 2007"," Very emotional and again something unexpected....
","So I watched every movie Stanley Kubrick shot since Lolita and its very notable he always tried to invent himself again and again... I think he never worked except with Kirk Douglas with one actor two times, might that right? I'm not a great fan of Tom Cruise, he had really bad appearances and I don't like his unemotional style and also in this movie he had a little bit of it. But overall he played really well this time. And so did Nicole Kidman. The sequence shortly after Cruise arrived at home and Nicole tells him her bad nightmare was very true and real. Also the scenes in the house were really harmonious and I really felt with Cruise in these moments. Though the movie is a two and a half hour drama of epic dimensions it could even be longer because it was never, not even one second, boring... for example the party sequence: I remember a lot of party scenes like this in hundreds of movies, but I can't remember one, which was so near to the people. The dance sequence between Sky Du Mont and Nicole Kidman is so near to them you have to watch them because its so... its hard to describe... fascinating, although they just talk about complete nonsense. I think that's very notable for Stanley Kubrick, there is under no circumstances an actor who is just there and if he wouldn't it would be not important, If you remember the guy from the costume rental, or the guy at the reception of the hotel... both of them had maybe 30 seconds, maybe a minute in the movie but you remember them as a person because they had a distinct character. So all in all I just can say: If you like movies where the plot evolves very close you have to watch this movie but If you expect just a 90 minutes amatory drama, go and watch any Hollywood movie, because this is the real art of cinematography. ;-)"

The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.""  Stanley Kubrick What is more frightening, having to wear a mask or what is indeed under that mask? Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick's final and most haunting film is a journey into the mind of a Bill Harford, played by Tom Cruise, who after hearing his wife's fantasy of being with another man sends him into a journey to cheat on her. He roams the streets to escape from his weakness of possibly being undesirable to his wife and along his path is offered sex by a prostitute whom Bill considers in order to get even. There are masks on the wall of her apartment  maybe to show she is more honest about her sexual exploits than the affairs of married couples. She is shown in full view. Most striking is Tom Cruise's transformation into the classic character Dante as he journeys into hell with the aid of Virgil (Sydney Pollack) from the Inferno. Kubrick's use of lighting and cinematography is impeccable as many of the shots are done with a dolly which is one of the hardest to perfect.<br/><br/>What separates this film from so many others is its realistic characters. None are overpoweringly heroic or clear protagonists or antagonists. One might view Cruise's Bill Harford as a protagonist and Sydney Pollack's character Victor Ziegler who represents Virgil as the antagonist but that would deny their developed and rounded characters. No one is particularly virtuous or morally devoid. It is more of a difference of levers of morality than simple on and off switches between who is virtuous and who is immoral. The dialog is pleasantly restrained from pretension and theatrics. No snappy one-liners or eloquent speeches are used here. Instead we get real people who talk like we all do. There problems are much deeper and painful though and they stem from moral decay.<br/><br/>Bill Harford although being a successful doctor is bored with routine, his wife and lifestyle. Anything different would open his life up. Alice Harford played by Nicole Kidman goes through this tormentous affair as well; she takes care of the kid, cooks dinner and fixes the house. They are comatose in an existence where they both are successful and suppose to be happy. After meeting an old friend from medical school who is now a pianist Bill sees him write a password for a gig he will play at. Bill, intrigued, gets where the location is being played from his weak friend.<br/><br/>The next part has Bill enter a mansion that holds a secret ritualistic orgy to initiate new women and entertain the onlookers. Everyone is masked including the sexual participants. The sex scenes in the film are detached, impersonal, cold and clinical. The famous orgy sequence features all masked guests at their party to protect their identities. These men are powerful including politicians, doctors and elite aristocrats. The guests arrive in limos and gain entry to the giant mansion, the password  ""Fidelio."" This scene can be seen as the second layer of hell designated for the lustful according to Dante's Inferno. Virgil (Sydney Pollack) sees him and a woman escorts him and tries to get him to leave because he is in danger. After leaving by being discovered he is called by Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack) mysteriously. He tells Bill that he saw him at the party and the whole thing was a charade.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut has Christmas trees in almost every scene. This may be since the Illuminati use a symbol similar to it as seen in the dinner party. It is an eight pointed star with a triangle and circle in the middle that is suppose to be an ""eye."" Christmas is hardly mentioned in the film and it really serves no purpose as a plot point so the Christmas tree is most likely occult symbolism.<br/><br/>The main conflict that arises in the film is that of intent and action. Harford intends to cheat on his wife and goes as far as entering a prostitute's room to get even but chance strikes as he suddenly gets a phone call from his wife. Does he not go though with it because he genuinely loves his wife or because fear shakes him in this awkward situation? Alice Harford intended to cheat on the marine at the dinner where she and her husband were but didn't. Are they both repulsive for wanting something but not going through with it? That is up to one's own moral compass. The film is about morality and the sex, power and trust are just tests of how strong one's morality is.<br/><br/>The ending shows that after Bill confesses to Alice of where he went and his intentions that there relationship was reduced being just sexual after the trust was gone. This is Kubrick's most haunting film that is expertly crafted and deeply layered. It is one of his best films along with 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br/><br/>10/10"
"MaxBorg89","10","1","2","27 July 2007"," Kubrick's final masterwork: a haunting, compelling nightmare
","Due to the advertising and rumors surrounding the plot (not to mention the stunt-casting of real-life husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as the central married couple) most people expected this film, Stanley Kubrick's last picture, to be an explicit story of sex and adultery. I expected it too, to be honest. I couldn't have been more wrong: Eyes Wide Shut is one of the coldest, most unsettling studies of love and betrayal ever made, one that acquires new meanings as the years go by.<br/><br/>Set in New York (but actually shot in London), the film's bizarre chain of events starts at a party, a typical Kubrickian context, where Dr. Bill Harford (Cruise) and his spouse Alice (Kidman) are among the guests. While his wife elegantly tells a suitor to get lost, Bill is asked to help the host (played with eerie charm by Sydney Pollack) revive a naked girl who has accidentally OD:d in a bathroom. Though visibly shocked by these events, the physician returns home and calmly follows his usual routine. One night, however, an argument between him and Alice leads to the latter revealing she fantasized about sleeping with another man during a holiday. Stunned by the cruelly honest confession, Bill leaves the house and spends the rest of the night wandering around, the image of his wife having an affair prompting him to seek revenge: at first he considers having sex with a prostitute, then he decides to attend a party a friend told him about, only to run into something bigger than imagined and almost risk his life.<br/><br/>Superficially, Eyes Wide Shut can be considered a sex film, but it is in fact much deeper: with only one actual ""sex"" scene (apart from the infamous orgy sequence and Bill's visions) in the whole movie, the focus is more on what love and commitment imply and demand. Naturally, being this a Kubrick film, no happiness should be expected: so chilling it actually makes Mike Nichols' Closer look like a comedy, EWS leaves no room for comfort or relief, the cynical closing line being the definitive punch in the stomach for anyone hoping things would go differently.<br/><br/>Moreover, the wonderfully strange title suggests this movie might be the one that most reflects the director's view on cinema: film is like a dream. In this case, it is a frightening nightmare, and even though there are clues that seem to prove Bill's harrowing experience took place in his mind alone the ghostly atmosphere never leaves.<br/><br/>Scariest of all, though, are the fearless anti-performances Cruise and Kidman deliver: combining the original script with whatever problems they might have had at the time (one should keep in mind their divorce was finalized less than two years after the movie's release), they expose the darkest sides of marriage with a brutal sincerity that clearly indicates there is no, or very little, acting involved. And while Cruise used his role and that of Frank Mackey in Magnolia (his best work to date) to prove he could handle more difficult characters, Kidman's surprisingly raw portrayal of disappointment and secret lust was the first of many parts (Moulin Rouge!, The Hours and Dogville in particular) that showed the world she was actually a great actress and not just the Top Gun star's wife.<br/><br/>With its layered thematic content, expert execution and brave cast, Eyes Wide Shut is a fascinating last film from one of cinema's undisputed masters, and like all other Kubrick pictures it repays repeated viewings like few are able to. A little warning, nevertheless: it is not recommended if you get nightmares easily."
"jvincent1","10","1","2","20 July 2007"," Complex and Compelling, but I'm Tired of American Censorship.
","The older Kubrick grew, the more he tired of the limitations imposed by traditional story-telling, as the complexity of the structures of his last two films, Full Metal Jacket and Eyes Wide Shut, clearly reveal. Had he lived, I'm of the opinion his films would have reflected a combination of his old, traditional eastern European values merged with some hybrid form of David Lynchian narrative structureless, creating a result I cannot even imagine. Debate on future Kubrick films, assuming he lived, would have been most interesting. But, this is not my point. It's those damn little digitalized images which intrude upon the orgy scene in Eyes Wide Shut which have my attention, because, in the United States, those brief little computer-made creatures followed the film to DVD. I was determined to find a way to remove them, so I could enjoy Kubrick's final film in its purest form just like our brothers and sisters across the ocean. I'm sure most persons could care less, but there does exist a small number of film buffs willing to go a little farther in order to eliminate problems of this sort, because there are solutions out there, you just gotta find out what they are. DVD players and the DVDs also are manufactured to be compatible according to its region. The almighty powers of the DVD empire have divided the world into twelve regions, and, for example, since the U.S. is coded region 1, only DVD players manufactured for that region will play DVDs also with region 1 coding. How do you ascertain the region of a DVD? On the back side of most DVD cases, if you will look carefully towards the bottom of it, you will find an image of the globe, sometimes encased in a rectangular little box, others shaped like a global football, and in the middle of that little globe is a number, which in our case is always a number 1. It's not always easy to spot this small globe and number, but believe me, it's usually there. Now, if you were to come across a European DVD in its case, you'll find that same globe but the number in its middle will be a 2, rather than a 1. That's because most European DVD players and discs are manufactured for each other, and in Europe's case, that's region 2. Now, put a region 1 DVD (U.S.) into a European DVD player, and what happens? Nothing happens. You get no picture. The player and disc are very simply not compatible. Very often, when you're on a movie site, looking to buy or rent a foreign film that you've read about, etc., when examining the DVD's specifications, you'll reach a point where it warns you about region compatibility, or the possible lack thereof. Major foreign films, those that have gained a certain level of notoriety among film enthusiasts, very often are available in region 1 format. However, that's not the case for a far greater number of films from other countries. Surprisingly, certain American films are available only through some foreign distributor, in, say, a region 4 format for example. Orson Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons can be purchased only as a region 6 DVD. David Lynch's Lost Highways, until recently, was available for purchase only as a region 2 disc, and this still is the only region in which you can obtain the film in its theater aspect ratio. In addition to this region compatibility problem, the DVDS of films from other countries often have video signals in the PAL format while many American televisions come only in the NTSC system, which basically means your colors will not match and, hence, lousy picture. I'm not very comfortable addressing the contradictions of mixing PAL and NTSC DVD other than to say, it will not work. With all these different regions for different foreign and domestic movies on DVD and PAL encoding for American DVD players designed to handle region 1, NTSC DVDs, is there a way to make it all work? Absolutely. With the region-free or multi-region or all region DVD player, all these problems promptly disappear, and any DVD will perform nicely in a DVD player of this nature. At a price no higher than a regular DVD player bought at the local chain electronics store. Don't look for a region free DVD player there, however. It only sells regular region 1 DVD players for those region 1 DVDs which it also sells. So, where do you go to buy one of these region-free players? The answer is on line. There are many, many sites which offer these type players. I don't know whether you can mention products or stores on here, so I will not do so, but you can email me and I'll refer you to the place where I bought mine, which has operated smoothly for about two years without any trouble, and many, many films have run through it over the course of that time. With this region-free DVD player, I purchased a region 2 version of Eyes Wide Shut on DVD, and watched the film without the insertion of those damned digital images in the orgy scene. It was a little thing, but it mattered to me, as do all the other foreign (and some domestic) films I've purchased and watched several times. With all this hoopla about the coming of high-definition DVD, a battle for supremacy between two competitors and the eventual winner an unknown for several years to come, you're better off with a much, much less expensive region-free player which will greatly expand the diversity of your collection. One other thing about the high-definition competition: the eventual loser will fade at about the same rate as VHS has to DVD, and its products are not compatible with those of its competitor and visa versa. I can be emailed at: jvincent1@bellsouth.net. By the way, I don't sell the things, I just promote the international bonding resulting from film."

"MichaelMargetis","5","1","2","6 July 2005"," ""No dream is ever just a dream. "" - Dr. Bill Hartford
","Let's start this review off on a positive note. Stanley Kubrick was the most talented film director to ever walk the face of the earth. It's an extremely bold statement, but I'll stand by it proudly. You see, I've never encountered a filmmaker with such a meticulous and keen vision as Mr. Kubrick's. He truly was a genius and every film he made was a shining example of his wondrous talent. Well, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is his very worst film in my opinion, not to mention his most pretentious. It's a very muddled, confusing, peculiar and most of all boring film, but it presents itself as if it's a masterpiece. Critics raved about it, but the Academy shunned it (a move of the wise in my opinion). Kubrick fans seemed to have split on it, and I'm here to say it's a damn shame this was this brilliant man's last film. 'Eyes Wide Shut' tries to awaken curiosity, be provocative and cause us to think long and hard, but it just ends up being an absolute train wreck. It isn't a bad film, but it is just so upsetting and disappointing since it came from Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>The warped story follows a rich married couple living it up in a nice apartment in Manhattan. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) is a wealthy, young and handsome M.D. married to a slightly crazy nagging woman, Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman). They seem to be such a perfect couple and have a smart seven-year-old daughter, but they have extreme jealousy issues when it comes to their relationship. Alice is jealous of Bill being with other women, and so is Bill to a certain extent. Just before Christmas, the two get invited to a Christmas party held by Bill's boss, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack). At the party both Bill and Alice find other people they may be attracted to and fight and argue about it later that night. At the party, Bill runs into an old friend of his who dropped out of medical school, Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), who is the piano player/band leader at Ziegler's party. After the party, Bill and Alice have a huge marital fight while smoking marijuana, and in the middle Bill gets a call from the daughter of a patient who passed away. Bill makes a house call to see Marion (Marie Richardson), whose father has passed. After visiting her, he decides to not cut the night short and go out to see Nick Nightingale play at a local bar. The two meet up, and Bill becomes aware of a secret organization which Nick plays piano at, and wants to check it out. Nick lets the password slip and tells Bill the address. Bill checks it out, and it ends up being a secret ceremony people wear costumes and masks too, then have wild sex orgies with various hookers. Bill get's spotted by the leader of the organization and then is threatened not to tell anybody. The film takes a bizarre and hard-to-follow turn after that point, and frankly it looses my interest.<br/><br/>'Eyes Wide Shut' isn't a success not due to Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick provides astounding direction as always. His vision is vibrant with color and beauty, and that alone kept me going throughout the film's two hour and forty-minute runtime. The acting from the two leads isn't that great. Tom Cruise is absolutely dreadful in his role, and is anything but believable as a doctor. Nicole Kidman is nothing better then average, but her screen time is way more limited then you probably would anticipate. The supporting cast is good though, with strong performances from Sydney Pollack, Todd Field, Vinessa Shaw (as a beautiful prostitute Bill takes a liking to), Rade Serbedzija (as a costume shop owner), Leelee Sobieski (as the costume shop owner's daughter) and Broadway actor Alan Cumming as an eccentric and entertaining to watch hotel desk clerk. The writing in 'Eyes Wide Shut' drags repeatedly, and it's of a quality so low I'm absolutely shocked Stanley Kubrick wrote it! Although the film's cinematography as music score are incredible, it can't really make up for a drawn-out and tiring storyline. Supposedly it took Stanley Kubrick a long time to make this, and that definitely shows because of how jumbled and hard to follow the film is.<br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a film for Kubrick fans only. Others will roll their eyes and sigh through the drawn-out pretentious movie 'Eyes Wide Shut' is. Even though there is a lot of intriguing scenes buried within 'Eyes Wide Shut' they never really seem to redeem the constant dragging of the film. It seems as though there is two or three movies going on at one time in 'Eyes Wide Shut' because the film never really blends into together well. I'm going to cut 'Eyes Wide Shut' more credit then it could possibly deserve because it has the great Stanley Kubrick's name on it. Kubrick really does a fine job with the directing aspect of 'Eyes Wide Shut', but the film lacks almost everything else. 'Eyes Wide Shut' ended up being a disappointment of colossal proportions, and that's an absolute shame seeing as though it was our world's finest film director's last motion picture. Grade: C+"
"a-jacke","10","1","2","11 May 2005"," Thge master of cinema pushed a great actress
","Everybody knows that Kubrik is the one of the great masters in the history of cinema. And his last film is a great final and nothing else.<br/><br/>With this film, I would say the acting of Kidman have to become another dimension. What Jane Champion or Gus van Saint never have shown Kubriks show us from her in 10 minutes. The dialog between Kidman and Cruise after they have smoke a joint is so real and important that much of my friends tell me that they were angry about her in this scene. ""She is searching a conflict"" they say. But it is the truth??? I think that it is not the problem. The problem is that her husband in this film and with him many people don't understand anything of her fantasies. Or they don't want understand. I think what the wife is saying in this scene to her husband is not a provocation - it's a real problem for her, too.<br/><br/>With her fantasies his jealous run begin - the motivation for the complete film is given and Kubrik also as Schnitzler make a story about a man. But in the beginning and again in the end in this film the scenes with Kidman are so good that here at the first time everybody can see how much she can.<br/><br/>Here and before in ""Portrait of a young lady"" in the end slumbers fill her eyes - and the tragic dimension of life become the result of it all. They details of it you must see by yourself, but never forget that they stopping of this fantasies is impossible. Because so you can understand that the end is not the end, because there is no end - for her - for him it is possible. Thank you for reading."

","Am I the only one who has the guts to say this movie was just ok? I mean, just because it was Stanley Kubrick's last film has everyone trying to use ridiculous allegories to justify what was basically an average film. If it was any other director, this would not be raved about as it was. Instead we have pseudo-intellectuals dissecting the cinematography, the lateral metaphors blah blah. Please, making lame observations using a thesaurus does not an intellectual make.  Objectively speaking, I found the movie worth watching. It was ok by Hollywood standards. I only wish Cruise had spent some money on voice modulation - he still sounds like a choir boy. Its hard to take him seriously in a role such as this, with his pre-adolescent squeaking."

At least in this American<br/><br/>version (I've read the European edition is more explicit) the sex is<br/><br/>not actually that graphic, although Nicole does use the `f"" word a<br/><br/>lot. But that's not really the core of this film at all.

","I think there are two types of people: those who thought this movie was art and those who thought it was terrible and had no reason for being done.<br/><br/>I think it should have been rated NC-17, but I also don't think that's the death notice of a film.<br/><br/>I did think it stank.  I don't know why Cruise, Kidman and Pollock had anything to do with it.  There had to be some reason, but I thought it was boring pornography.<br/><br/>I also thought it was very Kubrick, but from me that's not a compliment.  I still have no idea what 2001 was about.<br/><br/>There was a good bit to the movie, which I'll paraphrase.  Cruise goes to a clandestine party where everyone wears a mask.  Yet somehow, Pollock knows he was there.  How, because, as Pollock put it, he arrived in a cab as opposed to a limousine and his name was in the cape he handed to the valet.<br/><br/>Weird movie because of the cast.  Otherwise it would have been an ordinary skin flick, I suppose.  Once again a director proves it is possible to put together a group of attractive women, all naked, and have it be not remotely titillating."
"wawain","10","1","2","9 February 2004"," WOW (no spoilers)
","This film has some of the best photography I've seen on any film. For me, this film raised the bar on good cinematography, so much so that I found myself thinking that the Lord of the Rings films actually didn't convey mise-en-scene well enough (I was surprised to find that simply showing grand vistas of fantastic places/creatures wasn't good enough for me). The pictures in Eyes Wide Shut alone sucked me into Kubrick's world completely. The film made me think that on most films each film frame conveys primarily one color/tint (they look bluish, reddish, greenish, yellowish etc.). The scenes in Eyes Wide Shut, on the other hand, captured in the same frame multiple colors (including black) so well that, it felt like the film had a higher resolution than it actually did (because my eye could resolve more details). The overall effect is that the images felt more real than those of most other films. Actually ""surreal"" is more appropriate, because Kubrick didn't settle for mere realism. It is said the film takes place in a dreamscape, partly *because* of the gorgeous color saturation.<br/><br/>The film itself is pure Kubrick. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is all about the mystery and intrigue, never about the clear resolution. The other reviewers here have pointed out lots of juicy interpretation-bits, so I won't say more."
"nicki_stovall","Null","1","2","30 September 2003"," Kinda missed the mark
","I'm unsure of how much (or how little) Kubrick had to do with editing the final version of EWS, but I'm leaning toward ""too little"".  The pieces just didn't come together, and when the ending finally came, I thought- ""I just paid $8 to see this.""  Lord knows this could've been some really juicy cinema.  Even with the nudity and sex eclipsed with CGI bodies, it was quite provocative, but went nowhere. Also, I got a strong feeling that there were contract obligations that Kubrick had to live with regarding Cruise and Kidman, meaning that the two were a package deal and he was stuck with them.  Cruise' performance was certainly more than adequate, but Kidman's acting seemed forced and 'off the beat'.  The uncut version is fleshier, but no better."
"bkam","Null","1","2","16 August 2003"," Hate to say it, but... Riveting
","The smallest of spoilers.  Despite its lumbering and sometimes excruciating pace, this movie kept my eyes locked on the screen.  It is not that the film is pleasant to watch; on the contrary, many times it makes its viewing extremely difficult.  Yet it is so rich in detail and realism that it has a sort of twisted charm to it.  Not that the plot is realistic, because few would say that Bill Harford had a typical night.  Instead, it is the human emotion which is real, and in many ways it is the sheer brilliance of the acting that makes this bizarre situation into a hauntingly familiar one. Tom Cruise is perfect for the role, and some have argued this is not because of his talent, but the fact that he is not a good actor.  Kubrick seemed to play on this, and molded the character of Harford into one who is at once acting and not acting, real and fake.  This is made possible by the strange relationship between actor and character in this case--this is definitely not Tom Cruise's typical role.<br/><br/>Kidman, on the other hand, is absolutely superb.  Having read that Kubrick had forced her to film some scenes hundreds of times until she was crying after each shoot, I expected some sincere acting.  She well exceeded my expectations, however, with such strikingly poignant acting that I was almost immediately drawn into the lives of this semi-functional couple. Without her, how could Harford have the drive to do what he does in the film?  She is excellent, as are all of the supporting actors and even those in even one scene (the desk-clerk, Domino, Mandy, etc).<br/><br/>The cinematography is also top-notch.  If my eyes did not deceive me, there were some strange tricks in this film.  I saw an eye move across Harford's back as he enters his home in one scene (replayed it like 5 times to confirm it).  Things like that combined with the already outstanding camerawork add another layer of macabre deception which the film embraces.  Near the beginning, when Kidman is describing what happened at Cape Cod, there is another artful use of the camera as it follows her hysterics, nodding downwards to watch as she collapses with laughter.  Given that this was an unfinished movie by Kubrick, the high quality of the cinematography overall is a tribute to his genius.<br/><br/>The score was simple and repetitive--and yet so enormously effective.  Those piano notes, reaching their apex when Harford returns home near the conclusion of the film, are really only a few dissonant notes, but they mix with the visual imagery and the atmosphere of the film to become a cacophany in the mind of the viewer.  There are numerous musical references in the film as well.  The score fits perfectly with the ambiance of the film.<br/><br/>The suspense of this film was maintained at a high level throughout, reminiscent somewhat of Blue Velvet with its inexplicable darkness, which is one of the most suspenseful films I have ever seen.  Certainly there is a Lynchian element in the darkness of the film and the way the film's reality changes drastically during the conversation with Ziggler.  And yet, while discordant realities may be Lynch's specialty, Kubrick focuses on the depraved reality, all the locations of his films having their own psychology which can essentially go insane the way his protagonists are wont to do.  We are given reality filtered through the protagonist's increasingly unstable psychology, and this film is an extraordinary example of it.<br/><br/>This film is not for everyone.  It is long, it is dark, it does not have a typical easily-understood plot.  It is character-driven, and at that, features a character whose reality many viewers would not be comfortable to reside in for three hours.  It is not easily understood.  It is not all that it seems, but is more like a message from Kubrick whose ideas I can really only scratch.  If you're intrigued, you will probably enjoy this film.  If you're disgusted, you will probably hate it.  I doubt there's many who fall in the middle. [9/10]"

With ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" the director's sterile, detached style reaches an unfathomable low, as he literally sucks potential vigor and excitement out of his own movie during its 159-minute transfusion.  Therefore it is hard to blame the actors for the film's lack of importance (and interest)--neither Tom Cruise nor Nicole Kidman can feign drunkenness (or other highs) convincingly, and their performance as husband and wife feels uncomfortably self-conscious.  It doesn't speak too well for Kubrick when his best-staged scenes involve Alan Cumming and Sydney Pollack embarking on expositionary monologues when he gets bored with ogling his bland stars.  The director's death only helped fuel the hype about ""Eyes,"" but the perceptive viewer won't find much to get excited over--every inch of the female anatomy is lovingly examined during the much-ballyhooed orgy scene, yet is drawn-out, numbing, and base compared to something like ""Blue Velvet"" or ""Crash.""  The pretext for Cruise's descent into the baroque sexual underworld--Kidman's admission of an 'erotic' daydream--is rather improbable, resulting in a weak payoff in the last act.  Granted, there are some moments that hooked me in, but the trance was only fragmentary.  To many, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was interpreted as a fitting epitaph for a great director--to me, it just amplified an overrated one.<br/><br/>4.5/10"

","It's hard to say what this movie is about. One thing it sure isn't about is sex, or rather the erotic aspect of sex. In fact it's rather easy to say what the is movie isn't about: Eroticism, storytelling, competent direction, editing, and certainly not acting. Evidently Kubrick spent a massive amount of time filming and editing the thing, but like some things, the more you pick at it, the worse it gets. Call it perfectionism, call it attention to detail, but also call it not just diminishing return, but out and out regression.<br/><br/>Usually one can say that a movie needed more work, this one needed much, much less. The movie itself is a kind of descent, like so many other works both literary and cinematic. In fact it's sort of a basic plot of many soft and hard core sex movies: Disatisfied middle class husband descends into a strange and erotic world, learns a lesson and returns to his wife a better person (usually releasing her own pent up desires in the process). This is a dark, dark, version of that plot line. And it's hard to see if any lesson is learned by Cruise's character, in fact it's hard to say anything has really changed--the two leads are just as vapid and stupid at the end of the movie as when it began.<br/><br/>For those folks who pretend to get this movie, well, self deception is one thing that does come through in the film -- so live long and prosper in that deception. There's nothing here to get -- save that sex is really complicated and people lie to themselves about it.<br/><br/>One interesting parallel is a soft core sex movie called ""Sin In The Suburbs"" from the very early sixties that has a similar sex style club involved. It's not a good movie -- but it goes to show this has all been done before, and much, much better."

","""I'm going to watch this again to remind myself why I hated it,"" I told the nice boy at the video store.  He laughed, being a nice boy, and told me the movie got better the more you saw it.  Maybe it does.  In any case, it didn't feel quite as long...<br/><br/>But I suppose I should be fair to the movie, although I'm sure it loses no sleep wondering whether it's been fair to me.  I did get a better sense of why someone else might like this.  There are some very deep, fascinating, thought-provoking things happening here.  My problem is, they don't happen in the actual movie as such.<br/><br/>Watching Eyes Wide Shut for a second time, I was reminded of two scenes from two very different movies, both of which I liked.  The first is from the Kids in the Hall movie Brain Candy.  From a very swank party, our scientist hero is summoned by his boss to a room downstairs where beautiful people lounge about a swimming pool.  ""What is this?"" he asks.  ""This is the real party, Chris,"" he is told.<br/><br/>The second scene is a flashback from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  A random hippie is sucking spilt acid from Hunter Thompson's sleeve when a man walks in on them, and is forever convinced that just behind every men's room door, men in red sweaters are getting incredible kicks from things he'll never understand.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise in Eyes Wide Shut is essentially the man who walked into the restroom.  He's convinced that somewhere out there lurks the real party, and it's got something to do with sex.  Sex really gets a bad rap in this movie (except maybe for marital relations in the missionary position, which are never really commented on.)  It's the neo-Puritan post-HIV philosophy of our times:  Sex is gonna kill ya.  Didn't you see Halloween?<br/><br/>Of course, I'm only guessing at what's ""really"" going on.  Nothing is horribly explicit in this movie.  We assume that there are deeper levels to it, and that they are oh so very deep indeed, but it isn't so much the movie hinting at that as it is the fact that, taken at face value, this is an excruciatingly boring film.  We have Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who do not have characters well-defined enough to make us think of them as anything other than Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, doing a large amount of nothing for a large amount of time.  Cruise spends most of the movie walking around New York as if he were an amnesiac who'd been handed an index card:  ""You're a doctor.  Offer people money.  Try and get laid, but then again, don't."" Kidman sounds like she learned to speak from listening to her seven-year-old daughter read out loud -- with long......pauses......between her...........words.  Was she directed to talk that way, or was it the only way she could get through the dialogue?  And why on earth do they keep their pot in a Band-Aid box?  They have a daughter, what if she cuts herself? Where do they keep the Band-Aids?  Rolled up in a sock?<br/><br/>And then comes the orgy scene.  I remember how thrilled I was by it the first time.  Finally, we're at the real party.  It's gorgeous, and mysterious, and sinister.  It's exhilarating and terrifying.  It's over in ten minutes.<br/><br/>And Tom Cruise is still boring, still a doctor, but now he's also an amateur detective.  He's gone from seeking admittance to seeking understanding. He learns secrets, and we learn secrets, but they're not really definitive, or even all that exciting.  Oh, hi, it's the end of the movie.  Everybody wave.<br/><br/>I don't hate this movie as much as I did the first time.  The nice boy at the video store says he's seen it three times, and by now he ""almost likes it,"" so maybe if I saw it twice more, say, on an airplane, or tied up during a sadomasochistic ritual, I might change my mind.  It does have a few high points: the Asian guy in the blond wig, enough female nudity to choke a chicken, and, um...oh, and Alan Cumming is in it briefly.  If you prefer reading between the lines to reading the actual lines you'll probably love it.  I won't hold it against you.<br/><br/>Personally, I like to think that somewhere, ideally an abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard, Kubrick's inner circle is watching the real movie, which is infinitely better.  I hope they're all wearing masks."

","Kubrik has done it again! Despite the fact that some people call this movie disgusting and weird, I would just have to say that they haven't reached the level of maturity in movie viewing to be able to see Stanley Kubrik's genius. Not only is this film strong in conveying an interesting point but it is also highly entertaining to watch. Like all of Kubrik's films, Eyes Wide Shut opens the door to a new universe of understanding a subject, which in this case is sex. Every moment of the movie is filled with colorful themes that branch from that one part of our mentality concerned with love, affection, and last but not least lust. Kubrik presents the viewer with a variety of different sexual preferences and in the background shows how people, sometimes unknowingly, exhibit them through their behavior. At this point it should be mentioned that if you are viewer who is concerned about stuff like strong sexual content, nudity, etc., you should make an exception to see this movie in any case. Because although the MPAA does describe Eyes Wide Shut with these exact words, Kubrik simply used theses themes to deliver a more direct and powerful message (in which he highly succeeded). So in conclusion I highly recommend that you see this film, because it's one that you don't want to miss."
"Captain Ed","6","1","2","24 October 2000"," One final comment ...
","One thing I forgot to add in my earlier post is a response to the many reviewers who advise four or five viewings to understand what Kubrick is trying to say.  This is an incredibly arrogant comment and shouldn't go unchallenged.<br/><br/>First, as an avid movie-goer, I well understand that repeated viewings of a film will sometimes give different perspectives and meanings.  Cool Hand Luke is one such film, Edward Scissorhands another, On the Waterfront, Being There, and many, many others.  However, if a director makes his film SO obtuse that it takes more than two viewings to understand it (really, more than one), then the film fails.  The point of art is to communicate, not to needlessly play mind games.<br/><br/>Second, I *did* get the message that Kubrick intended on sending, and I still feel the movie was pointless and boring.  That's due to some very lackluster directing and below-par acting, especially by Nicole Kidman. Having interminable long shots of empty rooms and hallways may be a hallmark of Kubrick's (I'd disagree with that), but if so, it doesn't work.  It drags the pace of the film down to a crawl.  So does Kubrick's idea of delivering 'important' dialogue: stretching the words out needlessly in a monotone. Small wonder this film came in at 2:45.  Watch The Green Mile, another multi-layered movie, and see how fast the three-hour runtime passes. <br/><br/>
I understand that some reviewers have an emotional attachment to Kubrick, and I also really enjoyed other of his works.  Take another viewing of Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange.  Sure, you can get different subtleties and symbolisms on multiple viewings, but the main themes are communicated clearly  on the first viewing.  Both movies also were well-paced, included excellent acting, and had much more interesting (and real) conflicts, taking real chances with the material, not the half-baked and phony issues which form the crux of this movie.  In this case, sadly, the Emperor has no clothes."

","Briefly: over-long over-rated movie by an over-rated director.<br/><br/>More detailed comments?<br/><br/>We see the rich and beautiful people on toilets, getting stripped, getting dressed, and being rich and beautiful. Just as in another of Kubrick's over-rated films 2001, the director takes much too long to belabor a thin plot. Photographed in a gauzy glow, the film could be called THE NINE YEAR ITCH. It's full of style with little substance. Some of the piano music is reminiscentm of old nickelodeon meller-dramas. I got the feeling that the film was Kubrick's failed attempt at being Hitchcock.<br/><br/>The story takes an hour to really get started, and everything seems to be in slow motion. That's a self-indulgent method of storytelling that doesn't work here at all. Be prepared to use fast forward a lot if you don't want the film to drive you up the wall.<br/><br/>Oddly set at Christmas time, it could have been a good Halloween film if it had some pacing to it other than a dirge. However, there are a few enjoyable moments: the comic relief of the costume shop and the amusingly baroque masked ball.<br/><br/>As to the interpretation of the story as being a long dream that the sexually-starved doctor is having -- well, maybe, but unless that's clear in the original novel and one reads the novel, it's certainly not clear in the film. In fact, not much is really clear in the film. Of course, that's probably part of the theme. But I have to say it's much ado about nothing."

","This film starts with the basic handicap of both leads being undeniably pretty, but utterly lacking in cinematic sex appeal. One of the reasons Kidman was so well cast in ""To Die For"" was the frigidity and detachment she brought to the part of a woman using her sexual charms to get where she wanted.  Add to this Cruise's lack of talent - to the extent that in some of the scenes when he was meant (I think) to be in an extremely emotional state, I honestly found it hard to tell whether he was laughing or crying, and in a scene where he sits in the back of a taxi, there is almost a voice-over saying ""Look at me; I'm brooding!""  True, there are lots of remarkably gorgeous women's rears, and some fronts, and some inevitably unrealistic sex, but I was left not only sharing most other critic's bafflement at what the picture was trying to say, but why on earth it was trying to say it - whatever IT was."
"mailbob","4","1","2","29 May 2000"," Hard to keep eyes open.
","With the hype last year - magazine covers and all - I expected something more. Much more.<br/><br/>I give the film a generous 4. I thought it failed on several counts: Tom Cruise has never been a favorite of mine. In The Firm, at least, he came closer to character playing a smart-ass attorney, but his self-assured semi-smirk and perfect Hollywood looks don't fit the character of a young doctor. Both the Cruise and Kidman characters were superficial to the extreme, with no more personality than cartoon characters.<br/><br/>The characterizations were bad enough, but the acting didn't help. The two leads in particular seemed acutely self-conscious. Whenever Kidman spoke, she exuded ""I'm a sexy actress playing a REALLY hot role - listen to my every profound word!"" I could prepare a snack before she finished a sentence. By the time she did, I was so irritated I nearly lost track of what she was saying. And her intoxicated demeanor while dancing at the party with a stranger - who came off as some hack's quick-fix cliché - was simply embarrassing.<br/><br/>As if the pace of the dialogue wasn't slow enough, questions had to be repeated - i.e., ""What do you....think?"" (pregnant pause) ""What.....do... I think?"" ""Yes, what.... do you.... think?""  Over and over and over again. Please, not EVERY word is such a big deal. The result is a pretentiousness that simply overwhelems. Is it really necessary for this film to take nearly 3 hours? Not if the characters sounded like real people instead of robots stuck on repeat.  I'm reminded of Kubrick's revolving spaceship in 2001, accompanied inexplicably by a Strauss waltz. I remember wondering - will this scene ever end? Unfortunately, I had the same feeling in this film, many times.  That shouldn't happen in any film, let alone one with a subject matter that should - de facto - keep everyone enthralled, and one that is the last film and the crowning achievement of an important director's life.<br/><br/>What a shame. Sexuality - as opposed to sex -- is not often dealt with at all, let alone successfully. I kept hoping for a hook to reality, an honest statement. Instead, the plot degenerated  into a convoluted hodgepodge which, while titillating (no pun intended), was never sufficiently explained or resolved.<br/><br/>I would have rated it lower than a 4, but for its ground breaking attempt as a serious treatment of sexuality. For a main stream film, it was bold. But again, self-consciously. For me, nothing rang true. As for nudity - frontal nudity, yes. Breasts, plenty of 'em. Sex, er, maybe. But men's privates are still apparently just that - private. And sex - weird and not at all erotic, and only filmed from strategic angles. There is still that familiar and conspicuous holding back, not just of nudity, but of the treatment of sexuality itself. Come on, we're supposed to be grown up. And this is supposed to be a film about a grown-up subject. Unfortunately, it came off more like an adolescent's wet dream."

We know that Kubrick didn't actually fool around, meet people, or stay tuned with the world. It shows.<br/><br/>The approach is very theatre-like. I actually lost my concentration thinking about how much of the dialogue is Schnitzler and how much isn't. Especially the slimy and sleazy Hungarian, who would very much have wanted to f**k Nicole Kidman, acted nothing like a turn-of-the-millennium-c**t-licking playboy would. Maybe Kubrick thought nothing has changed since the times of the original story.<br/><br/>Very sorry. I think Stanley Kubrick was one of the greatest. Eyes Wide Shut is beautifully shot (in Lightbulb Yellow and Nuit Americaine Blue), has a driving screenplay and a genuine no-hurry Kubrick feel, but I still think it's nowhere close to what it would have been, if the director could have worked on it for another five years."

","Stanley Kubrick is a brilliant director that has a unique style, a vision for details, and an eye for the obscure.  But I don't know where his artistic ability was for this film.  <br/><br/>Knowing this was Kubrick's final film, I salivated for a great movie.  But this movie definitely does not deliver the goods.  Nor does it deliver a climatic finale.<br/><br/>From the B-rated running of credits, and throughout the movie, I waited for the flavor that shocks the senses that Kubrick knows how to manipulate.  But that never happens.<br/><br/>This movie lives on the coattail sympathies that it was Stanley Kubrick's last movie.  That's the only redeeming quality of this film.  In a morbid way, it felt as though Kubrick died before filming the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Another irritating aspect of this movie was the soundtrack. The chanting at England's beautiful Highclere Castle was very long and annoying.  And I really would like to know if Kubrick had a cat pounce on a piano for his climatic scenes.  Seriously, I wouldn't put that passed him.<br/><br/>On the brighter side, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were very convincing in their roles.  The scene where Nicole is telling Tom about her fantasy, almost made me feel that Kubrick confiscated one of their home movies.  Sure, the half-naked Nicole is basically what makes this scene tolerable for some people -- but next time, I'll save the money, open my window wide, and watch my Springer-like neighbors go at it!<br/><br/>I give a 2 out of 10, just for the use of Christmas bulbs. <br/><br/>My apologies Stanley."

There the defining questions are always : How so? To What? To Whom? It is well known, among scholars, that Nietzsche said : ""I believe that I have guessed some secrets of the highest man's soul. Perhaps everyone who guesses them is destroyed."" (Trnsl., Thomas Mann; 1947.) Kubrick's so refined adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's Freudian/Nietzschean novel of fin-de-siècle decadence, at this climactic turn-of-the-century and outset of a new millennium, takes the form of his culminating masterpiece of cinematic art and sophistication. And is, in a word : Great !<br/><br/>His filmed tribute to and like celebration of all the deep-psychological Mystery in the human condition, reconstructs anew and actualizes those earliest discoveries which motivated very passionate collaborative exchanges between the psychiatrist and the novelist. Indeed we may well contend that our extremely talented director was once again ""ahead of his time"" with this last film and his own breathtaking exploration of the dream-like reality of the human Soul !<br/><br/>Such examples of the ""dangerous"" variety ARE perhaps that which is why ""we have Art"" at all; that is, ""to keep us from perishing from (mere) truth !

"drhickman","Null","1","2","22 April 2000"," Do acting, direction and pacing count for anything?
","This movie belongs to the genre whereby the director was incapable of making a profound statement and settled instead on obscurity in the hope that people would assign profundity in the absence of clarity.  Kubrick is a master at this sort of thing and has his devotees slobbering over obscure nuances such as visual hints and clues that most of us are not the slightest bit interested in.  They rave about his handling of lighting and slow, deliberate pacing.  Who knows from lighting?  If I want lighting I'll go to a fireworks show.  The ""deliberate"" pacing was so slow even the actors seemed to lose interest in what they were saying.  Kubrick may be a master and I may be an idiot, but if I'm going to spend 2 3/4 hours with a movie I at least want some acting, pacing and directing.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are perfectly capable of excellent acting, but in this charade the acting is dreadful and the lack of proper direction is inexcusable for a man of Kubrick's reputation.  I wish the ""professional"" reviewers would stop trying to explain the obscure, cease raving about directorial signatures, and take a closer look at the acting and story line.  For the hapless viewers out there who, like me, were sucked into this loser: never follow the recommendations of a reviewer who sees more than 2 movies a week. After that threshold and in their boredom, they start to look for things that simply aren't there."

The movie is not exquisite or amazing, as someone else here said. The slowness of the scenes is just irritating, and there's nothing charming about all the Christmas lights. So what?

"dsewell","Null","1","2","12 April 2000"," Almost laughable....
","I refer to the high rating this movie  has received as well as certain parts of  EWS itself. My wife and I looked at each other a couple of times while we chuckled at a scene, both with looks of ""Was this intended to be funny?"" Particularly the scenes with Cruise being attacked by a strange woman who says she is in love with him and then her fiance arrives and when he runs into the group of guys in the street who question his heterosexuality. I like Kubric films  for the most part. I think Kubric may have explored the subject he was looking at in EWS in a better fashion in his adaptation of Nabokov's ""Lolita."" The sexual relationships, the jealousies, the overall married and non-married relationships, all were done and done better in ""Lolita"" than in EWS. Kidman has shown she can act. Here, however, Kubric wastes her. How well do we actually get to know her character? Hardly at all. Kidman  is underused in this film, if anything. Of course, if she would have been in the film more and kept reciting her  lines as if she were having trouble reading them from a cue card from a long distance, more Kidman wouldn't have been a good thing. As for Cruise, why were we subjected to constantly watching him stride down a sidewalk with just a blank, dull face we were supposed to take for thought. A voiceover would not have worked, but the supposed brooding did not work either. And as for character development, why did Kubric even include the child in the film. What use was she? The way the NY apartment the family shared was laid out, Cruise and Kidman's characters essentially lived in a separate house than their daughter (and please don't tell me that's his symbolism for the eyes wide shuttness of providing a false happly family front, if that were the case, Kubric would have, or should have, delved into the contrasts of what is presented as family and what actually exists even more).<br/><br/>Is this motion picture stunning in its look? In some scenes yes, some might say in more ways than one. Is it stunning in its plot? No.... c'mon how easy is it really to find a secret orgy society by happenstance (and why don't they want Cruise to join?) ... or which also houses a young prostitute pimped by her father... The scene between Cruise and Pollack is wasted also, especially since Cruise is in no  real danger. That means all the buildup that he might be in danger (the young drug addict/orgy participant who warns him and later dies/his friend who suddenly leaves the hotel and town) was also wasted. At least in Kubrick's other films the danger, the suspense, the human nature and its tendencies were more fully recognized and developed. What we have here is a film that took too long to film because the director didn't know what he wanted and then died before he could correct it, thus losing the message (if there ever was one) along the way. I've read some comments here that this is a good ""art"" film. My question is did Kubric mean for it to be an ""art"" film or is that peoples' way of gracefully letting this film slide by....."

","There was a brilliant article in the magazine Brill's Content a few months after ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was released which explained what happened to the marketing of the film before it was released. What it boils down to is the fact that Kubrick only let one person see the film before it was released and that person worked for Time magazine and he saw it 72 hours before the film was scheduled to be released in July. But since film magazines and other avenues of the mainstream media have production cycles that have deadlines months in advance, before you knew it rumour was being compounded on top of rumour until it completely snowballed out of control. Obviously no member of the press actually went to the trouble to actually read the novel that Kubrick based the film on, they were more interested in repeating whatever rumour sounded like it would sell magazines. At one point I remember hearing that the film was about two psychoanalysts who are married to each other and each of them starts to have an affair with their respective patients and then they decide to swing with them. Whoa. Says a lot more about the person who thought up the rumour than it does about the film itself. Of course, Kubrick played it to the hilt by just refusing to comment and letting the rumours get out of control until you have lapdog rags plastering their cover with things like ""The sexiest film ever?"" Can you say ""Pavlov""?<br/><br/>The public really was conned into thinking that this film was going to have THE most erotically charged orgy ever filmed by what is considered one of the, if not THE, greatest director of all time. So you wonder why everyone said it bombed? Because they were swindled into thinking that it was supposed to be like the rumours and when it was finally released it was revealed to be just like any other Kubrick film: I.E. a sensitive and very analytical piece that is essentially an art house film that will be discussed for decades. No wonder Kubrick kept his mouth shut: he got his last film, an art house film with, as such, a very limited audience, into the minds of everyone passing a news stand and got them into the theatre thanks to their blind faith in the lies and rumours that the mainstream media publish before they realized that it was, sure, a movie about sex, but not an erotic movie at all. Kubrick made a film which analyzes the difference between sex and love (something the United States doesn't realize there's a difference between) and shows both sex and love in ways that are not erotic at all. Those who were disappointed by this film were those expecting a movie with sex in it to be erotic, which basically reveals just how shallow this culture is. It's actually the warmest film Kubrick ever made. If you can think about sex without getting aroused, you'll love this film. If you can't think about sex without getting aroused, perhaps you're better off with Russ Meyers films."

And that's saying something.<br/><br/>The preposterous [and lengthy] script is worse, however, with absurdist dialogue in abundance.

Mild, at the very best.<br/><br/>Sure Kidman is topless a few times, and there are a few glimpses of her [rather extraordinary] derriere.  But we've seen these goods before.  Nary a bum from Cruise for the ladies.  And the so-called orgy scene, complete with the famed digital shadowy cloaked men to hide the allegedly explicit parts, is a limp disaster.<br/><br/>And you thought that Verhoeven's lamentable ""Showgirls"" was the most unerotic movie ever made which tried to shock you with its nudity?  Or was that ""Romance""...<br/><br/>The only scene which I'll remember is the one in which Kidman confesses her almost~infidelity to Cruise, which sets this on its course.<br/><br/>Here's how bad this film is: all three interviews on the DVD version are tributes to Kubrick, not to this film.  Steven Spielberg even weighs in with a ""best actors"" list ~ Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, etc.  Ahhh... nary an actor among them.

"dfranzen70","3","1","2","11 March 2000"," Kubrick's final film uneven and, apparently, unfinished
","Many critics praised this film as the crowning achievement in Stanley Kubrick's long and illustrious career. Many critics are also full of deer feces. Seriously, I can't imagine people actually thinking this is an incredible movie - unless they're in awe of Kubrick, who brought to the world many magnificent films, including ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Barry Lyndon,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and ""Paths of Glory."" Kubrick is indeed an auteur, but here he missed the boat. The late director, who also served as screenwriter, gives us a 2.5-hour piece of slop, as we follow Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) through a series of curious, if not altogether interesting, experiences. First he and Mrs. Dr. Bill (Nicole Kidman) go to a lavish party where each is kinda tempted to cheat on the other, but doesn't. Then they discuss it later and typical marital understanding ensues. Yes, you can almost recite the lines before they happen in that scene, folks. Angry, Bill leaves his wife, runs into a cheap (and, apparently, kind-hearted, JUST the kind of prostitute that's on the streets today, one can easily imagine) hooker, goes to a jazz club, and finally goes to a masquerade-cum-orgy ball. <br/><br/>The first problem hits you right away. For a couple who are married in real life, Kidman and Cruise have zero chemistry in this film. They don't play off each other well at all, and even the mild sex scenes are real yawners. Beyond that is the script itself. One gets the impression that Kubrick had a much more developed movie in mind, but when he died the studio just released whatever was lying around. The script could have been so intriguing! The main problem with it is that is simply doesn't follow through on any premises. When a small storyline is introduced, it's just left after that brief introduction. And folks, when we're talking about a 159-minute movie, that's not easy to do. Which brings me to the last big problem of the movie. Every actor talks..... really...... slowly. Don't ask me why. And since Kubrick declined to use much in the way of background music (except for one annoyingly repetitive riff, meant to portend great ominence or something), the pauses between syllables are even more prolonged. <br/><br/>So what we're left with is overblown, overstated, pretentious piffle. It's almost as if the auteur took bits of every art-house smash he'd ever scene and thrown them into a Cuisinart. Problem is the product is a gooey concoction of superficial gunk."
"Artêmis","10","1","2","20 December 1999"," One of the best movies ever made. Masterpiece.
","I wouldn't say that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is perfect but it is at least 99,9% perfect. First of all, if you want to enjoy it, relax and try not to compare it to other Kubrick's movies because each one of them are completely different from others. I heard so many people saying that EWS was great but as it was from Kubrick, they're expecting more. I think it's unfair. Well, writing about EWS isn't easy because it deserves some reflection after watching. For me it's even harder as I'm not writing in my natural language but in English so, the only way I found to do this review was to comment each point of the movie particularly. <br/><br/>The director: Stanley Kubrick is great. In fact EWS was my first Stanley's movie and that's another reason for me to wait sometime before writing this review.  I wanted to rent other Kubrick's movie to see if he was really the genius that all the magazines and newspapers were saying. I rented ""A Clockwork Orange"" and he's in fact, one of the best directors of the cinema history. And if you look at his filmography you can see how amazing he is. Some dramas as EWS, a science fiction (2001 - A Space Odyssey), a suspense-horror (The Shining), a war movie... And most of them are known as their category's best. Kubrick knew how to make us pay attention in the movie, stay tuned every minute, enjoy each scene. The 3 hours of EWS passed so fast for me and I wanted more and more. Kubrick is really a genius.<br/><br/>The cast: the entire cast was great. Tom Cruise is for sure a good actor and Nicole Kidman finally used all her talent. Some people said that Nicole was not a good choice because she had always worked in bad movies but most of the actors and actresses don't start acting directly in good movies. There's always a first time. And Nicole is very excellent. One good surprise is the young Leelee Sobieski. Even appearing less than 3 minutes in the whole movie, she was amazing. She didn't need to say one word, looking at her face you knew what she was doing, thinking, that she was enjoying being used by her father... (Today, she had been nominated in the Golden Globes for her great performance in ""Joan of Arc"")<br/><br/>
The soundtrack: I can't imagine different songs in Eye Wide Shut. They've used the best. Who is able to forget the amazing ""Musica Ricercata"", that played during the end of the ""climax scene"", the orgy? And the romantic ""When I Fall In Love""? EWS's should win next year's Academy Awards (today, it had been nominated for the Golden Globes!). <br/><br/>The cinematography, art-direction, costume design and set decoration: great too! The clothes, sceneries, furniture, and the cinematography of EWS are just great. And they got even better mixed with the music. The best example is the famous orgy scene again: the music is tense and strong, the clothes (not very much, but there are) and masks are strange and mysterious, almost all the furniture, walls and clothes were yellow or black. Even the voices were strange! Perfect. The orgy scene will be forever in the cinema history. Polemical and provocative.<br/><br/>The screenplay: the complex screenplay is the movie and each person has a different view about what Kubrick wanted to say and about the symbolism that is in EWS. What Stanley really wanted to say? What were his intentions? There are many different opinions and I'm not sure if mine is the best. In fact, there isn't one best interpretation. What I know for sure is that EWS is a amazing movie, from the best director of the world and not watching it is a sin. FOR SURE.<br/><br/>And surely, 10/10"

The story was flawed, sophomoric and amateurish in comparison to the visionary ""2001"" and the suspense of ""The Shining"". It also seemed an attempt by Kubrick to emulate (a nice word for copy) Greenaway.<br/><br/>But the worst part was the acting! I just about retched during Mrs. Cruise's drunken party scene. It wasn't just ham acting it was the whole herd of pigs. The woman is the very definition of a bimbo! And how about Dr. Bill saving the OD'ing woman with the power of his squeaky, adolescent voice alone! Then the Marijuana scene...my god such naievety. I can believe that Tom and Nicole haven't done any drugs in their Scientology-dominated lives but someone on the set must have been able to say...""Uh, gee I've never seen stoned people behave that way before...what exactly is in that joint?"" Haven't they heard of method acting? OK, I'm no fan of either of them but these performances were simply too revolting. I can only say good things about some of the supporting cast in comparison. The costume shop owner Milich and the distraught daughter in love with Tom (Helena?) were the two most striking performances.<br/><br/>I could go on and on but won't. I am sorely disappointed and saddened that I saw this film and that it has tainted my otherwise great respect for a masterful film-maker.

Nice camerawork and lighting in places, too.<br/><br/>4) Good bits: the row in the apartment (contains the best writing in an otherwise unworthy script); the orgy (though only for its style, not for its content); the moment when Cruise finds the mask; er... that's it.<br/><br/>5) Why doesn't Sydney Pollack act more often? He's terrific!<br/><br/>6) I don't have a problem with sex in movies, but here it was gratuitous and actually rather sad. One can, unfortunately, easily imagine Kubrick doing the editing using only one hand.<br/><br/>7) The last line is predictable and stupid, and rather trivialises the whole thing.<br/><br/>In short, EWS can't make up its mind whether it's a Hitchcockian thriller or a psychological study of sexual relations within a couple. If SK had stuck to the latter, it would probably have been a very good film. Unfortunately, despite flashes of his previous brilliance, this one doesn't work, and it's sad that this is the note he went out on. Still, at least Cruise nearly manages to act."

Nothing in this movie is thrilling and nothing, except from two scenes, are even interesting. The plot is nonsense - you ask yourself, ""Why does anybody care? What is so 'scary' and 'secret'?

","This movie needed more editing.  I know they wanted to keep the film the way Kubrick made it, but it seems unlikely to me that he wasn't going to edit it anymore after other people actually saw it.  Some of the transitions between scenes are absolutely horrible, and there is a lot of wasted space, though that likely would've stayed in the film; Kubrick always liked to plod along.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my second criticism of this film.  At times I found it, well, boring, which seems strange, since it was billed as some kind of sex-fest; instead, there isn't that much sex in it, although in my opinion, that is probably a better thing.  I also thought the scenes with LeeLee Sobieski were quite irrelevant.  At most, they were amusing but added nothing to the story at all.<br/><br/>My fourth problem was those stupid added-in figures in the orgy scene.  It's not that I need to see what they're obscuring; the problem is that the figures were extremely distracting and really stood out. <br/><br/>
My fifth problem also relates to the orgy scene: why were most of the women so skinny? The piano player talks about how amazing the women are there, and then they turn out to be a bunch of sticks.  I'm sorry, but if I can see all the bones in someone's back, even those in the lower back, bulging out, that person is too thin.  And people wonder why women sometimes feel so much pressure to lose weight.  In the case of the thighless woman who warns Cruise, I suppose it makes some amount of sense, because she's supposed to be a drug addict.  The only thing I can figure out, other than perhaps the casting director having some serious issues relating to body image in other people, is that the sometimes twisted attendants at the orgy prefer for some reason women who are highly abnormal.<br/><br/>My last problem was the sometimes gratuitous use of the word f*ck.  I realise that many people use that word frequently. My problem with it is that, at least among people I know, when you're talking about sex with your (potential) life partner, you don't usually use such a crude word to describe having sex with that person.  Yet it is used frequently in this movie in that context.  ""F*ck"" is a word that fits very well to Kidman's fantasy about the naval guy, but not to her having sex with Cruise.  I suppose this is just my opinion, but I did have a problem with that, although it didn't affect my view of this film much.<br/><br/>What I DID like about this film was that the basic idea of the film should provoke discussion among couples.  In perhaps a strange phenomenon, Person A knows that he or she is attracted to people other than Person B, and may even have been seriously tempted to act on such feelings, but it doesn't occur to him or her that Person B is in exactly the same situation.  And sometimes it bothers Person A immensely, just like in this film.  I suppose this is because we all know what goes on in our own heads, but we have to guess at what goes on in other people's; we don't know just HOW tempted they were, or if they acted on the impulse and just aren't admitting it.  It seems to me that this is a subject matter that every couple needs to discuss, rather than assuming something and living in a fantasy world, until it all comes crashing down when the illusion is shattered (like in the film- all that stiff about women being ""different"" than men).<br/><br/>Warning: slight spoiler ahead.  Some people, including those I saw this movie with, seem to have missed the point of the HIV+ hooker.  My take on that was to show just what Cruise could have lost by acting on his jealous, untrusting, and perhaps vengeful impulses.  Instead, he got lucky- not in the way one usually would with a hooker, but because his wife called him on his cell right before he did the deed.  Would he have gone through with it had she not called? I would not have been sure he would, except that the next evening, he was already to get it on with hooker number 2, until she informed him of Domino's bad news.  This to me is another good point of discussion: should such things count as infidelity, when a person did not commit the deed but would have if he had not been interrupted (in the first case)? And in the case of Kidman's fantasy with the naval guy: should her insistence that, had the evening gone by a little differently, she would have had sex with him, be taken as an act of infidelity on her part,or should she be given the benefit of the doubt that she wouldn't have been able to go through with it? I think it is important for both parties in a relationship to know where the line gets drawn.<br/><br/>I also thought that acting was, for the most part, good.  I did not find Kidman's laughing fit remotely unbelievably; it was perfectly consisted with my experience, however limited, with pot smokers. <br/><br/>So basically, I thought this movie could have been substantially better (especially considering the number of retakes Kubrick insisted on), but it is still worth watching because it is thought provoking; it makes a person ponder both his or her own boundaries as well as those of his or her partner."

","I've seen ""Eyes Wide Shut"" this afternoon and I thought it was incredible. OK, it is quite slow, but it is good to forget its failures and enjoy the qualities. Stanley Kubrick proves that he was one of the greatest directors of all the times, and he still is in the memory of his fans. Everything in the film is on its place, so let's start with the cast.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman has a terrific performance and deserves an Oscar nomination, or even win. She surprised me, because she has already done many bad films (""Practical Magic"", ""Batman Forever"", etc). Here she plays Alice Harford, the wife who has almost betrayed her husband. He is Tom Cruise, another one who surprised me for the same reason. He plays Dr. Bill Harford, the 'almost betrayed' husband ready to face some sexual adventures. The supporting actors and actresses were also great. Kubrick really cares about all the characters. We can see this in Sidney Pollack's acting, but there are others: the strange owner of 'Rainbow Fashions' and his daughter, the pianist Nick Nightingale, the hotel desk clerk, the people in the orgy.<br/><br/>The scenes are just wonderful. The orgy... Oh, the orgy! Perfect, perfect, perfect! Only Kubrick could imagine those disturbing and at the same time fascinating scenes.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also perfect. The music can tell you a story...<br/><br/>We can't say ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a drama, or a romance, or a mystery film. It is a film about many things: love, wedding, betrayal, sex, revenge, redemption, etc.<br/><br/>If you're looking for sex, really strong sexuality, you'll be disappointed. The sex and the nudity in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" are not on the screen all the time. Oh, right! It is also about sex, but Kubrick doesn't abuse of the sexuality.<br/><br/>The art-set direction, the screenplay, the dialogues... Everything wonderful!<br/><br/>So if you're looking for a real good film; not only to spend the time, but to think, this is the one. I think it'll be nominated in the main categories in the next Academy Awards. At least it really deserves.<br/><br/>A warn: it is a very complex film, so pay attention in everything."

","I love 2001.  I love Full Metal Jacket.  I like A Clockwork Orange (for the most part).  Here's what I don't love or like:  Eyes Wide Shut.  What a stinker.  Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't completely awful or shoddily put together.  It was just far too long, and ultimately misguided.  What starts out as a semi-surreal exploration of sex, the subconscious, and the merging of these things degenerates (after the infamous orgy scene) into a dull, plodding, unsuspenseful thriller that peters out rather than builidng tension.  The final explanatory scene with Sidney Pollack deflates what little mystery there might be left.  It is a dreadfully generic way for such a pioneer as Kubrick to end what started out as a promising film.  Tom Cruise is decent in the lead role, but unfortunately, Nicole Kidman is wooden.  At least when she has her clothes on and is talking.  Kubrick's visual style is as breathtaking as ever, especially during the costuemed orgy and whenever he lovingly frames Kidman's perfect body, but the script is bad, and some points downright laughable.  Too bad this is the last taste of Kubrick we'll ever have."
"a-rod","2","1","2","15 August 1999"," High ambitions, poor execution
","Have all the critics shut their eyes? Sure, Kubrick had high ambitions for Eyes Wide Shut, and he certainly raised some interesting questions about relationships and secret thoughts and fantasies.<br/><br/>But please. Eyes Wide Shut is horribly miscast. Tom Cruise might be able to play a doctor in M*A*S*H, but he comes across with no credibility in this movie. His acting is shallow, his believability nil.<br/><br/>Sydney Pollack, as the mysterious, wealthy Ziegler, in the end, fuels paranoia about the great Zionist conspiracy (rich, powerful people who shall remain nameless, indeed). He may be credible as a businessman, but not as a member of the power elite; he looks and acts too much like one's Uncle Saul. Kubrick originally intended to cast Harvey Keitel, and it's a shame that Keitel didn't make it. Keitel would have had brought the ominous underlying tension needed for the role.<br/><br/>Then there's the sexism. Now, I enjoyed Nicole Kidman immensely. I'd like to take her home with me, and she actually was one of the better actors. But how Kubrick could film a movie rife with female frontal nudity and not show even one little johnson is inexcusable in this day and age. We don't even get to see where the sun doesn't shine on Tom Cruise. This inequity merely contributes to the movie's out-of-whackness.<br/><br/>I could go one about the contrived situations and the ham-fisted acting.<br/><br/>If you really want to see a movie that raises many of the same questions, head over to the video store for Apocolypse Now, which chronicles a similar kind of personal voyage, with better acting, less obvious atmosphere, and a Marlon Brando who, although also miscast, is somehow less irritating."
"cowtow","2","1","2","11 August 1999"," eyes (& ears & mind) apparently shut ... while making this movie
","Two words: Pretentious Drudgery.  And Nicole Kidman still can't act ... To Die For was a fluke.  Two recent movies that dealt well with the concept of what you don't know about your lover's insides are Happiness and Your Friends and Neighbors.  I recommend them both.  This one was an utter bore, and I swear I tried really hard!<br/><br/>What was Kubrick thinking?  A 2001 pacing to a 1960's exploration of infidelity and no f*cking boundaries.  With a little 1990's window dressing culture?  This movie was way way way bloated with cliched dialogue, actors hammering out every banal word, zero charisma, and poor characterizations.<br/><br/>How much more meaningful it would have been with a normal relaxed human pacing, off-hand unself-conscious line delivery, not so heavy-handed confusion of one ""whore"" with another and a truly meaningfully vested characterization of the wife role.<br/><br/>How about a (younger) Annette Bening in the role (?Renee Zellweger)? Give the wife some warmth, a quality of having deep and easy capacity to love and be loved, a genuine emotional involvement as a mother .... instead of a detached neuraesthenic shell.  How interesting it then would have been to see her inability to repress her involuntary fantasies of passionate devastation.  Then we could understand the husband's struggle with her ""dreams.""  Instead we are left to fail making any distinction between an empty wife/mother/lover and the ""whores"" in the night.  Where is the tension?  Where is the struggle for when this man has only half a human soul?  There was no story ... if Cruise's character had any depth to him, as soon as he recovered from the parallax of pot and saw her for what she was, he would have filed for divorce immediately.   EWS misses the point!  How can we be troubled by the lust that threatens substance when there IS NO SUBSTANCE?! All in all, Eyes Wide (Robbed) Blind was an abominable bore, a self-involved little piece of mock manhood obsessed over to the point of cloying involution, an insult to my intelligence, a waste of my time (and I want my money back!)  Stanley Kubrick, a masterful filmmaker, has unfortunately been reduced to a two year-old fascinated with watching his ""duty"" circle the bowl.  How embarrassing that his last airs ... came out the wrong end!"
"ween-3","5","1","2","7 August 1999"," You just know that Stanley didn't want to go out on THIS note
","As a dyed-in-the-wool Kubrick fan, I'm aware that the closest Kubrick ever came to depicting sex was the docking sequence in ""2001"" but I bought into the hype and figured that if Stanley was going S&M and Tom and Nicole were along for the ride this was going to be AN EVENT. What I got instead was 45 minutes of Kabuki theatre accompanied by Gregorian chants and a piano that was missing 87 keys, and another 2 1/2 hours of Stan's Greatest Hits. There were pieces of ""Clockwork"", ""2001"" and ""Full Metal"" sprinkled liberally throughout the proceedings in the form of camerawork and pacing. Probably nothing wrong with this movie that a good hedge trimmer couldn't cure. This puppy D--R--A--G--S! Unfortunately, some impressive acting by Nicole Kidman and a great little bit by Alan Cumming gets lost in this ponderous opus. A miscast Cruise and a script that ostensibly is about obsession, dreams and reality never gets the viewer to a clearer understanding of how they are connected. One can sift through some of the more obvious nonsense and sort of see where Kubrick wanted to go, but, like riding the Long Island Railroad, it's just a long, hard way to get there. Considering the body of work that Kubrick left behind, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" has to rank as a disappointment. We've lost one of the great American originals, a truly visionary director, and it's seems a shame that his swan song should be one of his lesser efforts."
"DukeEman","9","1","2","16 August 1999"," Welcome to upper-middle class angst with Bill and Alice.
","That clever cheeky bugger Mr. Kubrick knew what he was doing when casting top line stars Tom and Nicole in his final masterpiece. He was aiming for a wide audience, specifically hetero couples and that he achieved. With the presence of the stars this movie will reach its audience in suburbia. That's were I saw it and the cinema was full of couples. At the end of the movie you could hear a pin drop as we all filed out with our heads hanging down in either astonishment or outrage paranoia. I viewed this movie with my wife and never have we discussed a movie so deeply afterwards. But the discussion went beyond the movie as we dwelled into our own relationship. Were do you draw the line between sexual fantasy and realism? Do men go beyond the point of sexual fulfilment? Or are men just a natural hunter in search of a prey that normally is its own self? Dr. Bill, (Tom), goes on a primitive hunt to satisfy his urge of curiosity after his wife Alice tells him of a sexual fantasy she had about a sailor. While hers was a fantasy, (or was it?), his will be reality, (or is it?), for revenge purposes. Instead Dr. Bill is lead on a crusade that takes him on a journey beyond his outer-comfort-limits. He enters a sexual world that only man can wish for and only receive in dreams. Kubrick succeeds in challenging the Hetero world with questions that need to be looked into deeply. As with all Kubrick films the images range from straight narrative to the surreal when it is necessary. This is mostly Dr. Bill's perspective that left him with eyes wide shut during the orgy sequence. Tom's performance as Dr. Bill was one of his finest. At first he seems out of his depth but you soon realise that his performance is based on the social appearance of pretence that is soon replaced by the personal and strong performance when he discovers Alice's fantasy and is swept away in the journey. Nicole is brilliant in a small but important role. In the end I had to laugh at Kubrick's brilliance. Maybe I misread it but the movie was left open for any interpretation. As far as I'm concern, a movie is the patient and the audience the Therapist."

It doesn't work, however, because the Marilyn Monroe character has been rewritten into four different supporting characters!<br/><br/>But seriously folks, the film does include many of the same themes explored in TSYI. But that is where the similarity ends. Kubrick was without peer. His final masterpiece is a film of extraordinary depth, complexity, and emotional intensity. But alas, in will no doubt be inaccessible to most. As with any work of art, however, an open mind will greatly assist the filmgoer in achieving a true appreciation for EWS.

","The day before we saw Eyes Wide Shut, my sister-in-law, who is 19 and not dating anyone, told me how disappointed with it she was. After seeing it for myself, I wasn't surprised. People who are in long-standing sexual relationships are going to be the ones who appreciate Kubrick's mature, honest approach to the possible dark side of every relationship. Relationships can sometimes seem like a tightrope walk between loving someone and hurting them. It doesn't take much to move from one to the other.<br/><br/>One of the details that I appreciated about Eyes Wide Shut is the way in which it allowed the main characters to be wealthy and still arguably normal. Wealthy people in films are too often portrayed as either spoiled and bratty or psycho and drunks. The activities that Tom Cruise's character ends up involved in are pretty out there, but the way in which he became involved and his and Nicole Kidman's reactions all seem normal and healthy."

","This movie is turgid, boring, pompous and outdated.  The film's sensibility is a cross between between Victorian moralizing and '70s-era Freudianism and sexuality.  The former is a little simpleminded (not all non-marital sex is ""illicit,"" and not all women are teases, prostitutes, or coffee-fetching secretaries), and the latter is obvious and silly.  Nicole saying ""f**k"" a lot is about as raw and shocking in 1999 as re-reading Erica Jong.  The dialogue is frequently laughable (eg, ""take off your clothes!"" ""Take off my clothes?""  ""Yes, get undressed!""), the score is like a little drill going into one's forehead, and the big dramatic moments are just plain hoaky (omigosh, THE MASK IS ON THE BED!!!).  And talking really slowly, as the entire cast does at all times, does automatically make for great acting. Admittedly, there are some nicely composed shots and lovely lighting.  And Sidney Lumet gave an OK performance.  But I failed to see what this movie had to tell us in the 1990s, let alone what made it even remotely engaging. I am baffled by all the fawning reviews, both in the papers and by IMDb users.  <br/><br/>Folks, it's okay not to like a film by Kubrick, even though he's dead.  He's rightly viewed as god-like for Lolita, Dr Strangelove, etc, but that didn't give him license to make a grindingly boring, moralizing, unkempt movie like Eyes Wide Shut.  I appear to be in the minority on this, so I hope someone can convince me I'm wrong."

Tom Cruise fails again to offer any evidence of major-league acting talent to back up his pay packet and Nicole Kidman was a huge disappointment after To Die For and Dead Calm, almost sleepwalking her way through the very overlong film. The plot can charitably described as slimline and the weighty themes and important points hit the screen with an almost audible clang - possibly trying to complete with the plinking minimalist piano soundtrack. There were some good scenes and nicely played moments and an effectively captured sense of naturalism though lack of background score and flat/static single camera setups, but these were lost in the landslide of disappointment.

","Eyes Wide Shut By Dean Kish<br/><br/>When you sit down to venture into the world captivated in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" you have to look deep within yourself and see the vision. Director Stanley Kubrick's last great masterpiece is just that a masterpiece. The common thread in Kubrick is the imagery of ""an unknown force taking away the control of an average man's life and slowly driving him insane until he learns a life lesson from it."" This thread has been in other Kubrick classics such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""A Clockwork Orange"". And it is so evident in ""Eyes Wide Shut"". The film's stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman pour their lives out as they portray a couple grasping to hold together after some tightly kept secrets are let out of the bag. Cruise and Kidman begin to doubt each other's fidelity and honor to one and other. But what keeps this film together has to be the haunting three key score that accents to a lot of the actor's movements and at times heavily accents their haunted lives. Some of images portrayed in this film are so far out of left field it looks as if Kubrick has a lesson to give even in death. To summarize the film's originality, I can only state two words, ""Subtly Intense"". So go out and see Kubrick's final lesson and don't forget to kiss your wife when it's over.

I was lucky enough to see this film during a early screening so i did not have to pay the seven dollars it would normally cost to see a movie. I would not even pay the couple dollars it would cost to rent Eyes Wide Shut.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is being billed as a steamy love story between Kidman and Cruise and as Kubrick's last masterpiece. It is neither. Yea there are some romantic encounters between Cruise and Kidman but they are done in the first twenty minutes of the movie. True this is the late Kubrick's last film, but it falls well short of a masterpiece. <br/><br/>The last two plus hours of Eyes Wide Shut shows Kidman and Cruise crying to each other. There are reasons to become a little upset but there is nothing in the film that should cause such crying fits as Cruise and Kidman display.<br/><br/>There are more deadspots in this movie than in all the documentaries made in 1999. Many of the shots in the movie have no bearing on the plot and could be shortened and/or cut out completely.

","Very simplistically stated, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" resembles ""The Shining"" and ""2001"", Kubrick's two most popular and profitable movies.  (There's even a visual reference in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" to the neo-Classical bedroom where Dave Bowman ends up in ""2001"".)  But whereas Kubrick got away with making what has been described as ""the most expensive experimental film ever made"" with ""2001"", I'm not sure what this final film is going to do to his reputation. The picture works as a protracted nightmare (poor Nichole Kidman has to ponderously, slurringly, deliver most of her lines since in her two big scenes her character is either drunk on champagne or stoned on pot), but being promoted as a mainstream entertainment, I expect most audiences to get up and walk out.  (These aren't the times of Stravinsky's ""The Rites of Spring"", so they won't riot, they'll just leave.)  In the final analysis, I see in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" the same complete contempt for his audience which Kubrick exhibited in ""The Shining"".  This is where he has been heading his entire career.

Hey, 2001, Dr. Strangelove, Clockwork Orange were all classics--but this is just a bad, poorly scripted, (mostly) poorly acted waste. I've seen it twice (out of necessity), and it just gets worse.

It's mostly shapeless, especially when Cruise seems to revisit every earlier scene in the movie to little effect; the movie is awash in a softcore art-movie cliched view of nudity; the ritualistic sex is mostly ludicrous and the climax...well, it s not much of a payoff. It s not that I can t see the things people cite as proof of the film s greatness - it s just hard to value them that highly. Certainly, there s an occasionally hypnotic ritualistic air, a feeling of heightened unreality in which the boundary between dreams and reality is untrustworthy - the movie periodically quivers under its severe vision of the weakness of the flesh; the privileged lushness of the settings heightens the fragility and shock of subversion. These undercurrents are interesting, but not enough to make the thing predominantly enjoyable. It's an old man's film; out of touch with the raw material of life (and perhaps even of dreams)."
"elcopy","6","1","2","19 July 1999"," Kubrick seemed ready to pass the torch to new geniuses.
","Great storytelling. Poor casting judgment. That's how you can resume Kubrick's last masterpiece.<br/><br/>Unlike film directors from the school of Lucas, Kubrick treats his audience as intelligent human beings. This is actually a filmmaker who wants you to think when watching his film and not just sit there like an idiot, killing time in a dark room for a couple of hours. He doesn't tell you everything that's going on in the story so you have to figure it out for yourself. Besides, the story is carried from the point of view of one person, and that person has to figure out things just like us.<br/><br/>There are some flaws in the movie that stand out too much to be ignored.<br/><br/>Especially in the casting. Tom Cruise, a mediocre actor who happens to work with wonderful people, is never believable as his character. Neither's Nicole Kidman by the way. A street hooker that looks like a model from Vogue Magazine disconnects you from a sense of reality, as well as the minorityless New York Streets. Fortunately this movie will survive the test of time and hopefully in the future the presence of Cruise won't be so distracting from the whole thing.<br/><br/>The story, which is more teasing than sexual, and basically about a confused guy who ends up crashing into a party he wasn't invited. Some supposedly graphic scenes, that must be in the movie to deliver the story, are ruined with computer imaginery. Yet, none of these are enough reasons to discard this movie. A must see, even when is just short of satisfying."

What we got, was not too far removed from that.  I think this movie ran way too long. Not sure what the point was of having a child in the picture, except to demo how Tom has almost zero relationship with her.  Tom, as a doctor, kinda had a false ring to it . . . Some of the mood and imagery was interesting, and kinda ""artsy,"" however, it did not seem to fully develop.  To paraphrase Garcia, ""What a long, strange   trip"" this was.  Did I enjoy it?

"Pesto-5","10","1","2","17 July 1999"," Kubrick's Final Masterpeice is Flawless
","Stanley Kubrick's final film, EYES WIDE SHUT, is a breathtaking story of a marriage plagued by jealousy and a husband seeking revenge.  Tom Cruise shines in his brillant potrayal of Dr. Bil Harford as he searches for answers in a haze of sexual confusion.  Nicole Kidman plays his wife in heartbreaking scenes where she tells Cruise of her fantasies of another man. Some scenes will haunt you, such as the well-publicized orgy scene.  Every moment is flawless.  The acting is fabulous, the scenes are eerie, and you find yourself delving whole-heartedly into the escapades of Harford. EYES WIDE SHUT is characteristically Kubrick, and his final movie is just as good, if not better, than its predecessors."

"Polgara-2","9","1","2","18 July 1999"," A sincere look at the human psyche as it struggles with marriage, lust and jealousy
","Stanley Kubrick creates a moving, intelligent, mature piece of cinematic work.  Some may criticize this film for the length.  I would challenge with which scene would you delete?  Every scene is essential.  I was not able to see the final cut (65 seconds longer than the released version) Kubrick turned in but as soon as it is made available, I am there.  Some may criticize this film for the amount of nudity.  I would challenge that it is not the amount you should be concerned with but instead the way in which it was used.  Kubrick takes the act of sex and the nude form and raises them to a level of beauty, art and to some degree, realism.  This film is just that, a film.  It is not a blockbuster movie that relies on quick cuts and disorienting camera work.  Kubrick allows you to see, even though the American movie rating system does not, what happens to a man who becomes so jealous with the thought that his wife would give up everything to be with another man.  You feel this film. <br/><br/>The acting is top notch.  Tom and Nicole are pure and refreshing.  The scene where Nicole first reveals herself to him is one of the best scenes I have ever witnessed.  It is not just the acting, it's the way in which the scene is shot.  Watch this scene and watch how movement is used to display the emotion.<br/><br/>I have watched this once and I would watch it again and again.  I find that the more I think about it, the more I love it.  That is the true test of a great film.  It sticks with you.<br/><br/>I feel sorry for those who don't get this movie and I say to them come back to it in a couple of years and maybe then you will appreciate it for what it is - a sincere look at the human psyche as it struggles with marriage, lust and jealousy."

","Ive just watch Eyes Wide Shut. I had no great expectations, because I expected the movie to be boring. So I was pleasantly surprised by how good it appeared to be. The party with the people wearing masks and banging in every room was really creepy and scary. But no questions was ever really answered. It seemed quite clear to me that Cruises friend lied to him about what happened to Nick, the pianist and Cruise just accepted the answer. And how did Cruises mask end up in his bed next to his wife??I cant accept that there wasnt anything more going on. That the whole party was staged. And why wasnt Cruise furious with his wife when she admitted wanting to sleep with another man? Why didnt he get back at her by sleeping with other women? This movie could have been so much more but instead it was just everyday life with a few strange things going on. And the ending was ridicoulus. It ruined the whole film. Al of a sudden it was just over and I felt like Ive been cheated. I hope Kubrick is turning in his grave over how bad his last film was. Movies like The Shining and Full Metal Jacket was great but this is a big mess with alot of unanswered questions."
"Aidan McGuinness","Null","1","2","13 March 2002"," Sumptuous, gorgeous but lacking substance
","I approached this movie with some trepidation - on the one hand it had been slated in reviews by critics. On the other hand... it's Stanley Kubrick. You know the director with 6 of his movies in the Top 250, and the director at #12 in the overall best ranking (and even higher if you discount tv media, which is also included on the list).<br/><br/>Is it any good? That's a difficult question. The principal problem is that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" lacks substance, i.e. a plot. The premise is that Tom Cruise's character, William Harford, goes through a rough patch of exploring himself, and his notions of sexuality, after his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), admits to having a vivid fantasy involving a man she saw at a hotel once. On his way he gets wrapped up in the events of a mysterious group who conduct, among other things, masked orgies. The trouble with a lack of plot is that the film tends to meander along, not seeming to go anywhere. Yes, it's obviously exploring some concepts as it goes along, but the way William cruise's (ho ho) along makes you ask yourself, ""What's the point of this?"" You're left with little to grasp, except lingering notions.<br/><br/>How's the acting? Cruise puts in one of his better performances here, and you do get the idea he is genuinely haunted by the image of his wife Alice's erotic fantasies. Kidman is under-used, although it's nice to see her beauty contrasted with typically mundane acts such as going to the toilet. However the chemistry between the two is quite cold and their scenes together lack passion and vibrancy. It's made forgivable due to the film's premise, but there is still a certain something vital missing that undermines their relationship (ironic considering they were married at the time of filming).<br/><br/>So what's good about it? It looks great, which is absolutely no surprise. The costumes, the set-pieces are all excellent. There's a nice subdued atmosphere to the movie - the orgy scene, for example, is viewed somewhat afar, never scrutinised too closely, as Cruise wanders around exploring the house and, in turn, himself. There's nice uses of wide camera lens to take in as much of a view as possible and the music that accompanies sceneries works effectively. Lightning, camera-work, all done to the standards we expect. Even though the film clocks in at an above average 159 minutes, the editing is done in such a manner that the journey never feels jarred, or distorted. The finale is quite abrupt but, at the same time, drives home the point of the movie.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a hard movie to judge. It lacks a certain something. It does have some interesting concepts on the other hand, that a marriage, or love, doesn't mean you have to committed body & soul to someone 100% of the time, and that it shouldn't fail over the smallest slip into infidelity. It looks rich, but is let down a little by a passionless marriage. A hard one to call so I'll pencil it at a 7.2/10."
"nicenin","Null","1","2","7 February 2002"," This movie needed David Lynch *Possible Spoilers*
","This is Stanley Kubrick attempting - and failing - to do a David Lynch. Supposedly an escapade into the sexual compartment of the male psyche, this is a movie that is surprisingly ordinary given the talent involved, and is entirely devoid of either surrealism or eroticism.  Scene after scene potentially offers so much in the way of how our brains trick us, and how the imagination can blur the distinction between reality and dreams, but the whole thing is played so much for straight that the whole episode is DOA.<br/><br/>There's really not much to be said about the plot; on paper the premise seems disturbing and erotic in equal amounts, Tom Cruise explores New York's seedy underbelly in a fit of sexual jealousy, et al - but the execution is so flimsy, superficial and adolescent that you'll end up shaking your head in disbelief.<br/><br/>A supposed orgy scene is hopelessly dated and reminiscent of Ken Russell on a bad day.  Nudity is frequently unnecessary in movies, and this one is no exception - Nicole gets her kit off from time to time, completely pointlessly may I add as all scenes are of her dressing and undressing or in the bathroom on her own.  Tom needless to say does not repay the compliment to the ladies and the film suffers badly as a result - not from a mutually gratuitous point of view but he never once indulges in any of the temptations put in front of him once he's out on the town.  (It's the same cheap plot trick that Michael Douglas played on us in 'Falling Down' - we're supposed to believe that this guy is on the edge of insanity and will do anything crazy but - because of star power - he always refrains every time).<br/><br/>The supposed plot twist at the end is like an X-Files cast-off.<br/><br/>It is curious that two more recent releases, ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""AI"", have been described as Kubrickian in nature (the latter having had his involvement).  It's ironic that both of these truly magnificent pictures (whichever is your favourite) would be compared in anyway to the heap of sterile junk that was Kubrick's swansong.<br/><br/>To experience Tom Cruise at his sexual celluloid pinnacle, go see the incredible ""Vanilla Sky"".  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the cinematic equivalent of repeated and failed attempts at copulation followed by inevitable slumber."

It just means the director has no qualms about ejaculating whatever crap he wants to onto the screen.  The long drawn out pauses and sparse/piercing soundtrack might work in films like Shining and 2001 but they become distracting, even comical in EYES WIDE SHUT. One cannot rely on the same tired tricks to propel one's self through an entire career.  This film needs to be judged on its own and not in relation to Kubrick's canon. It makes me sick to hear critics revere this work simply because it came from a man who has done well in the past. This film was not cryptic not mysterious not thought provoking and not even sexy.

"hippiedj","4","1","2","18 May 2001"," Arthouse T & A
","Think about this: if you didn't know this was directed by Stanley Kubrick or told someone else directed it, would you have liked it?  I've seen too many cases of kiss-butt for this film than any other in recent history.  Sort of like the folks who say they like Shakespeare just to be considered smart and full of culture.  <br/><br/>You can argue the film is a deep study of ""human covenants,"" relationships, trust, vulnerability....but take away many of the gratuitous nude shots and the stars ""CRUISE     KIDMAN      KUBRICK"" (jeez, I expected a little ""tm"" trademark next to each name), and you will see there's not much left.  Just like some positive reviews of the film Striptease claim that film was a ""clever comment"" blah blah were unfounded, considering if you put lesser known stars in that one you'd have a late-night T & A flick like the ones shown weekends after midnight on the USA cable network.<br/><br/>I knew Eyes Wide Shut was going to be a bit one-sided on the nudity element once I saw that the very first shot was Nicole Kidman dropping her dress. There seemed to be several scenes like this where she is posed naked, getting undressed, putting on a bra, standing in front of a mirror, etc. and they have nothing whatsoever to do with the story.  Interesting how we never saw multiple scenes of Cruise doing the same kind of thing, naked and pulling underwear on or off--guess the heterosexual males in the audience would complain about that.<br/><br/>More chances to see Kidman naked are in Cruise's ""tormented"" visions of her and another man (which seem to pop up in the story whenever a certain amount of time has passed in which no breasts are seen, kind of convenient), and these ""visions"" fail to come across as tormenting because they are too forced and bathed in blue hue, giving them a feel of something out of a direct-to-video ""erotic thriller"" with Shannon Tweed and Andrew Stevens.<br/><br/>All these problems are made even more messy by the weak material Kidman had to work with when she was given the task of having to laugh in her sleep, then deliver a dialogue about her dream.  Even her argument with Cruise about him flirting at the party seemed a confusing one considering the excuse to not sleep with the man she was dancing with was ""I'm married..."" (and she never admitted she had the opportunity) an excuse she wouldn't accept from her husband when he said that's why he didn't have sex with two models.  <br/><br/>The mysterious gathering at the mansion?  Seemed like a lot of hooplah just for guys to get to have sex with hookers.  Okay, if that's what was happening.  I admit to attending some interesting ""events"" in my life and sex was never made THAT symbolic--I found the Howard Stern mentality rather annoying that the women at the mansion looked like they were made from the same mold, were eager to paw and touch each other and were all accessibly naked while (and I assume the cloaked figures WERE men) 98% of the guys were covered head to toe.  Many people don't realize that for the U.S. release many scenes of copulation were blocked by digital images of people!<br/><br/>I was very suspicious of the intended audience as well by the fact that if women in the film are willing to participate in sex with each other and do this naturally, why then was the one male gay character (the hotel desk clerk) portrayed as a total prissy stereotype?  I can't believe we've come this far to keeping gay male characters at a Jerry Springer-show level. Again, this is another way to make the straight men watching the film feel secure.  Hey folks, I have no problem with nudity and sexual oriented films, but when the a parade of breasts is really not connected with the story, I get the feeling of a sham going on.<br/><br/>This could have turned out differently...but after all the talk and secrecy during its filming and the unbelievable length of time it took to make it, Eyes Wide Shut was a hyped event.  Its importance as a film is extremely overrated, just because Kubrick is connected with it doesn't mean it's such relevant filmmaking.  I remember hearing how Last Tango In Paris was considered to be such an important film and I just sat there thinking Bertolucci was joking when he made that!  Jean-Luc Godard did much the same thing:  get naked women to spout philosophical lines and for some reason you have high art.<br/><br/>Check some of the interesting foreign/art films I've reviewed, and you'll see I'm not damning ""art"" cinema at all. But I know a basic nudie film guised as legitimate cinema, and Eyes Wide Shut was only a glossy example of just that."

There are subplots that have nothing to do with anything in the story. The costume store story has no purpose. Cruise goes to rent a costume from a costume store, the owner of the store sees his underaged daughter having sex with two older men so he traps them in the store and continues doing business, threatening to call the cops. When Cruise returns the next day he sees the Johns leaving the store, thanking the owner, who tells Cruise that they worked it out financially before offering his (still underage) daughter's services to Cruise.<br/><br/>The music is beyond irritating - a single piano note being hit over and over.<br/><br/>So this is a 3 star film.

Plus, I'm always being told how he was a stickler for details and would shot entire scenes if something went wrong, but I CONSTANTLY find shadowing and crew reflections in his ""masterpieces.

He, Hitchcock, Welles, Murnau and Dreyer are the greatest visual masters of all time. <br/><br/>But what was Kubrick thinking of when he made this piece of rubbish?!!... How could he say this was his ""greatest work ever""? What happened to the man who made beautiful masterly films like ""The Killing"" ""Paths of Glory"", ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Barry Lyndon and ""The Shining""? He must have been going senile when he made this pretentious piece of crap and called it his ultimate masterpiece! <br/><br/>Was it necessary to make a two-and-a-half hour movie to tell a dull story that could be compressed in ninety minutes or even less? What a waste of celluloid!<br/><br/>And couldn't he have possibly found a better leading actor?!! Dear god, Cruise is a dull moron who can't act at all but flashes his smile and touches his hair every minute and looks this way and the other while he says ""you know, hum, yeah, honestly baby"" all the time. A total bimbo-boy. <br/><br/>A totally much overrated movie that if it had been made in a low budget by a second-rate director it would have been slashed both by the critics and the public. And the director, crucified. It's a total shame that Kubrick's brilliant career had to end up in such a worthless way."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","2","8","17 June 2011"," Kubrick's swansong his most underrated?
","In my opinion, I think it is. Not his best mind you, I personally would put 2001, Clockwork Orange, Dr Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket and Barry Lyndon over Eyes Wide Shut, but while I haven't seen it in quite some time and have been meaning to revisit it I remember not being particularly impressed with Fear and Desire.<br/><br/>I like and respect Kubrick a lot. He is a great and influential director who is of great interest to me, and his skill for directing is in full evidence here. I can understand why people mayn't like Eyes Wide Shut, it is a very lengthy film and slow, but I also find it interesting and find it Kubrick's most underrated. I will admit the first two times I saw it I didn't like it, but I have seen it another three times and each time it gets better.<br/><br/>Like all of Kubrick's movies Eyes Wide Shut is beautifully made and edited, and has a wonderful soundtrack consisting of mostly pre-existing music with Musica Ricacarta by Ligeti standing out the most. The screenplay is mostly very good and the story is interesting. Much has been said of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, either good or bad. In my view Cruise is good, for me it is one of his better performances, but Kidman is just terrific and is memorable in every scene she's in.<br/><br/>In conclusion, interesting and for me Kubrick's most underrated film. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","I just watched this movie last night, in amongst a marathon of 'sensual thrillers'.<br/><br/>I would have to say, that amongst all the Stanley Kubrick films I found this by far the least.<br/><br/>It wasn't so much the plot, which was thin but ...ok, I can go with that. The direction of the piece...I didn't understand, which made the movie hard to follow.<br/><br/>On top of that was the music. What was with the piano plunking?!!?!!? On many scenes you hear a (highly annoying) one-finger-plunking on a piano. It makes absolutely no sense in relation to the movie, just leaves you annoyed and not really paying attention to the film. This movie really brings home what music can bring to a script...and how BAD music can ruin it.<br/><br/>Granted, I also didn't really understand the ending.

"ericjg623","3","2","9","24 February 2013"," ""American Pie"" was better
","There is supposed to be some deep, maybe even profound, message to this movie, but, for me at any rate, I sure couldn't find it. Indeed, my recollection of this film, which I've only seen once, on Pay-Per-View shortly after it came out, was that this was basically really high class porno made by an extremely skilled director. As such, the best (and maybe only) way to enjoy this movie is to fast forward through all the parts that don't contain naked ladies. <br/><br/>The problem is, ""Kubrick"" and ""Emotional richness and complexity"" are two expressions that just don't go together. Think about how many of his characters, from Strangelove to this present movie, that you really cared about. The only one that comes to my mind is the unfortunate fat kid who cracks under pressure in the boot camp part of ""Full Metal Jacket"". And that's the problem with this film. We just don't care about these characters AT ALL. At best, this is a stylistic exercise, a slick production that is utterly devoid of real human heart. <br/><br/>In that sense, ""American Pie"", which came out the same year, does a much better job of exploring the sometimes embarrassing and often hilarious things that occur when men and women (or, in this case, boys and girls) tap dance around the issues of love, romance, and sex. Unlike ""Eyes Wide Shut"", we see real human beings in real human situations with real human emotions. We can relate to them, and laugh along with them as they deal with the various foibles that come with human relationships. In contrast, the characters from this movie might as well be cyborgs for all the warmth they bring to the screen."

","I cannot say enough bad things about this movie.  I had been passively looking forward to this movie for years, and actively looking forward to it since I heard it announced.  I absolutely love all of Kubrick's work. Except this.  It is, without a doubt, the most masturbatory piece of filmmaking I have ever seen.  Even the reasonably interesting, and occasionally beautiful, cinematography can IN NO WAY save the endless, plodding, poorly scripted, and worse acted film that, the most I can say, ran through a projector for three hours.  I realize that some folks will think I am hyperbolizing, or that I just don't like slow movies, but I like the rest of his work, and, for God's sake, I like Sergio Leone.  But this was like Sergio and Stanley constantly interrupting each other while on Quaaludes.<br/><br/>All of the actors were evidently handed their scripts approximately thirteen seconds before shooting and only one take was allowed.  Most of the dialogue consisted of ""Uhhh,"" ten second pauses, and repetition of whatever was left over.<br/><br/>To sum up, this was ... this ... was ... the most ... it was the most boring... the most boring movie ... the MOST ... boring movie ...  ever made."

"SmileyMcGrouchpants","10","1","3","25 June 2017"," You find out ... or do you?
","I saw this again recently (two years ago) and I totally got into the weird tone, the razor's edge that this guy's walking, and how he doesn't seem to get good answers for what's going on, ultimately ... what he's told is not just cryptic or obscure, or to mollify him, they're the sorts of things you'd tell somebody who doesn't deserve to know, when you've got answers aplenty and can spare these minor-and-prosaic ones. Everything's all wrapped up and accounted for a few times over, so, why behave as though there's some ""whole enchilada"" to even share with him, to begin with? He's only glimpsed a piece, if that All these alternate identities have to do with cover, with not getting caught out, with the possibility of discovery buried under many onion skin-layers of guise to conceal the goings-on ... what else could be the point? Why unravel it?<br/><br/>It's crucial that the piano-player guy only knows a *little*, and then the physician played by Tom Cruise sneaks in, driven by some sense of dislocation at home which pushes him over the line to take some potentially-unwise risks. Everything the Sydney Pollack character tells the Tom Cruise guy near the end *seems* to account for everything, and you'd be paranoid to worry more about having it all wrapped up like that ... right? It's a weird distinction; it's not that everyone on screen is simply ""rich,"" it's that those other people are ""wealthy,"" and the doctor is merely upper-middle-class. (Remember, the Fitzgerald line is actually ""the *very* rich are not like you and me."") He's close enough to have contact with them, but he's not in the ""inner circle,"" and, whatever they might think of him personally, he's not going to get clued in, he's only going to be placated. (They also can't just ""get rid"" of the guy, that's out of the question -- which is why the drama proceeds the way it does. It's not a ""kill him if he's giving us problems!"" fictional-fallacy story.)<br/><br/>Part of the problem with catching this lies not just in subtleties not easily explicated without wrecking the whole movie to begin with, but in the use of recognizable stars whom we're accustomed to sitting back and watching do things we wouldn't, anyway. (On the other hand, if Tom Cruise was playing a working- class steelworker, for example, and Sydney Pollack was a champagne-sipping bigwig, we'd know how to take it, but it's not so drastic and pedantically-obvious a distinction in this particular movie -- which is also why the only-in-NYC setting is crucial). Similarly, the narrative strategy of the movie involves putting you in a position whereby catching the tone and usage of ""privileged information"" as deployed between individuals in offhand conversation proves crucial to understanding the action, as well as how much one could guess about what goes on behind closed doors when they're decisively shut tight, quiet as a tomb, emitting no sound from those trapped inside. (I didn't get this as a 28-year-old in '99 when I first saw it in the theater, and the reviews I encountered didn't help.)<br/><br/>As a result, I thought the masked-ball scene was really, really scary; Kubrick's use of the music, or, rather, his invoking of how ritualistic occasions would *deploy* specific musical tones towards ends like that, stirring up all the deeper energies of the participants, smacked of esoteric practices that only few people walking the earth would even know *about*. To be not nervous by that point is to be less-than- clear about how hot the water the Tom Cruise guy is in. What is this place he has just waltzed into out of some vague curiosity and momentary spite towards his wife? I think the movie comes together or falls apart, by that point, for viewers if they're not with him, if they can't sense he's walking a tightrope, little though he may be aware of it at the time ..."
"Prismark10","5","1","3","9 July 2016"," Eyes Wide Shut
","Eyes Wide Shut was Stanley Kubrick's final film. He died before the film's wide release. The film was in production for over a year requiring various re-shoots. It starred the then husband and wife team of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.<br/><br/>Dr Bill Harford (Cruise) is a successful young doctor with his own practice, beautiful wife, young daughter and a swanky apartment in Manhattan.<br/><br/>After attending a lavish party where Bill flirted a bit and later smoking some pot in their apartment. His wife Alice (Kidman) tells him that she once fantasised leaving him for a sexy sailor. This rocks Bill as he now keeps imagining his wife having sex with the sailor.<br/><br/>This sets Bill on a road to strange encounters where he lets his inhibitions drop and walk the wild side of life. He meets a woman that is a hooker, a bereaved daughter lunges and kisses him. He goes to a fancy dress shop where the owner's nubile daughter gives him the come on. Bill gets an old medical school friend, now a piano player to reveal to him the location of a place where wild sex parties take place.<br/><br/>However Bill gets caught out as an interloper in the sex orgy and realises that he might have put himself in danger, especially when a prostitute in the orgy turns up dead and his piano playing friend disappears.<br/><br/>Bill is spurred on to confess to his wife about the dark night of his soul and his various encounters, none of which ever lead to sex.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully filmed in a Christmas setting that allows for a lot of festive themed lights. The film was shot in London as Kubrick who having settled in Britain never left the country.<br/><br/>Despite building a typical Greenwich Village street at Pinewood Studios it looked unauthentic.<br/><br/>There is nothing in this movie to suggest why it took so long to shoot the film. At its heart it is just an adult drama with erotic leanings and comic absurdities.<br/><br/>Now I know he was not known as 'One Take Kubrick' but really taking over a year to shoot the film was taking the biscuit. I once read a discussion and I think it has some validity that the reason Kubrick took so many takes was he was hoping for some kind of serendipity. A chance magical intervention that would suddenly occur which would elevate one shot from dozens of other similar ones and critics would acclaim Kubrick as some kind of wizard.<br/><br/>During the production two actors were replaced. Sydney Pollack replaced Harvey Keitel as Ziegler the gregarious and libertine party host. Pollack was an actor turned Oscar winning director who specialised in making cameo appearances such as the startled agent in Tootsie and the shocked doctor in Death Becomes Her.<br/><br/>Pollack also directed Cruise in The Firm. Pollack was right on the money as Ziegler the concerned friend but also a man with a seedy underbelly.<br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh was replaced by Marie Richardson as Marion the bereaved daughter who impulsively kisses Bill.<br/><br/>The notorious orgy starts out as some kind of Roger Corman-like masked ball from The Masque of the Red Death with some kind of semi satanic rituals before descending into some laughable softcore sex scenes. Some of the over enthusiastic jiggling we get to see, well let us say the man would be slipping out a lot.<br/><br/>The women Kubrick hired for the sex party look rather fetching with their thongs and bare breasts. Kudos to the casting director.<br/><br/>Cruise's character is very passive with all that is going on around him including the kinkiness. He might had a sharp punch in the gut from his wife's careless words but Cruise does not reflect this. This must a be a directorial choice as Cruise is a lot better and a more expressive actor than say Matthew Modine or Ryan O'Neil that Kubrick had cast in his previous movies.<br/><br/>The whole story is too thin and stretched out for a 160 minutes run time. The film is leisurely paced. At least Kubrick pierced the mundane setting with sudden slapstick such as the escapades of the Fancy Dress Shop owner and his daughter.<br/><br/>Ultimately the film is about two married people who took each other for granted and failed to appreciate each other. Just look at Alice at the beginning who is peeing in the bathroom as Bill walks in and does not flinch.<br/><br/>At the first party thrown by Ziegler, she gets propositioned by an older man and she flirts back while Bill in turn is being playful to two English ladies which Alice sees but does nothing about.<br/><br/>Kubrick made fewer films as he got older. Eyes Wide Shut was his first film since 1987. Cruise and Kidman were prepared to put their successful film careers on hold to work for an auteur knowing that they could spend months making the film. It is just a shame that Kubrick went out on a whimper."

This is a very provocative film that has to do with psychotic and sexual thoughts and behaviors. It isn't one of Kubrick's best work though but still a engaging movie from beginning to end although it can be messed up sometimes. Actually a lot of times.

","As if we didn't already know Kubrick was the greatest filmmaker of all time, he proved it yet again with this, his final film, an epic and dark masterpiece. I won't give a plot summary, as so many people have and the plot itself is fairly simple to follow. Cruise is amazing at the height of his career (his Oscar-nominated performance in Magnolia followed) and Kidman is captivating in her monologue early in the film, the revelation which sets in motion the strange and eerie events of the film. Kubrick's talent is once again visible, employing classical music as well as an unsettling piano tune which plays during the second half (by Gyorgy Ligeti) to sink us in, as well as a mysterious plot which pulls us without warning into a dark world of sexual discovery. Cruise plays his frustrated doctor character with ease and skill, one of the best performances by an actor in a leading role in 1999. If you're a fan of Kubrick (or even if you aren't), this is a must-see."

","This is an unforgettable, haunting, thought provoking masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, with a mesmerizing story, and incredible performances!. All the characters are wonderful, and even at 159 minutes I wanted more, plus Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are simply incredible in this, and have amazing chemistry together!. You must pay strict attention in this one, otherwise you will be lost, and it's one of the most unpredictable films I have ever seen, plus it's full of twists and turns as well. I can see why it's controversial however it's seriously one of the most amazing films I have ever seen, and quite possibly the best Kubrick film I have seen as well (only competition, The Shining and Clockwork Orange), plus it's brilliantly made and written. Yes it has tons of sex and nudity, but it's a hell of a lot more then just that, as it may take one of two more viewings before it really sinks in, plus all the characters are extremely likable. It's also incredibly creepy as well, and the score is one of the best I have heard, plus the ending was just great.<br/><br/>We are able to totally care for Cruise's character here, as we feel his pain, and yes even the jealousy, and the same goes for Kidman as well, even though I didn't like what she told Tom about her sexual fantasies, plus some of the creepiest parts in the movie, came at that weird party, with all the guys in hoods and masks, it really Creeped me out. Also the scene where that guy is following Tom across the street, was really suspenseful and well done, and I personally believe this should be in the top 250 in my opinion, plus This was an incredible way for Kubrick to go out in my opinion, as he may have given us his best film!. This film will not be for everybody, as it's an acquired taste, and it has some great atmosphere in it as well, plus even though I didn't know what the hell was going on at times, I was still extremely engrossed by it all!.<br/><br/>It would have been even more wicked it they released it as NC 17 or even X, and the scene with Cruise and Sydney Pollack near the end, is quite confusing, but absolutely shocking! plus the scene near the end where Cruise breaks down in front Of Kidman and confesses is very powerful and moving. This is one of the most unique films around, and filled with lots of wonderful bizarre stuff, plus it may get under your skin (but in a good way) at times too!. It's rather disturbing at times too, and some scenes seriously took my breath away, plus the ending gives you an important message as well. This is an unforgettable, haunting, thought provoking masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, with a mesmerizing story and incredible performances, and if you haven't seen it please do so immediately, although it may not be for everyone.<br/><br/>The Direction is incredible as always from Stanley Kubrick!. Stanley Kubrick does an incredible job here, with outstanding camera work,amazing angles, giving the film lots of creepy atmosphere,and leaving us with a sense of dread, panic and making the viewer feeling uncomfortable (in a good way), plus he kept the film at an extremely engrossing pace.<br/><br/>The Acting is incredible!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, he is extremely likable, a jealous and somewhat tortured man, and we feel for him, are able to care for him, a lot of people complained he walked around too much with a smirk om his face but that's his style and it fit in with this film well, he also had wonderful chemistry with Nicole Kidman, had a very powerful scene near the end, he also played a real convincing Doctor, a powerful performance indeed, up there with one of his best. (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Nicole Kidman is also amazing as always and is incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, extremely sexy, had fantastic chemistry with Cruise, had a very likable character, even though she intentionally made Cruise's character jealous, she was just important to the film as Cruise was she was incredible! (Kidman Rules!!!!!!). Sydney Pollack is excellent in his role here he added lots of class, and was simply delightful, I loved him!. Vinessa Shaw has a small but memorable role as the hooker Domino, she is incredibly gorgeous and played her part very well. Leelee Sobieski has a very small part as Milich's Daughter and did OK I guess. Rest of the cast do fine.<br/><br/>Overall if you haven't seen it please do so immediately, although it may not be for everybody. ***** out of 5"

","The story was fabulous. I really liked the idea of a couple thinking about infidelity instead of actually doing the act...that was more interesting than a real affair. The LIGHTING WAS INCREDIBLE! I loved the dazzling blues with occasional splashes of orange. The locations were well chosen too. The women in the omen orgy scene were a little on the stick side, but I'm just saying that because I wish I were that skinny. Nicole was impressive, especially the part where she gets high. I liked how she went off on Tom, who was way too rigid. She was totally lost in her character and he was still confused and not giving himself over to anything. I think this movie was too deep for him. And on the DVD it's interesting to watch the interviews because that was back in 1999 and he talked about their marriage being strong enough to be able to stand working together. I wonder what he thinks now! I also see why famous people don't like interviews. Anything said in an interview is on public display and could sound incriminating at a later date. Anyway, I feel the movie could have been a lot better with a different actor to play Bill. Cruise was not the right choice. To the film's credit, however, it was one of the first time that I actually looked for the name of the person who did the production design and lights...although I don't remember their names. Too bad this film was wasted on Cruise."
"turnipism","Null","1","3","18 March 2005"," Sex, Lies, and Mask with Cape
","I can see how this movie tries to explore the intricate details of a sexually deficient relationship. It wasn't hard to realize that both Tom and Nicole's characters were suffering because of a lack of passion between them. It is also obvious that Bill's night-long sexual escapade was a unsuccessful quest to fill that void, and that it lead to a kind of awakening in him. These things are clear, but they do not make for a compelling movie. This film is hailed as being one of Kubrick's finest works, maybe even his best, but I found it to be a horrid display of acting and film-making that too many people automatically claim to be thought-provoking and a work of genius. It was neither.<br/><br/>Choosing a real life celebrity couple to play the parts of Alice and Bob was a terrible idea. Sure celebrities have the most hands-on experience with screwed up relationships, but that doesn't mean they need to act it out. And with these two I use the word 'acting' quite loosely. The movie tries to create sexual intrigue as it trods along from scene to naked scene where either Kidman is acting like an exaggerated nitwit, or Cruise is wandering around in a haze of confusion, as if the script was being revealed to him via telepathy. There was nothing serious or real about these two people. And if there's an award for most annoying pacing of speech in a movie, I nominate this one. Perhaps Kubrick could have shed an hour off of this film if he hadn't had every conversation drag on with dramatic pauses every second word.<br/><br/>One thing Kubrick is known for is his cinematography and use of music, but this movie had nothing going for it. Watching scene after painful scene of Bill being haunted by the black and white visions of a cheating wife was too much, making the film feel like a lousy soft-core movie you stumble across late at night. And the musical score....what beauty. Every shot was certainly enhanced by the one-armed pianist banging out his 4 note sonata of sorrow. Well done, Kubrick. <br/><br/>And let's not forget the climax of Bill's night out. After wandering into a series of stupid encounters with prostitutes and such, he decides to try his luck at the freaky cult masquerade ball of lackluster sex. There's the unique genius of Kubrick at work for you, producing a party scene somewhere between high society and a jawa orgy. I kept expecting David Bowie to spring out from beneath a cape and mask to sing ""As the world falls down"". I knew the movie was truly swirling the bowl when the naked showgirl reject announced to Bill that he must leave at once, for he is in great danger. I know what you're thinking, ""But...later on it's explained that the whole thing is staged, so it's supposed to sound corny."" Well if a so-called serious movie comes up with a lines like those, I think it's time to start rethinking the story.<br/><br/>I could continue with more complaints involving Cruise flashing his medical license around like it was a police badge, or the unrewarding conclusion to this sad excuse for a film, but anyone who really liked this movie has stopped reading long ago. Kubrick has made good films, but to wait nearly twelve years for him to create something this bad is disappointing to say the least. Luckily the shock of it killed him before he could start developing some movie called 'Tongue Outly In'; a weird exploration of a couples' crumbling relationship among the playboy druids of Sexton Mansion starring Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston or some other 'unstoppable' celebrity duo. Phew! That was close."

Their on screen chemistry seems lost in this epic....

I watched it, and didn't like it. Then I watched it again with a different group of people, and still didn't like it.  Then, in an extraneous effort to see where Kubrick was going with this movie, I watched it again by myself.  Will someone PLEASE explain to me why this movie is good?"

","It MUST be great?  I MUST be missing something, right?  These are questions that you start asking yourself after seeing this movie.  All of Kubrick's other movies were great, so watching this movie is a bit of a shock to your system.  For a while, I was in denial mode, thinking it HAD to be good and I just didn't get it.  I saw it a few more times on cable and reality set in. This is an awful movie.  What a terrible way to end a legacy.  It's sort of like the sequel that you wish was never made."

Eyes Wide Shut is such a movie, it leaves you with many open questions and I find this very disturbing. I expect a movie to have at least a closure that will answer all the questions if not answered before in the film. If Eyes Wide Shut had answered the tons of questions it made me think of in the movie I may have enjoyed it 100 times more.<br/><br/>This movie is big disappointment for me, don't expect too much of it."

","First of all, this movie is sexist.  There is full frontal female nudity all throughout the movie, whereas we see no male nudity, except for maybe Tom Cruise's chest.  The most despicable scene is where there are a bunch of fully clothed men dancing with a bunch of naked, Hollywood perfect women. In what world are the men clothed, but the women naked?<br/><br/>As for the actual movie, it was mediocre.  I didn't think the acting was anything special, even for Cruise and Kidman.  The plotline was kind of dull to me...and the meaning of the movie was washed away behind the nudity which was there, top to bottom.  And the nudity didn't have to be there.  I feel that the movie could have been a lot better...first off, if the actors had given it 100%.  Secondly, if they either a) did away with some of the nudity or b) put in some male nudity to give it some class so it didn't seem like trash.  <br/><br/>All in all, I wouldn't really recommend it unless you want something to fall asleep to or jack off to."

","I think this movie had the potential of being good, but didn't succeed at it - at least not for me. When Tom Cruise visited the house with all the people it started getting good, but then it went downhill again (instead of uphill). We was never told what was so dangerous about that house party, we never was told who the people were and we was never told what was the deal with Nicole Kidman and her involvement in all this. Of course there may be something for us to figure out for ourselves in movies, but this had to many loose ends in my opinion, to make it to hard to figure it out and just made it a movie where you just said ""Nah, I couldn't really say if it was good or bad, as it had too many loose ends"". It's not like it was completely crazy and weird like ""Lost highway"" for instance, but it just a bit boring and instead of building up to big climax it kind of faded out a whole hour! It also lasted almost 3 hours, so it was too long to use on a film like this in my opinion. I don't mind long films if they're good, but this was as I said just a film where I said ""Nothing special"", which for me basically is a waste of time."

","In ""Cool Hand Luke"" Strother Martin uttered that truly memorable quote ""What we've got here is a failure to communicate.""  Never has that line been more apropos then as applied to Stanley Kubrick's self-indulgent fantasy made public ""Eyes Wide Shut.""<br/><br/>Last year, filmgoers were subjected to Terrance Malick's long awaited return in ""A Thin Red Line"".  This year it's Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut.""  We can only guess that something must happen to reclusive directors living in isolation that causes them to lose their once profound ability to communicate with their audiences.<br/><br/>In the last year, Malick and Kubrick have each provided us with nearly three hours of screen time filled with memorable, and often haunting, images.  It has been as though their personal dream worlds have been given life through the magic of cinema, and tens of millions of studio dollars.  For at least the last year, many of us have heard reports of how Kubrick subjected his actors to continuous rewrites and reshoots.  We can only presume that these ongoing rewrite and reshoots where were the result of Kubrick's struggle to place a story to the images coming out of his personal dream world, both fantasy and nightmare.<br/><br/>We have learned over time that most successful films tap into our society's collective mass consciousness.  Stories are told using a form of logic based upon our collective experiences to which most of us can understand and related.  However, in ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" Kubrick has failed to provide his audience with a story which has the requisite logic to connect his images to a world shared in our collective consciousness.<br/><br/>In ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" it is as if Kubrick is telling us a story in a foreign language that we cannot understand.  Imagine Kubrick's photography as the body language of the story-teller.  Although we can understand enough of the body language to appreciate the tone of the story, without understanding the words we have no way of truly understanding the message contained in the story.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" drops the filmgoer into Kubrick's reclusive dream world, filled with memorable images of sexual fantasies and ominous nightmares. Unfortunately for us, the story-teller has passed away and there is not a translator in site.  Consequently, the film will likely only make sense to a viewer who lives life, like Kubrick, in their dreams -- with their Eyes Wide Shut."

Besides, we thought, there will be Tom Cruise nudity - what could it hurt? It could hurt a lot - and believe me it was painful. I think this movie must have been about 7 hours long. We knew 30 minutes into the movie that it sucked, BUT, we still had to watch the other 5 or 6 hours, because there's the Tommy Nude Shot to look for  - right? (If you've seen the movie, you know how well that theory turns out.) I was quite surprised at how tame it was. I had heard all this talk about how it bordered on pornography, but to me all it was was nudity. Lots of naked women - big deal.

","Amazing that anyone would find anything redeeming about this sad debacle. It's Stanley Kubrick doing (serious) Woody Allen, right down to the Sydney Pollack cameo. Stultifyingly paced, it's the best sleep inducer I've ever experienced. This is the kind of vehicle that mainstream hollywood would have cast Michael Douglas & Kathleen Turner in, & that might have given it some humor & punch, but Cruise is so badly miscast, he looks like he's about to burst into tears at any moment. The plot is laughable. It worked fine as a period fantasy, but it sure creaks & flops in a contemporary context, not that this movie has any kind of context at all. It's strangely a-contextual. There's not anything resembling a real live 3-d human being anywhere on the screen. Even all those nude women (no nude men) look like products of a corporate committee. How sad.

I think a movie about jealousy and the politics of sex in marriage is a superb idea, but in order for it to work we need to care about the characters, they need to be well developed. They are nothing but mannequins here. And there's almost nothing believable here, from Cruise flashing his medical license everywhere (how many MDs carry their license card? and is there even such a thing that fits neatly into your wallet) to his getting so wound up over Nicole's THINKING about cheating on him. And I agree with all of the posts on the hypocrisy of the nudity: WHY do we only see nude women??? I know the director is a man, but please, have SOME compassion for the female viewers. And seeing Cruise shirtless isn't enough, for me anyway, since I don't think he's very good looking."

Absolutely phony in every frame. And *unbelievably boring* to boot. A truly awful movie-going experience, and an embarrassing adieu for Kubrick."
"alice liddell","8","1","3","13 September 1999"," Stanley Kubrick was the one director to have only directed masterpieces: the more you think about this deceptive film, the more this might be still true.
","For the first half of this film I was reeling in disbelieving dismay.  What had happened to the great Stanley Kubrick, along with Peckinpah and Burton the great American director of the last forty years?  The old style now lacked any life, lapsing into cod-Felliniisms (sic?); the story was without any real interest; and where the hell was Nicole Kidman when we needed her?<br/><br/>Then I realised how wrong I had been.  Many critics have noted, in surprise, how faithful the film is to Schnitzler's trite novella.  This is, I believe, where they were misled.  Only on a superficial level can it truly be called a faithful adaptation.   EYES WIDE SHUT can only be properly appreciated as a Kubrick film.  It's not really an examination of marriage or psychoanalysis, as is the book.  Like LOLITA, 2001, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, BARRY LYNDON and THE SHINING - it concerns the gradual disintegration of a hero who began the movie whole, confident and self-satisfied.<br/><br/>In this way, the most helpful references might not be to Freud, but Nabokov and, perhaps bizarrely, Eric Rohmer.  Like Nabokov, especially in Lolita, the assured faith in witness of the hero is constantly undermined.  Unlike the novel, in which Fridolin's peregrinations are unambiguously dreamlike (its title translates as Dream Story), Kubrick takes care to establish the superficial reality of Bill's adventures.  As these go on, though, coincidences, correspondances, nagging implausibilities and absurdities begin to undermine this reality.  <br/><br/>The film, like Lolita, is impossibly symmetrical - the first two important scenes (Bill with his family; Bill in a crisis moment with Zeigler)exactly match the last two scenes (except for Bill's power in them); and there is an elegant patterning and repetition throughout.  The ludicrous, Victorian, 'motivation' of a novel called Dream Story is completely weeded out, and characters are reduced to ciphers, as is appropriate to a dream.<br/><br/>This is where Rohmer comes in.  His films, on a superficial level, concern bright young things talking talking talking about sex and philosophy, but his use of colour, framing and allusion (paintings, books, films, songs etc.) tell a completely different story.  Similarly here.  The crucial sequence is the opening party at Ziegler's.  Everything in Bill's 'dream' that follows springs from this.  For instance, the models that invite Bill for a menage-a-trois promise him a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow: in his plot, the costume shop he visits is called Rainbow.<br/><br/>Most important is the scene with Ziegler in the bathroom.  For a start, the room is covered in mirrors.  On one level is a naked, possibly dead, girl on an armchair; on another is a painting of a sprawling naked woman (I thought it was by Matisse, but I couldn't find it when I looked it up later). Already slightly drunk, and aroused after the models, can you imagine the effect of these two naked women multiply reflected in all those mirrors must have on Bill?  This mixture of profuse nudity, and fear of death, ring throughout his 'dream'.<br/><br/>Secondly, the rich red of the painting echoes throughout Bill's adventures, colouring everything unrealistically, especially the orgy scene, and Ziegler's billiards room, completely undermining the latter's 'explanation'. This is a wonderful scene, completely misunderstood by Kubrick devotee Michael Dwyer.<br/><br/>The film operates as an Oedipal story in reverse.  In (simplistic) Freudian terms, to enter into society, a man must symbolically kill his father and marry a mother substitute.  This Bill utterly fails to do.  Ziegler is the father figure here, and Bill at the opening is forced to confront his father, having just completed the primal scene.  His subsequent attempts throughout the film, to 'marry' this 'mother' result only in her death, and Ziegler's increased superiority.  As a son grows older, he is supposed to see flaws in his father, see that he doesn't have the answers to everything. But in the billiards room scene, Ziegler CAN answer everything, he is total control, like a father correcting an errant child.<br/><br/>Bill ends the film reduced to the childlike level of his daughter, in tears, totally dependent on, and at the mercy of, his wife ('mother').  If this is optimistic, as everyone has been claiming, than I'm Stanley Kubrick. Obviously not everything here fits - one would hope not, and I have only seen the film once, so give me a break.  The emphasis on the hero at the expense of the heroine might seem misogynistic, but that would be to miss the point of the film's deconstruction.<br/><br/>One of the film's structural motifs is storytelling.  Foucault once linked epistomology and sex, and here almost every character  has a story to tell, a way of controlling and shaping experience.  Everyone except Bill, who must find his own story (linked to his having sex).  However he keeps being waylaid by others' (especially his wife's), and his own 'conclusion' (Ziegler's explanation) does the opposite of what he had hoped: it emasculates and infantilises him.<br/><br/>On a simply entertainment level, EYES WIDE SHUT is a joy.  As I've said elsewhere, it's been an atrocious year for cinema, so it's enrapturing to see a genuine master in mature, if not absolutely outstanding, form. Kubrick's famous tracking shots, besides being so aesthetically breathtaking in themselves, create a real sense of the steady ground moving from under the characters' feet, slowly slipping away.  The film is very VERY funny, especially in its use of doomladen piano music in the orgy scene and after in Bill's head whenever a crisis point occurs (the orgy should not be taken as literal and 'daring', but as a centring of the signifiers and anxieties whirring in Bill's head), as well as the mocking insertion of old favorites such as 'Strangers In The Night'.  Shostakovitch's glorious Waltz from Jazz Suite No. 2, the film's musical motif, is gorgeously evocative, as well as being, appropriately, a parodic pastiche (and impossible to get out of your head).<br/><br/>The scenes between Kidman and Cruise are remarkable and painful;  one never had Kubrick down as such a perceptive artist of domestic comedy (although THE SHINING should have been a clue).  Nicole Kidman is truly brilliant in a difficult role, but Tom Cruise is strangely perfect, his smug persona wonderfully sent up (see especially the scene where he gives the prosititute/student 'compensation'), his eventual reduction after his confession to a little boy truly convincing.  <br/><br/>Since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick films have invariably received initially unfavorable reviews, only for subsequent viewings to reveal them as astonishing masterworks (BARRY LYNDON and THE SHINING are the pinnacles of modern cinema).  I would not be remotely surprised if the same thing happened with this film."

The critics who rave about this movie are simply praising Kubrick, if anyone else had directed this movie it would have been universally bashed as the awful film it actually is. Fortunately this is America and everyone is entitled to an opinion. I have enjoyed some of his works in the past, especially Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove, but Eyes Wide Shut in my opinion is a sad finish to a career.

"harmony-8","5","1","3","20 July 1999"," This film is definitely not a masterpiece.
","I was very disappointed in Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, -- perhaps because I was a great admirer of Kubrick's films such as 2001: Space Odyssey and Dr. Strangelove.  The symbolism in the film was too obvious to be thought-provoking, and Kubrick's attitude toward the material was puerile and  puritanical at the same time, generating a sense of cognitive dissonance.  As the initial shot of the film as well as the deployment of the movie-star couple  indicates, the director at first seems to underline the voyeurism of the film medium, audience as well as of himself.  Well, however, as the film progresses, his critical stance toward the film medium disintegrates into his somewhat childish fascination  with the ""beauty"" of the nude female bodies in the Hollywood film industry(all of which reminded me of the naked mannequin beverage dispensers in A Clockwork Orange), which is nevertheless hidden under the facade of a stern moralist.  It is a sexist film, indeed.  (Well, which of Kubrick's films were not sexist?) However, the most disturbing aspect of this film event (what else can you call it?) to me was many critics' response toward this film: some of them even called this minor incomplete film as a masterpiece.  Their awe of this outstanding film-maker obviously pulled a blind over their eyes.  Eyes wide shut can be described as the condition of these critics whose inferiority complex makes them intellectual coward of themselves.  As a recent, more thought-provoking film hinted at, we are in a matrix-like system that has been created and controlled by the media. These unthinking critics are the ample evidence of this false-reality-creating machine."
"Shimsham-2","2","1","3","19 July 1999"," This was Stanley Kubrick?
","I have been a fan of Kubrick ever since Dr. Strangelove.  He has always demonstrated the ability to bring his audience into a world full of characters that they may or may not like, with whom they may have very little in common, but always making the characters sympathetic and always framing them in a story that is both fantastic and convincing.<br/><br/>
Eyes Wide Shut missed this mark.  I am not sure how much is writing, how much is directing, and how much is editing, but this movie was so disjointed that all credibility evaporated.  The acting, though quite good (well above the weak 'Far and Away' performance I was expecting) was not able to save the film.<br/><br/>A brief word about the sex: Unerotic.  As I patiently waited for the big turn on (cf. Lolita), I kept thinking how, with so many naked people on the screen, how difficult it is to make so much sex seem so unsexy.  The actions in the raunchiest of scenes (albeit digitally purified so as to not assault my delicate American sensibilities) seemed overly deliberate.  It was more reminiscent of Cinemax late-night than the raving saturnalia it was meant to be.<br/><br/>With little action (events, not nakedness), stunning visuals and characters are what keep me interested.  I have to admit, that for the lion's share of the movie, the colors and sets were gorgeous, with interesting themes in lighting to give a sense of what context the scene held for Dr. Harford. The New York (London) streets were well filmed, but not stunning by any means.  But the characters were left as mere shells with minor motivation and very little in the way of context in the story.  Some of the characters I really wanted to know about (eg. Domino, Nick Nightingale) were completely unexplored.<br/><br/>For a long time, I have been pushing the idea of a Dolph Lundgren moment. This is the time in some films where the characters and their actions mean so little, that all I can do is wait for Dolph to bust through a large leaded glass window with grenades in tow, and begin the carnage that will inevitably bring the credits as all the characters are dead. Unfortunately, Dolph was not in the cast."

I can give you a plot summary in maybe four steps:<br/><br/>Tom Cruise walks around New York to one of two locations and spends ludicrous amounts of money.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise says he's a doctor.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise thinks of Nicole Kidman.<br/><br/>Repeat if necessary until you have thoroughly wasted 2 1/2 hours of the audience's time.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was just some maniac on a piano banging a note at a time as hard as he could.  The only noticeable song, Chris Isaak's ""Bad, Bad Thing"" was a bit of irony in that his characters never actually DO bad things. They just think about them or watch, and I'm sorry, but that's terribly boring.

"supahz","1","1","3","17 July 1999"," EWS Fails To Live Up To The Kubrick Legacy
","I like Stanley Kubrick.  What director can boast of such a wide variety of films and styles while maintaining such a high level of work?  Few, and Kubrick was one of them.  The man was a filmmaking genius.  No one can argue that point.  However, we CAN argue the merits of individual films within a lifetime of work, and EWS would have to rank as a major disappointment when measured against Kubrick's past achievements.<br/><br/>The film was beautiful visually.  Kubrick certainly had his own vision, as every good director does, and his fans certainly won't be disappointed from this perspective.  As far as the craft of making films goes, EWS was often fantastic.  However, the actual story drags in places, which isn't good for such a long film.  In fact it was so much so that I heard some of the 30 or so patrons in the theater begin to make comments to the screen about it. Some movies are meant to be interactive, with cheering and such, but when a film generates only ""get on with it!"" and lots of ""sheesh""es, it's not a good thing.<br/><br/>Sydney Pollack was extremely solid in his role.  Nicole Kidman's rear end did a fine job.  And the whole scene of the orgy party was very well done. Another highlight was Alan Cumming, who provided a much-needed wake-up and comic relief as the hotel clerk.  But these were not enough to save the film.<br/><br/>I suppose that we should all play nice and rave about EWS, seeing as the master filmmaker died just after its completion.  And I suppose that we should also go along with some fawning critics and claim this is a wonderful film, worthy of praise alongside truly amazing Kubrick films like 2001 and Dr Strangelove, because, after all, it's his last film.  We should, I suppose, also ignore  Nicole Kidman's weak performance (her pot smoking scene was laughable, and performance generally shallow), Tom Cruise's overwrought emotional performance (which was, barring the often senseless crying and whining, nicely done), a piano soundtrack that threatens to cause insanity, and a totally inadequate and weak end scene.  Why?  Well, it was Kubrick's last film, of course.<br/><br/>Baloney.  The truth is, unless you're serious Kubrick fan, or a die-hard Kidman or Cruise fan, you're bound to be disappointed.  Like mystery?  It's here only as a misleading force.  Like romance?  Look elsewhere.  Want drama?  There's some, but it's fairly bland stuff.  EWS takes on many angles and delivers on precious few of them.  True, it's nice to have someone take a ""mature"" look at sex and relationships, and to do it intelligently and seriously.  Intelligent films are a good thing, when done right.  There are elements of genius in this film, but it simply doesn't come together in a way that relieves the boring stretches and overshadows the weak performances and ending.<br/><br/>I can't imagine that this film is going to be a favorite among the general movie-going public.  I'm sure that that's just how die-hard Kubrick fans would want it, and that's great for them.  However, to fans like myself who have enjoyed Kubrick's work in the past, and had high expectations for this film, it's a disappointment.  Looking back now I can't understand the secrecy or hype around the movie.  And I'm guessing that neither will most movie fans."

","Having read the greater majority of the 1050 user-comments listed here, at least, the fifty odd that were WORTH reading, I feel constrained to add my own; perceptive, witty and appropriate as they are! I believe that Kubrick unequivocably was the ultimate directoral sensai. His unique brilliance shone like a red giant amongst a galaxy of variously and indifferently talented movie front-men. EYES WHITE SHUT is Stanley Kubrick's own personal black hole. Not only can no light escape from it, it totally collapsed under its own seriously weakened infrastructure. More than anything, I had wanted to immerse myself one last time in the work of an artiste, a man whose depth of vision and interpretation of life's everyday abnormalities, brought to the screen towering ambiguity and unending scope for discussion.<br/><br/>Despite those who obviously see what they WANT to see in this two and a half hour ad for ribbed condoms, there remains for me just one question. What happened? did I miss the fat lady somewhere?<br/><br/>Kubrick took the final print to Hollywood just one week before his death on March 8th 1999 in Hertfordshire England. The ultimately reclusive movie maestro had been working on the movie's post-production since filming wrapped early in 1998 after 71 weeks in production, having commenced December 1996, thus making this the longest film-shoot in history.<br/><br/>In line with Kubrick's reluctance to travel - especially by air, the production team recreated the Manhattan street scenes on-set in London. The story itself is based on the Arthur Schnitzler novella entitled ""Traumnovelle"" (Dream Story). Budget for the film allegedly topped $120 million, though HOW u would wonder, but a fraction of that is visible on screen. From concept to completion EYES WIDE SHUT occupied pretty much the last decade of Kubrick's life! Many believe that the movie reveals a humanitarian side to the master film-maker that was absent from his real-time personna. Blended surrealism and sexual liberation that could only come to the screen by way of Kubrickvision.<br/><br/>What DID happen to Cruise at the masked orgy? (Who cares? I hear many whisper furtively!) All this and less is revealed in the ensuing well photographed confusion. This however is the core of the mystery and perhaps the beginning of another. An elusive note perhaps on which to bow out.<br/><br/>Infinitely more interesting than the movie itself are the reasons behind Kubrick making it. Not a solitary reviewer appears to have questioned this aspect of the film. Although little more now than supposition, the death of his second wife Ruth at her own hand in 1968 left Kubrick with a profound guilt-complex, he having accused her of having an affair some months earlier. Later he took refuge in his self-enforced isolation, consoled in part by his inherent distrust of humanity. It was Ruth herself who proposed he should read ""Traumnovelle"" It is easy then to view EYES WIDE SHUT as the self-flagellation he felt he so richly deserved. Sexually, Kubrick once confided to an associate that he privately fantasised about having relations with unknown young actresses, although at the time he was clearly smitten (like so many others) with the young Julie Christie. Here was a man mortally afraid of the rejection he felt would inevitably set-in, if a man should lose control of the relationship itself.<br/><br/>Whatever the underlying motives, EYES WIDE SHUT though bearing all the hallmarks of the Kubrick directoral DNA, it remains a flawed work. One problem being that Kidman, perhaps entitled to be referred to as 'elegant' while dressed, is surely something less than hot-stuff in the raw. (Just MY opinion, but there again, I thought Tinkerbell had it pretty much all together in the body department!) Either way, Kidman's sterility-inducing opening scenes on the toilet were quite frankly not the aperitif most connoisseurs were hoping for.<br/><br/>Try as one might, to WANT to admire this work, it is lean-pickings at best and far from a fitting epitaph to a very great man."
"mattymatt4ever","9","1","3","7 May 2001"," A memorable final chapter for one of our greatest directors!!!
","Though ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was not easily received by the general public, I consider it an underrated classic.  After all, this is the not the type of film that would appeal to mainstream audiences, which is why I don't see why they fought hard to get the R rating.  This movie proved more popular among the arthouse crowd, who realize the haunting visions that Kubrick portrayed in this masterful effort.  <br/><br/>What makes this movie so great is its unpredictability.  That's what distinguishes it from lots of the mainstream garbage that's been shoved down our throats.  Kubrick allows the audience to embark on these characters' weirdly fascinating journeys through this murky atmosphere in New York City. This is not a sex film, like people so rudely judged it as.  Yes, it is quite rife with nudity, but it's all tastefully done, like something out of a Da Vinci painting.  Yes, it has some erotically charged moments, but never for tawdry purposes.  <br/><br/>Kubrick helps create this atmosphere via creative lighting, and the score is absolutely brilliant ranging from symphonies that help capture the darkly comic moments to the striking piano chords that accentuate the eerie moments.  Kubrick is a master at creating hypnotic visions that suck viewers in and keep them watching with anticipation.  Viewing this movie for a second time, I was able to spot some flaws, but they're all superficial and very minor.  First of all, Kubrick shot the movie in England.  The story is set in New York.  He does his best to make it look a lot like New York and sometimes succeeds, but at other times fails.  In some scenes, Cruise is walking around at night, and you can see that the streets are clean and polished, and same with the sidewalks.  Anybody who's been to New York at night, or lived there, can spot the inaccuracy.  Those streets would've been filthy, crawling with rats and you would probably see more gangs and drug dealers in the background, whereas Cruise is often walking all-alone--unless a new supporting character is introduced.  Also, some of the very minor characters (Ex.: The Waitress) are obviously hiding their English accents and doing a poor job.  I also felt some of the dialogue scenes could've been cut a tad shorter, and would've been more effective with visual aid.  For example, in the scene where Nicole Kidman describes the bad dream she just had, it would've been nice if we actually saw a dream sequence with her voice-over.<br/><br/>Then again, the dialogue is one of the film's strong points.  About the only films that I feel strongly capture the way REAL people talk are this one and ""sex, lies and videotape.""  In the scene where Cruise and Kidman are getting high, and Kidman reveals her dirty secret, they don't articulate what they're saying and seem to ramble on at points.  Because that's what people do when they're high!  And just like Soderbergh's masterpiece, the dialogue isn't literal, and you can tell what one of the characters is really trying to express through facial expressions, body language, etc.  This is another one of those movies that shows people don't always say what they're really thinking, and it's evident when that occurs.  <br/><br/>Through this surreal journey, we're faced with many offbeat characters. This sets the film's different tones of black comedy (the incident in the costume shop), drama (the mysterious hooker) and Hitchcockian suspense (the orgy scene).  Best of all, Kubrick leaves an area of mystery in each scene, allowing different interpretations from different minds.  You don't always FIND OUT why the conflicts arise in this movie!  And that's the beauty.  It leaves you thinking and gives your imagination something to do.  The whole movie has this haunting, mystical aura that just draws you in from beginning to end.  Yes, it's 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but I hardly realized the running time being that I was so wrapped up.  Never once does it fall flat, never once is it boring, never once does the intrigue fade out. <br/><br/>
Although, I fell in love with this movie the first time around, I think others might need to watch it a second time and looks beyond the surface. As I said before, this is not a sex film!  This is a movie about lust, deception, temptation, jealousy and every other emotion that would arise from Cruise's character in this situation.  He has just learned about his wife's past sexual affair, and some think that it was a little far-fetched how Cruise reacted in that situation, but I think relationships can be flaming with jealousy--whether they're overreacting or not, it just happens. People lose control of their emotions, and just like Cruise they get plagued by monstrous visions.  In his case, he kept seeing her in bed with the guy from the Navy.  Why he chooses to embark on this unpredictable sexual journey is not exactly expressed on screen.  Once again leaving the audience free to think what his motives might be.  It can be jealousy, it can be something else.  You never know.  Not every situation is entirely realistic, but they weren't meant to be.  This was meant to play like a dream/nightmare that Cruise goes through, roaming the streets of NY at night and bumping into suspicious characters left and right, sometimes putting himself in danger.  Meanwhile, visions of his wife with another man continue to haunt him.<br/><br/>I'm almost sure that Kubrick fans will appraise this virtual masterpiece. His perfectionism really shows in every scene of this movie.  And it pays off great.  Steven Spielberg said, ""What's great about Kubrick's films is they're never the same.  All his movies have something different to offer."" So is the case with ""Eyes Wide Shut.""  It's like nothing you've ever seen, even through Kubrick's eyes.  His legacy will always be remembered, and so will this as a successful final chapter in a great filmmaker's life.<br/><br/>My score:  9 (out of 10)"
"jboothmillard","4","2","11","14 July 2005"," Eyes Wide Shut
","This was director Stanley Kubrick's last film before his death, and unfortunately, it is not one of his best. Basically, Tom Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford and Nicole Kidman plays his wife, Alice. They are a troubled couple that do not have a lot of passion in themselves. One night Alice tells Bill she is going to bed, and he takes this opportunity to have a night to himself. In this night, he almost has sex with a prostitute, and then he buys a mask, black cloak with hood and tuxedo to go to a large house of (invited) men and women (wearing masks) shagging all over. Those are pretty much the highlights for this almost confusing and not very exciting film. Also starring Sydney Pollack as Victor Ziegler, Marie Richardson as Marion Nathanson, Rade Serbedzija as Milich, Todd Field as Nick Nightingale, Vinessa Shaw as Domino, GoldenEye's Alan Cumming as Desk clerk and Leelee Sobieski as Milich's daughter. The two biggest problems I have are there is not a lot of explanation for certain things, and every moment was too slow, dragging the film on. The critics say it is a must see, but I'll let other people decide that, I personally wouldn't recommend it as a Kubrick masterpiece. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Jocelyn Pook, and it won the Venice Film Festival Filmcritica ""Bastone Bianco"" Award for Kubrick. Nicole Kidman was number 21, and Tom Cruise number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Cruise was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Okay!"
"mjhalta","1","2","12","21 July 2006"," Not even a good porn flick
","Stanley Kubrick must not have gotten out much. If this movie was meant to somehow shock us then obviously some of us have never rented a porn flick or gone to a strip joint or had someone do a lap dance for us. The only people who would find this movie shocking or perhaps at least interesting are living in some old folks home, having been born in the 1800's. What I don't understand is how Tom Cruise would get mixed up with this loser. Maybe he was anticipating his coming divorce and wanted to stock up on money for the settlement. After such an outstanding career it's a shame that this Dud will be remembered as Kubrick's last movie. People should get better at their craft not reach rock bottom with their last effort."
"harryplinkett14","1","1","4","22 August 2018"," Disappointing
","When you promise so much to the audience in the first half of the film, and you deliver absolutely nothing, it's a crime. Then again, I hear more than 20 minutes were cut out by the studio, so we will never know what the film was supposed to look like.
But as it is, it's utterly empty. It appears to be deliberately confusing, and not in a way that stimulates people to reflect over what's going on. Is it about genuine Satanic elites and their rituals? Is it more metaphorical? Is it all a dream? Why is it so focused on sex? Frankly, I don't care.
Now, I like the tone of the film, I like its style, and I like the acting. But I am not too impressed with direction. Some of these scenes really could have been directed a lot better. Has Kubrick never watched Hitchcock?
All in all, I enjoyed watching the film. Watching it is a good experience. But when you reach the end, you are just disappointed. And that really pisses me off."
"sowvendra","10","1","4","18 September 2016"," A beautiful, understated, gem of a film
","Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw in ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Stanley Kubrick takes the stars out of Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise and makes them any ordinary, self-searching people. Kidman of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was certainly not the Satine of ""Moulin Rouge"" or any star character of any of her other films. Tom Cruise was not the Tom Cruise we are so used to seeing: Maverick, Ethan Hunt and all. Both Cruise and Kidman were both disrobed and demystified in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" that I felt sorry for them. They are vulnerable, they cry, and they are absolutely not the stars or heroes we are used to seeing.<br/><br/>As a film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" works excellently. Though it has been billed as an erotic thriller, it is also a study into human relationships, especially between married couples. There is a line in the film: ""Don't you think one of the charms of marriage is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties?"" This line was spoken in a flirtatious way at a party, but this line seems to be the message the entire film seems to be built upon. In a married couple, who shows the most honesty, the husband or the wife? Alice and Dr. Bill Harford (played by Kidman and Cruise) are a well-to-do New York City couple. Bill is a general practitioner, while Alice used to be a manager at an art gallery who is now a housewife looking after Helena, their only daughter, aged 7. In a cannabis-fuelled haze, Alice reveals that she had wanted to be unfaithful to Bill once, though she hadn't. Bill is unable to stand this revelation, though he doesn't show it, and roams the streets of New York City that night watching apparently committed people turning to adultery, morals (depending upon how one defines ""morals"") being disregarded, and, the highlight of his introspective adventure, gatecrashes a secret party where orgies are being held and that nearly endangers his life.<br/><br/>After a lot of revelations and catharsis, the film ends well. But it leaves behind a number of questions, the biggest one being: Who between a husband and a wife is the most honest? We see Alice being honest to her husband, but Bill - because of several issues, including the doctor-patient relationship of secrecy - cannot be that honest with his wife even if he wished to. So was it right for Bill to get so upset about something that Alice said she had wanted to do but she, ultimately, didn't? Was it right for Alice to tell her husband something that she didn't do? Is it right for couples to discuss their fantasies involving other men and women? Or was that joint Alice and Bill rolled that was to be blamed? With a lot of self-searching questions, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is an amazing and beautifully understated thriller.<br/><br/>Also, check out the background score. There are a lot of classical music pieces. But what really caught my attention were the menacing piano solos that pop up all of a sudden at critical points. Also, piano - or, rather, a pianist - plays an important role in the plot. Hats off to Stanley Kubrick for giving us this gem of a film called ""Eyes Wide Shut"" just before he departed!"
"grandmastersik","4","1","4","15 September 2015"," Tom Cruise throws his money around in a big non-event
","Tom Cruise is so rich that he can give hookers $150 for nothing, and men who pimp out their daughters, $200 tips on fancy dress costume rentals.<br/><br/>Um, I think that was the plot - or maybe I missed something? For what feels like a very, very long time, Tom Cruise meanders around New York, angry about his wife saying she once thought about cheating on him, after she felt offended by him telling her that the only reason he didn't have a threesome with two super hot models is because it would have hurt her.<br/><br/>The advertisements at the time made this film out to be about some kind of cabal/swingers club, but the part with the masks is more like a side-note throwaway. A shame, since a decent thriller could have come from those events being the main plot. No, the film is actually about Tom Cruise strolling around, thinking about cheating on his wife... or has he already?<br/><br/>That will probably be the talking point amongst film buffs: the dying man's daughter confessed to being in love with him and he did seem to be very cosy with the residence and the maid... but, like I said, it's a point for fans to discuss, and being a Stanley Kubrik film, there are bound to be plenty.<br/><br/>The reason Kubrik has these fans is simple: the directing is top-notch. The opening one-shot scene is brilliant in its nonchalance and Tom Cruise really does shine as an actor - not just that average, albeit good-looking bloke from Risky Business who, somehow, became cinema's equivalent to Elvis.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the same praise cannot be given to Kidman. Yes, awful dialogue can be partly to blame (though, in some parts the dialogue is very natural), but she just came across as stupid and annoying, and really not the kind of woman I could imagine Tom Cruise's Dr. Hartford ever having married.<br/><br/>The final verdict: an okay film in terms of idle entertainment, but don't waste your time looking for hidden depth.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you ever meet Tom Cruise, don't ask for his autograph - ask for a couple of hundred dollars."

Theere is nothing great about this movie, may be just showing the insecurities about the people, but could n't it be shown in an interesting manner. There is no humour even in the movie. What a bore. The only thing I liked about the movie was the piano background theme. One thing which I have noticed after watching several Kubrick films (due to compulsion) is that he just takes you to a position where you will expect something is about to come but then leaving you at that point without any further revelation.

It's likely Kubrick's attempt to reveal a pervasive, insidious modern phenomenon known as Gangstalking(I call it the modern inquisition. You can call it 'The Guilt Game', if you like)<br/><br/>Watch it again and take note of the facial expressions of seeming 'bit players', like the hotel attendant and the diner waitress(and Bill suspected EVERYONE...eventually, including his wife).<br/><br/>The hooker didn't have AIDS. Her room mate told Bill that to chip away at his sanity, and to further emasculate him, which is why she rubbed up against him to begin with - to get his 'fires' started.(The sexiest scene in the film for my money...which is saying something, since they were both fully clothed)<br/><br/>Hooker 1 couldn't reveal that she didn't have sex with Bill to her masters, for fear of displeasing them(the explanatory scene was probably ALSO cut from the film). As far as all the other 'players' were concerned, they had sex...so the 'game' was still on. But Bill's suspicions were raised because learning of her AIDS diagnosis was essentially irrelevant to him, since he didn't have sex with her, which the room-mate should've known.<br/><br/>Remember the newspaper Bill picks up late at night? What does it say? What are the odds that Bill would pick up that newspaper at that time and read that headline?<br/><br/>The reason the movie doesn't make sense is because it was de-sense-itized.<br/><br/>'The Cabin In The Woods'(the start at least) is another example of this 'game', and how it might work.<br/><br/>Know Thy Self, or place your destiny in other people's hands!

","Stanley Kubrick made some great movies in his day---but this is not one of them. Simply put, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" meanders all over the place and the director himself never seems to know exactly what kind of film he's making. Is it a murder mystery? Is it an exploitative shocker? Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the two totally baffled leads in this clunker, never really grasp any tangible idea that's being presented and act like they don't know if they're coming or going. Kubrick, being the iron-fisted controlling director that he was, completely stifles the couple and it shows. Both of them give the appearance that they'd rather be anywhere else but on the set. Ms. Kidman is only on-screen about half the time compared to her soon-to-be ex-husband Cruise. She's the lucky one. Cruise's character (a Manhattan doctor) is vapid, indecisive, confused and disillusioned---and that's just from him reading Kubrick's script. Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh were enlightened enough to have jumped out of appearing in this movie before the first morning rushes. Instead, Sydney Pollack does his best with the weak writing and nonsensical story as does poor Leelee Sobieski. As for the movie itself, the sex scenes fall flat as a pancake, the plot is irrelevant, and the actors look like they all want to hang themselves. Luckily for the public-at-large, only a few of them went to see this bomb. It's a shame because Kubrick was one of the great directors of his day. At least one can always rent ""Lolita,"" or ""Dr. Strangelove,"" or ""Paths of Glory,"" etc. All of those films are far superior in every way than this woeful concoction. The only thing you can ask yourself if you happen to sit through this abomination is ""What was Stanley thinking?"" There is no answer. According to many sources, Kubrick himself was very disappointed that this movie was a dud and that he wasted fifteen months of his life making it. He wasn't the only one. The studio wasn't happy either. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was also a box-office failure."

But the movie lacks a couple if critical elements. The first being good acting.<br/><br/>Cruise has never been one of my favorites. There are only a few movies where I would praise his acting. Kidman is more of the opposite, mostly good acting with only a few stinker performances. This movie seemed to be on the bad acting scale for both of them. They looked uninspired and going-through-the-motions for most of the movie. Their scenes where they are upset or crying were completely unbelievable.<br/><br/>Another part of the movie that bothers me is the score. The gloomy score that repeats throughout the movie sounds like a more redundant rip-off of the Halloween score. And it is used way too much during the movie. The first few times it does a good job at setting the tone, but after that it's just repetitive and distracting.<br/><br/>In the whole, it is potentially a great movie that is undermined by a number of flaws (only two are mentioned here).

When he gets involved with a sketchy sexual cult of some sort, he realizes that he is way over his head and must find the effort to go back to his loving wife and try to patch things up, or to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.<br/><br/>Being that I'm not a big fan of either Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman, I'm not totally surprised that I didn't like this film.

I love thrillers, but for a thriller, this film doesn't work too well at establishing any sort of immediate danger. There are moments of threatening toward a separate character, but all the danger takes place off screen.<br/><br/>I did, however, love the production design and the musical score. These are aspects of film that Kubrick has always been able to master, however, and it shouldn't really come as a surprise. It just concerns the film as to whether all this beauty was right for this kind of film. Personally, I would have rather had the film not have so much beauty since this is a rather dark and ugly story the film is telling. It just feels out of place.<br/><br/>Overall, despite it being a disappointment for myself, I'd still recommend the film to fans of his, or to fans of sexual thrillers.

","Stanley Kubrick is the type of director that is beloved by many, and his films have earned a high place in cinematic history ('Dr. Strangelove, '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Full Metal Jacket'). He is a director who creates and creates, which is interesting, because most of his films are based on published pieces of literature. He has gone from genres such as crime ('Killer's Kiss', 'The Killing') to war ('Paths of Glory', 'Full Metal Jacket') to satire ('Dr. Strangelove', 'Barry Lyndon), and even more. He envokes a rare visual beauty within his films, and he creates perfection in every frame. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is no exception.<br/><br/>Here we have such mainstream actors as Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, Alan Cumming, and even Leelee Sobieski. But Kubrick doesn't fail them, and they don't fail Kubrick. Each actor listed, and more (Todd Field, Vanessa Shaw) give powerful performances. Tom Cruise, who many slam for being such a mainstream actors, proves his ability to act here. Nicole Kidman, who also is a mainstream actress, though more praised in the film world, also gives a genuine performance. We have caricatures here: the wealthy and kind doctor (Tom Cruise), the attractive wife (Nicole Kidman), the wealthy and corrupt friend (Sydney Pollack), and the hooker with a heart of gold (Vanessa Shaw). These people feel real. They're dialogue is not especially extremely quote- able, but they sound like human beings, saying stupid things or not. The film is calculated, no doubt, but in a way that gives us what is intended. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is Dr. Bill Harford, who resorts to his profession as a doctor and his kindness as an escape, while walking around New York at night after his wife's stoned confession about near- infidelity. He is jealous, even though he says he's not ""the jealous type"". He lies to her, but she saves him nonetheless. Through his experiences, he understands more and more about things he didn't want to know about. Is Tom Cruise good? No doubt. Even though I prefer him in his other 1999 feature, 'Magnolia', he still gives a good performance as the kind- hearted but somewhat ignorant doctor. You can feel his anguish, and his confusion. Life was going perfect for him, he had a good time with his rich friend, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), and he came home fine. He is thrown awry by the confession of his wife (Nicole Kidman), because he lives in the notion that she would never lie to him, and he would never lie to her. She quips to him, ""You are AWFULLY sure of yourself!"" and he replies with ""No! I'm sure of you!"". She proceeds into a laughing fit then proceeds to tell him about her near infidelity. Nicole Kidman, an actress I feel that seems to lack a passion for performing, uses her cold air here perfectly. On the surface, she is a kind, gentle, loving woman but underneath she is filled with angst. Sydney Pollack as Victor Ziegler gives the audience the best performance of the film. He is commanding, he is greedy and selfish, but he gets what he wants. In one scene by a pool table, he talks to Bill about an incident both were involved in, and you can feel the corruption. The supporting cast does the job as well. Todd Field plays Nick, a pianist who helps Bill when he shouldn't, and a somewhat sleazy character. Vanessa Shaw is sexy as the prostitute, and she plays it correctly. And last, but not least, Alan Cumming is hysterical as the gay receptionist who helps Bill with some information about Nick. In some cases, the lead actors in Kubrick's films over- shadow the rest of the cast (see 'A Clockwork Orange'), but here he manages to balance everyone out. And it works.<br/><br/>Say what you will about the slow pacing of Kubrick's film, but he has a fantastic visual eye. The cinematography by Larry Smith is fantastic, giving the film a dream like quality. The colors are lush and poetic, and give the film the perfect tone. The haunting musical score by Jocelyn Cook is also fantastic, especially the chilling simple- noted piano music. The film editing by Nigel Galt gives the film the right pace, making it not too fast paced, but not too slow either. There is no awkward editing, the film feels smooth and just right. <br/><br/>While I've always thought Kubrick is more talented at directing than he he is at writing, his and Frederic Raphael's screenplay is excellent. The dialog, while it may at times sound contrived and even silly, is perfect because the characters feel genuine. Bill is kind- hearted, but not ready for the tough part of the world. Alice is honest, but loves her husband and child. Victor is greedy and morally shakey, but he is an effective man who gets what he wants out of life and has no remorse. The story is an interesting one, and it is an important examination of sex in people's lives. Detractors who say the film is ""about nothing but sex"" are missing the point completely. It is about human interaction, which at times, is sex, but also about themes such as love, friendship, trust, honesty, and more.<br/><br/>And boy, is Kubrick a talented director. He brings everything together, he has directed the actors perfectly and has woven a masterful tale. The orgy scene is one of the most brilliant and visually stunning films in cinematic history, as well as one of the most bizarre. The momentum of the film builds up, and never lets down as characters have unexpected confrontations. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is dramatic, but not overly dramatic, and emphasis is put in exactly the right places. <br/><br/>'Eyes Wide Shut' opened in the summer of 1999, amongst many detractors. Not only was it seen by Stanley Kubrick fans, but also fans of mainstream stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. For me, it is the masters's best work, and a representation of the brillaince of cinema. It is quite possibly, the greatest film ever made. So turn off your expectations, and ignore the terrible reviews, and watch 'Eyes Wide Shut'. You won't forget it."

","I admit that Mr Cruise is not my favourite screen star by any means, and this is the only film of his I forced myself to sit through to the end, mainly because of the fact it was Stanley Kubrick's final film.<br/><br/>Using a celebrity couple to play the leads doesn't work at all, and the soon-to-split Cruise and Kidman have no chemistry whatsoever in what is trying desperately to be a daring, racy plot.  Trouble is, it is neither. The best bit was probably the orgy scene and that reminded me of something from The Story of O anyway (where it would have been done much better).<br/><br/>A huge disappointment, Eyes Wide Shut meanders all over its three hour running time and goes nowhere.

","Fans of the movie need not read this review. It's not for you. In fact, it's not for anybody who has already seen Eyes Wide Shut, whether you liked it or not.<br/><br/>I've reviewed hundreds of movies, and this is the very first time I've written a review of a movie I haven't seen. Here's why I'm writing it anyway: There may be others out there who, like me, still have not seen Eyes Wide Shut, more than 16 years after its release. They (again, like me) may be huge movie fans, even huge fans of Kubrick's earlier movies, but for some reason this particular Kubrick movie hasn't drawn them yet.<br/><br/>They may feel sometimes (like me again) that they OUGHT to see it, but for some reason they just haven't. If you're in that state, hearing my reasons may help you decide to see it, or it may help you reconcile yourself to never seeing it. This review is for you and you alone.<br/><br/>I've read a LOT about this movie, about the circumstances under which it was made, the challenges Kubrick and others faced in making it, its unique position in the history of making and distributing movies. I've read dozens of reviews of the movie, by professional critics whom I respect enormously (and some I don't) and by amateurs like us here at Amazon, IMDb, Netflix, etc. I've seen many clips from the movie, official trailers as well as pirated clips posted online, including some that are hailed as the very best scenes in it by most fans of the movie.<br/><br/>The thing is, not once in all that time have I ever read or seen anything that made me want to see the movie. Not for one second did I see a clip that made me want to see more, read anything that made me want to experience it directly instead of second-hand. There just is not anything about it that appeals to me. Nothing.<br/><br/>Nearly every movie I see I see because a trailer, or a clip from the movie, or a comment I read somewhere stirred up something in me that wanted more. Often the full movie turns out to be disappointing or even unwatchable, but I have found a few real jewels that way. But nothing has ever caused me to want to see this one even slightly. I WANT to want to see it, but I just don't.<br/><br/>Since it's unlikely that anything new will be discovered in this movie now, anything that would light even a tiny spark of interest in me, I just need to accept the fact that I don't want to see Eyes Wide Shut, and I most likely never will, and that's okay.<br/><br/>So I'm giving this movie one star because it hasn't even succeeded in making me want to see it, which is about the biggest failure a movie can have."

","Not much happens in Eyes Wide Shut, yet somehow the movie kept my attention. It's weirdly interesting, but not necessarily good. Because of that, it seems much shorter than its almost three-hour length.<br/><br/>While Nicole Kidman got better reviews than husband Tom Cruise, they really gave basically the same performance, which is mainly comprised of talking really slowly. I give no credit or blame to either of them for that, since it's clearly what Kubrick wanted.<br/><br/>But that's Kubrick for you. He knew what he wanted, he got what he wanted, and then the audience liked it or didn't. He was an uncompromising visionary, and while I would have liked his final movie to be something I actually enjoyed, I do admire his lack of compromise.<br/><br/>Still, for me the most entertaining moment of the movie was when Cruise groped Kidman and my girlfriend whispered (""probably the first time that's ever happened."")"

Worst of all, there is no dramatic buildup - it drags the viewer to a head-scratching anticlimax that makes you want to scream, I sat there for well over two hours, and then it simply ends? As for the supposedly controversial sexuality, it feels more like you've been groped by a blue-gloved TSA agent.

"Red_Identity","Null","1","5","11 June 2011"," Stanley Kubrick creates a film that still stands out among his filmography... A Masterpiece
","1...2...3... Eyes Wide Shut! I always like to review films as soon as possible because I like to have a review that has been written right out of emotion after a film ends. It is only after time passes that I will see how my initial thoughts on it has changed or not. I don't even think that this will be put in effect here, simply because I doubt there will be much change in how I feel about this film as time passes by.<br/><br/>Kubrick is known for succeeding in creating films in different genres. Yet, one can still see his signature in all of his films. That is also present here, especially in the opening 20 minutes. Yet, it also stands- out quite apart from the rest of his films I have seen. It never once left me feel unattached. It never lingered for me, it never became dull at one moment. <br/><br/>First off, the acting. The only time I have seen a great performance by Cruise was in Magnolia (also the same year as this). I wouldn't call him a great actor because of one great performance though. This role demanded something different... and he was solid. It was not a great performance by any means, but he did well enough. Yet I can't help but think that maybe a better actor would have been more than capable of turning in a better performance. Cruise is out-staged by Nicole Kidman, who does have a lot of great performances under her belt, this being no exception. In fact, compared to her work in The Hours, The Others, and even Dogville, this performance might still be her finest yet. <br/><br/>I don't like putting out sections of films apart, and I won't do that except for the section in the middle of the film that is perhaps some of the finest filmmaking I have seen. It is an eerie, moody, sort of horrifying and suspenseful sequence that reminded me a lot of David lynch. It's truly captivating and absorbing filmmaking, and even Kubrick should be proud of that. <br/><br/>I am surprised to say that this is also a very ambiguous film, perhaps even his most ambiguous (yeah, I know, how is that possible when 2001 still exists). I think I can safely say that this is Kubrick's 3rd masterpiece (out of 6 Kubrick films seen, impressive!). I also recommend it to fans of Lynch (who is probably my other favorite director)."

","One gets the impression that the detractors of this movie outnumber the admirers but I suspect that, if it's true, it's because the movie was directed by THE Stanley Kubrick. It's hard to top a string of hits, some of them near masterpieces. If it had been directed by some nonentity who had just graduated from film school it would have been hailed as a momentous debut.<br/><br/>The plot. Doctor Tom Cruise is married to Nicole Kidman and they live on Central Park West in New York. After a party they get stoned and Kidman confesses that on their vacation last year, she noticed a naval officer and couldn't get him out of her mind, not even when she and Cruise were making love and developing plans for their life together. She'd have given up her future to be with this other man just for one night.<br/><br/>Now these are ugly words for a husband to hear. He winds up walking the night-time streets, brooding about his wife and doubting his own grasp of things in general. He runs into a pal, a pianist, who quietly tells him that he's going to play the piano blindfolded at a secret party at a mansion. Everyone wears costumes. And he lets slip the password. He leaves, warning Cruise to forget everything he just heard.<br/><br/>But Cruise is still tortured by Kidman's confession, rents a costume and mask, and attends the party. He's discovered as persona non grata and, surrounded by a hundred weirdos in dark costumes and garish masks, he's told to take off all his clothes.<br/><br/>To make a long story short, he is ""redeemed"" -- ie., saved -- by a nude woman and he's allowed to leave. The next day Cruise learns that his pianist friend was hustled out of his hotel with a black eye by a couple of well-spoken hoods. And the woman who apparently volunteered to substitute her life for his is found dead of an overdose. Is it all coincidental? Cruise tells Kidman all about his overnight adventure and the two of them agree to believe that it was simply one of those things.<br/><br/>It's slow. Mighty slow. Nobody speaks quickly. There are long pauses between utterances while one of the conversants stands open mouthed with expectation. The plot is wispy and filled with adventitious encounters. In all these respects, and more, it's a lot different from Kubrick's earlier stuff that, by comparison, seemed to rocket along propelled by the plots. But it's an obvious culmination of certain trends in Kubrick's later work, which is to say everything after ""Paths of Glory"" -- the episodic structure, the looseness of consequence, the introspection.<br/><br/>There are, though, some interesting innovations. Kubrick had developed a habit of high key lighting. Everything was a fluorescent white in his late work, maybe with accents of color here and there, mostly apple red. There's unyielding light everywhere, as in a hospital operating room. In ""2001"" even the floors were translucent and lighted from below. He's reversed himself here, and it works too. It's Christmas time in New York. The streets are decorated with colored lights and interiors often have Christmas trees. The overall tone of the lighting is rosy and golden and warm all over, an ironic contrast to the disturbing goings on we witness.<br/><br/>And there is more comedy that we might expect. There's an encounter with an odd hotel clerk, Alan Cumming, that is right out of the Enchanted Hunters scene in ""Lolita"" (both novel and film). And another ludic moment in the shop of a Jewish costumier who discovers his daughter, Leelee Sobieski, in flagrant dilecto with two Japanese transvestites, beats them up and locks them away for the police. When Cruise returns the costume the next day, the two Oriental gentleman emerge with Sobieski from a back room, happy as clams, and it becomes clear that the shop owner is pimping his own daughter.<br/><br/>Before I run out of space -- and, believe me, this multi-layered effort deserves plenty of space -- I'll add a few asides. The piano theme that dominates the last half of the film is by a Hungarian madman, well, oddity actually, Ligeti, who built that ominous score almost entirely out of only two notes on the keyboard. It's an astonishing feat. Tom Cruise is something of an embarrassment as an actor, at least for me. I'm sure he's a nice guy and gives it everything he's got but I'm always aware that I'm watching some guy from New Jersey trying desperately to enact a role. It can't be the dialog, as elliptical as it sometimes gets, because Nicole Kidman is saddled with the same kinds of lines and she handles them smoothly. (By the way, she sports an exceedingly nubile figure in her skivvies. She's a lot sexier than the naked hookers at the party.) And it's not surprising that she's married to a doctor and lusts after an officer in the Navy. One projects immense wealth and the other power."

","What a momentus year 1999 was, George Lucas returned with one of three Star Wars prequels after a twenty year absence in cinema as did Terrence Mallick with his compelling tale of war The Thin Red Line, David Fincher produced the most controversial film of the 90's with Fight Club and legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick tragically passed away. With Stanley Kubricks final film, Eyes Wide Shut, he weaves an intricate tale of lies, deceit, envy, paranoia and sexuality. Eyes Wide Shut is undoubtedly Kubricks darkest and most confronting film not because it's subject matter is exploited, but the fact that such common sexual urges and tendencies can be led to morbid outcomes of the highest caliper, in addition to that Eyes Wide Shut can also be perceived as a pretext to Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's ambiguous marital relations. A structured tale of sexual proclivities expressed from the introspective of cinemas most influential filmmaker."
"fullonrobotchubby","4","1","5","15 August 2006"," A Journey to Nowhere for Nothing
","Stanley Kubrick was a genius director. There, now that you can't get me wrong, Eyes Wide Shut is quite a bloated piece of work. A married couple attends a party, leaves the party, shares a doobie, and question each other's faithfulness. After the wife (Nicole Kidman) reveals a close call of cheating and before the discussion can end, William Harford (Tom Cruise), a doctor, receives a late call to duty and must abandon his wife for the night, shaking off his high. Once the doctor leaves his home (with visions of a cheating wife in his head), he unintentionally winds up embarking on an adventure of sexcapades full of mystery, discovery, and oddities. My favorite scene is the first unexpected turn of Harford's journey (if you ask me) when a newly grieving widow makes a move on the young doc. Perhaps the problem was Kubrick was not alive to properly explain the film enough to reach critics and audiences alike, but something is missing in the final installment for the Kubrick Kollektor. For this critic, I'm not sure any explaining could save it; the film as a whole comes off as a pathetic showcase for the aging Cruise's fading acting talents. Cruise's deteriorating sanity these days probably could have been stopped if we had realized that Eyes Wide Shut and Vanilla Sky were the disguised cries for help they seem to be now (That was a joke... sort of.)."
"maury_markowitz","4","1","5","28 March 2006"," Visually interesting, but little else to recommend it.
","Kubrick seems to have had a habit of vacillating between movies that are primarily visual and plot driven, and ones that are word-heavy. Sparticus was followed by Lolita, 2001 by A Clockwork Orange. Eyes wide shut falls into the later category, and frankly, Kubrick's never been very good at it.<br/><br/>The entire movie is based on a simple premise; the male lead is astonished to learn that his wife has (unfullfilled) sexual fantasies involving other men. This leads to an escalating series of events that fills the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The problem is that we're supposed to believe that this admission would actually be surprising to anyone. Is there any man that is not aware of this fact? I can see this being a plot of a movie from the 1960s perhaps, but today it simply feels outdated, maybe even misogynist. An actual affair sparking things off might be believable, but he's upset because she _looks_ at other men? Come on! It just doesn't ring true. The plot feels completely artificial.<br/><br/>To add to the problems, the movie is heavily based on dialog, and it is here that Kubrick always seems to fall flat. The dialog is filled with pregnant pauses and flat dialog, one assumes deliberately, that simply add to the overall artificiality of the plot. People simply don't talk like they do when Kubrick directs them, and I found it sad to see two otherwise fine actors (yes, Cruise is a fine actor) reduced to a series of bland, empty statements. There was nothing remotely like emotion coming out of either one. Nothing could put this into better contrast than the final line of dialog, which Kidman delivers in an astonishingly unconvincing manner.<br/><br/>On the good side, Kubrick's visual taste remains as good as ever. The motion is slow, but this is deliberate, and works well. It would have worked much better had the movie been 120 minutes, instead of 159. Once again it seems Kubrick couldn't resist the siren-call of introducing bit characters, filling up some time and then instantly cutting them adrift.<br/><br/>I have to say that overall the movie isn't _that_ bad. Faint praise indeed, I know. But simply put, if not for Kubrick's earlier body of work, and well-timed death, this movie would have disappeared without a trace."

This is not a movie that you can casually watch for an evening of light enjoyment.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you trust the director, and commit to watch the whole movie, overall it is a fine film with a rewarding story.

For a final time, Kubrick forces his characters into such polarized roles to prove a point, they cease to be characters. 99.9% of women would not react to Cruise's revelation as Kidman does. No woman would desperately want to bang you shortly after you told them of your attempted infidelity. There'd be a long healing phase, if the divorce papers aren't delivered! The fact she thinks sex will solve their problems shows either the character's and/or the director's immaturity. Either way, why should we care?

","The marital intimacy and sexual fantasies of a couple with 9 years of marriage is the theme chosen for analysis in Stanley Kubrick's posthumous film, ""Eyes Wide Shut""
A movie that, like the rest of the director's works, is also a highly made film and that took more than 2 years of production, with pristine setting, decoration, music and cinematography, set in NYC, but filmed in London.
The insinuation, the flirting, the jealousy and the desire, are integral parts of this dream, nightmare or trip towards the unimaginable, and that necessarily lead to a catharsis, where the reflections of their behaviors and actions return them towards a revaluation of their life as a couple.
The vigorous and revealing sequence within the bedroom sets the tone between harmony and chaos, between reality and fantasy.
Born in Manhattan, Kubrick was an innovator, passionate about film techniques, and a perfectionist in every way.
Although he only made 13 feature films throughout his life, his productions had an impact on society, are still current and continue to worry, to mention a few: Spartacus 1960, Lolita 1962, Dr. Strangelove 1964, 2001 A Space Odissey 1968, A Clockwork Orange 1971, The Shining 1980, Full Metal Jacket 1987. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a key film in the history of cinema, for Scorsese it is the 5th. best film of the 90's, for Kubrick himself, is his best work. A film that shows that with a great director, even Tom Cruise can achieve a good performance and not just pose. 4 days after showing the finished tape to Warner Bros executives, Kubrick dies.
Great performances by Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, starring as well: Sydney Pollack, Sky Dumont, Todd Field."

","The most important thing about this film is ""Society"" and ""City"" the film begins in the high-level part of the city where the doctor has a big house and goed to a luyand beautiful dance party, but as the film continues we go out of this beauty, first we go with the character to anonymous dark room in that party that has no connection with the other beautiful things in that house, in that room we see the dark side of the party and the dark side of the people in this party and beside that even before the room parts we see that the doctor and his wife has the potential of making sins and cheating each other
The first part of the film makes a good guide to the whole movie as we saw in the first part in the party the beautiful things are the things that we saw the first and after that we went deeper and saw the darkness and dark parts, the whole movies is like that too, after seeing the doctor's beautiful shining House we go to another house, the girls house whom the doctor goes, a tiny little house in the very bad part of the city, and we saw that the house has a feeling of sin and darkness and and that is the complete opposite of what doctors house look like with a little girl and very shining furnitures and paintings and other stuff that is complete bright
But as the film goes on, we go underground to a caffe, and their we knew that they are also deeper and darker parts in that society and City
the doctor wants to go that dark parts and we the audience who are mostly living actually like the doctor in a not very very bad situation, we go to the darker and deeper parts with the doctor and that is where our and the doctors reactions are the same, both of us are petrified and terrified of what see in that big Castle out of the city made in the darkness.
Remember the scenes of the custom shop where where the second time actually was shocked from what we saw like the doctor because it's a fully horrible situation the human beings and morality has no import place in the society
so the film is about sins the society and the dark parts of the society what is not seenable in the very first part, but if you go deeper you will see the dark parts of the city, with all that the film also gives us a hope, hope of love that hope of trueness, because the doctor didn't make sin and didn't cheat on her wife and that good thing happened to save him, and that is the thing that will save us from this horrible situation: kindness, goodness, and love"

It's not just a simple plot, some things that happen during a strange night. Stanley Kubrick focuses on specific social messages (and some other messages too that maybe aren't so specific and have to be interpreted). My advice is that after you finish watching the movie, just sit and think about it. Try to pay attention to details. There are also some very helpful video on YouTube explaining the plot and some interesting material that you can read online.

","""Eyes Wide Shut"" has a polarized reputation: some say it's one of Kubrick's best movies, others say it's one of his worst. While there's much to like about ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" I have to agree that this isn't Kubrick at his finest. The movie is beautifully shot and thoughtfully addresses compelling themes of love, lust, and marriage. I love how Kubrick essentially recreated New York City in a London studio - the setting looks so real you believe it's genuine. The overall storyline is solid and the film's most infamous scenes in a certain upstate mansion are truly unsettling. The sex in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" isn't at all pornographic: it's cold, lifeless, detached. Kubrick shows that human relationships can often appear fulfilled when in reality there's no true love to be found, and the people in those relationships will pretend otherwise thinking it will make them happy. In other words, they keep their eyes ""wide shut.""<br/><br/>There's no doubt that Kubrick's direction is stellar and he, as always, uses the art of filmmaking to convey an important message about the human condition. But ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is also deeply flawed: there's a certain point halfway through the film where the story should clearly end, yet the movie continues aimlessly for another hour and a half. By the two hour mark ""Eyes Wide Shut"" almost becomes painful to watch due to its narrative emptiness and sluggish pace. Even in the first half the conversation scenes are extremely slow, and we only remain invested because of the movie's visual beauty and the committed performances from the central cast. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a strong final feature from Stanley Kubrick, but far from a masterpiece. 7/10."
"michaeltrivedi","9","0","2","2 October 2019"," Cinematic Perfection
","Eyes Wide Shut did not get great reviews. It was also shunned by audiences and reviewers alike for it's depiction of sex, and even became known as an erotic pornographic film. It was the last of Kubrick's film, and he died shortly afterwards, before it was released. I think Kubrick made the greatest film of all time.<br/><br/>First, let's get into the story. Bill Hartford is a doctor in New York. He and his wife transverse through the upper-class society, and is introduced to this life through Bill's employer. On one given night, Bill's wife mentions to him that she had fantasies a few years ago about leaving him for another man. Distraught, Bill heads over to a clients' home to check in on an old, sick man. And thus begins an unforgettable night that edges on crossing the boundaries of sex, but doesn't quite ever get there. It's a dreamlike night where Bill is constantly offered sexual interactions, but doesn't engage in them.<br/><br/>This movie portrays only one night. However, from Bill's attitudes and mannuerisms, it's pretty apparent that Bill has engaged in sex beyond his marriage. And yet, this one night seems to hold something special for the man. I am sure he's cheated on his wife before, and he'll probably do it again.<br/><br/>The movie is very slow, and at times creepy. And yet the plot is during Christmastime, and there is a jolly festive feeling you are getting. The walking along the New York streets in a trenchcoat is one of my favorite things about this movie. There is also a scene in a private mansion where a sex orgy is taking place among masked men who are basically the ruling class.<br/><br/>It's a very dark and creepy movie, and yet has all the feels of a family movie. There is really nothing learned in all of this, except that Bill should not cheat on his wife. The moral is that family is the most important thing in life.<br/><br/>I thought it was a fantastic film. I would highly recommend it.<br/><br/>10 Stars"

I have always enjoyed Eyes Wide Shut even though after my first and even second viewing I was left with an anti climatic feeling, however the film stays with you and you begin to think about it. Just like all his other works there is something that keeps you going back and discovering something else you did not notice before. His films change as you change with age, giving you new perspectives on not just the films subjects but also your own life. This film is immaculately directed and among the best films to be ever be lit, the constant use of Christmas lights in almost every scene gives the film a dreamy like feeling. I know that Kubrick was looking to change the medium of film again, and the lighting in this film certainly did that. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play their parts well, and like all Kubrick characters there is something off about them. The film like 2001 A Space Odyssey, and the Shining is very much left open to interpretation, Kubrick liked to make his films as ambiguous and allow the viewer to make up their own minds as to what they have just watched. I highly recommend this film, especially to film students. It is created by someone who has a lifetime of knowledge in the film industry and was known as a perfectionist. Thank you Stanly and everyone that was involved in the creation of this great piece of art."

","After completing Stanley Kubrick's last masterpiece I feel compelled to give some sort of explanation of what I had just witnessed after I partook of this mind blowing journey. First we follow a man named Bill (Tom Cruz), and from the very get go we quickly pick up on his inability to perform and throughout his journey his sexual escapades turn out to be one miss after another. His wife even mocks him at one point and tells him that he is blind and cant see the development of a sexual human (both male and female) has made over the course of millions of years of evolution. Bill is comfortable not knowing what he is capable of and when His Wife (Nicole Kidman) tells Bill that she could have had an affair with a military man in the past, and in fact in her mind did have the affair the disbelief was too much for Bill to handle. His Journey he made was one for self discovery and every person he encountered within a single night were all near misses for him. At one point a bully bumped into him and called Bill a name, reminding Bill of the wall that he lives behind and is too afraid to come out from behind. He finally reaches the highest level of depravity and witnesses complete sexual freedom and even at that level he is still unable to perform, he can only witness what everyone can become and he still has to sit on the sidelines. I can go on forever with the many twists that Kubrick captured and the reference to the Secret Organization with the Orgy scene is really a minute part of the story, the deeper underlay of the story is how sometimes it is easier on life just living simply without the knowing of what the world is really like, it can be frustrating not being able to reach that level of performance but at the same time it can be your savior, like not getting HIV from one of his near misses who found out the very next day that she was diagnosed with.

"iamyuno2","6","0","2","28 December 2013"," Disappointing And Over-Long But Some Good Elements
","An overblown movie that could have been much better if it had been much shorter and directed a bit better, the whole thing is an enigma. How did so many top name talents wind up putting out such a mediocre product? Even otherwise good actors put in less-than-average performances in this one, making you wonder what direction Stanley Kubrick gave them. In other words, did Nicole Kidman decide on her own to talk incredibly slowly to the point of poor acting and unbelievability or did Kubrick tell her to do so for some unfathomable reason? I suspect (since Kidman has done much better work in other films) that Kubrick was going for some weird stylistic twist that just did not work. Tom Cruise is also unusually stiff in many scenes. The pace is too slow, too, and the characters unsympathetic. It's hard to get into a movie where you disrespect the characters. That being said, there's a basic core story here that doesn't unfold until nearly the middle of the movie that becomes interesting and should have been the focus of this movie. (One wonders what impact this movie might have had had the middle scene not been censored - with monk-like shapes placed strategically over naked bodies.) Another thing: why Kubrick felt the need to make Kidman's character a poor example of a wife is curious and gratuitous. Another stylistic annoyance: the characters' constant repeating of whatever someone says to them is really grating; both Cruise's and Kidman's characters are made to do this. Much of this movie should have wound up on the editing floor. There are too many boring scenes - even when characters are absolutely naked. Speaking of which, Kubrick's showing of Kidman's bare butt in several early scenes is gratuitous and obvious - not having its intended effect because these scenes have no reason for being in the film (at least that I can understand). She's dressing - so what? How does that move the story along? (It doesn't.) Another big gripe: the final scene limps off lamely without any real character redemption or discoveries and then ends scatologically to shock - with a gratuitous comment that only trivializes this movie and makes you wonder what Kubrick and his writers were smoking. That being said, there was a kernel of a good movie here, but it was lost in an attempt on the one hand to make a bigger picture out of this tale than exists here and to shock on the other hand (and - PS to any Hollywood director who has not learned this yet: nudity, four-letter-words and sex do not shock anymore; they can, in fact, seem cliché - as they do here). You know, what made some of the movies of the '30s so great was their crackling dialog - fast-paced, ingenious. The slow dialog in this movie produces the opposite effect - dullness. Incredible especially if you realize how many scenes of naked people are in this movie. The lesson here is clear: nudity does not make a movie interesting. A dull story is a dull story, naked people or no. Very ironic: here, one of the most boring movies ever, has perhaps the most nudity and sexual content of any mainstream film of its time. Makes you yearn for a return to the old movie ethic of the '30s. One final question remains unanswered: what about their experience (as real husband and wife) in making this movie caused Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman to divorce shortly afterward? I have to feel it had something to do with what went on during the filming of this albatross."

But there was TOO MUCH of Tom Cruise. I wonder, Kubrick was in trouble, when he understood that this known actor cannot act at all. Well Kubrick has been taken maximum of Cruise, but still it could be better with actor who could achieve better results. <br/><br/>Cruise is as a person really self-centered man. And I could not see him care about this former beauty queen or about his family. <br/><br/>Same time beauty of scenes were wonderful, especially together with Kidman. Those casual day scenes, where you are sitting in toilet, sleeping, making love etc are beautiful and to waist time to show it in movies- that is wonderful art. <br/><br/>Someone wrote here, that he would like to punch Kidman to face for that cannabis-scene. This remark shows how well Kidman has done this scene under Kubrick hand. This scene was a instigation, pure one. And when I watched it, I felt bad and anxious, but same time I admired it. Wonderful work."

","On repeat viewing, this is my least favourite Kubrick film. I do not think his leads are up to the task. Cruise is simply okay, as he often is, but Kidman is really quite terrible. Kubrick has a tendency to let his characters overact which can work out well (George C. Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove"") or not so well (Patrick Magee in ""A Clockwork Orange). In Kidman's case, it's quite disastrous. 2 1/2 hours is far too long for such a slight story, and it seems to have been stretched out by slowing the dialogue to a deathly pace in most scenes. While the plot largely follows Schnitzler's novel, he has replaced the novel's conclusion with a puzzlingly arbitrary resolution that seems completely detached from the plot that precedes it."

"Jonathon_Natsis","8","0","1","21 April 2011"," The Last Temptation of Kubrick
","It seems nothing short of totally appropriate that the last film ever made by master director Stanley Kubrick (it's widely believed he died just four days after presenting Warner Brothers with the final cut) is unmistakeably Kubrickian in every way. To some this means drawn-out, tiresome scenes that serve little purpose, contributing to a final film far too steeped in 'fancy-pants' storytelling to ever appeal to the masses. But to others, it implies a deeply metaphorical and meaningful film abundant with visual clues, surreal scenarios and a climax deliberately lacking answers. <br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is a modern adaption of the 1926 novel Traumnovelle, and opens with a depiction of the well-to-do lifestyle led by Dr Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) as they attend an upper-class ball. During the night, each of them captures the interests of the opposite sex. In a fit of drug-induced anger and jealousy upon returning home, Alice admits to a fantasy she entertained involving a naval officer on a previous family holiday. And Bill, in a state of sheer disbelief, leaves the house and hits the streets of New York, unintentionally embarking on a sexually charged adventure of his own. <br/><br/>The acting cannot be faulted, but rather than being the highlight of the film, it simply serves to support the many themes on display. At the most basic level, this subversion of the erotic thriller has a lot to say about the craving for sex not as an expression of love, but an outlet for self-satisfaction in keeping with the primal instincts of this advanced race known as human beings. Personally, I prefer to assess the parallels drawn between this film and Homer's Odyssey, in which Bill, much like our ancient protagonist, acts as a positive energy against the crippling forces of hubris, jealousy and the need for revenge. This allows the film to work in a cautionary moral without sounding preachy or undermining the integrity of the subject matter. <br/><br/>It is the bizarre characters and scenarios that Bill encounters on his lone night(s) out that contribute to the film's message and the vast range of interpretations it has garnered. The series of events would not seem entirely out of place in a movie by the Coen brothers, but unlike the light heartedness of The Big Lebowski, or pure storytelling of True Grit, these scenes are inherently more sinister. Bill encounters, among others, a prostitute he opts against sleeping with (before finding out she tested positive to HIV), a costume shop owner who realises he can make an extra buck by whoring out his underage daughter, and a famous set piece involving an anonymous orgy in a labyrinth of a mansion, which plays a huge part in influencing Bill and the path his life may possibly follow.<br/><br/>Of course, each of the above scenes in some way reflect the different attitudes different people may have towards sex, and are far too obvious to be individually mentioned in this review. What they do so well, however, is compound the main character's mindset with more and more ferocity until, finally, he has an epiphany about the sacredness of fidelity.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, upon release in the summer of '99, the public accepted Eyes Wide Shut poorly, perhaps due to a misleading advertising campaign marketing the film as an action-packed, semi-noir thriller with nudity by the truckload. Okay, that last part might be true, but make no mistake: it is plentiful, but never glorified. In fact, because it is so prominent, the only eventual course of action for the cautious viewer is to accept it, and its significance in the story. <br/><br/>If by now you're still in two minds about this film, it is certainly not for everyone, particularly those who can't stand slow pacing. The film moves at a snail's pace with no exceptions, but patience is rewarded. As for the deeply metaphorical aspect, one needn't look any further than the title (one of the most unique in film history) to gain yet another perspective on this film. Which is a good thing, because if it were up to me, I'd have gone with The Sexy Adventures of Dr Bill.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

"sddavis63","7","0","1","2 April 2011"," It Doesn't Disappoint But It Does Frustrate
","Part of the Stanley Kubrick collection of movies (and, indeed, the last in the Kubrick collection) and starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (when they were themselves a happily married couple), ""Eyes Wide Shut"" doesn't disappoint, but it does frustrate a bit. It's an erotic thriller of sorts, and as such it manages to accomplish most of what you'd expect such a film to do. It IS erotic. It is very much about sex and sexuality and hidden desires and how they affect the relationships we have with those around us. There is a LOT of nudity in this - but somehow, the nudity didn't seem either gratuitous or exploitative. It was natural to this story; indeed, the story wouldn't have worked at all without the nudity. So the nudity involved (which featured a significant amount of Nicole Kidman) doesn't seem intended to titillate (although one can't really complain about a virtual parade of beautiful and often completely naked women) but rather it focuses the story and moves it along. As a thriller, it doesn't really thrill. It's more of a mystery - and it's a pretty good one there as well. There's really no strong sense of where this is going or of what the point of it is, aside from following Dr. Harford (Cruise) on his 24 hours or so of almost (but never quite) debauchery while his wife (Kidman) stays at home sleeping and looking after their daughter. In that sense it does manage to hold your attention very well. You want to know what this is about. What is this seemingly semi-pagan sex club that Harford stumbles upon; who are the people involved in it; are there going to be any repercussions for Harford and his family. In all those ways this is very good and very interesting. But ...<br/><br/>As good as it is in almost every way, in the end this movie frustrates because it never really answers anything. The mysteries are all left standing at the end. We never really do find out much about the ""club"" or the people in it, except that they're apparently powerful people who don't want to be known. Harford and his wife seem to put things back together in the end, but we don't really know if there are any lasting repercussions from the adventure of the preceding 24 hours. We don't really know. In the end, that left me feeling a little bit cheated. I wanted to know more about what had happened. I understand that the story had been about the struggles in the relationship of Harford and his wife more than about the ""adventure"" itself, but most of the movie was tied up with the adventure. Something in the end seemed missing from this.<br/><br/>It's a good movie. Good story; good directing; good performances. I have no arguments about any of that. In the end, though, it just left me unsatisfied. (7/10)"
"jzappa","8","0","1","12 October 2010"," When You Look in the Mirror, Do You See Yourself as You Really Are or Only Your Appearance?
","Viewed by some as a psychosexual thriller, some as a bitter comedy about how Tom Cruise falls short of getting laid, this is most likely neither, a cerebral film that works on various planes, imaginary, physical, transcendental and everything that falls in between. A hypnotic, thematically perceptive, sumptuously atmospheric, merely every so often bothersome piece, an intensely challenging consideration of the limits of faith, certainty and shared understanding possible between man and woman, Cruise's scenes with Nicole Kidman provide an intimacy hitherto absent from Kubrick's work. From the mirror love scene, played with a carnal sweetness rare for the screen, to the vulnerability and apprehension of their ultimate talk, Cruise and Kidman are frank, emotive, despite that the movie definitely follows Kubrick's thread of mysterious films with emotionally remote characters.<br/><br/>Actors are in an remorseless existential whirl. A good performance only tends to happen if they let go. Ironically the yearning to perform well and feel this free expression can trap them into holding on, reserving a corner of their focus so they can monitor and direct their performance, which makes all likelihood for a vibrant, natural performance recede. That's why many actors don't communicate their methods, superstitious about exposing such cavernous ideas to the outside. I think Kubrick was the same way with his technique. And that's why I feel that Cruise and Kidman don't seem like Maverick and Nicola; they mesh in Kubrick's world. They are in synch.<br/><br/>Yet the real star of this movie is Kubrick himself, who, precisely in character, gives meticulous heed to each self-contained scene. He makes a conscious decision not to weave them into a progressing narrative, but to make each one an objective in itself, giving each confrontation the ferment of a dream in which the present is lucid but it's difficult to recall where we've come from, project what could come next. It's as close as many films ever come to being pure: It's so intent on what it's about that even logical narrative form isn't allowed to take precedence over what it's about, which is something as basic and universal as a confession of sexual longing. It's purely, yes, a stream of fidelity, jealousy, and dream logic channeled through an array of sub-Freudian motifs.<br/><br/>No one acquainted with the distant meticulousness of Kubrick's work will be surprised that this isn't the steamy erotic thriller a synopsis might convey. The eerily stately air of sexual melancholy and claustrophobia which permeates the film finds its focal point during an elaborate masked orgy, which may or may not place Cruise in mortal danger. Yet there's an underlying subtlety to the film which takes care to provide all manner of visual and thematic echoes, accommodating the blurring of perceptual distinctions hinted in the title.<br/><br/>Each of these scenes is like an interior monologue-heavy chapter in a novel. They move at a slower pace to allow a more intimate look into Cruise's inner life, for him to digest actions, events and epiphanies, he interacts with himself and the settings more than with other characters, and they never feel time-based. They're thoughts, basically. They're free-floating. Everything's a projection of a feeling or notion. It's a beguiling metaphysical experience of overhearing a person's private thoughts, as they're alternately externalized and internalized.<br/><br/>Throughout the shooting of all Kubrick's most important works, he constantly sought the most authentic ambiance or ""feel"" for each, and this personally controlled, visually enticing enterprise has a thriller's framework, with the prospects of intrigue and murder. It also strikes one like an infernal delusion; a sequence of odd characters flicker in and out of the limelight, baffling the hero with obscure fine points of their lives. The compromise at the end of the film is the one scene that doesn't quite come off; a film that captivates us owing to its undecided issues shouldn't attempt to bring in the bubble wrap. But that's why Eyes Wide Shut is a consummate film in its famously headstrong director's canon, because it both classically exemplifies his power as a filmmaker and showcases his weaknesses, which compared to most filmmakers in history are showcases of pure talent.<br/><br/>I don't think the point is to be able to pass a test on it when it's over, but to nonetheless become completely absorbed. Implicating the audience in the act of coveting, Kubrick's accomplishment here is sustaining a weird, off-putting, somehow sensual pitch for the doctor's oddball confrontations. Shooting with a grainy high-contrast approach, lots of back-lighting, underlighting and intense primary colors, setting the film at Christmastime to benefit from the lights, he makes it all rather ornate, like an urban festival. Cruise isn't exactly the protagonist but the character being compelled, tilting from one scenario to another.<br/><br/>The grace, appearance of impulsiveness continually surprise, invigorate, and the horizontalization of space, emotion cement this banquet of technique, Freudian incisiveness and personal audacity as---despite minor but uncharacteristic compromises by Kubrick to secure a mainstream release---an affront to the Hollywood game, a declaration of its maker's independence. When this came out a few months after Kubrick's death, it was seriously misread, which should've come as no shock. If you retread, examine the initial responses to any Kubrick film, except the earliest ones, you'll see that all of them were. Then, after five, ten years came the dawning that 2001, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon were each like nothing else before or since. So is Eyes Wide Shut."

","Stanley Kubrick is a legend of film making, making classics such as The Killing, Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket. He is easily my favourite director and Eyes Wide Shut is the last film he ever made.<br/><br/>Set in New York Dr. Bill Hartford and Alice (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) are upper class members of society in an unhappy marriage. During a party both end up flirting with other people until Bill has to treat a woman who has a bad reaction to speedball. The following night during an attempted night of passion and smoking weed Alice relieves she nearly had an affair, which Bill off the edge. He looks to get his own back, first finding an prostitute before running to an old university friend who tells him of a special event that he plays the piano at, taking part in strange ritual. Bill sneaks in the event, and finds that it sex ritual. It is an orgy, but one of the women tries to warn Bill and he found out. After the orgy Bill becomes paranoid, fears he is being followed and that these people would attack his family and suffers guilt from the events.<br/><br/>Kubrick flair's for direction is shown once again. He tells a story extremely well, keeping your focus on the screen, unfolds the story gradually and keeps the mystery going. Kubrick is a very thematic director, as shown in his previous films. This time the themes are obsession and sex (similar to Lolita), the breakdown of marriage and the look at high society. There are small plot points, like the young girl sleeping with two older men, which add to film. Kubrick is magical behind the camera, filming some lovely shots, knowing exactly what the audience should focus on. He pays attention to detail, and has a love for tracking shots. He rarely has a need to make cuts, preferring to keep the film flowing.<br/><br/>But this film does have weaknesses. The weakest is the acting from the leads. Nicole Kidman is schizophrenic in performance, being wooden for the most time, but did have moments of brilliance. Tom Cruise is normally a good actor and he was better then his then-wife, but this is not his strongest performance in his career. I can picture that Cruise did this project thinking he can win an Oscar. It is believed that Eyes Wide Shut lead to their break up. Luckily the supporting cast for this film was good. The other major problem with this film is the pacing, being a bit too slow at times. There are some very long scenes in this film. But Kubrick is a man who knew what he was doing.<br/><br/>Kubrick is an artist. Eyes Wide Shut is his weakest film, but if this Kubrick at his worst, you can imagine what Kubrick was like at his best.<br/><br/>A film for Kubrick purists like me."
"bobsgrock","7","0","1","4 February 2009"," The final chapter of the book of Kubrick.
","There is no real reason to argue that Stanley Kubrick was one of the finest directors to ever stand behind a camera. From Dr. Strangelove to 2001: A Space Odyssey to Full Metal Jacket, Kubrick was able to polarize and hypnotize the audience with his brilliant composition, camera movement, and incredible storytelling. Here, he explores the human desires to copulate and have intimacy with one another. What is interesting is that this is an issue we all know about and that the movie industry really seems to like, especially these days as practically every film made has a sex scene ore sexual reference in it. For Kubrick, he makes it more of a dream as the plot stretches off into wild and weird sections we weren't expecting and really kind of put us off in a way.<br/><br/>As Tom Cruise's character begins to explore the sexual events that surround him throughout the night, the film feels more and more deliberately slow in pace as well as more strange in tone. I believe Kubrick is doing this intentionally in order to plunge us further in the mindset that Dr. Harford is unaware and confused of the events happening to him. That being said, it feels a bit too long and there are some scenes that don't fit with the rest. The first hour is really strong as we view the marriage bonds between the doctor and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) strain as they both face temptation. As we follow Bill into this fantasy of sexual desires and obsession, the plot gets weirder and the questions pile up. This is not to say Kubrick doesn't wrap things up but not everything is revealed.<br/><br/>For me, this was not one of Kubrick's many masterpieces. I did admire the film for its insight on the reason of marriage and the ties it requires between two people. It also is very good in its atmosphere and set-up, which Kubrick always did well. However, I couldn't really get into it but that may be the reason behind the motives. For any Kubrick fan, this is worth checking out, but despite it not being up to his other stuff, there are definite traces of a great film here. It is only too unfortunate that he died so soon. One can only imagine what he would have done next."
"Maximus975","7","0","1","19 October 2008"," Summary
","Stanley Kubrick is regarded as one of the greatest directors of his time and even past. Making only a few films in his career, which spanned four decades, ended with the mystery drama thriller ""Eyes Wide Shut."" The films length spans a little over two and a half hours, and within it is the modern day classic Kubrick masterpiece. The look of it is very ""Kubrick"" because of how it was shot. Not simply just the lighting, but also the film stock as well. As a special request to Eastman- Kodak films, the company remade and released the film stock that had been out of print that had that look Kubrick desired. Lit mostly with practical's, such as Christmas string lights and assorted lamps around the room  Aided only by the occasional china lantern or highly diffused light. The story itself revolves around Dr. Bill Harford (played by Tom Cruise) and his encounter with a cult of sex fiends. Even though the movie possibly could have easily been told in less amount of time, it is very unlike Stanley Kubrick to not show every detail both prior and post the main event of the film. To get a greater sense of whom Dr. Bill Harford and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) we spend the greater portion of an hour and a half learning about what kind of people they are. What sort of fantasies, and lives they live on the outside of their marriage. Not to take any of this lightly, it was not uncommon for Kubrick to spend much more time than any other director would have on a scene  making sure he captured every little last detail, and that he got what he came there to get. Such a scene takes place between Bill and a friend of his Victor Ziegler (played by Sydney Pollack). Taken in one location, that of Victor's billiards room took roughly a month to film. Any other director would have been told to move on by studio heads because it was a waste of budget. Sadly however only a few days after the movie was shown to the studios Kubrick passed away."

It is an ambitious attempt.<br/><br/>First the GOOD:<br/><br/>I love the idea of the film which was an exploration of one man's journey into sexual and moral discovery. Midway through the film you get the sense of an amazing thriller is being unleashed before you. I love the idea of Tom Cruise and Nichole Kidman (who were married back then) doing this movie. <br/><br/>The movie had the dry subtle humor that Kubrick was known for and I loved that part of it. <br/><br/>Now the BAD: There were a few problems with the film. My biggest annoyance was the dialog. Many times in the movie the dialog would go something like this: person:1""Take off your clothes"" Tom Cruise: ""Take...off...my...clothes""<br/><br/>So many times in the film someone would speak to Tom Cruises character telling him something and he would just repeat what they said back, but very very slowly. After the 5th time it got very very annoying. <br/><br/>The score was decent except for the single piano playing during suspenseful moments. A single piano note playing over and over again. Also very annoying.<br/><br/>The plot of the film had great aspirations but after the midway point I thought the suspense was built up in perfect Kubrick style but there was never any conclusion. Also Tom Cruises character had the most random thing happen to him that it seemed unrealistic and more or less unrelated to the plot of the movie. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes I felt went on for way too long like Nichole Kidmans crying scene when her husband came back form the party.<br/><br/>I have tried very hard to like this movie and was among the excited fans waiting to see this movie when it first came out."

Worst thing is that those happy people didn't realize that they are being a great wall to protect ""them"" by being or act happy. <br/><br/>Being honest is one of the biggest crime these days.

I say they're lemons but by just about any other director's standards they would be their greatest work. And they are stunning films on several levels, but for me the subject-matter of both of them - sex and immorality - is turgid and uninteresting. Eyes Wide Shut is based on a dreary book called Traumnouvelle by Arthur Schnitzler, one of those early-twentieth century psychosexual writers who managed to gain acclaim by writing shock value prose with the fashionable Freudian conceits of the day. My summation of the plot of the movie above isn't really a summation, that is the whole story, in eighty words. All that leaves the two-and-a-half-hour movie with is characterisation (which there isn't much of either) and technique (which there is lots of). And so, like Barry Lyndon, it becomes a cold, beautiful film, like a Cartier diamond - rare, hypnotic and dazzling to look at, but ultimately uninvolving and flat. There are about twenty shots of Cruise walking down corridors in this movie, all of which are filmed with a master's perfection, but none of which really advance the story or tell us about the characters. There is fabulous low-key lighting, incredibly unsettling music by Jocelyn Pook, and marvellous editing, but the narrative is so slight it beggars belief. It's almost as if Kubrick set himself the challenge of taking a boring, threadbare book and transforming it into a fascinating, profound film; he succeeded, but it doesn't change the fact that the story is rubbish. It's also a movie where the style does not suit the material. The best scene is the big argument between Bill and Alice, which is shot close and feels very authentic, like a John Cassavetes drama. This, and other scenes, are completely at odds with the extremely stylised orgy section in the middle, which is vaguely risible, almost like a scene from a cheap horror flick about witchcraft. I think it's very difficult not to make people having sex on screen look comical and that wrecks the ooh-this-a-powerful-clique-of-debauched-sinners atmosphere the film is trying to create. Also, the ending is incredibly unsatisfying, a double-whammy of lameness, again entirely down to the plotting; not only do we not find out whether the hooker Mandy's death was an accident or something sinister, but Bill and Alice resolve their monumental differences with a few throwaway platitudes. Oh, and the title's stupid too. Okay, I'm probably whaling on this movie unfairly, but it's a thorn in my side. Kubrick was a genius, an absolute untouchable genius, but he took forever to make movies (five in thirty years) so when he picked this material I was incredibly disappointed and tragically he died of a heart attack literally days after finishing the final cut, so Eyes Wide Shut became his epitaph (as opposed to, for example, a much more interesting project he was working on, AI Artificial Intelligence, subsequently made by Steven Spielberg in 2001). What can I say that's good about Eyes Wide Shut ? It has some nice performances - I admire the way Cruise throws himself into the thankless role of Bill, a man questioning his morality but who lacks the courage to fulfill his fantasies, constantly trudging down hallways and streets and repeating the questions others have asked him. Both he and Kidman (who were married at the time) became grown-up actors as a consequence of making this film, and particularly in her case have gone on to challenging dramatic roles. I also like both Davis and Shaw as the two hookers, one high-class, one not, both of whom manage to make interesting women without much script to work from, and Kubrick's longtime assistant Leon Vitali plays the bizarre Red Cloak. For trivia buffs, the movie's production was the usual Kubrick litany of insane secretive meticulousness; despite the fact that numerous scenes take place on the streets of NYC, it was all shot on huge stages at Pinewood, the schedule was over a year long (probably a record), with Kubrick's usual one-hundred-takes-of-everything please ethic. Most notably, Harvey Keitel and Jennifer Jason Leigh were both original cast members, but Kubrick eventually fired Keitel and Leigh had other commitments and couldn't reshoot. How can I sum up ? This is a bad movie you have to see. Its faults lie in the story and script, but it has so many other interesting facets to it and it's such a unique nutty sex drama, it has to be experienced. However, don't judge Stan The Man by this film - check out Dr Strangelove (incredible), 2001: A Space Odyssey (mesmerising), A Clockwork Orange (astonishing), The Shining (terrifying) or Full Metal Jacket (stunning) to see the real genius of this master filmmaker."

","Um I haven't seen EWS, but I didn't think it made any sense. It just looked like it was all about sex, and there was like way too much nudity in this movie. I do love The Shining, on the subject of Kubrick films though. He made a film called Lolita, which I heard it very controversial. What is that about? Was he a controversial director???? The part I didn't understand about EWS was when Tom Cruise went to that mansion and there was like some sex party. Why was he there?? It was really weird because they were all in masks. His films are all different, but they are all strange in a way also. I don't know if I should watch any of his other films aside from The Shining. Lolita looks weirds and Eyes Wide Shut is hard to understand. Please post your thoughts about EWS."
"dust-7","Null","0","1","11 December 2005"," Is 'rehab' indicated after viewing?
","This is a film based on a novella, Traumnovelle, written by Arthur Schnitzer in 1926, apparently concerning just the party-crashing into a dead-eyed sex party of oligarchs that is the basic plot of Kubrick's film. Kubrick has the whole mess set in and around Christmas. There are 37 scenes in the film, mostly including Tom Cruise; which is rather unfortunate (this was really a part for Jack Nicholson). Worse are the scenes of his wife, Kidmann, playing the character, Alice, not for her beautiful if somewhat undeveloped form, often shown unclothed, but for her attempt to show affection to her husband. She seems miscast, and uncomfortable. But so does he as a physician, named Dr. Bill. Sydney Pollack, as one of his wealthy patients, makes an early entrance as the host of a fancy ballroom party. Cruise recognizes a not too bright med school buddy in the piano player, one Nick Nightingale, who tells him to drop by a few weeks later at the, Sonata Cafe. He meets some dopey woman whom he saved as they talk about, rainbows. Meanwhile wife, Alice, gets drunk, seems to adopt a Melanie Griffith accent, and strikes up a conversation with a 'hungarian' actor-type who spouts Ovid, and desperately wants to show her 'sculputures', upstairs. Meanwhile Pollack calls Bill to attend to a hooker named, Mandy, sitting bare naked in a stuffed chair, having taken some sort of overdose. Bill says she is lucky to 'survive', and needs 'rehab'. Keep it confidential, says Pollack.<br/><br/>So one evening Bill and Alice smoke pot in their underwear (it's the plot, trust me). And Alice mentions the Ovid-guy, trying to inexplicably strike up a jealousy argument. After some painfully convulsive laughter, which is apparently what pot does to Alice, she reveals that she wanted to have an affair with some Navy guy, back when, but never quite did. But she goes on and on about it to make Bill jealous.<br/><br/>And at that very moment, jealous Bill gets a phone call to visit the apartment of a patient who just died. The daughter is there, crying, talking about an impending marriage to some professor, when she launches herself at Bill and proclaims a 'love for you'. The prof. turns out to be Greg, from Dharma and Greg, who saunters in after she has thrown herself at Bill. And Bill makes his quick exit. He takes to walking the streets, and then quickly meets a hooker, who has him to her apartment. Alice calls him on the cell, and he claims he's waiting for 'relatives to arrive'. He quickly leaves, but pays the hooker $150 anyway. And he winds up at the Sonata Cafe.<br/><br/>Now Nick and his backing band just finish their jazz set as in walks Dr. Bill. And Nick says he has another appointment soon, which he makes out to be so mysterious that Bill is interested. Nick gets a call on his cell and writes down a word, Fidelio. He tells Bill it's a password. Bill presses him. He gives Bill the address and apparently, off camera, describes what sort of costume is expected. So Bill is off to the costume shop, apparently owned by another patient, called, Rainbow Fashions. Some other guy now runs the shop, and agrees to open at that hour for a $200 premium. But he discovers his daughter in the back with two sissy Japanese men, doing whatever. He locks the Japanese in the room, threatening to call the cops, banishes his daughter to her room, and outfits Dr. Bill with his required costume. Off Bill goes in a taxicab.<br/><br/>He pulls up to an estate with a fancy gated entrance. He gives the password, Fidelio. And he's in. And what does he see? The well-lit 'orgy' rooms are wood paneled, sporting middle-eastern music as soundtrack, it seems. People watch satanic-type chants, in robes and masks, and then head out as if on sedatives to stand by as others disrobe and copulate. The twist is that these are all supposed to be powerful oligarchs, who cannot let their dark secret see the light of day. Dr. Bill is quickly discovered. A naked woman warns him to leave immediately. But he's called before the 'inquisition', asked the 'password for the house' (a trick question, there is none), and is then threatened. They tell him to strip, and we first hear the annoyingly childish piano tinkling as score. The woman, and from the balcony, says she'll take whatever punishment. So he leaves, apparently forgetting his mask.<br/><br/>In short order, Nick is 'disappeared'. The hooker he didn't engage is diagnosed with AIDS. The costume shop guy has a completely mysterious turnabout, practically offering Dr. Bill his daughter. Bill's followed on the street. And the naked woman from the balcony turns up dead in the morgue. Quite the conspiracy, particularly with the annoying piano all the while (there's no mute button in a theater, just at home). And then Pollack calls him over for a chat. And Pollack lays it out. And he was there at the 'orgy'. The taxi gave away Bill, and that his rental suit still had the receipt in the pocket. He says Nick is just fine. The threats were just a lot of bold talk, with nothing behind them. And the girl was a hooker who was fine when they dropped her off, later. Like Mandy before, she was high risk, or coincidentally overdosed. So no threat, no conspiracy. The oligarchs are harmless.<br/><br/>The final twist is that Dr. Bill returns home to find that Alice has the mask in bed with her. Alice was there, too? Who knows? But he comes clean about his 'night out'. And Alice says, in the closing scene, that 'forever' is too long a time to promise, but that they should at least be grateful they 'survived' their 'adventures', and need 'rehab' (well, they don't say that - that's just for the surviving audience)."

","Reading much in the tabloid press about the controversy and lies told about this film's production I was surprised to find, on watching it, that none of the rubbish was actually true. Kidman and Cruise make a halfway decent couple in this film, although one gets the impression particularly from Cruise's acting that he suffered far too many takes going wrong but aside from that, Kidman looks lovely and completely at ease with being pictured in the way that Kubrick portrays his film women - mostly naked but in a strangely non voyeuristic manner.<br/><br/>That said, all the classic Kubrick touches are there. The sumptuous ballroom scene at Ziggler's and the equally beautiful masked party scene; liberal use of female nudity (seen in many Kubrick films, including The Shining, Clockwork Orange and occasionally in Barry Lyndon) but with a continental eye on it (as its incidental to the plot), little touches which crop up again and again (the well-lit Christmas tree, Cruise's ill-fated attempts to have sex as a means of getting back at his wife's revelation and the parties of the rich and successful (and masked)). Also there is the Kubrick trademark long tracking shot down a corridor and his use of nudity to shock. Kubrick was an incredibly talented and creative director who will be sorely missed by his fans.<br/><br/>The plot is as complicated as ever. Cruise plays an ordinary suburban doctor whose former art dealer wife makes an uncomfortable revelation about an encounter she had on one of their holidays. Then Cruise, answering a call from a client/friend to attend to her dead father, finds himself dwelling over and over again on his wife's real or imagined infidelity as he travels around. He meets a succession of characters; a prostitute whom he almost sleeps with, a piano player in a jazz club who tells him about a masked party in another part of the country which he is playing at and then a costume supplier and his unruly daughter, followed by the anticipated so-called orgy sequence in which Cruise is, oddly, out of place and is 'rumbled'. The rest of the movie concentrates itself on Cruise trying to find out what went on at the party and whether the girl who 'sacrificed' herself for him really did.<br/><br/>The only problem with me regarding this film was Cruise's acting. It is, at times, quite tired and he never gives a feeling that he is in any danger or his family are and he is concerned about it."

","By the end of Eyes Wide Shut, my friend and I wanted to bash the television screen in with our shoes. I'm still bitter that I'll never get those two hours of my life back. Just calling this film awful is not enough. The soundtrack consists of two notes, played in different octaves. Both Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman left me feeling cold; whether this was the fault of the script or their acting is unclear. The script and plot line left much to be desired, either way. At no point did I feel sympathetic toward a single character in the film. However, I will not deny that Stanley Kubrik was able to evoke strong emotions from me; I rarely finish a film loathing its characters so thoroughly. If this was the intent, I suppose I missed it. My friend and I kept watching because we felt that surely there had to be a point to it all. Instead, I was left feeling completely stupefied.

","'Eyes Wide Shut' was the final film of the legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's films probably have had greater disagreement among film lovers than any other movie maker in history. Just for that he deserves to be remembered. Those who love his works call him a genius, while those that hate his films call him a charlatan. Regardless of what people may think of him and his movies, it is no doubt that his films continue to fascinate the movie fanatics. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is no exception, although this reviewer will sympathize with those do no like this film. <br/><br/>Most of this movie is very difficult to watch. No doubt, Kubrick's impeccable craft is still there. The lighting, editing, music and a creepy atmosphere stays throughout the film, as it does in many of his other films. What is horribly lacking in the movie is a screenplay, story, and most importantly, a point or moral. The screenplay is downright awful. I swear Tom Cruise repeats everything another character says to him. It is as though Cruise's character is absolutely clueless and has ADD. It is as though the screenwriters could not find anything better to write. The story is a absolute mess. Each scene is drawn out three times longer than it should. There are long pauses in the conversations, even though the characters are talking about the most mundane things. Rumors exits that Kubrick was a control freak. These rumors might be right. He was so obsessed with photography and technique that he destroyed any kind of spontaneity. The plot of 'Eyes Wide Shut'? Tom Cruise walks around ""New York City"" all night long encountering one bizarre sexual encounter after another. Many of these scenes are embarrassing and painful to watch. None of these encounters seem to bring any kind of point, except things most people already know. <br/><br/>Although this movie has many bad things going for it, other things stood out that saved the film from being one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, and Sydney Pollack do a fantastic job in their acting. Their performances are powerful and convincing, and salvage a badly written story. Stanley Kubrick once again shines in his directing, as the orgy scene and the ""billiard room talk"" are both hair-raising and brilliant film-making. In the end though, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is pretty much a waste of time. Kubrick died before he finished editing the film, so maybe what we saw wasn't what he really intended. Nonetheless, even if Kubrick had completed the movie before his death, I don't see how the final product could have been any better."

","Eyes Wide Shut (1999) was Stanley Kubrick's final film. This movie probably killed him in the end. He never even got the chance to present a final cut of this film. The production on this film was very lengthy. Reshoots and hundreds of takes were never enough for the man, he wanted perfection (that's what happens when a photographer becomes a film maker). The movie was a very non-commercial one and a lot of post production tinkering was made to get this movie some mainstream acceptance. Kidman and Cruise are brilliant in this film. Fellow director Sidney Pollack shows that he can act as well as direct. Too bad the film was tinkered with in the editing room (get the Hong Kong V.C.D.). Not the movie that I wanted to see Kubrick make before he died (what ever happened to the Aryan Papers and the Napoleon project?)but I guess it'll have to do (like I have a choice). In a way it is fitting for him, making a mainstream movie after all of these years.<br/><br/>Recommended for Kubrick fans only."
"philip_vanderveken","6","0","3","21 June 2005"," Too bad Kubrick had to end his career with a false note . . .
","I've always considered Stanley Kubrick as one of the biggest geniuses ever to have worked in Hollywood. A man who has made movies like ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""The Shining"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and so many more excellent movies, doesn't deserve any less than to be seen as one of the greatest ever. But I really wonder what he had in mind when making this one. This was his last, but in my opinion also his least...<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a doctor who becomes obsessed with having a sexual encounter after his wife has admitted that she has had sexual fantasies about a man she once met. She hates the fact that he doesn't admit that he has had similar fantasies in the past and keeps torturing him with the idea. This leads him into unfulfilled encounters with a dead patient's daughter and a hooker, but when he pays a visit to a nightclub where he meets an old friend, he learns about a special secret society where sexual rituals are performed. Intrigued by the unknown, he decides to attend one of their congregations, but almost immediately finds himself in a lot of trouble. Not only is his own life in danger, so are his marriage and the lives of his wife and daughter...<br/><br/>Before you think that I didn't like this movie because of all the nudity or the sexual content, I want you to know that such things don't bother me at all, certainly not when they add to the story and are brought in a very nice way (like in this movie for instance). No, what really bothered me about this movie was it's incredibly slow pace. I'm used to watch alternative and 'foreign' (read European, South American and Asian movies), but this certainly was one of the slowest that I've ever seen. Some will say that it helps to see the 'dream-like' state the characters are in... Possible, but it certainly didn't work for me. I got bored after a while and almost thought about hitting the fast forward button (something that I've never had before with other movies). <br/><br/>I'm not saying that I wanted to see several action scenes in this movie either. Those who know me or those who have read several of my reviews on this website will know that I'm far from a fan of action-filled movies. I hate big explosions, a couple million rounds fired at an innocent bystander,... I really don't like that and don't need it to enjoy a movie. What I want is a very powerful story, some excellent acting and some nice camera-work. That, I did get from this movie at regular moments.<br/><br/>Kubrick certainly knew how to create a certain atmosphere, thanks to the clever use of music and original camera work. And the fact that he chose Kidman and Cruise as his two main actors wasn't a bad choice either. But it is never enough to save the entire movie and the main reason why it got a lot of its publicity is probably because the director died before the project was closed and because Kidman and Cruise decided to end their marriage shortly after the movie was released... As I already said, Kubrick was one of Hollywood's greatest, but this was one of his weaker movies. I give it a 6/10."

","EYES WIDE SHUT contains considerable nudity, several fairly explicit scenes, and one sexual situation after another. But any one who approaches EYES WIDE SHUT with the idea that it will be sexually arousing is in for an extremely rude awakening. EYES WIDE SHUT is not a sexy film, and (Hollywood marketing men aside) no one in their right mind would describe it as such.<br/><br/>The story is intriguing. Upscale New York doctor Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) fall into a drug-laced conversation--and goaded by Bill's rather archaic ideas about female sexuality, Alice reveals that she has had a powerful sexual fantasy about a man she once saw in a hotel. Powerful though the fantasy was, the facts of the matter are much more prosaic: she never spoke to him, never had sex with him, and never saw him again. But the authority with which she describes the fantasy, and the realization that women in general and his wife in particular are capable of contemplating such behavior, sends Bill into an emotional spin.<br/><br/>Unable to shake the image of his wife having sex with another man, he prowls the city--and wanders more by accident than design into one sexual situation after another. Accosted by a patient, taunted by drunk men on the street who think he is gay, and even picked up by a prostitute, Bill eventually stumbles into the film's centerpiece: a secret society that gathers for cold-blooded and ritualistic fornication. And once he trespasses upon the society, he suddenly finds that death and destruction follow his every move.<br/><br/>There are clearly several metaphors at work in the film. EYES WIDE SHUT essentially presents sex as something that boils under the surface with a ferocity of which we are generally unaware--and then by stages ties sexuality to emotional risk, disease, perversion, cruelty, and ultimately death. It is also flatly Strindbergian in its vision of women, presenting them and their sexuality as irrational elements that must be subdued and reduced to the mechanical lest they lead to absolute destruction. And it is no accident that the story is set at Christmas with its story of a male God born of a virgin woman.<br/><br/>But these are only the most obvious of the film's layers. What confuses--and often enrages--viewers is the fact that Kubrick leaves a tremendous amount of wiggle room when it comes to both the story and what it means. There is no clear-cut summation re anything: everything is presented in the most ambivalent manner possible and we are left to draw our own conclusions. And this is as true of the plot as it is of whatever interpretation you attach to it; it winds back upon itself, ultimately frustrating any clear-cut response. One might say that with EYES WIDE SHUT Kubrick tantalizes us with a secret that he keeps entirely too well. I like the film, but people tend to have extremely divided reactions to it, and for that reason I recommend that you rent the film and decide for yourself before making a purchase.<br/><br/>In theatrical release, EYES WIDE SHUT was presented in a widescreen ratio; on both VHS and DVD release, however, it is presented in the ratio of a standard television screen. Liner notes indicate that Kubrick intended the film to be seen in that ratio--but even if that is true it is a pity that there is not a widescreen option, for the visual statement of the widescreen theatrical release was somewhat more powerful. If you are trying to decide between DVD and VHS and both price and DVD bonus materials are factors in your choice, you should know that there is no significant difference between the two.<br/><br/>Gary F.

","i have seen this movie many times, and i must say thought it awful the first couple of times. mainly because of certain parts, which contained atrocious acting, false and unbelievable scenery, (and if i didn't know Kubrick's style, i would say lack of development). it is a great film, for the scenery, the shots, the underlying Kubrick kind of stuff. but it could have been better with just a few more minutes of development. <br/><br/>although this is one of kidman's best acting jobs, i didn't appreciate her drunk or stoned scenes, having been in college, i experienced all there is in the ways of self medicating, and no one behaves that way, the drunk party scene for lack of a better word sucked, and Sandor's accent was far from Hungarian. attention to detail is what makes a movie, and Kubrick has always been one to do just that. i am sad that this was his last film, and i can't believe those scenes passed inspection. but never mind, not really important. <br/><br/>i grew up in NYC, and their portraying of it was bad, they tried for that mythical 1980's mayor dinkins era where it really wasn't that safe, but more than that painted a picture which some out of towner who had never been there might describe to a friend. where was the sketchy 42 st and 8th ave they were aiming for? as i watched the movie more times, i started to not pay attention to this tidbit, because it really just made me angry, but more-so i found myself watching it only for the interaction with the sect in the beautiful mansion, (which is also not NYC or out lying territory style. i believe it is in england somewhere)and later in the film the conversation with Ziegler at his apartment. this is Kubrick at his finest: pure eye candy, the house, the robes and masks, the women, the music, the chanting, i've been trying to find out whether the chanting is taken from some other work? (if anyone that reads this knows anything about the music from the ceremony starting the orgy, particularly the chanting of the man in red, please tell me, my email is listed above.) people's fascination with sects, call them what you want, Illuminati, masons, weirdos whatever, this keeps people watching, wondering, hoping that one day the may be redeemed amidst a group of robe and mask clad fornicators."

","When I saw this film for the very first time, I will admit that I did not like it,,but I couldn't think of the exact reason why. I thought it was very slow in some parts (mainly when Tom and Nicole are in their bedroom getting stoned and having an argument, that part just dragged on and on), and the movie scared me a little bit. After HBO kept airing Eyes Wide Shut I found myself watching it over and over, and now I think this movie is a work of art and a masterpiece. You really have to have an appreciation for Stanley Kubrick to appreciate this film.The movie is supposed to be set in NYC,, but one of its biggest flaws was , it was apparent it was filmed in another city (London to be exact). Tom Cruise plays a physician, Bill Hartford. His wife, Nicole Kidman, admits she often fantasizes about sex with another man,, and then he starts to question his true desires and feels he should get back at his wife for her fantasies. It's almost like this movie sends a subtle message- don't cheat or even think of cheating or ""they"" will get you! This is all proved by a series of strange coincidences throughout the film, including the prostitute that Dr. Hartford attempts to hook up with. Sydney Pollack has a role in this film as a friend of Bill Hartford, seemingly normal, but then he too is involved in orgy-like escapades that involves people wearing masks,, another part of the film I thought was creepy.The music played during the orgy scenes, believe it or not, is hauntingly beautiful. There is a lot of speculation as to whether Dr. Hartford is dreaming the entire time the film takes place. I honestly do not know and this never occurred to me the many times I've seen this film. Also, I couldn't figure out the purpose of the scene involving the ""Rainbow Fashions"" shop owner,, who apparently allows his underage daughter to seduce older men. I guess Mr. Kubrick is just telling us that the world is full of perverted sickos. I think, overall, this is a fine film but you have to be open minded about it."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","0","10","30 December 2004"," Kubrick's final film... and possibly his least impressive
","After having seen just about every single of Kubrick's films(The only films that are left are Spartacus, Lolita and his short films) and a documentary about him(Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures), I was looking forward to seeing his last film, despite it's reputation. Now that I've seen it, I'm not sure what to think... I don't know for sure if I agree with the common opinion that this is his least impressive film(even less impressive than The Shining). Don't get me wrong, it is a good film, but it just seems... I don't know, unfinished, rushed... like Kubrick didn't spend as much time filming as he should have. Maybe it's the actors, I don't know. It just seems... uneven, somehow. The plot is very good, and has a pretty good pace... but there are places where you're bored, and the film seemed to end too suddenly, I think(despite the film being quite long). The acting is, not unlike The Shining, less impressive than most of Kubrick's other films. Cruise is not an actor with a lot of range, that's for sure. Kidman is mostly believable, but, like Cruise, she seems more like an actor playing a part than the actual character, which distances us from their characters and thereby from the film itself. Not good. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The story is interesting, evolves at a very good pace and provides food for thought. I liked how the film presented infidelity and sex in general as acts lust and desire rather than affiliating them with love or emotion. I've heard many complain that the film was lacking sex scenes. This is a Kubrick film; just because the subject matter is directly intertwined with sex, doesn't mean that he's going to do the typical, simple Hollywood thing and just pack the movie with sex scenes. A talentless director could(and probably would) have done that. Anyone can make sex look appealing to the general public. It's much, much harder to make it seem unappealing and in fact almost disgusting... but Kubrick succeeds. He reminds us that sex is just a bodily function, something between two people that doesn't actually require emotions. It's physical by nature. The soundtrack is quite good too... there is a classical piece that can bring you to the edge of your seat just listening to it, and Kubrick pairs it up with great visuals. Maybe I should let you know that, while this I think this is one of his lesser films, it is still definitely a Kubrick piece. No doubt about it. Perfectly framed shots, slow pans and zooms, great music... and the ending, albeit being a bit sudden and leaving the viewer somewhat unsatisfied, still has the Kubrick touch and, whilst appearing to resolve the film, it also hints at something more sinister and unsettling. A good, maybe even great, film by the master of innovative storytelling, Stanley Kubrick. I recommend it to any fan of Kubrick. Anyone who isn't a fan, or at the very least isn't used to his style of film, should consider watching some of his other films first, as this is one of his heavier and less impressive ones(at least in my opinion). 8/10"

","This film was described as a sexual odyssey and that much is true. It's also director Stanley Kubrick's last film (I think I might actually be happy about that). I know countless people have debated what this film really meant and probably over-analyzed it to the point they injected their own creativity into it. My viewpoint is much more practical and simple I think, albeit I still don't know why Stanley was so fascinated by sexuality to choose a final film about it. I got the impression the film was more for effect and remembrance than anything else. Given the it's lack of taste and gratuitousness, I would agree.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" starts out in unveiling the life of a well-to-do couple. It gives particular attention to Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) on an emotional and physical level to show a woman in all her sexuality. I think it attempts to show the physical desires a woman has with her maternal nature and her sincere affections. This schism in a woman's feelings is flip-flopped back and forth throughout the film and almost appears as if Kubrick might be showing some satirical misogyny...? Alice quickly becomes an over-the-top bimbo at a social event with her doctor husband, Bill Harford (then, real-life husband Tom Cruise). I think Kubrick thought the display of a real-life couple (especially stars) would not only draw public attention but would also allow for a better film due to the established chemistry. But this was my first disappointment. For two real-life lovers, I felt their encounters were sometimes forced or awkward and unconvincing. Their interaction with the daughter felt very unnatural, especially with Cruise's part. <br/><br/>I mentioned misogyny earlier and I'll elaborate. Alice is intoxicated and soon begins flirting with an older man who is trying to seduce her. She acts (as I said) like a complete bimbo. But the encounter serves the purpose of creating a debate between Alice and her husband about attraction and trust. She verbally attacks her husband to try and find some sort infidelity in his at least having sexual thoughts about another person. This brings to the surface Alice's own hidden sexual thoughts she has kept from her husband. She confesses having entertained sexual thoughts about someone other than her husband. She goes on to say that she would have sacrificed everything (husband, marriage, child, etc.) for a one-night stand with a man she saw at a hotel. Bill Harford is portrayed as a real gentleman and very devoted to his wife and child. He is loosely-cohesive after receiving the shocking confessional from his wife. But he still believes women aren't as sexual and willing to do the things men do. <br/><br/>Reinforcing the meaning of Alice's confession, a women tells Bill she loves him and wants him. This comes as a shock since he hardly knows her. Her sincerity scares him as it shows how women can have thoughts for other men without giving the slightest intimation. What generates a negative view of women is in the subsequent collapse of Bill's fidelity. His wife's mental cheating acts as the impetus for his own destruction. Man destruction appears to be the fault of a woman's sexual uncontrollability. Alice's confession and the thought of infidelity (on any level) torment Bill into attempting to commit the reality of her thoughts. <br/><br/>You could also look at the plot for this film as removing gender from sex and showing both males and females as having the same desires, drives, and secrets. It still shows Bill as a horse put into motion by his wife's secret eroticism. Bill ends up with a whore as a way to get back at his wife and indulge himself. Luckily, he is saved by a phone call which keeps him from making a marital mistake. That's still strike one on the close-call scale. Next he calls the woman's house that confessed her attraction to him. The phone is answered by her boyfriend and Bill hangs up. That's strike two. Bill then ends up going back to see the whore, Domino, but finds out she is not home. After trying to put the moves on her roommate, he is given the news that Domino was diagnosed with AIDS. That's strike three on the close-call scale! Well, you know what they say after three strikes.<br/><br/>And out goes Bill (*SPOILERS BELOW*). He still can't stop himself as if on some sexual adventure. He finds out about a private costume party that hosts orgies. This fuels Bill's fire as he gets the secret password (ironically it's Fidelio) and a costume. In probably the most memorable scene of the film, Bill is shown at an occult hedonistic masquerade. An intentionally jarring set of piano keys follow throughout and into the rest of the film - more Kubrick signature bizarrity. Without going into all the details, Bill witnesses some pretty raunchy and shocking things. But just as he's been warned by some mysterious hooker to leave, he is discovered as an interloper. The negative consequences of Bill's departure from fidelity soon become apparent as it appears as if his life might be in jeopardy. His inquiries into the events from the party yield a dead body and a kidnapped friend. The party and its darkness envelope the remainder of the film. Two other scenes show a dark sexual perspective - the costume owner becoming a pimp for his daughter and the revelation of Bill's close friend as one of the orgy's members.<br/><br/>All of this appears as the dirty foam of some wave that just crashed on the beach. It is the deluge from a intense storm brought about by sex. In one of the more controversial parts of the film, Bill returns home late after hearing his friend's revelation. He finds the mask from the orgy masquerade on the pillow next to his wife. He lost the mask somehow before returning it the store. Some people have suggested his wife found the mask and put it there. I am more apt to believe, since she did not know of the mask's significance, that someone from the party broke into his house and put it there as a warning. That is why Bill breaks down and confesses everything to his wife.<br/><br/>The ending is just as strange as the rest of the film, so I guess it's no surprise. True to his intended depiction of women, Kubrick has Kidman deliver a speech with a surprising sexually-expletive ending. I don't know what Stanley thinks he's accomplished here. And what makes him the authority on women and their sexuality? ""Eyes Wide Shut"" was just too creepy and awkwardly ""Basic Instinct"" to be very credible. Especially the whole orgy thing, although I doubt I will forget it anytime soon. It scares me that those kind of things probably go on. Some sick insanely-rich people. 4/10"

","I sat through this long, slow moving movie about a year ago and when it finally ended I couldn't believe that was it and I'd just sat there for nearly 3 hours watching such rubbish. It builds up suspense then at the end just forgets all about it and thats it! It starts off reasonably well, and has very good acting from Cruise and Kidman in the 2 leads, but the story itself doesn't make sense at all. All the movie is really is Tom Cruise wondering around New York having heard his wife had an affair, to meet a grieving woman, a prostitute, an old friend, a costume shop owner, and finally onto an erotic party. He also spends about $1000 in the space of 2 days and doesn't care that much! This whole evening takes up about an hour and a half of the movie and is incredibly slow-moving and annoying as the lines are slow and it moves at a snails pace the entire time. Then its the next day and everything is really weird and by the end of it you're thinking what the hell? There are that many plot-holes and their is no point in the movie at all!<br/><br/>In the end this movie left me confused, bored and annoyed. So I advise you to skip this and watch a good move like The Green Mile or Seven.<br/><br/>This is a complete waste of time and I give it 3/10 only for Cruise and Kidman's acting which was good I must say"

","Eyes wide shut..<br/><br/>Sex thimble Tom Cruise plays opposite the lovely Nicolle Kidman who was at the time his wife, ironically in a film about sharing your wife. If ever there was a film that was more style than substance this must be it. I won't spoil the paper thin plot for you, suffice to say its about near infidelity and its effects on the couple. Although the visual effects of this film, namely the sinister masked orgy costumes, work rather well the musical score really detracts from the film. Nerve jangling piano was the intention, headache inducing annoyance was the actual result. Every time anything happens someone starts plonking the piano keys like mad. Kidman is watchable as ever but rarely engages you with a lackluster performance. Its Tom Cruise though that steals the show with bad acting. Ask Tom to show concern, uncertainty or fear and he'll clutch his face. I lost count of the times he did this during this movie in an attempt to convey some emotion. He is supposed to be ultra-desirable to virtually everyone in the film and the rest of the cast drool over him while he gives his patent 'eyes too close together' look and inane grin. Vast swathes of the film are pointless and have nothing going on and the last half hour or so are aimless and boring in the extreme. Stanley Kubrick is a talented director but this ones barely worth watching. The final word of the film is utterred by Kidman and it's ""F*CK"" I can only add ""Off"" to this pretentious and dull effort."

"Angry_Arguer","8","0","3","19 September 2004"," Patient Depth
","Kubrick was possibly our most mature filmmaker in both form and ideas. He proved that story was not necessary in '2001' and 'Barry Lyndon'. His artistic and technical perfectionism is still relevant today (compare the grandeur of spacecraft in '2001' to Lucas' cartoons in 'Episode II') and, despite what anyone will tell you, his stuff is_not_boring.<br/><br/>OK, so 'Spartacus' was a bunch of moralistic hoo-ha and 'Shining' was too safe. Big deal. Let's get to the good stuff.<br/><br/>Spoiler minefield ahead...<br/><br/>Kubrick works in a very contemplative mode. He doesn't have the penchant for editing that those in my ""cinematic excess"" category do. In this respect, Kubrick is one of the most personal directors I have experienced. He doesn't create characters by having them spout lines in a cut-and-paste fashion like most directors. He wants them to exist, hence the mountains of laborious takes.<br/><br/>Of course, characters themselves are irrelevant in Kubrick's work (again with the '2001' reference). They are about situations and tone. Is it fear? Passion? Insanity? Why do you think his work hits some emotion/psychological bells in our heads? It's not because it's Jack Nicholson.<br/><br/>Watch this and notice how Kubrick rewards our patience. You might enjoy it."

The photography was nice, the issue of the story had potential, but the energy and pace died! Everyone was waiting for their cues instead of listening to each other. This was the 3rd collaboration between Cruise and Kidman, and all 3 films did not do well at the box-office. There was no EROTICISM in this film.

","Spoiler alert I have recently watched EWS and was captivated by it, I found it intriguing and thought provoking. So much so that the following couple of days I spent pondering the plot and trying to make sense of it all. I came across this site which clarified a few things for me but some uncertainty remains.<br/><br/>Bills journey started when he got the late night call from Marion who was grieving over her deceased father. I found it interesting that Marion's overwhelming feelings for Bill mirrored Alice's confessed feelings for the naval officer. Marion was willing to throw her life with Carl away for a chance at Bill. This was the beginning of the journey because his realisation of such intense desire (as descried by ALice) was amplified by his experience with Marion. <br/><br/>The relevance of Domino contracting HIV reflected his first lucky escape - it would have cost him his life if Alice didn't call when she did. Like his dogged determination to turn up to the forbidden event - also could have cost him his life. HE ALSO WAS WILLING TO THROW AWAY HIS LIFE FOR THESE FLEETING SEXUAL EXPERIENCES. or was he trying to experience an overwhelming desire to revenge Alice - (he kept imagining her with the sailor).<br/><br/>Also how did the masked Mandy at the orgy recognise an intruder when no-one had spoken to her about the receipt found in Bill's coat pocket or the taxi. She was busy with the ceremony, then walked directly to Bill warning him he was in danger and doesn't belong there. How did she know? Maybe because his cloak gave him away - perhaps he should have worn an ermine-lined cloak. This may be showing us a connection between Milich, his daughter at Rainbow costumes and the orgy. Remember they were acting strangely when Bill returned the costume - were they involved in the orgy? In costuming the members? <br/><br/>For a secret society 'orgy' there was a huge attendance don't you think? It seems unlikely that that many people could keep it a secret without leaks being a regular occurrence and why wouldn't they want any new members - they must get new members otherwise how would they have such a huge following. There must have been 200 people there! Wouldn't they discuss if he wanted to be a member rather than go to the extreme of having him followed etc. and threatening death!<br/><br/>Bill would have gone ahead with having sex with the 2 girls at the Xmas party with the significant line ""we'll take you to the end of the rainbow"". He was pulled away from that encounter significantly by the near death of Mandy - I believe this was his first warning. The next time he refused to be pulled away resulted in Mandy's death.<br/><br/>It is a very clever movie. I welcome any comments on my comments."

","""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Lolita"",""A Clockwork Orange"", these classics were ahead of there time, now these movies are being hailed as the best of Kubrick's films.  ""Eye's Wide Shut"" was Kubrick's last film, he took a chance and has made a film that is in it's own class, and has created a dark yet clever film.<br/><br/>THE PLOT<br/><br/>A doctor (Tom Cruise) who is married to an artist, finds out that she almost cheated on him, then he goes on an odyssey of sex and murder.<br/><br/>When I first heard of Stanley Kubrick's latest film, I was expecting a sexual, cinematic film. But then I saw the film, and I was dissapointed with the darkness, the acting, and the orgy scene. Well if that's an orgy, I don't want to be in one. It was scary. I didn't like the film at first, but then I saw it two more times, and I began to think, can sex drive people to murder.<br/><br/>2001: A Space Odyssey<br/><br/> I looked at all of Kubrick's films before I saw ""Eye's Wide Shut"", and I realized that he's the kind of director that show's the dark, inmoral side of human being's,  so I decided this is an instant Kubrick classic. However, Kubrick  does demonstrate hope in some of his films. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is one of the best films of the 20th century.  As I remembered the ending, that showed a man being reborn in space as a baby, it brought tears in my eye's.<br/><br/>A CLOCKWORK ORANGE<br/><br/>This is another good film by Kubrick. It's about a man who is a rapist, and a killer. But when he's arrested, they put him through a treatment that will change his whole life. When the treatment is over, one of consequences of it is that he realizes that every time he throws up, he is  thinking of sex with women. He curses, and tries to be violent but it is impossible. The ending shows  that he has  had some redemption, but maybe he didn't really learn anything.<br/><br/>FULL METAL JACKET<br/><br/>The action is savage, and this is a superb film. The ensemble cast falls into action in Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War that shows the horrible process that turns people into killers. ""Full Metal Jacket"", from its basic training to its nightmare of combat in Hue City, scores a cinematic direct hit.<br/><br/>I love ""Eye's Wide Shut."" I give it ****(out of 4 stars)"

This is very noticeable. I think if the actors were allowed to speak naturally at their own paces, this film would only run for 1 and a half hours.

","Eyes Wide Shut to me was a movie that even after reading the book, I was still confused.  What some may think of as artsy, I think of as soft core pornography.  Nicole Kidman shines in spite of a complex, and uninformative storyline.  It was designed to shock, and borderline startle you.  The only thing that startled me was the jolting notes of a piano here and there throughout the movie, that began to grate on my nerves as the end drew near. Perhaps this movie led to the demise of Kidman and Cruise's marriage.  In my opinion, it is more because Kidman was an underrated actress until she got out from under the shadow of her now former husband.  The movie, however did not lack in an all star cast.  Sobeliski's breakout performance in this movie is one worth noting.  I did find the apartment showcased as the couple's living space to be worth looking over.  Many of the details there were stellar.  Perhaps it could give Martha Stewart a run for her money in decorating tips?"

","Stanley Kubrick's reputation of course relies upon other films, and this one is more likely to impress film students for techniques than any audiences most likely to be disappointed when they are drawn into the odd connection between Kubrick and some major movie stars more than thirty years his junior (Cruise and Kidman) who have no other connections to him. I must admit that for the first thirty minutes all I could think was ""What a piece of pretentious rubbish! How could Kubrick soil himself with this?"", and then it grew upon me, but not in time to convince me that Kubrick didn't make one film too many (this one) or should have made some other movie as his unintended swan song. The result is mediocrity: half masterful, and half amateurish.<br/><br/>As usual for Kubrick, set design is consistently masterful. Enough of this movie grates on me to damage the rest. This is not an early work of a promising filmmaker; this is the last complete work of a decayed master. Perhaps, as with the other master Hitchcock, his taste failed him as he aged. Perhaps he fell in love with a novel that he thought needed a cinematic treatment -- and bit off far more than he could chew. <br/><br/>Kubrick moves an expressionist novel set in Germany or Austria across an ocean and nearly a century later in New York City in the 1990s, and he gets some interesting results. Interesting, but not wholly-satisfying. Expressionism, over the top a century ago, is silly today even if recent art has gone even more over the top. <br/><br/>First of all, Kubrick's mastery of set design gives a beauty to an ugly story, half pornographic and half a brilliant mystery, and the opulence makes the ugliness of much of the behavior all the more troublesome. The chilly personas of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (and this is deliberate) underscore the ominous qualities of the film.<br/><br/>I find the short, and potentially deadly, excursion of the clinical Dr. Hartford (Cruise) into the secret (Satanist?) ceremony by overhearing a password a bit contrived. Then again, expressionism itself is obsolete because it is contrived; what was over the top then is what alienated risk-seekers search almost routinely.<br/><br/>Kubrick took a chance, and this one spun out of control. For good reason Expressionism did not become more than a cultural fad, dying out about twenty years after its introduction."

The storyline, though long drawn out, is fairly easy to follow and has some sort of resolution at the end. <br/><br/>There are even some light touches - Stanley Kubrick must have know it would be his last film, as there are visual or aural references to most of his previous films, and even a pile of Stanley Kubrick videos in a bedroom scene near the end!<br/><br/>And any film with 3 different shots of Nicole Kidman's bare bottom will get me buying the DVD!<br/><br/>But there are also flaws.  It is definitely too long, and would have benefited from losing 20 minutes at least.

Also we learn virtually nothing about Alice and Bill's background other than that she used to own a gallery.

The empty film with the gorgeous outlook may be appropriate to conclude Kubrick's career, as he had perfected most of his works with various materials in a randomly wide range, which are sometimes meaningful and sometimes not.<br/><br/>Technical note: The editor used a lot of long cross-dissolves, which are strongly annoying.

Like that film, the plot here is threadbare and serves only to observe the relationship between two lovers. In this case we see how the the two partners in the relationship react to imagined and almost fait accompli infidelities. I for one was yet again very impressed by the always technically meticulous Kubrick and the performances he elicited from his cast.

"TOMASBBloodhound","8","0","1","27 December 2003"," Not Stanley's best, but still pretty good.
","Eyes wide shut will be the last piece of greatness we will ever have the privilege of experiencing from Stanley Kubrick. Unfortunately, it was released into a world expecting shallow, brainless thrillers, and pointless vanity pieces from untalented actors and directors. The public at large had no idea what to make of this very fine work when it hit theaters in 1999. ""pointless"" is the word I kept hearing from anyone who saw it before I did. Such a shame.<br/><br/>Eyes wide shut is like most of Kubrick's work. It flows like a stream happy to be churning along at its own pace. One cannot simply dangle their toes into the water and get a true feeling for it though. You must jump all the way in and let it take you for a ride. That said, I still think the pace of this film was a little too slow. I think the point could have been made, along with all of the emotions being conveyed, in under two hours. Some of the scenes drag out for a few minutes longer than they need to.<br/><br/>The acting was a little stiff, and at times unconvincing. Tom Cruise, however, does and outstanding job. He really carries this film a lot longer than a host of other leading men could have. Kidman really didn't impress me with her performance. She isn't in nearly as many scenes as Cruise, and she comes off as being kind of ditzy in the ones she's in. Not just in the one where they smoke pot. None of the supporting performances are all that memorable either, but they probably weren't meant to be.<br/><br/>The story is what really makes this one so memorable. We see a confident, professional man driven to near madness when his wife admits to fantasizing about leaving him and their child for another man she only saw briefly at a hotel. Cruise is understandably upset by this revelation, and sets out to get laid to spite her with anyone he can find. He wanders the streets for hours, and eventually ends up at some wild orgy at a country mansion. Then, things really get interesting.<br/><br/>The film is like most Kubrick films in that it is technically awesome and emotionally ambiguous. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide what constitutes adultery and what can simply be written off as a harmless dream or fantasy. One could have a conversation with someone else about these issues for hours and hours.<br/><br/>I must take issue with one of the ideas expressed in this film. Kidman's character would have us believe that women are just as much after sex as men, and that they are just as capable of committing adulterous thoughts and actions as men. WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! If you women thought about sex or wanted to have sex as mush as us guys, the world would cease to function. That orgy at the country mansion would be happening all over the world non-stop. <br/><br/>Overall, a clever, thoughtful film that should be in any DVD collection. I would stop short of calling it a masterpiece, though. It just falls a little short of that distinction.<br/><br/>ps: There are a lot of hot women in this film. Notice how all of them (including Nicole) are tall with perfect breasts. My compliments to the casting director!<br/><br/>8 of 10 stars<br/><br/>So sayeth the Hound."
"furiospin","Null","0","1","23 December 2003"," masked man who recognizes and salutes Bill Harford: Thomas Gibson
","I've watched this film almost more than 50 times. So now my way of watching it is different and I can notice every detail or facial expression. I totally agree with the idea that the orgy chapter is a non-realistic representation. Then we can't have a solution to the mysteries concering the people and the facts happening in this part of the film. But a reality about the MAKING (or realization, if you prefer) of this film, is that the ACTOR who plays the masked man recognizing and saluting Bill Harford is Thomas Gibson. That is the same actor who plays Marion's fiancè, Carl. We have the chance to see this man, with a particular pale mask devoid of a mouth, a few times. And I can say that is Thomas Gibson because if it had to be Sidney Pollack, there should have been wrinkles on the neck, because Pollack is a man in his 50s (maybe going on 60s). This man ain't got a single wrinkle - he's young. The eyes look pretty similar to those of Thomas Gibson and the figure corresponds perfectly to Marion's fiancè: quite tall and fit. Sidney Pollack is not very tall and has a big, robust trunk. The woman who stands by him could be Marion, but there is absolutely no way to recognize her eyes, neck or hair because she's perfectly covered by a black cloak and the mask is darkened in the eye holes, BUT that woman at the orgy who stands by Thomas Gibson is short like Marion is. So, to detect the people in this house, we have to remember that it can't be a normal prostitute or a middle-class person because it concerns only high-class people. Remember what Ziegler says in the ending? `If I had to tell you the names of the people who were there last night, and I'm not gonna tell you their names, I'm sure you wouldn't sleep so well'. That means that they are very important personalities. After all, the estate is the symbolic representation of the Mansion of political Power - it's the ""government"" and, seeing the house where Marion lives, we have the feeling that she's RICHER (maybe a noble) than Bill Harford. Bill and Alice, after all, are just middle-class people who live comfortably. But they are not involved with the high-class. As a matter of fact, at Ziegler's party, Alice asks Bill `Do you know anyone here?' Bill `Not a soul' Alice `Why do the Zieglers invite us at this thing every year?' Bill answers that it is a sort of reward for a doctor who makes house calls.<br/><br/>I think the idea of Alice knowing everything is not plausible. Bill's mask is on the pillow just because he forgot it home and she found it. After all, I would have done the same thing if my partner came back home with a mask. I would ask myself ""a mask? this thing could only concern a masked ball or something like that. Then my partner has been at a masked ball without me participating? I just leave it here, where he can find it and then I ask him where does it come from"". Alice doesn't know anything about what happened to him until he doesn't confess everything.<br/><br/>The real interesting thing we should discuss about is the opening sequence: Alice taking off her simple black dress and getting naked. That nudity would require sex. The first times I saw the film I thought that could have been the epilogue of their story. The movies ends with a message told, directly or indirectly, by Alice ""We should f**k to solve our problems rather than talking and arguing about sex"". As a matter of fact, Bill and Alice are a faithful couple because Alice is just dreaming and fantasizing about an affair, but when she has the chance to betray her husband with a fascinating hungarian man she firmly refuses. Bill would like to betray Alice after she told him about her fancy, but he always finds obstacles before starting to have any real betraying relationship. But there is a question? Which time collocation has the opening sequence? Are we sure that is happening after the whole story? And, as we know, Kubrick never puts an object into a scene if it hasn't any reason. Then, what do the rackets mean in the opening sequence? My mind obviously joins the rackets in the opening sequence with the dialogue told by Ziegler in a following scene - the arrival of the Harfords in Ziegler's hall. Ziegler says that his ""serve"" is terrific after a medical operation. It's a total mystery. But it can't be just fate to find those rackets and then hearing that dialogue. Moreover, we see many other times the spot in Harford's bedroom where the rackets are placed: after the opening sequence, the rackets are gone. Maybe Alice made them disappear after the party? Then, is she related in any way to Ziegler. Another clue for this supposition is readable in the dialogue between the hungarian Sandor and Alice as they dance. Alice worked in a gallery. So, she understands art. Sandor suddenly talks about Ziegler's sculpture collection. He asks her if she likes it. Alice says yes. That would require Alice knowing Ziegler deeper than her husband thinks. What I know is that, by absolutely no chance, she is not involved with orgy."

","Many say this film was a big disappointment. Sure, you'd expect the project that one of the world's greatest film directors had been working on for nearly ten years would be worth waiting for. Well was it? That's the problem - people's expectations were huge. And that has probably detracted from this being a very well made piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>I have seen EWS twice now, and I must say, I liked it much better the second time. The lack of depth that was apparent first time around was absent on a second viewing, and the film showed itself for what it was - a complex, challenging and questioning tale of sexual morality. Perhaps we weren't supposed to ""get it"" first time around, and that the issues and details in the film were so subtle, that a repeat viewing was necessary.<br/><br/>I need not dwell on the fact that the cinematography, shooting and craft were excellent. They were, and this was to be expected from Kubrick, a master of the art. <br/><br/>But I think people have been unfairly critical of the character development, plot, and ultimate point to the film. This film is comprised of short bursts of high-density dialog and much longer descriptive scenes absent of significant dialog. You have to pay attention during the dialog scenes in particular between Cruise and Kidman, as their relationship, the trust, and secret thoughts therein is at the nub of the film's message.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a unique film, both in style and substance, and is, in my mind, ultimately underrated. <br/><br/>Kubrick should be awarded the praise he deserves for his last great work.<br/><br/>Score: 8/10"
"JappJapp","10","0","1","30 October 2003"," For those about to be unsure
","This film is an ingenious scenery into couple relationships and sexuality. I can't imagine another movie that has handled these themes quite this honestly, bluntly and devastatingly and also beautifully as Mr Kubricks last film.<br/><br/>The themes that are approached are numerous but yet strangely coherent as they all combine to the basic element of the movie: sexuality. Jealousy, love, lust, possessiviness, faith - Kubrick shows all these emotions in their real complexity ripped from the ideals of one true love and such myths that are kept as sacred in these times.<br/><br/>Why feel jealousy? What does it take away when you betray someone; Whether it is physical or even emotional, why do people generally feel possessive about their loved ones? And what is love and what is passion, lust or so forth?<br/><br/>Eyes wide shut is directed very carefully. As Kubrick's other films, it's very subtle and there is very little pinpointing to the answers of the moral dilemmas. But, this is also the beauty of the film - one is forced to think for yourself. And to think these things: how many times have you craved for someone else than your partner? Is it worse than actually doing it just to wish for it? And your partner, what does she/he dream of?<br/><br/>It may be difficult to understand the movie if you have never lived in a relationship and had to deal with expectations in a normal relationship. Maybe you need something more, too: you have to be a bit unsure if the current norms of the western society in marital or comparable relationships are just what a man or a woman needs.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is definately worth seeing.

","I am a BIG fan of Stanley Kubrick, and it's a shame that we won't be able to witness another Kubrick film.  What he contributed to film could hardly be put into words; he was simply a genius.  His name is right up there with Hitchcock and Scorcese as far as milestone directors who revolutionized film.  Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut', is a suitable and triumphant end to his illustrious career; it is misunderstood, quite ambiguous, controversial and different from anything you'd see.<br/><br/>The usual Kubrick signatures are present, the dream-like long shots, beautiful frames, and a steady, sometimes slow pace.  Eyes Wide Shut' is a film-buff's movie.  This obviously is in no way for the audience of Armageddon',  XXX' or Charlie's Angels'it is a thinker's movie, as is all of Kubrick's films.  Because of this, Eyes Wide Shut' will turn off many people, even some Kubrick fans.  In a simple description, this movie is a character study.  Everyone of my peers hated this movie, all I heard was it was boring', what is it about?', the movie sucked'.  What strikes me about this movie is the fact that it is very different, almost dream-like throughout, but I for one was intrigued from beginning to end.  Tom Cruise was excellent in his role; he really showed that he could downright act in this film and should've gotten more recognition for his role.  Although I don't like Nicole Kidman, she was very effective in this as well.  The true star of this movie is, of course, Kubrick.  Simply put, this is a beautiful film to watch.  This is true with all of his movies, and he doesn't disappoint here.  The story explores humans and their sexual nature..it explores human relationships..simple!  Whether what we see is a dream or not, in the end, doesn't really matter to me.  The way Kubrick explores the human psyche in his films made him that much more unique, and he stripped everything down to the bare essence in EWS and said, this is how we are, like it or not, LOOK'.  Whether or not you choose to do so is up to you.  I think this movie is meant to be unsettling, everything you see is there for that purpose.  This is a very mature film, which is why I think there's such a diverse opinion about it.  <br/><br/>It's sad we won't get anymore Kubrick films, but this is a wonderful and suitable end to a wonderful career.  The last testament of Kubrick's genius, in my opinion, is a great one.<br/><br/>*** 1/2 out of **** stars"
"reporterman2000","9","0","1","22 August 2003"," Sexual film noir
","The only adequate description I can think of for ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is that it's a sexual film noir, an erotic mystery wrapped in an X-rated enigma. Tom Cruise is the befuddled detective, fumbling his way through the darkness searching for the light, and Nicole Kidman is the femme fatale whose sexuality holds the key to all. Or does it?<br/><br/>I never expected Stanley Kubrick to release a mainstream movie that contained graphic sex on the order of ""Basic Instinct,"" though I would like to see the European version (minus the fake-looking digital forms). This is another intellectual film from the maker of ""2001,"" and it's fascinating and in many ways appalling. It also has a seriously twisted sense of humor ... notice the way a ringing telephone almost always prevents Cruise from going over the edge into infidelity.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has said that the whole movie is a dream, that not a moment takes place w/in ""reality."" An interesting point of view. But who's dreaming? Both Cruise and Kidman, I say, with Kubrick weaving the two dreams together, and with Kidman emerging as the dominant partner at the end. (She has one of the best closing lines in all of movies, right up there with ""Forget it, Jake ..."")<br/><br/>Critics who say Tom Cruise is terrible here are way off base. Dr. Harford has gone into himself; his passions exist with his own imagination -- he is literally walking with his eyes wide shut, obsessing over the mental picture of Kidman having sex with another man, and he's terrific. Kidman, meanwhile, deserved the supporting actress Oscar for her performance here. The scene where she destroys Cruise with her sex fantasy is just outstanding. Rade Serbedgia is memorably creepy as the late-night costume salesman, and Sidney Pollack excels as the scary rich guy who may (or may not) be manipulating things behind the scenes. Every performance, really, is a gem.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" is not a plot-driven movie; it's a story, and a character study. Some find it boring because a car doesn't explode every 5 seconds. They can watch ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" This was the final work of a master filmmaker, and it's as great as it is weird.<br/><br/>(Footnote: watch this as a double feature with ""American Beauty."")"

What Kubrick delivered is a unique character study.Cruise and Kidman give brilliant understated performances.Other characters in the film are brilliantly cast no matter how short their screen time.There is a deep undercurrent of evil and nastiness running throughout the film that is unsettling.Cruise's character takes a step outside his normal daily life that is solid and successful and safe into a world he does not belong in, one of danger and menace. Nobody is who they seem.He is in unchartered territory. Kubrick must take credit for the ambience and look of the film and the pace at which the film unfolds, he will lose people's interest along the way but he doesn't care and does not conform,that is why Kubrick is a Cinema great.When Spielberg took to directing their shared interest project 'Artificial Intelligence' he ultimately conformed to making the film a certain way, Kubrick would have made a bolder,darker,colder and ultimately better film.We can only think what would have been. In Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick has left us a small miracle of a film.It will probably never attain the classic status of his best work (which I rate as 'Lyndon','2001' and 'Clockwork')but should be remembered as a daring and audacious work. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*!! A word about Tom Cruise.His was an excellent performance that has gone without deserved praise.Note his acting in two particular scenes - when he goes to see the dead girl in the Morgue and also when he goes to see Ziegler who tells him that he knows about everything that has gone on. Cruise never gets really great critical appraisal but he deserved something for this project.

","It continues to amaze me how the mediam of film in our society so clearly measures both personal and collective awareness surrounding aspects of life and the experiences it provides us. The expansive variety of responses that continues to surround Stanley Kubrick's final film "" Eyes Wide Shut "" is yet another firm example of such a measure. This film has received such extreme responses that cover all ends of the spectrum. For a particular individual to condem the film as ""boring"" and another to hail as a ""masterpiece"" confirms my theory if nothing less than accurate. It is clear that the many of the more negative responses to this film have been submitted not considering one fundamental possibility. Could it be that the filmmaker(Kubrick) is far ahead of your own personal life experiences and what he explored in this film fails to be relevent to you at this moment in time?. I do not mean this as a put down but something to carefully consider before passing judgement so quickly. Do not forget so quickly the release of Kubrick's 2001-A Space Odessey in 1968. The critics panned it and it took over 10 years before people finally caught up with what Kubrick was attempting to convey and it was then hailed as a ""Classic"". This was the direct experience of Award winning filmmaker Woddy Allen when he stated in a recent interview about Kubrick "" When I fist saw 2001...I didn't like it and I was very dissapointed. Then a couple of months later I was with a woman in Chicago who said to me what a wonderful movie this was so I saw it again and I liked it a lot more. Then a couple of years later I saw it again and thought ...Gee this really an amazing picture and that was one of the very times that I realised that "" The Artist"" was way ahead of me. Stanley Kubrick films are notorious for ""growing"" on you and leave you with an ""urge"" to re-visit them time and time again later in your life. I shall forever remain curious about all the individuals who have so quickly panned this film whether they will hold the same view in 15 or even 20 years time. A lot can happen to any individual during this time- a failed marriage, monogomy failures in thier relationships or even exposure to an underground and highly organised cult. Be cautious and reluctant to judge what you have yet to experience. Do not so quickly undermind a genius filmmaker and the level of brilliant subtley that is embodied in ""Eyes Wide Shut"". This film remains a widley missed masterpiece and if my perception about matters of the human condition are accurate, it shall remain this way for sometime to come."
"jeffbertucen@hotmail.com","Null","0","1","11 June 2003"," Curiously unerotic
","Eyes Wide Shut is an adaptation of a short story, 'Traumnovelle' or Dream novel, by the Viennese early 20th century author Arthur Schnitzler. Its popularity was no doubt boosted by the tremendous advances in (and fashion for) psychoanalytic theories in Vienna at the time, and its central themes of infidelity, jealousy and sexual obsession were no doubt very potent and risque a century ago. The central flaw in Kubrick's film is that no-one, it appears, seems to have told him that these themes, like whale-bone corsets, don't set too many hearts aflutter in the late twentieth century.<br/><br/>
  Further to this is the strange choice of the leads, made no doubt primarily for commercial reasons at the time. Am I alone in thinking that Cruise and Kidman would have to be the most bloodless, unerotic pair of major actors in the cinema today? Kidman has a certain alabaster elegance but in the manner of the gallery exhibit, whereas Cruise has a strangely chaste and sexless perfection that suggests to me that he may be a lost Osmond brother. While not wishing either to speculate on the sexual life and experiences of the director, Kubrick's idea of sexual titillation is exactly what one would expect from a happily married man of 42 years. It is in short, an old man's tease of a movie, as devoid of real sexual spark as A Clockwork Orange was of genuine violence, despite all its arty perversity. If the mores of Schnitzler's novel had been up-dated to suggest that the couple was indulging in swinging, for example, and jealousies had arisen, then one might have had a more believable pretext for all of Cruise's mental torments.<br/><br/> Despite the central implausibility of the character's reactions to events, there are many fascinating details to enjoy. The minor players (Rade Sherbedzia for one) provide constant delightful menace, and the overall atmosphere of secret and dire deeds threads through the narrative brilliantly. Overall, a curate's egg. As an exercise in film craft, constantly watchable. As a psychological essay, slightly dusty, creaky and hampered by the rather sterile sexuality of the leads. 6/10"

","This post is in response to a few of the recent comments that I viewed. Franck (Soysoy), I felt posted a very good understanding of the character, but I feel this poster missed the big picture. Before seeing the film I was shocked that Cruise was the lead (although I am not enamored with Matthew Modine either). But after seeing the film, I have come to realize that Cruise was the perfect choice for the role.<br/><br/>Cruise, like so many actors (even some I enjoy like Christopher Walken) can only play one role. With Cruise it is the popular (cliche charm) and boyish (immature and shallow) leading man. Lucky for him, this may be the most common hollywood role. This is the exact character that Kubrick is making fun of while exploring in EWS.<br/><br/>Alice opens his eyes (that he must keep wide shut), in the beginning bedroom scene, to the fact that his conceptions of love and how a woman feels are shallow conventional concoctions and thus he has no clue what the reality is. Bill says, "" I don't want to put it into words."" He does not want to screw around with all these thoughts he just wants to screw Alice. She laughs at him; she understands his world while he is clueless of hers. The glasses she wears are a hint to her ability to see through her husband. Dr. Harford is just a shell, like the mask that he finds sleeping next to Alice.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, after all of Bill's adventures and his confession, Bill is lost and lays himself at the feet of his much more sophisticated wife. She seems regretful that she ever made him think about all of this (by confessing to him about an infidelity) and just wants to go back to the shallow but stable relationship they've always had.

Kubrick is visually stunning, as always.<br/><br/>What is this film about?  It's a film noir, in vivid color rather than black n white.  It's a film about sexual intoxication, and about fidelity. Through all of Tom's escapades and Nicole's dreams, their two characters remain faithful.<br/><br/>This film is a document of a real life marriage, between Nicole and Tom, and their breakup was probably mirrored well by this plot, the only difference being that the characters have a daughter whereas Nicole and Tom did not have any children.  I wonder whether their divorce was already in the cards prior to shooting this film, or whether perhaps this film served as something of a catalyst.<br/><br/>At the film's conclusion, Nicole's character tells Tom's that she cannot guarantee endless fidelity, but that they should have sex and play it day-by-day.  In other words, the only resolution is that the two characters finally have sex.  Neither of the characters had sex with anyone through the duration of a film which is saturated with sexual fantasy and orgies. <br/><br/>
This film is about how marital relationships and sexual relationships interact.  The film also documents the effects of economic/class standing and its effect on sexual expectation.  And it's a very colorful   moving picture."

","Well I'm a long-time Kubrick fan, almost all of his movies are among my all-times favorite, mainly ""2001"", ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Lolita"".<br/><br/>I've seen each Kubrick movie at least 12 times *LOL*, even ""The Killer's kiss"" despite its numerous technical flaws and goofs.<br/><br/>I don't understand what's happened with ""Eyes wide shut"". Not only this is Kubrick's less enjoyable movie I ever saw, but I actually found it boring! Incredible...<br/><br/>I suspect the horrible performance given by Tom Cruise is partly responsible. I never saw such an unconvincing character (Apart from cheap TV-movies ones). Cruise was definitely NOT the guy. Too shallow. A friend of mine told me this was probably on purpose, well OK but what's the point then? He couldn't tell!!<br/><br/>Maybe someday I'll understand Kubrick's purpose and understand the real meaning of this movie. Until then, apart from the gorgeous scenes when Bill arrives at the ""party"", and the overall ""Kubrick's eye"" magnificence, I'm still considering ""Eyes wide shut"" as the most bitter disappointment I ever had about cinema.<br/><br/>Rating 6/10"

","One of the most annoying and filthy movies I have ever seen. Everybody in this movie acts artificial and unreal, seems like they felt helpless to act stupid doing stupid things. All that Tom Cruise can do is to keep his mouth slightly open all the time and his face expressionless when he is not showing us all 32 teeth of his. All that Nicole Kidman can do is to put too much makeup and act like a cheap prostitute, just like her other roles for example ""Practical Magic"". Why would people watch this movie while they can rent freaky videos next door? What's the message of this kind of movie anyway? Freaky stuff is all rich people love to do just because they have enough money to freak out and don't have to bother about what to eat tomorrow?"
"Silverzero","7","0","1","11 April 2003"," Empty, dull and painstakingly boring. A wasted opportunity for all concerned.
","The plot line sounded very good for this film. A dreamy, erotic oddessy through Manhattan's seedy underworld. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are the main stars. The film's atmospheric and moody teaser trailers made `Eyes Wide Shut' look a lot better than it actually was. The real result is subtle, boring drivel that only amounts to being a pathetic excuse for cheap pornography. <br/><br/>I've never been a fan of Stanley Kubrick's movies and his last piece of completed work hasn't impressed me. There is no creativity in `Eyes Wide Shut', and nothing stands out among the evident dross. Yet people still call this man a genius; the mind boggles. Perhaps the film would have been much better had it been someone else, maybe Martin Scorsese. He's created a hellish yet vivid portrayal of New York in the past and I think he would have done a much better job. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's last pairing is indeed they're worst. The main problem is that any less popular actors could have easily replaced them. The chemistry between the two is convincing and ultimately believable, but they know that they could do with better material than this.<br/><br/>
The pedestrian pace that the film takes and the slow, dull narrative fail to help it either. At 162 minutes, the plot and much-to-subtle dialogue are insufficient for it's length. Sure, Nicole Kidman looks good in her birthday suit, but there's little else good to remember about it. When it tries to be inventive it just ends up being plain weird. Very little can compensate for the misery and despair that it digs itself into. <br/><br/>While it is an oddly interesting movie experience it's not one that you will have good memories of. Fans of Kubrick's earlier work might respect it, but most normal people will find this as repulsive as the south end of a magnet. For me `Eyes Wide Shut' is an overlong and hopeless misfire. 4.6/10."

"openeyes","8","0","1","23 February 2003"," A stunning swansong
","Stanley Kubrick, the director of the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""A Clockwork Orange,"" returns to the screen after a twelve-year absence with a stunning tour-de-force.  Sadly, this film will also serve as his swansong. He died last March soon after completing this film.<br/><br/>In ""Eyes Wide Shut"" Tom Cruise plays William Harford, a doctor who embarks on a dark sexual odyssey after his wife, whom he considered absolutely and routinely faithful, confesses she once contemplated having an affair with a naval officer she only glimpsed across a hotel lobby.  This confession comes after an upscale party where they both found themselves in the hands of lustful but unsuccessful seducers.  His faith shaken, Cruise examines his own lusts.  After an unconsummated dalliance with a Greenwich Village prostitute, he eventually finds himself in an ominous mansion where wealthy masked participants indulge in dark ritual, orgastic sex, and perhaps even murder.  But in a world where faithfulness is revealed to be little more than an illusion, can evil be any more substantive?<br/><br/>Cruise, who built a highly-successful career playing brash but insecure boy-men in search of absent father-figures, plays Harford with the frightened smile of a man desperately trying to hide just how completely out of his depth he has fallen.  With ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" Cruise builds upon the strengths he exhibited in his previous film ""Jerry Macguire"" for which he was nominated for an Academy Award.  Perhaps the presence of his real life wife (and soon to be ex-wife) Nicole Kidman in the role of his screen wife gave him the ability to reach deeper into himself than before.  However, regardless of the true boundary of fact and fiction, this intimate on-screen pairing gives the film a strange voyeuristic quality.  Kidman herself gives an excellent performance and infuses her many nude scenes with a relaxed, almost banal, naturalness.<br/><br/>The film is based upon the 1926 novel ""Traumnovelle"" by Arthur Schnitzler. Kubrick transports the characters from the decadent Vienna of the 1920's to the decadent Manhattan of today which Kubrick recreated in his adopted hometown of London.  The illusion is not entirely convincing.  However, rather than detracting from the film, the minute oddities and inconsistencies only add to the sense of unreality as Cruise falls from the safe world he once took for granted.<br/><br/>Kubrick lets the story unfold slowly.  His traditionally languid pace comes as a welcome relief to the cut crazy films of our post-MTV era.  Lingering master shots allow viewers with an attention span of over five seconds to sink into this opulent world beautifully photographed by Larry Smith.  The film is long, but never boring.  The story resolutely defies expectations. Every time you think have it figured out, it takes an unexpected, and sometimes inexplicable, turn.  It moves from domestic drama to sexual obsession to murder mystery and back with ease.  Nor does he offer easy solutions.  He leaves the final interpretation of the events in the hands of the viewer.<br/><br/>Kubrick has been rightly accused of being a cold, cerebral filmmaker. This approach was justified in the past by his recurring theme of dehumanization. Astronaut Keir Dullea evolved into a post-human entity in ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  Malcolm MacDowell, a futuristic sociopath, found his brutal inhumanity restored to him in the ironic ending of ""A Clockwork Orange."" Jack Nicholson and Matthew Modine both devolve into killing machines in ""The Shining"" and ""Full Metal Jacket,"" respectively.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" stands in a sharp contrast to those earlier films.  While Tom Cruise certainly loses his innocence and his comforting sense of security, it could be argued that the film ends with him being more fully human than ever before.<br/><br/>Kubrick was a throwback to an earlier time when the movie-going public expected enlightenment from important filmmakers.  While that remained an impossible expectation, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" proves that until the very end Kubrick was at least asking the right questions."

I can only hope that it is better than this on-screen adaptation.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be boring. I could barely keep myself in front of the television through to the end, and I was almost angry with myself that I had, given the fact that it ends in about the worst possible manner. It has one of the lamest endings in recorded history. All in all, I would say you are far better off to spend your time watching Stanley Kubrick's earlier works. They FAR surpass this confused, pointless, uninteresting work. The only reason I rated it above a 1 is that some of the scenes are visually stimulating and put together well. Unfortunately, that doesn't really make up for the fact that, in my opinion, it's a really weak film."

","Warning: Spoilers<br/><br/>The first thing I have to say about this movie is that it was duller than dishwater.  It's long, it's slow, nothing happens, and then it just ends without rhyme or reason.<br/><br/>Second thing: virtually every female in the movie spends all her onscreen time fully or partially naked, even when it had nothing to do with the plot. Why did we have to see Nicole Kidman get dressed for the party at the beginning?  Why didn't we get to watch Tom Cruise start in his birthday suit and then put on his clothes?  I guess it must be because Stanley Kubrick, now gone to the great beyond, must have been some kind of pervert.  It just got to be ridiculous.  There are Tom and Nicole whining to each other in the bedroom, with her in see-through underwear rolling around the floor, literally, while he sits sedately on the bed in dark boxers.  Then he goes to some sick black magic orgy in which all females march around starkers while the men boink them not only fully-clothed but in full evening dress with big long Dracula capes.  Blecch.  Enough with the adolescent/geriatric Hugh Hefner fantasy.<br/><br/>When I think of all the pulp and paper, not to mention ink, wasted by so-called critics extolling the mastery of this steaming pile... Even the acting was dull.  I've only seen Kidman in two movies, and she has the same fluttering mannerisms in both, and mannerisms aren't acting, no matter what they tell you in Drama 101.  <br/><br/>In the end it was inexplicable.  This waste of time wouldn't appeal to horndogs wanting a triple X movie, and it doesn't appeal to normal movie-watchers wanting a coherent story and a little intelligence. <br/><br/>
I'll be generous and give it one star."

","I love to see people struggling to realize what this movie is about. Kubrick created another masterpiece that confused the audiences for one more time, proving that only a very small percentage of the population can grasp some of the realities of this world.<br/><br/>Let me give you a hint. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is not a crime movie. It is not a thriller either. It depicts the life of a man with a high social stature who looses dignity and control as soon as he accepts his partner's sexual urges. Ultimately he discovers his self again, after he takes a small trip into the night.<br/><br/>Kubrick's sensibilities and talent are all present here. The lust, doubt and fear of the characters are projected to the audience with full control and great rhythm. The music score is undescribable. No one has ever injected a movie with a soundtrack that takes over all of your senses. Photography is brilliant too.<br/><br/>Anyway, don't try to solve the crime, all you reality show lovers out there. There isn't one.<br/><br/>10/10"

While some might label the erotica in the film as hot and steamy, Kubrick managed to make naked women and animal lust feel cold and isolated. From the opening cut to the last line uttered by Nicole Kidman, this will be one of those films that will be simply labeled a `Kubrick film.' While it saddens me to think this was his last film, at least I got to watch this one in a theater. With the exception of this film and Full Metal Jacket, I have never seen any of Kubrick's previous film in a larger than life fashion. While the pacing was a little slow, even for Kubrick, I really felt the dialogue was strange and unique. Coupled with some great camera movements and music, everything is put together evenly over the run of the film.

I do think there was a message, but whatever it was it was drowned out by senseless nudity, sex, and meandering scenes. All these elements seem classic in one way or the other in Kubrick films, however it seems akward in this film. Personally i think Kubrick may have just pushed the mantle on these elements too far. Now just because i didnt love this movie, or only watched this movie for the nude scenes means a have a short attention span, or am mentally challenged. Kubrick had not done a film in a good while, it turned out to be a dissapointment, the fans couldnt comprehend that kubrick had made a bad movie and there for call this movie brillant and listen to no body else.

Here is where Kubrick with Schnitzler's eloquently written novelle about dreams and the desires they create with the analytical as well as clinical portrayal of Freud's ""Interpretations of Dreams.""

Nicole Kidman is awesome in this role, even more so, in that her character is not one that we really like all that much. A lot was left unsaid. Tom Cruise plays the quintessential ""nice guy"" and like them, he tends to lose. It is a bit amusing that, as he goes out to seek revenge on his wife for her sexual fantasy, he never quite manages to get laid. Sydney Pollack's character provides some exposition at the end, but one doesn't really know whether to believe him, just as Cruise's character doesn't know. There are some large mysteries, which I would have called plot holes in someone else's movie, such as how the woman recognized Cruise to warn him, through his Venetian mask. That whole sequence had such a dreamlike, nightmarish quality about it that I can see how someone may think that entire part of the film is really a dream. Plus Alice (Kidman) made some comments at the end that might make one think so. I'm not so sure. The return of the mask is completely unexplained, and so it up to the viewer to interpret. The creepy piano music fit the film perfectly, and the photography was always very bright, odd for a film that one might consider as basically dark. I need to see the film another time or two to really see what I think of it. But for now, Grade: A"

","In Greek mythology, Zeus allegedly got into an argument with his wife, Hera, over which gender was more sexual, male or female;  so, he took a god and changed his sex, and then asked for a comparison.  Zeus wasn't happy with the answer:  the female of the species, the god reported, far surpassed the male, both in terms of desire, and ability.  <br/><br/>Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut is narrowly focused on this issue of female sexuality.  In fact, its laser-beam dedication to the issue of feminine sexual desire is so unwavering that it's easy to be confused by its obsessive single-mindedness.  Although most of the movie's action follows Bill (Tom Cruise) as he struggles with jealousy over his wife's attraction to other men, it's really about her:  Alice (Nicole Kidman) literally defines his reality through her own.  And her reality is produced, not by her conscious will, but by the depths of her feminine sexuality, buried so deeply and so powerfully within the libidinous pre-conscious brain that her waking awareness is but a shadow image of it.<br/><br/>Bill's world is thrown into chaos when, high on pot, Alice's true nature comes smashing through her darkest depths to the light of consciousness. Discussing infidelity, he tells her that he's never been jealous of her because she `would never be unfaithful.'  She replies, sarcastically, `You're awfully sure of yourself, aren't you?'  Bill answers, confidently, `No, I'm sure of you.'  As a man, I feel the object ownership inherent in Bill's words.  And then Alice destroys Bill's somnambulistic, fragile, secure, culturally accepted and encouraged little lie, baring her lustful soul to him with a true confession.  With sultry and utterly visceral derision, Alice tells him, `If you men only knew.'  <br/><br/>Freud wrote about the difficulty of uniting two currents of feeling:  the tender, affectionate feelings, with the sensual ones.  And that's the central dilemma of Eyes Wide Shut.  The real question is not whether Bill will get over his jealousy:  it's whether Alice can integrate both types of feeling into her personality, and literally redeem their relationship as the more powerfully sexual of the two.  The very last words of the movie, spoken by Alice, leave no doubt."

","....and as the flakes start to pile up they form into a shape of a ridge, with winds and melting and refreezing constantly changing the shape into a potential avalanche...One miscalculation is all that it takes to bring the avalanche down which takes on a personality of its own separate from each snow flake's intentions... This is the essence of most all of Kubrick's work and this film is no exception. Each character walks into a trap set by their own empower- ment and the trap takes on characteristics that force the characters to reach for some means of escape  which, much to each dismay, is simply another trap. I mentioned earlier in a review of this film that men are trapped into a role we pursue only to become something we despise. Turning our backs on manhood, however, is an act of manhood itself and the macho image is renurtured. For women it is no different. Their power lies in their attraction and turning their back on it mererly rebuilds them in attraction of another form. The women in this film show power over the men as collective sex objects, circling them in a mansion with an audience looking on behind masks. Masks empower the powerless, guiding predators down false path- ways that can bind them into more trappings. Dr. Bill can only escape his indulgence by having some woman play the liberating role. His duty to his wife pulls him away from one prostitute with a phone call. Mandy sacrifices herself to pay him back for saving hers. His marriage has different powers that lie beyond lust. Women have power as long as they attract men toward them but lose it entirely when that power en- gages, allowing them to be murdered, to set them against each other (who would believe a drug addicted prostitute in a court of law?), and to be made to feel cheap, like some ride at a carnival, even in their dreams. So why does Kubrick prevent the avalanche from falling completely in this film? Or, is he leaving us with a curiosity about whether or not this couple will survive in marriage? The deliberate slow pacing of Kidman's dialogue showed someone reaching for her thoughts as she was speaking as if Kubrick told her not to rehearse her lines, but to reach for words with her emotions just like we all do under stress. The lack of male nudity is a misperception here. The male ego is very nude in this film while the the female ego is behind masks. Male status is protected by the mask while women's is undressed, fitting the generation that Kubrick grew up with... So, keep stretching your minds folks..."

The use of light, fantastic music, the way he captures the performances and our attention is brilliant. Nicole Kidman is stunning, she steals the film with her chilling speeches. Cruise is good too, but with a straighter role. The supporting cast are great: Alan Cumming is so funny! It is very long and slow, but i was never once bored as Kubrik always has an aspect about each moment that is fascinating - the time flew by. The story line and dialogue is thin, as in most of the kubrik films ive seen: this is done in order for us to observe the characters, scene and shot more closely. The one thing that a female friend had a complaint about was the lack of male nudity, where Kidman gets her clothes off as much as possible, cruise only ever strips down to his underwear. BUT i think this is done in order to frustrate the audience, as i think Kubrik is commenting on the unfairness of sex. Be warned, this film is not for everyone.

","i often hear ""i'm a huge kubrick fan, but eyes wide shut is just - insert abrasive adjective"". while i appreciate the subjective nature of film, if you don't at least respect eyes wide shut, you don't understand kubrick. to those who complain it was too long: stick with something which has enough stunts to hold your 10 second attention spans. kubrick may be long, but he is by no means excessively so. i can't think of a single scene in eyes wide shut which would benefit from being truncated.  and to those who try to boil the film down to one idea expressed in one sentence: that's not what he is about.. kubrick is intentionally abstract and soaks everything with ambiguity and meaning, indeed every detail is relevant. but regardless of what kubrick thinks, i believe he made a conscious effort in at least most of his work to get the viewer involved in thinking about things in a certain way rather than making an objective statement.<br/><br/>but enough ranting .. to the film: make what you will of the dream story in its schnitzler form, kubrick as a rule only takes the skin of novels then infuses them with his own themes: contingency and failure, dehumanization, human morality and the complexities of culture. what we have on our hands is no exception, but in contrast to the dehumanization, immorality and failures of government, war, or science, here he talks about them in the context of love, relationships and wealth, entities regulated via the more important yet less tangible complexities of social norms, power structures, and culture, all morphing invisibly beyond the control of any single hand to form a web of transparent forces which control our thoughts and actions. those who succeed in understanding and manipulating these forces benefit with comfort and power. everything has its price, however, and for power you pay dearly in the currency of moral integrity."

","I'll tell you what. For everything that takes place in Eyes Wide Shut, to me it just boils down to one man dealing with the thought of his wife being with someone else. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) is married to Alice (Nicole Kidman). One night Alice tells Bill that she once had a fantasy about giving everything in her life up, for one night with a man she saw the previous summer. This somewhat upsetting news leads him to one of the strangest nights of his, or anyone else's for that matter, life I've ever seen.<br/><br/>
It starts with a visit to an old friend, goes to a prostitute, follows into a bar, goes to a costume shop, and ends up at one of the weirdest orgies I've ever seen. Then again, I've never been to one so who am I to say it's wierd. There is a lot of nudity, and a lot of talking in this movie. It's very slow moving. The characters seem to have to draw everything out by repeating things over and over. If someone asks a question, the answer has to include that same question. A few times I wanted to yell, ""Just spit it out already!"". The story was just plain odd. Bill, after finding out about his wife's fantasy, ends up walking around New York. Everywhere he goes he is tempted by a beautiful woman. Whether it's a prostitute, a friend, a man pimping his daughter, or a woman in a mask, someone always seems to want him. And the question is, will he give in to his temptation and, in his mind, get back at his wife? Or will he not allow himself to cross that line?<br/><br/>
The performances were pretty good overall. Tom Cruise again shows why he is so successful as an actor, and not just another pretty face. He gives more of a subtle, laid back performance this time. His facial expressions and emotions don't go very far, but that's the sort of tone the entire movie has. Nicole Kidman, who wasn't in the movie nearly as much as I thought she would be, also gives a fine performance. I saw her character as being very sexual, someone every man would want, which is why Tom Cruise's character deals with so much after hearing about her fantasy. Sydney Pollack is the only other person in the film who showed up for more than a few scenes. Everyone else had their part and then left. Leelee Sobieski was the only other person I really recognized, and she had a very small, yet revealing part. <br/><br/>Being that this is Stanley Kubrick's last film, I suppose I should say something about the filmmaking. I've only seen two other Kubrick films in their entirety, and those were 2001 and A Clockwork Orange. I've also seen parts of The Shining, and the one thing they've all had in common, is that they are very deliberate. Kubrick takes a lot of time to get the audience to see everything that goes on around the characters. Every shot, every sentence is milked as much as it can. While it tends to make the films longer than most other directors would make it, it also makes it very full. I'm not sure how else to say it. You never feel like something is missing from a scene. From the set design to the music, every scene is full of life. Especially in this film. From the apartment sets to the orgy, the look of the movie was very distinct. And the music, especially that haunting piano, kept me on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>Overall, Eyes Wide Shut is definitely not for everyone. To many it will seem extremely boring, and the ending not very spectacular. To others it will be considered a masterpiece. To me, it fell somewhere in the middle. Not the greatest film ever made, not even the best Kubrick film ever made, but something that will definitely go down in history. And if that's not reason enough to go see it, I don't know what else is."

","Those who have criticized Eyes Wide Shut as an inelegant misinterpretation of 'Dream Story' have misunderstood both the adaptions necessary for an objective visual medium and Kubrick's own daunting artistic stamp. Eyes Wide Shut inverts the psychological dialectic of Schnitzler's novella into a dark metaphysical mosaic. The dilemma for the viewer is not to reconcile the dream state logic to the visceral reality, but to fathom the perception of the protagonist as he is enveloped by anger, jealousy and fear. Kubrick creates an integrated tapestry of the malignant manifestation of deformed desire. The streets of New York form the backdrop of danger and threat; every venality is accepted and bartered here. Distractions or interruptions invade every possibility of intimacy in the film. Sex and death are juxtaposed in a sustaining motif. Like a hall of mirrors, look alike characters, distorted fragments of Bill and Alice, appear throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Victor Zeigler seems a potent, savage stage manager. His final ultimatum to Bill holds the entire plot. Like peeling layers of an onion he unmasks the competing emotions and possibilities of the events. Nothing being said here can be taken at face value. Both are well aware of a subtext. Ziegler casts down his comments with avuncular condescension, like an encyclical from a throne. He offers a recourse to facile rationalizations (as Kubrick does to the audience), but this masks a core of corruption and ulterior motive. He is not offering a choice. Bill is lucky to be alive. The film slips, for the moment, its filters of dream, fantasy and deception and comes into sharp moral focus. Is the good doctor really worried about the fate of his friend Nick, or the nature of Mandy's death. No, his inquiries go straight to the obsessional suspicions which drove him into the night. The frightening, tantalizing implications of his own experience are the limits of his conscience. He accepts Victor's frail reassurances and leaves.<br/><br/>Bill finally finds the prospect of his wife's infidelity both tormenting and irresistibly intoxicating. The final scene seems to indicate that all pretensions have evaporated. Something primitive, overwhelming has taken over, the same force that has propelled his odyssey from the beginning. There are a series of revelations (to the observant and receptive) as the film progresses, but they do not disentangle the ambiguities. Kubrick involves his audience along with his characters in an encroaching awareness, like an engulfing flood.<br/><br/>This director never resorts to trivial, happy endings. His bleak vision of the human condition is the binding element in his films. All paths lead to the same nihilistic conclusion. Nothing is resolved of Alice's taunts, sexual dissatisfaction and secret desires Where, then, can this marriage go but abandonment to the shadows and creatures which inhabit every corner of Kubrick's city? He leaves just enough, though, to reclaim a glimmer of grace and hope, an escape portal from the labrynthe. In this, EWS brilliantly synthesizes the essence of his previous films.<br/><br/>The indistinct borders between fact and illusion become moot to the theme. Bill's desperate sojourn through this modern mythological underworld forms a classical tableau, where the contradictions of impulse and character ARE the projected reality. This should be the great director's most enduring achievement. The cast is uniformly excellent. Kubrick's cinematic genius is most obvious in its stunning visual impact, but Eyes Wide Shut's real power in its subtlety, and the indelible and disturbing impression it makes on the mind.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>1999 159 mintues Rated: R CC."

","This is in many ways an interesting look at jealousy and infidelity that is seriously marred by two elements: (1) excruciatingly slow pacing, and (2) building the movie around the famed centerpiece orgy scene, which may have seemed daring when Kubrick first started working on this screenplay in 1975, but today looks like a pretentious and very expensive scene from a soft-core cable flick. On the plus side, Kidman shines in what are essentially 3 dramatic monologues that occupy most of her time on screen. There's much to enjoy visually in terms of the use of color and light, and the haunting piano theme used during the orgy is an instant classic. Kubrick also manages to build some suspense, but by the time the mysteries were explained, my reaction was, ""That's it? That's what I waited 2 and a half hours to hear?"""

","I'm not a Kubrick fan. I'm not going to bend over backwards to praise this movie because I still feel the man is in love with his own directing style. Still, this movie is good.<br/><br/>It's not great, but it's good.<br/><br/>There's real meaning and wisdom in this movie and metaphor aplenty. It isn't for everyone but I felt it was intelligent and if you get it, you'll like it. Sydney Pollack's performance seems to be the best one in the movie, and for once, I don't disagree with Kubrick's direction. For the most part.<br/><br/>One of the problems is the movie is horribly paced and could have ended at 100 minutes instead of 158. It tacks on an extra hour of basically unnecessary story. Some of it is important, such as how the movie begins starkly likening unsafe sex to death. It's well-done, provocative, and intelligent. But it's too long.<br/><br/>Another issue I have with the movie is with the two stars, Cruise and Kidman. There isn't much chemistry between them and whenever they're close to each other, it has this dry ""yeah yeah, we've done this before"" feeling to it. No real passion. Cruise proves once and for all in this picture that he cannot act. He is incapable of it. He gives a hollow performance comparable to Christian Bale's in ""American Psycho."" The difference here is that Bale's was intentional and effective, whereas Cruise's is simply empty and inept. Kidman seemed to ham it up a little too much for my tastes when she was intoxicated in this movie, and for the rest of the movie did her very best ""I wanna be Julianne Moore"" impression. We could have had better performances and more amiable characters if they'd actually cast Christian Bale and Julianne Moore. Cruise's Dr. Harford is weak and spineless; Kidman's Alice Harford is vile and sadistic.<br/><br/>I think another thing that bothered me about this movie was how gratuitous some of the nudity was. A lot of it, such as Alice Harford undressing in the opening credits, was unnecessary. I'm a man, I like naked ladies, but the movie bordered on gratuitous at points. If you want to make a statement, don't throttle it with eye candy.<br/><br/>Ultimately a great deal of the plot is grossly unrealistic and exceedingly hard to swallow. You'll have trouble believing most of it.<br/><br/>But with all that's wrong with Eyes Wide Shut, there's still a very real, very potent story and message in it. I don't know what exactly it is to assimilate from this movie, but you will feel something from it.<br/><br/>I just wish this story had been given more capable hands to mold it. Kubrick, Kidman, and Cruise have nearly ruined what could have been a much better movie.<br/><br/>I give it a 6/10. An A for effort, D for execution."

","To start I would like to say that I am a BIG Kubrick fan. ""Full Metal Jacket"" for instance blew Platoon out of the water.<br/><br/>The man was a genius. But with EWS what was he thinking. Selfindulgent (nothing new for Kubrick) and plodding (again nothing new).<br/><br/>But I must say this unlike other Kubrick flicks was bad for one main reason the Cinematography was just awful. Usually the trademark of a Kubrick picture is his magnificent use of color and contrast (2001, Clockwork, Barry Lyndon). This was just terrible. Tom Cruise's Black suit looks almost gray from all the grain in some shots and in others looks perfect indicating that a large amount of time passed between takes and some assistant was not keeping proper records or lighting. The acting was bad. Kubrick's films because of their pace don't lend themselves well to American actors who are used to quick pace MTV style editing.<br/><br/>Kubrick's swan song was terribly disappointing to a man who spent the bulk of his life reinventing cinema.

","Yes, it is of course uneventful, but thats not the problem...uneventful is okay, as long as it is thought-provoking and entertaining - but this film was laughable.  We get to take a trip inside the mind of a rich yuppie doctor as he questions love, fedelity, and sexuality - it doesn't help that he is played by Tom Cruise.  Plus, we also get to witness Stanley Kubrick at his most boring and self-indulgent, as if he is trying hard to be as artsy as possible but instead just comes off as *trying* to be artsy.  Instead, it's just boring and contrived.<br/><br/>It's slow, yes, but so were ""2001"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" - but they were decent films with rich subject matter.  This was boring, empty effort. Also, it is one of his only films that takes place in regular, everyday society in modern times - a problem for Kubrick, who had been a recluse for many, many years prior and his more recent films (aside from ""Full Metal Jacket"", which he wrote from research) have usually delt with alternate or futuristic worlds.  Maybe it wouldn't have hurt had he gone into the city and gotten a cup of coffee before penning a script like this.  Maybe it would have come off as a bit more believable where the result is more...i don't know...laughable.<br/><br/>It looks and feels like a Kubrick film, but it hardly leaves the impression of a good one."

","Alternative titles:  Baby Had a Bad Dream, Hey, That's Some Great Scotch, Should Have Taken the Taxi, Slo-Mo in Soho, i said a BLACK cloak,and finally, A Doctor's Card Gets You Everywhere.  Perhaps if these were the proper titles i would have been more satisfied with a film that did not try fit it's measly size 4 figure into a stately and voluptuous 12. No matter the title or the hype surrounding the film, one cannot get around the fact that it is, with/sans Kidman, a TOM CRUISE movie. As such, i couldn't stop imagining Dr. Bill's character as Jerry Maguire (from the film Jerry Maguire), or the stocious blarney bartender Brian Flanagan (from the film Cocktail).  Both Jerry, Brian and Dr. Bill share the same snivelly grin, macho, hey-i-can-fuck-around-but you-can't, woman magnet traits that Cruise coincidentally (?) seeks out in nearly every character he plays. Tom Cruise as a wealthy Manhattan doctor who passes out $100's like post-its and flashes his Doctor card everywhere like a police badge is as mismatched as Gabe Kaplan cast as the next James Bond.  However, the superficiality of Dr. Bill's character does not give the horribly miscast Cruise much to stretch with, so we can't blame the all the horror on poor Tommy. Nicole Kidman, the girlish blabbery former art gallery owner/wife offered the best snippets of acting in the whole film. Her one drunken soliloquy was at best believable as it seemed to be a realistic peek into the private neurosis of the real Kidman/Cruise marriage.  Side note:  There was one scene that seemed a bit coincidental-a half naked Alice steps out of the bathroom bathed in blue lights that seems close to her theatrical performance of `Blue Room.' This film bored me.  Perhaps being an out lesbian,and my sordid past of having observed and/or participated in real life sex parties, sex clubs, and general menage a trois trysts, i unfortunately did not find any of the sexual matter to be too way out there, nor as explicit and heart racing as it could have been portrayed.  But that is beside the point.  Was this movie more excited with the sexual escapades of the freaked and anonymous, or was it more concerned with the relationship between Bill and Alice, or what?  i would have demanded my money back if this film went over the brink and became a gangster movie.  Hooded thugs following Dr. Bill everywhere with hidden uzis, featuring dark and dank underground poker rooms with metal cages reminicent of the set of Rounders (Edward Norton/Matt Damon).<br/><br/>The only conclusion i came to was that the movie was trying to be neither sexy, or it WOULD have been sexy, neither gangster like, and neither about human relations.  It was obvious to me that this film was more like a public service announcement warning against the dangers of the upcoming 21st centuryÂ… A very different outlook for the year 2001, not a space oddysey but an oddysey of human degeneration.  Here's what the film really wanted to say:  Don't mess with prostitutes or you'll end up HIV positive. Don't abuse doctor/patient privileges.  Don't go off to anonymous sex parties or you'll end up with a ransom on your head.  Don't overdose on cocaine and heroine or you'll end up dead. And most importantly, do work out a lot so you'll look good naked on screen if you ever end up a movie star."

","I truly believe upon watching this film, that the people who have criticised it were disappointed because like in most Kubrick films there is a moral, albeit a hidden and twisted moral in his cinematic masteries. I think the wonder of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is that there is no hidden meaning, no metaphor and there is certainly no moralistic hint. It is there to simply stun and to be seen as Bizarre (to an extent it does this) but for some reason, the atmosphere and a lot of the dialogue just pulled me into it's deep and disturbing void. There is no over-acting, no big speeches, no shouting, and no overly-flamboyant violence.

","Please!  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is another one of those bizarre films that make the viewer think, ""this film is so 'different' and strange, there must be something wonderful about it that I'm just not getting"".  It's simply one of those films that plays on peoples' forced love of the bizarre.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut was entertaining, but was hardly anything special.  Alice Harford tells her husband Dr. Bill Harford that she had fantasized several times about a sailor, and Dr. Harford goes out to have some fun in revenge. So what's so special about this movie?  The fact that he almost sleeps with a prostitute named Domino who ended up HIV positive?  The fact that he makes his way into a cult-like orgy?  The fact that he gets scared by their threats?  The fact that a friend of his happened to be involved?  Where is the plot?  Part of what makes a movie special is how interesting the story is while adhering to the plot.  This movie, however, seemed to be one of those anything-goes; whatever the screenwriter could conjure up in his head was added to the plot.  This does not make a good movie.  It can make an interesting movie.  It can make an entertaining movie (which it was), but it does not make a good quality movie.  Eyes Wide Shut was a meaningless film choc full of cheap ""thrills"" because you weren't sure what was going to happen next (after all, this was an anything-goes film).  Of course, one issue I had with this film was the fact that everything took place so slowly.  People walked slowly, people talked slowly, with excessively long pauses between sentences and words.

","I am huge Kubrick fan. I haven't seen everything he's made but the films I have seen - Lolita, Clockwork Orange and Dr Strangelove in particular - have left a deep impression on me. He seems willing to tackle subjects no one else will touch, and the results are always mesmerising. For this reason, I was really excited when Eyes Wide Shut came out, as it was his last film and dealt with another difficult subject - marital jealousy and infidelity.<br/><br/>
Perhaps my expectations were too high. The first time I saw it (at the cinema on its release), I thought it was interesting, if slightly dissatisfying. I liked the way the streets of New York became a netherworld for Tom Cruise's fraught, jealous consciousness. I was fascinated by the way sex was on display and on sale everywhere, particularly in the curious and disturbing sequence in the fancy dress hire shop. The film didn't hold together for me, but I remember leaving the cinema impressed and thoughtful - and contemplating the film for several days after.<br/><br/>When revisiting the film on DVD, I found it less interesting and frustratingly slow. Tom Cruise's performance is unnatural and unconvincing - he doesn't have the range in his facial and vocal expressions to carry off such a tough part, and he falters with the weight of the film on his shoulders. Nicole Kidman is better but even she struggles to put across the highly stylised dialogue in a convincing way. This is particularly painful when she is dancing with the ""mysterious"" Hungarian (a hideous cliche of central European charm, grafted warts and all from bad 70s soft porn). She is best when ranting at Cruise in the scene where she confesses the temptation which drives the film forward.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the film is its pace. There are so many scenes of Cruise stuggling to come to terms with the temptations around him (particularly the one his wife confesses to) and he just doesn't have the depth or range to carry such a lot of chin-stroking angst. The set pieces, such as the one with the whore or the orgy itself, are okay and hang together reasonably well - but there's just too much pontificating in between. The most effective scene remains the one with gorgeous Leelee Sobieski as the teenage nymphet having a secret party with two Japanese men in her father's shop. In this scene Kubrick seems to be showing us a world gone mad, in which parents will pimp their children and only pretend they are doing anything else for a ""respectable"" customer. Sobieski is incredible as the little girl, sweet-looking but incredibly sexy at the same time, whispering something into Tom Cruise's ear which we will never hear.<br/><br/>
Interesting though this scene is, it also reinforces one of the film's biggest drawbacks - its profound and (occasionally) painful misogyny. The women in the film are sex objects of a very particular sort, drawn straight out of Schnitzer's neurotic Freudian 1930s novel and dumped into the middle of Manhattan. In the context of 1930s Vienna, a place at once sexually charged and highly repressed, these kinds of characters at least made a modicum of sense - in 1990s New York they make little or none. Also, by showing New York's melting pot of cultures through a host of first generation immigrant characters, is Kubrick suggesting that this cultural diversity has led to the sexual confusion of the modern world? One suspects not - he was from immigrant stock himself -  but it seems that this is one of the subtexts of the novel; perhaps there is an unconscious trace of self-loathing in Kubrick's film which he could not see because he was so close to the project for so long (and died before it was released).<br/><br/>There are so many problems with this film that I'm sure it will continue to be viewed with curiousity and confusion by audiences for many years to come. It is something of a shame that Kubrick's last film should be his least satisfying and also one which suggests that he died without understanding or really liking women."

","Stanley Kubrick's last film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a cross between an exotic fantasy and mysterious illuminating thriller. The movie also resembles a dream, whether it be a nightmare or preoccupation, as various characters drift in and out of focus during two nights of sexual exploration where opportunities are missed, and or avoided. Audiences have complained about lack of story, immaturity of characters, and slow moving atmosphere, but those elements are what make ""Eyes Wide Shut"" distinct: the story is not so much a plot other than a series of events that transpire each other through identity clarification; the characters are extraordinarily deep and involving, mostly because there are too many loose ends for our attention to stop paying attention. This is one of the best movies of the year, possibly decade, another landmark achievement by one of the best American directors of all time.<br/><br/>True couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are the wealthy Dr. Bill and Alice Harford, who are raising a seven year old daughter in Manhattan. During the film's long, indolent opening sequence, the two attend a society ball thrown in the costly mansion of Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack). There, Bill meets an old friend from medical school, Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), now a pianist. During the party, Bill is nearly seduced by two aggressive, shapely woman and a tall, suave Hungarian tries to sweet talk a drunken Alice. This occurs before Victor requires the medical assistance of Bill after a hooker overdoes in the middle of sexuality.<br/><br/>This first half hour is slow and stretchy, but luminous and necessary to develop the intentions and suspicious of characters later on in the story. For instance, when the party is over and Alice and Bill return home, and in their bedroom, stoned on pot, she questions his fidelity using enough perverse terns to startle fans of ""Cruel Intentions."" She eventually admits to fantasizing over a young naval officer she witnessed the summer before while she and Bill where visiting Cape Cod. ""At no time was he ever out of my mind,"" reveals Alice, ""And I thought if he wanted me, only for one night, I was ready to give up everything .""<br/><br/>It is here where the audience realizes the conflict is the current tension between Alice and Bill. Alice's secret confession is tantalizingly tense as we witness the jumble of emotions in which Bill experiences. This scene is important, and well crafted, and propels the plot into the second act where various, well-structured plot points occur.<br/><br/>From this point on our attention is captivated and the film never loosens its grip on the erotically appealing style and an odd, unsettling, sometimes lewd mood for the characters. The film is shot in high-contrast style, with back-lighting, underlighting and convincing primary colors. The story takes place near Christmas so the filmmakers can take advantage of the fantastic holiday tone.<br/><br/>Propelled by flashbacks of his wife making love with the naval officer, it is at this point where Bill begins his two night sexual odyssey, entering a world in which nearly everyone reacts to him sexually. He first stumbles upon Marion (Marie Richardson), who's father, an old patient of his, has recently died. She tries to seduce him literally on her father's death bed. Vinessa Shaw plays a particularly friendly hooker in which he has an alleged encounter, maybe intercourse, maybe not. Milich (Rade Sherbedgia) is an eccentric, patriarch costume store owner who seems to be advertising sexual favors for his young daughter (Leelee Sobieski). Arranged by Nick, Bill is then given the password to a secret country house orgy, in which he watches, but never experiences, ritual-like sexual activities. He later comes in contact with a queer hotel clerk (Alan Cumming), who makes it clear that he finds Bill attractive.<br/><br/>The film's story feels as if it revolves around the illustrative orgy sequence in a country estate, where Bill wanders around viewing masked individuals performing a variation of sexual acts with each other. This sequence is of the best ever witnessed in film; it has extraordinary intensity and hypnotic suspense. The cinematography is eye candy for the mind; the architecture is dreamlike in appearance. This tantalizing famous scene has undergone digital alterations to hide the most graphic sexual content. The more explicit sex is seen in question from a distance, and is more for the imagination to ponder upon rather than actual acts. If these alternations where not made, the MPAA would have slapped this masterpiece with an unwanted NC-17 rating. However, even with the cuts ""Eyes Wide Shut"" deserves an NC-17 rating with the profound amount of nudity and sexual explicitness. This movie is strictly intend for adults to experience. Warner Bros. has sacrificed Stanley Kubrick's masterful vision in order to make the film more appropriate to younger viewers. That is a joke.<br/><br/>The film is true Kubrick material; the way he pays attention to each individual scene and character; the aggressive and perverse sexual content; the ample amounts of female nudity. All elements follow tradition with his pervious achievements, such as ""A Clockwork Orange."" Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are perfection as they explore themes of morality, sorrow, remorse, emotion, grief, seduction, jealousy, pleasure, and love. Kubrick also produced and co-wrote the production; with precise, distinct dialogue, Alice's confession scene has intense verve. Stanley Kubrick knew exactly what he wanted with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and it appears he got it.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick tragically passed away in March of 2000. We lost a true component to the defining of American cinema. It is hard to believe he would have accepted the modifications placed on his success. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" should have been released as he made it, regardless of the MPAA mumbo jumbo. Nevertheless, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is an engaging, memorable and haunting experience for mature audiences only. Kubrick has constructed his final contribution to audiences and fans everywhere, and it is one of his most artful and brilliant. He will be missed for the great director he was."

","Kubrick's last film is horrendous.  Every scene goes on two or three times as long as it should, and many of them are completely without dramatic purpose.

","I am a Stanley Kubrick devotee who has seen (and adored) every one of his movies, even Barry Lyndon. But I just can't give this movie a positive review, even though it breaks my heart.<br/><br/>I must have looked at my watch 5 times during the first half-hour alone. Nicole Kidman was decent in ""To Die For"" and a couple of other films, but she was dull, dull, dull in this movie. Her affected matter of speech, her drawing out every word (""If.......you......only.......knew......."") as if she were speaking to a group of mentally challenged individuals, and her oh-so-eloquent last line only magnified my annoyance.<br/><br/>I read the book on which this movie was based, and the book outshines the movie in every aspect. Arthur Schnitzler's characters are finely described, the plot is riveting, and you end the book with more questions than you began. The movie bored me to sleep.<br/><br/>I'm not going to roll out the plot, because that has been done by nearly everyone else on here, and I'd just be regurgitating what everyone else stated. I admired the cinematography, the scenery (not that I believed that it was Manhattan - like another reviewer said, Manhattan is never that clean), and Kubrick's ambition. I respect and admire his attempt to pick a relatively obscure (at least here in America) volume of work and put it on film - but the result left me feeling dreary, bored, and annoyed - annoyed at myself for not liking this movie, annoyed at not waiting until it came out on video where I could at least fall asleep in the comfort of my own home, and annoyed that it wasn't more true to the book. Purely selfish reasons to be annoyed, but I couldn't, and can't, help myself from giving this movie a thumbs down.<br/><br/>I badly, BADLY, wanted to enjoy and appreciate this movie, but I didn't care for the acting, the too-nicely-wrapped-up-in-a-neat-package-with-a-bow-on-top ending, or the entire movie overall. Maybe in a few years, when I haven't seen this movie in a while, and I remember that this was Kubrick's last movie, I'll re-watch and (hopefully) see the merits that the pro-EWS posters are talking about. I can only hope, because I want to love and appreciate everything Kubrick has given us. But right now, I can't, I just can't."

","There's nothing terribly objectionable about EWS, except that it takes almost three hours out of your life and returns nothing.  Two words come to mind after two viewings: pointless and boring.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise was pretty good in this role, but it didn't seem like much of a stretch for him.  He's playing an Everyman type.  Nicole Kidman, though, was terrible, and I'm beginning to doubt if she has any talent at all.  The overly long dancing scene featured her wildly overacting in Drunk Mode. (The actor she was paired up with was no great shakes either; talk about a lack of chemistry.)  The toke-up scene a few minutes later was even worse. Did Kubrick *require* actors to talk veeeerrrryyy ssslllooowwwlllyyy in a monotone when delivering lines?  The ""You men have no idea"" line took about thirty seconds of screen time, and reminded me of the ""I AM in a world of s**t"" line from Full Metal Jacket.  Kidman wasn't the only one saddled with this direction, which made the movie seem even more ponderous and self-important.<br/><br/>**Some SPOILERS**<br/><br/>The story line was unimpressive at best, and seemed stolen from the plots of a hundred soft-core semi-porn films.  Everything in it was a cheat.  Talk about a lack of commitment; no one ever follows through on anything.  Cruise picks up a hooker and doesn't do anything with her.  He goes to a sex party and avoids having sex, but he thinks about it a lot.  Even the crucial motivating factor for Cruise's character is nothing -- his wife was attracted to another man the previous year.  Nothing ever happened between the two of them, but supposedly it rocks Cruise's world. <br/><br/>
Two scenes at the end really spell it out better than anything else.  While you're led to believe that there's a vast conspiracy, Sidney Pollack tells Cruise it was all just a fantasy.  The key visual clue which tells you it may not be is immediately revealed, eliminating all suspense in the final climactic return home for Cruise.  You see the clue, completely aware of what it means, then have to sit through two or three minutes of Cruise walking through the house before he sees it himself.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the extremely annoying toy-piano score.  It consists of someone using a single finger to hit the same seven-note run, over and over again throughout the movie.  Ugh.  It's supposed to indicate suspense, but all it does is set your teeth on edge.<br/><br/>I know Kubrick is a god to some people, but this movie is NOTHING like 2001 or A Clockwork Orange, or even the first half of Full Metal Jacket.  It's a waste of money, time, and talent.  If it looks appealing to you, I'd suggest waiting until it's on the movie channels.  Don't waste any more money on it."

","I have liked many of Stanley Kubrick's films, but this ain't one of 'em. I doubt that editing this movie could help either its excruciating pace or its insufferable dialogue. Just count the number of times the characters repeat questions they are asked. Slow movies are not necessarily dull, but Eyes Wide Shut demonstrates that the reverse is certainly true."
"Brian-272","10","0","1","14 October 2000"," The final movie from legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. A masterpiece. A film of character study and discovery. A must see.
","Anyone who knows anything about legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick knows just what a perfectionist he is when it comes to filmmaking. Kubrick takes the viewer down a haunting journey in every film he produces especially so in his final film ""Eyes Wide Shut"". The long length and creepy musical score of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" along with many other Kubrick films keep viewers in suspense, those Kubrick methods keep viewers in haunting drama  throughout his movies, but that is only an element of intrigue that Kubrick uses in his plots leading up to surprises and hidden secrets to be discovered. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" has Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star as an affluent couple in crisis. Cruise a Manhattan doctor begins to embark on a bizarre odyssey of sexual discovery after his wife (Kidman) admits to an unfulfilled romantic fantasy involving an attractive stranger. Cruise discovers a strange and underworld sex subculture through the streets of New York City. To his shock and amazement he finds that even close friends that he thought he knew well happen to be apart of this strange sex subculture. Cruise then tells his wife (Kidman) about his bizarre odyssey then in the films ending the couple both once again discover there sexual feelings. Though Kubrick's long drawn out pace and haunting score are complicated to many he sends some very clear messages with his final work ""Eyes Wide Shut"" one when beginning with a crisis individuals must go through a journey of discovery. Second a journey can lead to a unknown subculture that test sanity. Third through a journey discovery is found as in this films case it's sexual and morality leading Cruise back to Kidman no matter how bad or insecure the situation anyone can learn to enjoy what they have. What one person learns through a journey of discovery the other can be eager to take part in related things, as evidenced by Nicole Kidman's last words in the movie after Tom ended his odyssey watch and you will understand. A masterpiece and a tribute to Stanley Kubrick it's nice his final film was so great he always wanted a film to be a search and discovery to the viewer no matter how complicated. You male viewers get a treat you get a couple scenes of Nicole Kidman nude, but this film has so much more it's a meaning of discovery. It took me two viewings to fully understand the meaning that's why I feel anyone should watch ""Eyes Wide Shut"" it educates a viewer to explore and think."

For the film to progress like it did i thought the ending was a huge dissapointment that almost demeaned its built up efforts.  For the events that took place in the film i was expecting it to have had more of a twist at the end instead of resolving things with the characters forgiving each other.  What was Stanly Kubrick's message?........does any one really know?"
"ciervo-3","10","0","1","11 August 2000"," Excellent Movie
","Eyes Wide Shut is the last film of director Stanley Kubrick. It was not what I expected when I saw it in the theatre. The media made it out to be like it was some kind of porno where cruise and kidman had sex through the whole movie. It was so much more then just sex though.<br/><br/>After getting stoned, Alice Harford (Kidman) tells Dr. Bill Harford (Cruise) about a sexual fantasy she had with a naval officer. Then Dr. Harford receives a phone call telling him that one of his patients has just past away, and his sexual odyssey begins which eventually leads him to a gathering of some sort of cult where the infamous orgy scene takes place. So the film could be rated R instead of NC-17, this scene was severely edited.<br/><br/>As with any Kubrick film, the music blended in perfectly. Cruise and Kidman were excellent. And, of course, Kubrick's directing was amazing. I only wonder how much better this film would have been if Kubrick was still alive to tinker with it. Although, he probably wouldn't have changed much since the film is a masterpiece."

","After seeing 2001, Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, and The Shining, I had to see this.  The previews and hype a year ago made this seem like a porn film to suck in viewers.  Even after you've rented the film, the film still tries to decieve you by putting the nudity scenes in the beginning. Halfway through the film, thoughts and questions quickly come up:<br/><br/>""Wow, there's not much nudity after the beginning, and the beginning is where all the footage for the previews came from.  That was no accident.""<br/><br/>""What did the I-love-you-house-call scene have to do with anything?""<br/><br/>""There's not much sense of direction here.""<br/><br/>""Am I missing something?""<br/><br/>""What's going on here?  Will someone please tell me?""<br/><br/>And then, after the film is over, more questions:<br/><br/>""What was the costume ballet thing all about?  Who were they?  Was that all a set up for Harford?""<br/><br/>""So a hooker Harford never had sex with was diagnosed with HIV.  So what? It's a hooker!""<br/><br/>""About a third of those scenes should've ended up on the cutting room floor. A lot of scenes pop up that have no signifigance later in the movie.""<br/><br/>I'm sure you'll find many more questions about the movie that will never be answered.  Maybe Kubrick knew he was going to die and just wanted to make a confusing movie with unanswered questions just to drive us crazy."

"FeverDog","Null","0","1","7 August 2000"," Jeez, where do I start??? (SPOILERS)
","Ok, so I just finally saw Eyes Wide Shut last night during Cinemax's Kubrick-fest, and I've so so many issues with it:<br/><br/>Let's talk up the good first.  Nicole's stoned confession that kicks off Tom's torment is a stellar display of acting chops. Absolutely mesmerizing. I've been a vocal defendant of her underappreciated talent ever since Dead Calm, and her performance here confirms my beliefs even more after Malice and My Life. (Too bad that after this scene she pretty much gets tossed aside in Tom's journey.)<br/><br/>Great lighting! The blue hues and Christmas lights really lend themselves to Kubrick's icy filmmaking style. And the golden lustre at the party in the beginning made even Sidney Pollack look gorgeous. (Even though his home is roughly the size of Radio City...)<br/><br/>Ok, now the not-so-good. (Wait!  Let me collect all my thoughts here...) Let's start with Tom's performance.  While the wife thrives on all the well-publicized endless takes, Tom seems too studied and mannered to display any complex torment; this may have to do with screenplay itself, since he never actually acts on his adulterous impulses (with the hooker in the Village, at the Big Scene - which I'll get to later). He just looks too tired all the time. He's a truly expert actor (see The Color of Money, Jerry Maguire & Magnolia), but a Kubrick film is obviously not his forte.<br/><br/>There's the sets too. Kubrick of course tried to recreate downtown New York accurately, right down to every newsstand and Village Voice box, but, as a New Yorker, to me every street scene looks unbelievably fake; they're too clean and underpopulated.  They look like sets out of Sesame Street.  And where exactly on Long Island does that castle-of-sin exist? (Maybe out by the Hamptons, I don't know, but to take a cab there from Manhattan would cost a hell of a lot more than $75, and no way could he get out there, see what he sees, and be back by 4 am.)<br/><br/>Now, about the film's dramatic centerpiece:  What exactly is that orgy scene?  No information is supplied about it - not by the piano player or Pollack.  Is is purely sexual decadence?  Are there religious significances? (Everyone is dressed like Benedictine Monk performance artists.)  And, if I understood it correctly, how did the junkie recognize Cruise?  They're both wearing masks, and if that was Pollack on the balcony nodding to Tom, how did HE know that that was Tom?  And if Tom had a vehicle of his own, why the hell did he take a cab out there?<br/><br/>And there's all these scenes that have no relevance or connection to the main story. What's with those guys shouting homophobic taunts at Tom?  On what basis would they think that he was gay?  Is it because he's walking around late at night downtown?  (I've sucked face with another guy on the corner of St. Mark's and 2nd without so much as a glance from others.) Then there's the segments in the costume shop - what was that all that?  First, the shopkeeper's daughter is found with those two Asian guys and the keeper's gonna call the cops, but later the two guys are there again? What is the connection? What does it mean?  My roommate thought that the daughter was one of the models hitting on Tom at the party, but the daughter (Leelee Sobieski, whom I recognized from Deep Impact and Never Been Kissed) was definitely not one of those chicks.  ???  And the sojourn with the hooker who, as learned later, is HIV positive?  Call me naive, but I know of no NYC prostitute who brings a prospective client back to her apartment to woo and romance him.  And what was with the scene in the motel lobby with Alan Cumming?  God, I adore Mr. Cumming (B'Way's Cabaret), but his performance is totally out of whack with everyone else's.  And the information he supplied - that Nick Nightingale (the pianist seemed ""scared"" with two big, beefy guys).  Was Nick really returned to Seattle to his wife and kids?  He had bruises on his face.  What really happened to him?<br/><br/>I realize that I may be nitpicking, but is just a little plausibility too much to ask for?  Maybe there's more going on here than cheap beer can provide access to. [I was on my fifth Coors Light when the film started; hey, Full Metal Jacket was on before this, and the first half of that film never ceases to creep me out, although at 9:00 (after the ""me so horny"" scene) I switched over to Sex & the City on HBO (Carrie's getting back with Big, and Samantha has issues with ""funky spunk"") - how can anyone resist?].<br/><br/>Anyway, back to EWS...I am totally disgusted with the MPAA's verdict, that we immature Amercans cannot view a few glimpes of arty sex, and must be protected with some digital trickery and censorship - if you've seen EWS, you know what I'm talking about (this reminds me of American Psycho, where not the brutal violence is taboo, but a menage a trois is just too must for our eyes.  But this is a whole other issue...).  I've never really been a Kubrick fan; I find The Shining to be nothing more than Jack being Jack (although I'm all about Stephen King, and it's always swell to see Shelley Duvall). A Clockwork Orange has an unrelenting artifice that I cannot get past. I haven't seen 2001, since sci-fi turns me off quicker than skinny boys from Chelsea (I didn't see Star Wars until it was rereleased a few years ago, as well as Empire, although I still haven't seen Jedi. And I HATE The Matrix, but that's yet another story).<br/><br/>In response to that guy who stated that if one doesn't understand Eyes Wide Shut, then one is lacking intellect or something like that.  I realize that I am not an articulate man. I have intelligent thoughts about films that I cannot express in words. It does not equate me with stupidity, naivete, or undereducation. I know an amazing screenplay when I'm fortunate enough to witness it (Boogie Nights, Raising Arizona, The Sweet Hereafter, Breaking the Waves), although for some reason I cannot quite accurately comment on why it's so amazing. There's lots of us out here without the capacity of insight or intellect to have valid, ""professional"" input on this film. Give us plebes a little credit.  Usually, when a film by a legend is incoherent, amateurish (don't get me started on the raw piano score here, which any three year old protoge can improve on), and suffering from a lack of cohesive structure, the ""intellects"" attempt to input their overanalizations onto a project that doesn't (shouldn't!) warrant it (see Lost Highway). Think about it: if anyone but Mr. Kubrick made this film, would y'all be so quick to heap praise?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.  I respect Mr. Kubrick's work, his place in cinematic history.  But as I've never ""gotten"" his work, I must speak. Eyes Wide Shut starts off fabulously, but eventually devolves into Kubrick's own two-steps-behind psyche. This film is not remotely scandalous, coherent, relevant, sexy, sensual, or even important today.  He was holed up in his hermetic little world for too long, and didn't realize that his themes (infidelity, sexual obsession, death, and repentance) have been cataloged in numerous cheesy made-for-late-nite-cable ""erotic thrillers"".  It's HIS eyes that are shut.<br/><br/>Lordy Lord, how can I impose a grade on this film?  I really don't know what to ultimately make of it.  When it ended, I had a pretty thorough discussion of it with the roommie, and any film that can make me talk about it for over thirty minutes deserves some kudos [see Chuck & Buck (please!), Lost Highway, again].  So obviously I cannot totally write Eyes Wide Shut off as a ""bad"" film.<br/><br/>So I guess that my verdict is that we all should view Eyes Wide Shut (at least) once, just to get an opinion.  Most movies do not allow such intense debate.  In this aspect, EWS is definitely worthy.  I just don't see the reason for any deeper discussion.  I don't know - maybe I just read my EW a little to fervently..."

","Eyes Wide Shut was not Kubrick's best film, and I doubt anybody will disagree with me.  However, by itself, Eyes Wide Shut is an excellent movie. Much of the negative response to the film is due to people not understanding the film.  I have heard many similar comments regarding Kubrick's other films, including my two favorite, Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange.  I remember responding to those who did not like either film and challenging them to describe what the point of the two films are.  Nobody gave much of an intelligent response.  Many focused solely on the rape scene in Orange, and a few did not realize that in Strangelove, Peter Sellers played Mandrake, the President, and Dr. Strangelove. Upon explaining certain aspects and targets of Strangelove and Orange, I usually received an ""oh, now I get it"".  I am certain that the very same brilliant individuals who initially had contempt for those two movies are blasting Eyes Wide Shut.  Not very surprising.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is, as most Kubrick films are, a brilliantly shot movie and well-acted, and although the story did drag a little longer than I wished it had, it still was an excellent movie.  There were no real incredible acting performances, but incredible acting has always been an accident in most Kubrick films.  Kubrick makes films that are technically perfect and well-acted.  Only a handful of performances in his films could be called brilliant.  George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Peter Sellers, Slim Pickins, Malcolm McDowell, Michael Bates, Patrick Magee, R. Lee Ermey, and Jack Nicholson are the only actors that come to mind that gave such a performance, and not ironically, all but two mentioned actors gave their performances in Strangelove and Orange."
"Franky","4","0","1","17 July 1999"," Sorrowful Conclusion
","Most people would like their careers or their lives to end with a bang. Unfortunately, for Mr. Kubrick, this is not the case.  His career is ending with a whimper.  A sorrowful display that almost no one will understand, if they even manage to get through it without falling asleep.<br/><br/>The acting in most of the scenes is over the top as is the direction and lighting.  It's almost as if Mr. Kubrick was trying to poke fun at his own style and technique.  At times, I felt that I was watching, ""The Shining"" or ""A Clockwork Orange.""<br/><br/>Also, from a technical standpoint, the picture is flawed.  When did you see a major studio release allow crew and/or equipment to appear in frame?<br/><br/>All in all, this is an embarrassment to Mr. Kubrick and to its two leading actors, who happen to be two of my favorites."
"Jesse-45","10","0","1","26 July 2000"," Best movie of 1999!!
","In 1999, where commercial films were often disappointing and bad, Eyes Wide Shut brought so much more to the big-screen. The trailer was great. It didn't reveal very much at all. We watched the film, not knowing very many things at all. And that's the problem with movie previews now-a-days. They show way too much. Eyes Wide Shut didn't. And that's one of the things I loved about the movie.<br/><br/>This was a very captivating movie. I felt like I was inside a film after viewing it. It was spectacular. The lighting and everything was masterful. Stanley Kubrick has made so many great movies...2001, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, Full Metal Jacket, Paths Of Glory, The Shining and this flick is definitely no exception what so ever. He died as a filmmaker who made movies that were infamous.<br/><br/>To continue the subject on Eyes Wide Shut alone, it was a masterpiece...his last great masterpiece. Tom Cruise's character just pulls the audience right in, and on the way, we move around in our seats to get comfortable and to feel safe, when we see him go off into these bizarre, creepy and mysterious incidents. We feel poignant for these characters, after what we've seen them go threw, in their real-life and dream-life adventures. I think one controversial element of the film is the fact in may be found extremely un-comfortable for some married couples.<br/><br/>But one very thing that I find very disturbing about Kubrick's world. It's the lack of respect he has recieved. Through life. And even through death."

","Stanley Kubrick never made a film that wasn't a masterpiece. True, the gaps between pictures became longer and longer with every release. But consider the idealistic changes he negotiated and plotted for twenty years before Scorcese made MEAN STREETS. Remember that Coppola's star only shone for a decade between THE GODFATHER and RUMBLE FISH, and Friedkin's even less. A tortured perfectionist, the twelve-year hiatus since FULL METAL JACKET further and further increased expectation for EYES WIDE SHUT.<br/><br/>If I delayed in delivering the `ButÂ…' part of the review, it's because it's almost impossible to give EYES WIDE SHUT the thumbs down immediately. Part of the heart desperately wants to enjoy it, the remainder begs to understand it. After two viewings and still finding I could do neither, I had to face the facts. EYES WIDE SHUT starts with a real sense of direction, but ends up going absolutely nowhere.<br/><br/>True, Kubrick never minded slow-revealing narratives (best example BARRY LYNDON) which belong to an altogether different period of cinema. That would be easier to accept if the film did not burst to life with the energy and sense of dark humour that made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE tick. After nearly an hour of hypnotic, considered filmmaking, it just stops dead in its tracks.<br/><br/>You find yourself pondering little blunders like Nicole and Tom's embarrassing effort at playing stoned, flaws which take on huge significance when you consider how trying the director was on his stars to get his vision across. If it is true that Kubrick demanded Cruise cross a road 90 times to `get the feel', you can play a guessing game, trying to pick which scene drove the star crazy. It has to be said, he crosses roads okay, but Cruise looks helpless most of the time.<br/><br/>It seems that in the end, Kubrick's paranoia and neurosis crippled him where it really hurt. After being a slave to cinema - at the expense of the outside world - for the last two decades of his life, his final work fails to do justice, not to the hype (which was always an effective ploy) but to the great mans legacy. You can't help but feel sorry that such a badly-paced film is a poor epitaph. After a decade spent bringing it to the screen, EYES WIDE SHUT will go down as disappointing coda."
"marc_hendriks_2000","Null","0","1","17 July 2000"," Kubrick's mediocre testament; an incoherent review
","I love to read. I love to write. I love films. Hence, IMDB is a website I visit on a daily basis. Often amused, sometimes bemused I read the reviews of films I saw or am interested in. Almost every film has people absolutely loving or absolutely loathing it. In the case of Stanley Kubrick films, and especially this one, the reviews are extreme, fierce. Many reviews of Eyes Wide Shut have an almost pleading character. I haven't read all 800 or so of them, but the fifty or so that I DID read (like: `It takes a certain intellect to understand this film, and people who didn't like this film surely didn't understand it'), made me feel thankful for the existence of the internet; put all 800 or so people who commented on this film in one room and you'd have world war III.<br/><br/>Obvious, hidden, or even non-existent deeper meanings have always been the driving forces for some reviewers. For example, Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert saw something he didn't like in Blue Velvet and dismissed it as a film full of hatred of women. The same Ebert saw some kind of message in the piece of crap that `Last House On the Left' is, and called it a masterpiece. Both films contain the rape of women, but whereas the first one is a rather professional, well-written, well-acted, well-directed, and well-photographed film, the latter is an amateurish and cheap looking slasher-film, made by people who apparently didn't even have the slightest idea of how to hold a camera. Ah, yes, the power of subtext. The power of seeing what you want to see. John McCarthy wrote in his book `The Modern Horror Film', that, at first, he didn't like `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, part two'. When a friend pointed out that the film contains (how original) an anti-violence message (making it a preparatory-study of Natural Born Killers), McCarthy changed his mind and called the film a masterpiece. A satire of modern day mass-consumption. How original! How profound! Yeah, it really is one of the greatest achievements in contemporary cinema. Give me a break.<br/><br/>I made a couple of shorts myself. Most people who saw these, understood the symbolism and the use of allegory, but, even more, some folks saw things that weren't there. Some people got wild over a simple 'special effect' shot of an animated person looking out of his bedroom window and seeing CNN footage of a battlefield. All kinds of wild theories flew through the room before people got quiet and turned their heads to me. I could just smile sheepishly and state that, at the time, it just seemed like a great visual idea to me. The whole short was improvised as I just happened to have a camera for a few hours.<br/><br/>Not every filmmaker is making films to make a point. Not all inspiration comes from political standpoints, traumas, or what have you. You see, unlike what Boston University's Ray Carney believes, even sincere...no, ESPECIALLY sincere filmmaking is about the fun of it. Furthermore, films aren't books. If the subtext said it all, screenplays wouldn't be made into a film; they would be published. A film doesn't tell a story, it SHOWS a story and in that regard it doesn't really matter whether it's an intelligent story full of great dialogue (like Pulp Fiction) or a 'mindless' campfire story (Evil Dead). A sincere filmmaker's film comes from the heart; a critic reviews films with his mind, his intellect. No wonder that the relationship between critics and filmmakers isn't one of love and tenderness.<br/><br/>As Stephen King metaphorically pointed out in his non-fiction book `Danse Macabre', you can examine a butterfly by catching it with a net and take a closer look at it, after which you can let it go again. But you can also kill it, put it underneath a microscope and start to dissect the insect, taking away its mystery and beauty. All my reviews are based upon what can be seen on the screen.<br/><br/>I don't want it to be a decision whether I liked a film or not. Just like when looking at a painting or listening to a song, I want to undergo the experience and not letting a possible deeper meaning be the reason for liking or disliking it (or something in the middle).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I like subtext. I like to discuss a possible deeper meaning. Films, too, are like a Rorschach-test as the images can be interpret in a million different ways. But more often or not, the interpretation says more about the creativity and fantasy of the reviewers than it does of the filmmakers and/or their intentions.<br/><br/>One of my favorite reviewers on IMDB, Hitch 1899, wrote a killer review on Eyes Wide Shut. It even made me run back to the videostore to rent it again and give it a second look. It didn't change my ambivalent feelings, however. Stanley Kubrick was the real star of his films. He might have been an enigma, but I guess it's fairly save to say that stubbornness was part of his personality. Kubrick already wanted to make this film in the early seventies and even when the story dated over the years, this didn't stop him. He wanted to bring Schnitzler's work to the big screen and he did just that. In this film, we are more than ever aware of him and his camera and editing. More than ever, we are aware of him cutting, re-shooting, creating, re-creating. Almost obsessively retaking shots, editing different versions. Thereby eventually killing his work, not allowing it to breath. The film looks contrived, lacking freshness. The film is very uneven; like different shorts, glued together, it uneasily lingers from drama to comedy to thriller. The film isn't taut, it's meandering, thereby loosing most of the tension it could have had. Kubrick does put a rope around our neck, he just doesn't pull it. There's a difference between being slow and subtle and slow and boring. Kubrick's Barry Lyndon was slow and subtle. Eyes Wide Shut is slow and boring. Only two scenes really worked, in my opinion: Kidman's story about the naval officer and the quiet scene in which Cruise visits the morgue. The symbolism found (or created) by Hitch 1899 may hit the spot, but even the most beautiful subtext can't change these fundamental flaws and/or imperfections.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

","An excellent film, and very Kubrickesque.

The house, Nick, Mandy, the dream, you could make of it what you wanted. Maybe that's why so many people didn't get it, because they needed it spelt out and spoon fed to them. <br/><br/>
I have been waiting for a new Kubrick film for years. Funnily enough the first film of his I saw was 1987's Full Metal Jacket, which I rate as one of his best.  I loved EWS.

"Tyler-Durden","10","0","1","6 June 2000"," Summary is not required, check out the review.
","Most of the time I start my reviews with the name of the movie... well, I'm not going to write it as the very first sentence in here, but please, allow me to talk about it before anything else. The name ""Eyes Wide Shut"" could be interpreted in a lot (and I mean a *LOT*) of ways, I do not think it should be appropriate to write my personal opinion about this matter.<br/><br/>You know what? I will go straight to the point. People who are not smart could not have liked this movie. The thing is, as one of my friends said, ""it's a psychological masterpiece"", and intelligence is an important factor to understand this film. As other of my friends said, ""Some people either understood the movie, or they didn't understand anything at all"", and I agree. You can't be just thinking like ""I did not got that part very well..."", either you understood, or you did not.<br/><br/>It seems like only a small minority understood this film. Of course, not everybody who could assimilate it was supposed to like it, but most of these viewers, yes. It could be said that the first hour is a bit slow, and maybe even the word ""boring"" could come up when talking about the subject. When the movie starts to focus on Tom Cruise's character, there is the real stuff, that is what we all paid to watch.<br/><br/>Something that annoys me is the fact that I do not feel like expressing my personal opinion about this movie.<br/><br/>I just don't think somebody who saw it and did not understand it, could read some of the reviews made, and just get an idea, and make their on conclusion, and think that they now know everything about the film.<br/><br/>The movie was strange, that is, of course, undeniably. It was pretty under rated, but that was, of course, due to all the people who watched it and at the end did not have a clue about what they just had seen. They were just paying attention to the ""sexual"" part of the movie, which a mistake if you just want to see ""nude scenes"".<br/><br/>You should try to imagine yourself in the position of Cruise's character, and then, only then, you could get an idea of how would it feel, and you might understand the whole deal, and even the purpose of the film.<br/><br/>Another thing that should be understood to assimilate the idea of the whole film, is Nicole Kidman's character. By the way, now that I mention her... I think her performance could have been a bit better. All the conversations where Kidman is involved are important pieces that could help somebody understand that film.<br/><br/>After watching this film, I am now obsessed with this one word, a word that contains 4 letter, F, U, C and K. This word is mentioned more than just a couple of times in this film, that caught my attention. From some points of view, and in some aspects, the whole film tried to focus on that word. The film's ending was a surprise, and to be honest, I knew that Kidman's last word was going to be that one. I do not know if it's really that predictable, but I figured that out easily.<br/><br/>This film might cause some damage to people who did not understand it and tried to get a ""message"" out if it, because they could get a very wrong message.<br/><br/>I'm rating the movie with a 10 out of 10 score, great film, enough said."

","Bottom line with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" for me is this - I loved it. And most of my friends chastised me for that because they hated it.  Hearing their perspective, this is what I concluded - most people want films that ZIP along, especially if we're talking about the summer market.  Also, most don't want a film that's open to interpretation.  That's work.  Well, I didn't mind the work.  There's a haunting beauty and imagery to this film that lingers with you, no matter how much you may despise the overall package.  And as for that ""package,"" here's what I surmise (after sharing this viewpoint with my friends, they seemed more open to the experience)...<br/><br/>I interpreted the film as one big dream sequence for Cruise's character (hence the title) that takes place after the pot-smoking catalyst/1st Act Turning Point.  Once in the dream, he's offered one sexual fantasy after another, but each fantasy turns out to be a nightmare, i.e.: the girl in the costume shop, the hooker with AIDS, the orgy gone awry, the death of the orgy-savior-girl, etc.  It's only when Dr. Bill opens up his feelings to his wife at the story's close that he can fully consummate his primal urge.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the mainstream market can't embrace a movie like this because it's so open to interpretation.  The cineplex crowd doesn't want to sit there and work out the ""meaning"" while downing their Junior Mints.  What's confounding is that even the critics and die-hard Kubrick fans threw in the towel on this one.  Bummer.  Because like Kubrick's previous films, this one requires more of an open mind.  If you take on the film as a dream, then all bets are off and suddenly, you're in the hands of someone who's reinventing the conventional mode of storytelling.  Maybe in time, people will realize how beautiful this film is.  It sure beats sitting through ""Battlefield Earth."""

I think it is in part an exploration of one man trying to view his relationship with his wife in terms of the outside world. His is a journey where he gains knowledge, not necessarily experience. He never takes part in any of the sexual adventures he sees played out in front of him. This impotence plays on him more and more, working him into a state of paranoia. The sexual theatrics of New York's elite are stunning sequences, and Kubrick's trademark humour shoots through the veins of this, his last film.

Throughout his career he never ceased to challenge his audience with movies like the deathly quiet 2001, the disturbing A Clockwork Orange and the horrifying The Shining. None of his films had as much impact on me as did Eyes Wide Shut, which, after multiple viewings, has become my favourite film of all time. For the life of me I can not understand how people can emerge from this film saying, ""I hate it."" People have complained that the sets feel unrealistic, that you would never find an orgy like that in the real world. If you wanted the real world, why did you watch a movie? I love the surreal and dreamlike state of this movie? I love how most of the conflict is internal and I appreciate the turmoil Dr. Harford has been thrown in when his wife admits to nearly throwing away the marriage for one night of passion with a stranger. With that confession, she admits that she is not as committed to the marriage as he is, which throws into question the entire authenticity of the union. When the doctor goes out into the night he finds himself on the receiving end of advances from various women. If he resists temptation, to what exactly would he be staying faithful? As much as I love this film, I refuse to buy it until Warner releases the unedited version in North America. The film is definitely worth seeing in any version, but I love it so much anything less than Kubrick's unmasked version will not do for me."

","I can't believe that Tom Cruise and Nichole Kidman could have lowered themselves to do such a horrid movie. If you can stay awake through all the street walking and driving around in the car scenes you are rewarded by conversations between characters you don't even care about,  Tom Cruise's blank stares and Nichole Kidman's whinny, crying, stupid dreams were just too much. If Stanley Kubrick set out to make another really bizzare film he missed the mark on this one. It could have been a whole lot better. The whole movie was a let down. As far as this supposedly being a thriller, I wasn't  thrilled. Thrill is created when something dangerous is possibly going to happen to a character that as been developed  in such a way that you CAN care about them. As I said, I couldn't have cared less about these people. If there was suppose to be some kind of psychological lesson to learn it was all to vague and scattered to grasp with any clear cut definition.<br/><br/> I can only figure that it's the nudity, unbridled sex and sexual fantasy that getting the ""10"" ratings from the men. If the sex and female nudity were not such a big part of this film I doubt that many men could have stayed awake through it! If you want to watch a film with real psycological questions, rent ""What Dreams May Come"", a film about real love, with top notch cinematography and characters you can care about."

Jeez, Tom, have you never fantasized?<br/><br/>What this movie could've been was a good mystery, which it becomes for the last third.

","Of course people compare this to Kubrick's earlier work, and dwell on his past reputation - the man was an undisputed genius! That doesn't mean the faults of this film should be overlooked, and nor were they, as I recall, by the critics or the public upon its theatrical release. Yes, it is overlong, slow, and at times rather pompous. Alice is so unpleasant that you wonder what on earth nice Dr Bill would see in her. And the incorporation of the thriller element into the plot is sometimes rather unconvincing. But the cinematography IS amazing (though its impact much diminished on the small screen), the orgy scene at the very least memorable, and Cruise's performance outstanding. And of course the funny bits are supposed to be funny! (Could the scene with Cruise and the hotel clerk POSSIBLY be intended otherwise?)

I just thought this was painful to watch. There are only two movies on tape that I have come close to or have actually turned off and returned without watching the rest. This came close, but out of respect for all the pleasure Kubrick has given me as a viewer on other films I felt I should at least sit through the whole thing. I wish I hadn't.

I have an on going theory that none of the greats can make a good movie in Hollywood anymore. Maybe I have just become jaded and good movies don't seem as good.<br/><br/>But this was bad. Completely bad. I liked the music. That is it. Maybe it's because I don't like Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. They are both too serious for their own good. Or maybe it was all Kubrick.

The message of this film was interesting, and would have been served better by a better script, but it was most certainly not hidden in any way, shape or form.  EWS was (like all of Kubrick's films) a visual masterpiece, but it was also (like the vast majority of Kubrick's films) a failure as any sort of narrative.

"FlickJunkie-2","7","0","1","17 March 2000"," Defective screenplay brilliantly filmed
","It is unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick who has given us so many brilliant films (`Spartacus'; `2001, A Space Odyssey'; `A Clockwork Orange'; `The Shining'; `Full Metal Jacket'), should end his career with this one.  The biggest problem with this film is the screenplay, which is all the more perplexing since Kubrick helped write it.  It is hard to comprehend how such a masterful filmmaker could miss the mark by such a wide margin.<br/><br/>
Let me begin by saying that the technical aspects of this film were superb to the point of being superhuman.  Kubrick's camera work was pure genius. The color and lighting were impeccable; incomparable in their impact and effect as well as their beauty.  Anyone who has seen this film should go back and watch it again and just notice the way the sets are lighted, how the shadows are cast, how the rooms in the background are bathed in soft blue with contrasting colored lights perfectly splashed in to heighten the effect.  As far as the sound, Kubrick can do more with the well placed single note of a piano than most directors can do with an entire orchestra.<br/><br/>That being said, the script can only be described as grossly disappointing. There were really two stories here.  The first is the story of Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice (Nicole Kidman) Harford's relationship.  The second was the story of Bill's sexual odyssey resulting in his crashing of an orgy for the rich and famous.  Too much was made of the first and not enough of the second.  This should have been a psycho-sexual film noir suspense thriller. The elements were there for a good one.  Bill's penetration of the sordid inner circle of sex games of the powerful could have been a riveting thriller with proper follow through.  But instead, Kubrick chose to deflate this storyline with the unsatisfying dialogue between Bill and Victor (Sidney Pollack).  He then returned to the Harford's relationship, which was a character study in `who cares'.  He ends the film as if their relationship was the point, which left the film pointless.<br/><br/>Other than her ability to provide sexy set dressing, Nicole Kidman was utterly superfluous in this film.  Worse yet, this was probably the most wretched performance of her career.  Kidman is not without talent and has given us some excellent performances (`Malice'; `Dead Calm').   Her performance here was tentative and strained, however.  There were times when she was so unnatural in the delivery of her lines, one would have thought she was aphasic.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance portraying a difficult and tormented character.  It was somewhat of a departure for him to play a character that was so pent up and emotionally torn.  He hasn't taken on a part this difficult since `Born On The Fourth of July'.  Usually he plays the straightforward macho type; more action than depth.  I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to rise to the challenge of this character's complexity.<br/><br/>I gave this film a 7/10.  The filmmaking was a 12, but the story was never developed to its full potential.  It would have been interesting to see what Alfred Hitchcock would have done with this story.  Perhaps Stanley and Alfred are talking about that right now."

I keep coming back to two possibilities.  One - Kubrick simply made a movie that didn't work.  Like the father of an ugly child, he sees it as beautiful, but everyone else shutters yet says, ""Yes, what a pretty baby.""  Or two - the importance of something is that it is NOT important.  Like Cruise constantly trying to sway the situation by saying, ""I'm a Doctor!""  As if being a Doctor entitles him to anything - its pretence, and means nothing - just like this movie.  Maybe that was Kubricks message."

"DeeNine-2","9","0","1","12 March 2000"," Marriage is always under siege
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is not the self-indulgent, opaque film that I had been led by some reviews to expect. It is clear and focused with an important and worthy theme. Kubrick is exploring the nature of human sexuality in light of recent conclusions derived from evolutionary biology. The theme can be stated simply: 'marriage is a fortress continually under siege.' To be able to use Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as his married couple, who not so incidentally are actually married to one another, was quite a coup since it lent accessibility and immediacy to his theme. We are able to catch glimpses of what their married life might be like and to see that marriage played out against the temptations of a cosmopolitan lifestyle.<br/><br/>Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford, an attractive, high status, confident male who has always deceived himself about his sexual nature, and the nature of women and especially the nature of his wife, Alice. They go to a party and act out some 'teasing themselves' roles, as they have undoubtedly done before. Nothing comes of it since they are circumspect people. But the next night stoned on marijuana Alice decides to strip away her husband's smug confidence about her nature and expose to him the truth about feminine sexuality, and so tells him a little story about how she was moved to abandonment by just a glance from a man in uniform. Her expression is so vivid and powerful that Bill, stunned and shocked, begins to imagine this event that never took place, an event Alice has assured him, might well have taken place. As he visualizes, he begins to explore himself as various expressions of human sexuality are thrown his way, the prostitute, the gay-bashing young men, the teenage girl entertaining older men...etc. What he sees behind his mask watching the enactment of a secret medieval pagan ceremony tempts and enlightens him. <br/><br/>This film did not work well for a general audience for several reasons. One, many people did NOT identify with the privileged and glamorous couple. Two, the resolution of the theme was without the usual violence and/or sexual indulgence common in contemporary American cinema, a disappointment for some. Three, many young couples viewing the film together or at least in light of their own marriages, were made uncomfortable and threatened by being reminded of their own temptations and frustrations. To have the truth of our duplicitous natures rubbed in our faces, as it were, is not something everybody wants to sit still for. Most people lie to themselves about sex and their sexual behavior and especially their hidden sexual desires most of the time. Kubrick wanted us to see how compromised we really are. Finally, some were disappointed by an ending in which we see that we are human, all too human, and we have to accept that and live with it. Bill, realizing what he has done, not so much in action, as in his heart, cries out to Alice, what shall we do now? And she wisely says (because she has already figured this out) 'Be Grateful,' one day does not make an entire lifetime.<br/><br/>What is wonderful about a film like this is that, instead of going to the movies, fat and comfortable with the steak and wine in our bellies, expecting to be diverted from the irritations of our lives and to be massaged by the story upon the screen (as in say, You've Got Mail (1998) or Titanic (1998)) instead we are confronted with some uncomfortable truths about our own lives, and made to squirm. Our eyes are indeed wide shut, and we kid ourselves and tell ourselves lies about who we are sexually and what we really feel and want. Marriage is a compromise with the world and with our nature. Something is gained and something is lost, but this is no perfect world; and just as it is better to be respectable and a member of the establishment than to sleep in the streets, it is better to marry and maintain that marriage against our animal nature than it is to toss it away.<br/><br/>Kidman is mesmerizing and reinforces her reputation as great talent. As always she becomes the character she is playing. Cruise is clever, cute and has great timing. The sets are crisp and absolutely right for the story, and the dialogue is first class. The sometimes annoying score is appropriate. But this is not a great movie. Some of the scenes could have been sped up, and Kubrick did play the suspense card a little too slowly at times. I would rank it with the best of Kubrick's work, somewhere between Dr. Strangelove (1964) and The Shining (1980), superior to Spartacus (1960) but not quite on the level of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Certainly we see the mark of the mature artist here in both theme and treatment.<br/><br/>For those interested in an academic discussion of the theme (and possibly where Kubrick got some of his ideas) I recommend the following books on human sexuality from the point of view of evolutionary psychology:<br/><br/>Baker, Robin. Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex (1996)<br/><br/>Diamond, Jared. Why is Sex Fun? The Evolution of Human Sexuality (1997)<br/><br/>Margulis, Lynn and Dorion Sagan. Mystery Dance: On the Evolution of Human Sexuality (1991). <br/><br/>Ridley, Matt. The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature (1993)<br/><br/>Russell, Robert Jay. The Lemur's Legacy: The Evolution of Power, Sex, and Love.(1993)<br/><br/>I especially liked the latter two. No longer does a man have to ask, 'What does a woman want?' It's pretty clear and understandable. (She wants to have her cake and eat it too.) And of course we always knew what a man wanted."

It was about a man who is intimidated by his wife's fantasies, so he goes out in a conscious or perhaps unconscious trip to perhaps pay her back by having an affair.<br/><br/>He has several unsuccessful ""encounters"" with various women, which seems to frustrate him more because he is constantly envisioning his wife with another man.<br/><br/>The only thing that I could make sense out of this movie was that Tom Cruise's character felt intimidated because his wife (Nicole Kidman) confesses while stoned that during a holiday she met a man for whom she would give it all up for.<br/><br/>My husband kept looking at me and asking what was this supposed to mean?<br/><br/>This movie is extremely sexually graphic and really makes no sense,and appears only to have been made just to show Nicole Kidman's naked body. Nothing is really explained.  Loose ends are not tied up, and the ending has to be one of the worst I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I have seen adult films with better storylines. I would not recommend this film (?) to anyone.<br/><br/>Save the trip to Blockbuster and watch grass grow.<br/><br/>** out of **********"

","Kubrick thought this was his masterpiece and I think I agree. I'm not the biggest Kubrick fan in the world, but Eyes Wide Shut wasn't bad at all, in fact it was pretty good. Their was a little bit of unneeded sex, but I can handle that.  I loved the music, it tied the piece together. I have nothing bad to say about this movie. The actors were good for who they were, the story was good. I thought the ending was a little abrupt at first, but when I thought about it I liked it because it made me exam the whole movie again.

","After seeing a number of Kubrick films, I still fail to see why many consider him such a genius. Eyes Wide Shut is enjoyable only for the ample sex and nudity which dominates the film. Like many of his other films it meanders its way through a murky story that seemingly is going in circles. Then all of a sudden the movie just ends. There are not too many movies today that can bomb at the box office with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in starring roles. The movie is not bad but it is far from a ""masterpiece""."

","I loved this film. It was brilliant, amazing. I would love to sit around with bunches of people and watch this film every weekend.<br/><br/>WHY!?!? What a stupid question. Because it makes me look and sound smart. While all these people are sitting around, bored s***less by the plot and the story line, trying to hide their hard-ons from the orgy scenes, and the fondling, and the wink-wink-nudge-nudge, I can sit with my beer, and spout on for hours about how Kubrick's vision is meant to show us the light. Hell, I could sit and make up a thousand stories about how he was testing each and every one of us, trying to make us see how we feel about our own sexuality, and about our own relationships.<br/><br/>And it would be fun. These people would stare at me blankly, thinking I am some sort of Academic GOD like creature, while they mentally cursed themselves for being such retards.<br/><br/>The film is good, its not a masterpiece, but it can keep you interested if you watch the movie closely and piece together a story from its rather disjointed plotline. The artwork is good, not His best, but still colourful and beautiful to look at. Kidman does okay, Cruise is kind of still doing his Mission Impossible generic hero guy thing.<br/><br/>See this film, even if you just want an excuse to stare at some ass for a couple of hours. It will broaden your mind, not because of the movie itself, but because you'll be able to sit around an make up your own intellectual insights for it.

"krumski","Null","0","1","21 February 2000"," Should have been buried along with Stanley Kubrick
","Some reviewer (I forget now who) once said of Kubrick that ""he wants us to respond not to the story or the characters, but to his artistry."" If that's your bag, there's much in Eyes Wide Shut to respond to: the beautiful precision of the tracking shots, the gorgeous lighting (almost always from a natural source, like candles or Christmas lights), the rich cinematography,. . basically, all the things Kubrick has already been well admired for in the past. But all at the service of what, exactly? The only depth on display in this movie is in the color scheme. The story is incoherent and downright embarrassing, and Cruise is all wrong as the protagonist. Nicolle Kidman fares somewhat better, as she gets some tour-de-force monologues (which she pulls off quite well) and then is pushed aside for most of the picture, where all the slipshod plotting takes place. Actually, ""plotting"" is far too generous a term. Things happen - but that's about the only relation this movie has to an actual ""plot."" Even so, I could see myself enjoying it as an elaborate dream in another director's hands - say, Coppola's, or Lars von Trier's, even (maybe especially) Ken Russel's, someone with a more sensuous or enveloping visual style. But Kubrick has always been far too clinical for that - his images, no matter how stunning or well-lit, are always relentlessly flat and literal; they carry no meaning or suggestiveness beyond their rather prosaic surfaces. As such, the ""orgy"" scene in this movie (to take just one example) doesn't play like a bizarre hallucination, but rather as documentary footage, which forces you to ask immediately ""Who exactly has orgies like this?!"" no doubt breaking the mood Kubrick is at pains to set. In the theater where I saw it, laughter was the overwhelming response to this scene, not enraptured awe.  <br/><br/>But at least that scene kept your interest (if only to see how embarrassingly over the edge Kubrick was going to go), which is more than can be said for a whole slew of others, such as the ones between Cruise and two separate prostitutes, the one in the costume shop, and most especially the one at the climax of the movie between Cruise and Sydney Pollack. The flat-footedness of the direction and acting in these scenes is truly astonishing for a mainstream motion picture, not to mention one made by a supposed ""master"": moments are drawn out endlessly, pauses exist that you could drive a truck through, and each scene's reason for being is highly suspect. Of course, if you're going to get into reasons for being, you'd pretty much have to throw out this entire movie. Which is exactly what I recommend that you do.<br/><br/>I have a special category of film which I describe as ""'Neighbors' Bad"" - in honor of the 1981 John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd comedy. Briefly put, it is one (quoting from my own IMDb review of that movie) ""whose plot is almost indecipherable, whose events and characterizations are completely random, and again and again frustrates any expectation at arriving at any sort of meaningful conclusion, even a silly one."" Without a doubt, Eyes Wide Shut fits the description to a tee - it is truly Neighbors Bad."
"Rammstein-2","7","0","1","11 February 2000"," Not all that
","Terribly overlong and somewhat pretentious, this film does have some qualities that made me like it. The performances of Cruise and Kidman are above criticism, and the strangeness of the plot makes it worth watching - if only it weren't so long and tiresome.<br/><br/>I hated the music. There are better ways to point something out with music in a film. As it is, it just gets on my nerves (and maybe that's Kubrick's idea, too).<br/><br/>Overall, this film was probably over-hyped, but I don't think Kubrick could have left us in a better way."
"danr51","Null","0","1","9 February 2000"," What's the Problem?
","I just don't get what Kubrick was trying to say with his final feature.  I'm usually quite skillful at perceiving his subtexts and underlying themes, but here I'm admittingly stumped.  Was that his true intention to leave me with these confused reactions?  All I can recall is two spoiled married New York kids having a marital spat and then a soap opera scenerio of ""will he cheat on her or not?""  I didn't care.<br/><br/>Tom and Nicole go to a fancy, elite New York party, come home and argue. Drunk and stoned, she tells him she once had an urge to cheat on him.  Being that most people have wild sex fantasies, this is almost a moot point, but Cruise reacts as if it is the surprise shock of the century.  He's also a doctor, someone who should be more aware of these Freudian things than the so-called average person, but it still hits him like the coming of Armegeddon.  The wife's argument is weak to the point of annoyance.  She makes a monumental issue of his professional medical duties of examining women's breasts.  They've been married for years, she's already known about it, so why should this suddenly be such a big deal?  It comes off like obnoxious  bickering and not effective dramatic conflict.  It's like the brat who whines that they can't have seconds after having their cake and eating it too.  My only reaction was, ""that's her bummer"".    I DIDN'T CARE!<br/><br/>Next, Cruise decides to take to the streets and get his revenge on his almost cheating wife.  The problem is nothing happens.  Every time it seems like the plot is going to emerge into something, it is just suddenly dissipated.  There's an interesting scene where Cruise is with a young hooker in her run down apartment.  After they negotiate it seems like the story is starting to now take shape.  Then his cell phone rings and he has to go.  It's an irritating old sitcom routine, a cheesy ironic chuckle at best.  Worse, it makes the whole scene you've just been struggling through useless and makes you feel as if you've just been taken advantage of.   Was that Kubrick's purpose for some unknown reason?<br/><br/>Throughout this picture, Cruise appears constantly troubled internally. What is he troubled about?  What's his problem?  He and his wife had an argument and some feelings got hurt?  Ever know of any couples who never had any problems like that?  Is it that because two people are officially married, that means that they are now suddenly immune to all human failings? I didn't know that a marriage license was that infallible.   If everything isn't consistently hunky-dory, does that mean things will be fated to erupt into a hopeless nightmare of horror?  If Cruise's character is that much of a spoiled, naive prima-donna, then I frankly couldn't care  less about his disturbed conscience or what eventually happens to his storybook marriage. Come out of your plastic bubble and security blanket and get real.<br/><br/>Is Cruise worried that he is not sexually desirable?  Through-out the film many attractive women proposition him in one way or another, but he is the one who pulls out.  When he is at the orgy, an unknown woman tries to help him by warning him of the possible danger that may be coming his way.   Why would this woman, a total stranger (who is also a hooker and a junkie) stick her neck out for someone she doesn't even know?  No hooker would risk losing her bread and butter for that and, in her case, it ends up putting her life in jeopardy.  What's her motivation?  He's wearing a mask, she has no idea of who he is, and, for all she knows he could be an undercover officer or a corrupt one looking for a blackmail opportunity.  Why?<br/><br/>Cruise later returns to his wife and breaks down as if he just experienced the war of the worlds.  Except for some embarrassing mishaps and some spent money (which shouldn't be that big of a deal to a well-to-do person like him), what terrible thing really happened to him?  I hate to say it, but it all comes off as a 'much ado about nothing' presentation.<br/><br/>Obviously, I'm missing something.  I saw this film two more times, hoping that some new perspective would surface, but I hit an impasse.  With Kubrick, you have to look deeper than the usual celluoid creation, but I simply hit a blatant dead end.  Possibly at a later time something will suddenly occur to me, but presently that's all I could absorb.  I've always been a tremendous admirer of Kubrick, possibly one of his biggest fans, but this film regretfully strikes me as his weakest effort.  It sincerely pains me to have to say that. <br/><br/>EYES WIDE SHUT is still interesting if the slow pace and length doesn't bother you, but it pales compared to the directors' other strongly memorable, artistic events.  <br/><br/>Kidman gives a fine performance, though she has little to do through-out the second half, Cruise is not at all bad, and the supporting players are all quite impressive in spite of the script's problems.  The music during the orgy scene (which is not really that shocking) is compelling, the photographic images are splendid and engrossing as they always have been, but the story falls short.   I just feel it didn't come close to its actual potential, whatever that precisely was.   Later, it starts to turn into a mystery thriller, and just when that started to involve me, the rug got pulled out again.  Was that his purpose for some reason?  Was it his intention for the viewer to be left with deliberate mixed feelings?  Was he saying that many of our problems and worries are mainly just in our minds? Are we suppose to be left confused and not knowing?  Is it possible that ""knowing"" doesn't really change anything and that perhaps it can even worsen things?  I could go on and on, but hopefully you got the idea.  Somebody tell me - WHAT WAS THE POINT?<br/><br/>Truthfully, I hope I will eventually change my ambivalent views of this great director's final work.  He contributed so much to the art and to his fans.  His influence was overpowering.  Simply put -  There will never be another Kubrick.  It's for these great reasons that I felt disappointed with this interesting failure."

","Being an estimator of stanley kubrick's cinematography, I expected EWS to be a much better movie.  Instead, it has been a big delusion.<br/><br/>First tom cruise is absolutely unfit for his role>he is good at piloting jet fighters and making cocktails, but he has nothing to do with the character he plays, nor with the movie and that it is all to evident.  Nicole kidman is slightly better and more credible, but that is not enough since her role is indeed secondary to that of her husband.  Furthermore, the couple interaction is very limited and remains fundamentally unexplored.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie is about some of kidman's innocent sexual fantasy, which cruise cannot digest.  So he tries in every possible way to vindicate his offended ego, without being able to do so, not even in a huge luxury brothel, filled with naked women beyond imaginable and reasonable.  And so, after the two stars appear to have metabolised their ghosts, they also came up with the stunning conclusion: we must have more sex!!<br/><br/>My impression is that kubrick had an idea, and was unable to find the ideal actors, so he settled for a second or maybe forth best, since the choices available around where limited. Secondly, I suspect that if the director had had the time to complete his work, this movie would have been substantially different and less clumsy.  Finally, if there is something good about the movie, that has more to do with its marketing rather than the movie itself."

","Stanley Kubrick's 17th and final film as director, Eyes Wide Shut felt like his equivalent of Scorcese's ""After Hours"". Both relatively low-key works directed by outstanding professionals, concerning a series of interconnected and ever-more bizarre incidents that befall one man in the underside of life.<br/><br/>Where Kubrick's differs is that it has no thread of humour and takes a dark and regularly disturbing path. Interestingly, the action can be largely predicted by the colours used within. For longing and inactivity there is a blue hue shrouding the players. For unrestrained sexual desire and activity there are oranges and autumn reddish shades, be they the lighting or the backdrop.<br/><br/>In the middle of this is Cruise, spectacularly turning his back on the macho roles of ""Top Gun"" that have held him down for so long. There are points at the beginning of the movie where he looks a little strained, as with Kidman at the end of the film, though this can be largely put down to Kubrick's 50-100 takes, and both generally give career-best performances.<br/><br/>On the negative side, some of the incidental music is too instrusive, particularly the piano stabs, which seem to want to be Psycho-Jaws with bells on; though there is a neat joke that Kubrick pulls twice by having the soundtrack playing, only for Cruise to turn it down as part of a CD in the film. There is a nice use of fades to break the scenes cleanly, and scenes are sustained, though often the jump cuts are botched and the film literally jumps and crackles and one piece of film follows another. Who did the editing on this one, Edwards Scissorhands?<br/><br/>Ultimately, if the film gets bad press then it would be in the wake of being the arguably the most-hyped Kubrick movie, save A Clockwork Orange, and an anti-climax (no pun intended) is inevitable. After two years in production we had a right to expect a classic, and Eyes Wide Shut isn't it. Though while not scaling the heights of the aforementioned ""Orange"", or even living up to ""2001"" or ""Dr. Strangelove"" (how many films could?), Eyes Wide Shut is still a worthy film to enter the Kubrick canon and a worthwhile film for him to end his career on. His autumn years never produced such genius (his previous film, Full Metal Jacket, was, let's be truly honest, nothing outstanding), and Eyes Wide Shut is probably the best of his last four directoral works. One of the major problems is that it doesn't seem to have anything to say, although it's interesting how some intervention occurs every time Cruise tries to conduct extra-marital conduct, as if some moral guardian angel is watching over him. While the amount of sexual debauchery can seem far-fetched, the actual sexual act is overplayed on advance publicity and actually has very little involvement in the final product. The much-discussed ""orgy"" (childishly and detractingly edited for American release), is over in little over a minute, and strains towards art rather than pornography, as one would expect from Kubrick's stature.<br/><br/>Warning - possible spoiler ahead. The largest weakness in the movie is the sense of pointlessness at the climax. While, again like ""After Hours"", this film has an off-beat denouement, this one has no singing ""Is that all there is?"" to enforce the irony and subsequently falls flat. Almost like a game, we have followed the three big stars (Cruise-Kidman-Kubrick) through 2 hours, 39 minutes of intoxicating plotting only to find we're supposed to wake up sober and leave the theatre on the nearest exit to your right. A dissapointment, but not enough to destroy what is still a fine achievement."

Over-long, over-laboured, and certainly over-hyped, it manages to bring out the worst performances in an otherwise talented cast. It looks great, as you would reasonably expect, but a movie needs more than sets, costumes, and photography.

How the events that follow relate to his relationship is questionable, and I felt a bit disappointed when the ""thriller"" aspect of the film was ultimately dropped, rather anti-climactically<br/><br/>It seems to me that thematically, Kubrick has some definite ideas, but trying hard to make them entertaining (and perhaps shocking), he wastes time that could have been spent on a more thoughtful interplay between Cruise and Kidman..  maybe I just took it the wrong way, but my initial impression regarding this film is a negative one..."

","Yes, I am sad to report that the film that kept audiences waiting so long is very disappointing. The plot is quite close to that of Arthur Schnitzler's 'Traumnovelle'. However, this is a two and a half hour film based on a ninety page novella, which takes a similar time to read. Surely that is crazy? Tecnically, the film boasts all of the attributes which have made Kubrick one of THE greats. However, as with the Shining, form has taken priority over content leaving the poor viewer with a often beautiful looking but very dull film. The issues of jealousy that dominate the film are not taken to resolution in a satisfactory manner at all and the film as a whole falls apart around half way through, after a major scene which is far too long and sadly comical rather than erotic. Kubrick seems to have found something of a dilemma in taking 'Traumnovelle' to the screen. What to modernise and what to leave 'timeless'? The fantasy/erotic parts of the film are rendered somewhat silly and out-of-date in appearence. A shame that the great man's last film is his second turkey."
"songlife","Null","0","1","10 September 1999"," Why so many people don't like this movie
","EYES WIDE SHUT is an excellent film to use to determine, at least in part, the level of intelligence of the person you watched it with, based on their comments about it afterwards. Opinions are extremely divided on this movie, and following are the partial reasons why some don't like it; but ultimately, anyone who claims EYES is a failure is not worth wasting your breath on. If they watched this movie all the way through, and had only negative comments about it, you can be assured that their eyes do not see, and their minds cannot comprehend, brilliance. And I don't mean 'questionable brilliance' as in a sculpture or some other work of art which some claim is a masterpiece and others regard as horrible; I'm talking about palpable, obvious brilliance that anyone who is not a media slave can recognize. Many reviewers, professional and otherwise, claim that EYES didn't 'live up its hype'. These people are merely conformists guided only by what they see and hear on TV. They had false expectations of perhaps a sexy, light drama along the lines of most the other 'married stars' fodder they've been fed in recent years. When EYES turns out to be a daring, deep, esoteric thriller about the darker side of marriage, and very different from any other movie, they feel they've been 'let down'. These people are hopelessly anesthetized by the media, and are better off with Adam Sandler films, when they know what to expect: brainless drivel, which fulfills their deep desire to escape from having to use their intelligence. EYES is definitely not a movie for people who really think Sandler comedies are hilarious. Those people need shi* to survive, and there's plenty of it out there for them to roll in. You shouldn't bother them to try to explain EYES, or beseech them to go see it again; this is caviar and they only know oatmeal. In addition to saying it's ""not what they expected"", they're the same people who complain about the 'piano pinging' or call the film 'too weird'. Also, some people have seen Kubrick's previous films, and therefore expected something outrageous, as in Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket. They see EYES as merely a film in which Cruise walks around the streets for the whole movie: with few action sequences, they walk out and label the film a failure. They can't appreciate anything but that which holds their interest at the moment. Yet they believe that because they watch Kubrick films, they are on some higher level than Sandler fans. They are wrong. But the most prevalent and disturbing reviewers have been women. Apparently, this masterpiece is completely misunderstood by many women, whose opinions I've heard personally and in print, and without exception are highly critical. The orgy sequence in particular has caused a lot of women to say the film is merely soft porno, and/or pretentious and unbelievable; and they have misinterpreted (to an amazing degree) the fact that for the most part, only women are naked, and Cruise has no nude scenes. As if Kubrick should have inserted a gratuitous shot of a naked Cruise in order to pacify some really stupid people and 'live up to the hype'. These complaints are just ridiculous and juvenile. In Clockwork Orange, the complaints about excessive misogynistic tendencies were justified: none of that stuff was in the book, it was Kubrick's obnoxious way of making the movie 'his'. He was still learning how to translate novels into movies successfully. He  also loved to shock people, but he sometimes lost control of himself in his desire to deviate from the norm. 2001 is the exception to that, and so is EYES, which wraps up Kubrick's career beautifully and shows the brilliance of 2001 was not a fluke. The screenplay faithfully follows a brilliant book that was written decades ago, with some embellishments that add to the cryptic nature of the film, but never sacrifice shock for quality, or obnoxiously force Kubrick's personal beliefs on the viewer, as in ""Clockwork"". EYES is pure art of the highest quality, with absolutely no concessions to studio executives or the many Neanderthals among the moviegoing public who crave the exact same picture over & over. It's a movie for people who like to actually use their brain, and can appreciate such things as cinematography, screenplay, great acting, and virtuoso directing. There are some scenes in EYES which will have your jaw on the floor. If someone feels like walking out or snickering at these scenes, they probably should leave and rent a Garry Marshall movie, where everything is obvious and condescending, and no thinking is required. If you liked the movie but didn't understand a lot of it, and perhaps were frustrated by that, it's understandable, but don't call the film a failure. You're showing your ignorance. Read Dream Story, available in a book (along with the screenplay) called EYES WIDE SHUT. Many of your questions will be answered. This film is the best Kubrick has done since 2001. All the others in between were interesting and had many assets, but were ultimately flawed by excess and/or questionable translations by Kubrick from novel to screenplay. EYES does not suffer from that. The translation is excellent and very relevant; Cruise is amazing; the lighting is perfect; the soundtrack is truly spine tingling; and the orgy scene is one of the most incredible scenes in the history of film. In fact, the entire film leaves a haunting feeling. The many Christmas tree lights, the slightly, deliberately off-kilter faux New York sets, and the apartment interiors all add up to a unique after-effect that captures a certain, near-Christmas ambience better than any other film ever did. EYES is to be experienced, not merely seen. And if you know someone who doesn't like it, while you love it, then chances are you have a serious incompatibility with that person, and you should perhaps reconsider whatever you thought about that person's ability to appreciate the finer things in life. EYES WIDE SHUT is that good, and perhaps its brilliance will be realized by more people as time goes on; but I doubt it."

","Having read through several of the comments, I have the impression that Kubrick has hit a nerve so sensitive that half the people who hate the film don't even realize how they've been hit.<br/><br/>It occurred to me that Kubrick just might have been clever enough to also use that orgy scene as a representation of the movie audience and everyone who might be in it. Among the almost human masks are the Bosch-like monsters, leering, waiting for a vicarious thrill when Tom Cruise is unmasked and told to disrobe...nah, Kubrick wouldn't be THAT clever, would he?<br/><br/>I mean, it's almost as if he's not only staged the orgy, he's staged everything surrounding the film, teasing, playing on people's expectations...and then making a film about THAT.<br/><br/>Actually, I thought of Conrad's Heart of Darkness (or Copolla's Apocalypse Now) when pondering the structure and meaning of the film. You have to wonder what line is or is not being crossed here, or what line people pretend to cross but really don't.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't think the film is ""about"" marital fidelity. It's about something much more interesting."

"perlesco","Null","0","1","12 August 1999"," Kubrick's last is a GREAT movie and its tone reminded me of another underrated film-maker
","First of all, I want to say that this film has been targeted at the wrong audience, the type that probably goes to see most Hollywood mainstream stupid fare. That is why most people have said so many times it is boring and pointless. Second, Kubrick made a film with Warner Bros. but ultimately this is a conscious art film that the company rarely, if ever, gets to finance. Certainly is the prestige of Kubrick that makes for a film like this to be as widely distributed as any other Hollywood film.<br/><br/>Having made that point, it seems very clear to me that Kubrick made a film not caring for the size of its viewing audience. When you think about his other ones, he hasn't cared either. But Eyes Wide Shut feels very experimental and definitely his sense of adventure works. It is a very disturbing portrait of male sexual psychopathology that Kubrick hadn't tapped before as deeply as this (very much more than in Barry Lyndon). As time passes by, Eyes Wide Shut will certainly stand as his weirdest movie. This movie was very satisfying in all levels: the choice of music (some excellent somber compositions by Ligeti) and the uses of certain cinematographic colors and lighting to enhance the uneasy atmosphere.<br/><br/>Kubrick deliberately directs the actors to give a very constrained and methodical style which reminded me very much the way David Cronenberg directs the characters of his movies. By the way, this movie brought memories of the excellent Crash from the EWS tone to audience's reactions in the theater, which confirms my theory that this movie should have been made to showcase on art film festivals. It doesn't matter if people hate this movie 'cause past Kubrick films hadn't been well received at the time of its release. Sure, now all people say 2001 and Clockwork Orange are classics but that's just 'cause they've heard others say so, not because they truly appreciate these movies. Back in 1969 and 1971 the films went under heavy attack (check some film history to see for youlself), but still they have stood the test of time. And so will Eyes Wide Shut."

For those who haven't, I assume it was a short scene involving a lesbian 69 that was obscured. This seemed out of place given all the other women (and men) wore masks during that fateful evening.<br/><br/>The only other criticism I would have is that there should have been more of the Australian Kidman. A good movie, none the less."
"Spleen","10","0","2","11 August 1999"," Compared to ""2001"" ...
","I was reminded of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in a number of ways.  Both it and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" are indescribably, wallowingly, gloriously slow.  But whereas ""2001"" made an immediate impact, and all but clubbed me over the head while I was watching it, I felt as if ""Eyes Wide Shut"" gently tapped me on the shoulder - and THEN clubbed me on the head, an hour or two after I left the cinema.  Maybe it's the movie, maybe my reflexes have decayed. Whatever: my opinion of the movie has been steadily rising since I finished watching it.<br/><br/>I'm going to run with the comparison for a bit.  In both films it's ambiguous - or it appears to be ambiguous at first - exactly what happens. But whereas ""2001"" has a ""what the hell just happened?"" kind of ambiguity, there are exactly two obvious ways of interpreting what happened in ""Eyes Wide Shut"", one of which, I think, is determinately right, and the other wrong.  It all hinges on how seriously you take the title, ""Eyes Wide Shut"". (There.  Let anyone who hasn't seen the movie try to get some meaning out of THAT.)<br/><br/>Both films have a key moment of terror.  The moment in ""2001"" occurs when something goes alarmingly wrong way out beyond the orbit of Mars.  The feel of ""Eyes Wide Shut"", the sense we get that the central character is miles away from society and beyond all help, is quite similar.  Somehow the terror is much greater in ""2001"".  But terror gives way to something else in ""2001"", whereas here Kubrick manages to keep up the quiet fear in subsequent, seemingly innocent, scenes.<br/><br/>In both films Kubrick's use of music is something else again to that of people who plaster bits of Sibelius or Beethoven or Puccini or whoever over scenes in their films because they think it sounds good.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" made me hum Shostakovich to myself on the way home, but that's not what I mean.  More importantly I get the impression that Kubrick has looked at every piece of music ever written and chosen exactly the right one to fit in with his story, whatever musical territory he had to explore in order to get it.  (Normally I wouldn't listen to Ligeti in a pink fit - but try to imagine ""2001"" or ""Eyes Wide Shut"" without him.)<br/><br/>I do side with those people who describe the opening scenes as too slow. Sort of, anyway.  Kubrick is merely adopting the pace - surely it's the right pace - he will stick to throughout; so it's not sloth that's the problem.  Rather, we're not being fed enough of immediate interest in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (this is in stark contrast to ""2001"") to get us through the scenes the first time round.  I think this IS a defect.  (Of a sort.)<br/><br/>I can understand that there are people who dislike ""Eyes Wide Shut"", but it's futile to deny that it's very good.  We haven't been given very many Kubrick films since about 1960, and this is the last.  If you miss this one you'll probably regret it."
"Pronger","Null","0","1","11 August 1999"," ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM
","I feel especially compelled to comment on Eyes Wide Shut because I have noticed a huge disparity between the reviews for this film (mostly negative or middle-of-the-road) and those for The Blair Witch Project (beyond enthusiastic).  Others have commented on the latter being evidence of the critics' pack mentality, but it seems also to be a form of envy.<br/><br/>Kubrick had no use for the press.  Never gave interviews. Wouldn't give sneak details that would allow others to hype his work in advance (I can't understand those that felt this was hyped to be a big sex flick...hyped by who exactly?  Unless being silent is your idea of hyping something).  Therefore, one of the greatest filmmakers of all time was, except for a short period surrounding his death, the most criticized.  His work is cold.  His work has no human element.  In recent years we've had to endure remakes (or ""new versions"") of Lolita and The Shining because the new filmmakers felt Kubrick's original was in so many ways lacking.  Am I insane to wonder if there is a connection between his lack of communication with these critics and their own willingness to dismiss him?<br/><br/>One critique in particular has been everywhere and seems to be the new critical catch phrase ""________ is more erotic than all of Eyes Wide Shut"".  You see this everywhere, fill in the blank -- ""Rene Russo is more erotic in one scene of Thomas Crown than..."", ""American Pie is sexier and more fun than..."".  Again I ask, who promised you erotic and sexy?  Kubrick?  Did he ever say, ""Hey I got this amazing orgy scene where people are naked everywhere and it's guaranteed to get you hot!"" or anything even similar to that.  No, of course not.  And, one would have to reaching to suggest that this was ever his intent.  So, then how can you criticize someone for failing to do something that he never meant to do.<br/><br/>Instead, many things about this film continue to remain with me. There are few subjects more interesting to me than watching a character take a walk on the wild side and have no comprehension of just how wild that side might be.  Tom Cruise's character clearly thinks he's going to go to this costume party orgy where he'll be able to get off and indulge his burgeoning sexual adventurousness.  Then he arrives to discover some kind of bizarro, Venetian-styled, rich guys-and-hookers secret society, which might be so secret that to sneak in is a death warrant. I loved everything about what took place in that mansion.  It's grand theatricality, the unexpected sense of ritual.  It was so much unlike anything I expected to see or feel.  It is amazing to me that this has been one of the most criticized parts of the film.<br/><br/>I must admit to some disappointment at the film's end, some feeling that perhaps everything was too tidy.  [I felt the same way at the end of ""Go"", which also explored the walk on the wild side to great affect.]  But the fact that this work has been so ravaged, while ""The Blair Witch Project"" -- a film that every critic must imagine that they could have created themselves -- is hailed as the ""future of cinema"", makes me wonder about the state of the art of film criticism.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut is a film that will be watched and talked about for years to come."

","Was Kubrick a maker of popular Hollywood films who masqueraded as an art film auteur, or a giant of the cinema who liked to break even on a picture? This one certainly indicates he liked to do things his way, but it is an entertaining film nevertheless, despite the length (160 minutes) and the stately pace.<br/><br/>I think Kubrick's widow Christine got it right when she said ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is about fear. In this case it is the fear that one is missing out on something forbidden but delicious, or perhaps the fear that one has failed to achieve true fulfillment despite all the conventional trappings of success. Dr Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) has it all - society practice, luxurious Manhattan apartment, Range Rover, beautiful attentive art curator wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) and cute small daughter. Bill is motivated to find what he's missed by Alice's confession that she had been prepared to give him and everything else up for a handsome naval officer she merely saw across a crowded room at a resort months ago. Fueled by mental images of Alice cavorting with the officer, Bill goes out to find whatever it was he's missed. The journey is an interesting one with Kubrick doing his usual stringing together of set pieces/cameos to reach a rather maudlin but vaguely cheerful conclusion. The unjustly notorious orgy scene is absurd rather than erotic but some of the scenes between Bill and Alice are as intimate as one gets in cinema.<br/><br/>Kubrick was like Hitchcock in using detail to telling effect, though unlike Kubrick, Hitchcock knew when to stop. Tom Cruise breaks down and cries at one stage, probably because Stanley had asked him to do the scene for the 101st time. The detail is truly extraordinary. Just one example. In the opening scene, Alice is naked in front of a mirror above her dressing table and Bill, also naked, moves to caress her. On the dressing table are a few books. On the top is Alan Bullock's biography of Hitler and Stalin. A conventional enough tome to find as a young NYC doctor's bedside reading. The next book down is a biography of (the still living) Lord Longford. Lord Longford? He was the eccentric peer who launched a futile campaign against pornography in Britain in the early 1960s including among his targets Kubrick's film of Lolita. This reference is in the only mildly erotic scene in the whole film. A Lolita-like character makes a brief appearance later on and the angle offered will not amuse the politically correct, or Lord Longford, if he is still watching.<br/><br/>Detail is used for dramatic effect, not realism. Thus Bill gets on the Interstate to get to the country estate where the orgy is being held and winds up in England. Stanley plays fast and loose with the locations. The exterior is Mentmore in Buckinghamshire, built by the Rothschilds, some of the interior is Highclere in Hampshire, another fantastic Victorian pile, and the orgy scene is set in a Moorish style room in Elveden, the Guinness family mansion in Suffolk. <br/><br/>The plot doesn't bear close examination but the script is workmanlike and the minor performances enjoyable. You can see why actors liked to work with Kubrick despite his reputation for inordinate pains - he always gave the bit players a scene to steal (with Peter Sellars in ""Dr Strangelove"" being a multiple offender).<br/><br/>As for the leads, Tom Cruise (""it's OK, I'm a doctor""), although playing the character we see the film through, doesn't quite project a personality the audience can relate to - somehow it's hard to empathise with him and his obsession. Nicole Kidman is fine - yes of course she can act. She is particularly good early on, at a posh party, fending off while sloshed an oily would-be lover. Sydney Pollack as Victor, their wealthy and sleazy friend, is a standout also.<br/><br/>Well, that's Kubrick. His older films stand up amazingly well (eg ""Paths of Glory"", ""Dr Strangelove""). He was one of the few eccentric individualists of the cinema who actually did their best work on their own. With this film, he went out on a strong note, and I'm sure I'll enjoy a second viewing almost as much as the first."

","It seems to me that I had a fortunate experience with this movie, unlike other people.  I saw the movie in a nice theater with less than half of its seats filled, so the rest of the audience's reaction didn't affect me. It turned out that from beginning to end I was completely engrossed. Perhaps my faint-of-heartness concerning extramarital sex is really what made the movie for me. Rather than being repulsed, bored, or irritated, I was enraptured by the characters and the unfolding paths that lay before Cruise, who stumbled along (sometimes running eagerly) to the end of his dreamy,nocturnal ride.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. The criticisms of the wooden acting and terrible premise are criticisms of what I think are actually *great* about the movie. Kidman and Cruise did exquisite jobs--for some reason I imagine young, rich married couples in New York City to be just like them (in a Stanley Kubrick context anyway). I don't think the story is bad because it is unconventional, therefore whatever it may be missing isn't needed. The storyline--man okay, man find out something bad, man not okay, man go for a walk--is simple enough to provide room for the audience to study the character himself.  The movie is nothing about a brothel conspiracy, it's nothing about the weird things that go on in the city, it's nothing about sexual exploration--it's about a basically good man and how a specific instance, no matter how small it was, can throw a man way out of balance so that his perception of things is completely changed. The plight of this man throughout the movie goes from dealing with the sudden change of his perception to accepting and enjoying his perception and finally to realizing his vertigo and striving for the ultimately righteous and moral perception.<br/><br/>This movie is amazing. I'd say there's a 50 percent chance you'd hate it and a 50 percent chance you'd love it.

","There seems to be a general consensus that this film is about sexual intrigue and the relationship of husband and wife, but I submit that this interpretation is way off base.<br/><br/>Let us begin with the symbolism that Kubrick uses.  One may notice that in nearly every frame, there are thousands of small lights, one might even say a thousand points of light.  This is, in fact, a symbol employed by certain secret organizations to refer to their members.  On the list would be the freemasons, the Illuminati, et cetera.  It was employed by a former president of the US on a number of occasions, and this president was, in fact, a member of secret organizations.<br/><br/>Next, when the main character enters the house where his adventure begins, where the old man has just died and the daughter makes a play for him, there is a falcon statuette in the hallway, which recures several times.  The falcon is symbolic of the Egyptian god Horus, son of Isis and Osiris.  The connection to this god is reinforced by the setting in wintertime, which is dominated astronomically by the constellation Orion, or Osiris, and the star Sirius, or Isis.  The additional use of Christmas time, the symbols of which are decendent from Roman and Egyptian festivals of light and rebirth, further enhances this connection (ie- the Christmas tree, lights, etc.).<br/><br/>The obvious use of a Luciferian mass for the orgy is, without doubt, a reference to the secret societies.  Even the masks used are various symbols and images employed by Luciferians.  The loose and very grey morality of the characters through-out serve to enhance this reference.  Even the characters, man and wife, do not refer to physical love with any reverence. It is simply a course and vulgar act.  And that Lucifer is the fallen star, the light of Heaven fallen to Earth, is further reflected in the use of the thousand points of light.<br/><br/>Kubrick has even alluded to his own doubts and misgivings about himself in this area.  The way in which he allows himself to appear in reflection, not a mistake by an amateur, but purposeful, is telling.  The scenes in which the camera is visible tells us that we, too, must now suspect our own motivations.  In other words, this belief system has become so pervasive, that no one is immune to its machinations.<br/><br/>There are many more subtle and oblate references.  For instance, the name of the restaurant in the background when the main character is being followed. The music being played when he stops into the pub for a beer immediately after (reference the password used to enter the house).<br/><br/>Kubrick has sent out a warning.  He is trying to wake the audience up to the hidden messages all around us.  Our eyes, he says, are wide shut.  We see, but we do not understand.  This film bears additional viewings to pick out the rich subtlety embedded in it.  But viewing it with these points in mind will suddenly open a vastly deeper subtext to the film."

","I was, like most people, anticipating seeing ""Eyes Wide Shut.""  I think both Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise are good actors and thought the plot sounded interesting.  And it was... for a while.  The beginning of the movie was great.  The party where Nicole gets tipsy and then the scene in their bedroom where they're talking about jealousy.  Then they lost me and most of the people who were in the theater with me.  Parts of the rest of the movie were interesting.  Cruise's scene with Vinessa Shaw and the storyline with the father pimping his daughter were fine.  But other parts of the movie were just odd.  Cruise buying a costume to go to a party, the party itself which had naked women in a circle while some strange man banged a stick on the ground just baffled me.  It added nothing to the movie.  The movie was disjointed and just when you hoped it would end, it kept going.  What could have been a thought-provoking movie about jealousy left me thinking why two good actors would do this movie and why I spent ten dollars and almost three hours of my own time watching it.  I really wanted to enjoy this movie.  I went to the theater with high expectations.  Maybe they were too high. Maybe I just didn't get it.  Or maybe the movie just was not a good movie."

","What a fascinating -- and challenging -- film!  As with the best of his works, Kubrick combines a thought-provoking plot with a series of unsurpassed visual and musical touches, perfectly accompanying and, thus, augmenting the basic story.  In cases such as this, the end product IS greater than the sum of its parts.  Further, the performances here, particularly that of Tom Cruise, are some of the best of Kubrick's entire oeuvre.  An acclaimed actor (either Spencer Tracy or Laurence Olivier, I can't remember) once described the art of acting as consisting primarily of *reacting.*  As with ""Full Metal Jacket,"" where the audience experiences the film mainly as a series of actions in which the journalist Sgt. Joker participates, and therefore observes, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" can be seen as an extended dreamlike/nightmarish scenario through which the Cruise character, and, so, the audience, moves.

What is the message the film is conveying through the use of all this sexual dullness?  That we should look before we leap?  Cherish what we have?  Be careful of compromising our moral spheres?

Maybe I need to see the movie again because it was too ""deep"" for me, but I kept expecting Ghostface from Scream to pop out when the masked men were opera singing near the circle of (sarcasm) completely essential naked women.  I didn't find this film sexy, erotic, or any of the things I've heard about it... I found it to be dull and mindboggling. Perhaps if I were a man I would have liked it better, maybe the hordes of naked women would have been appealing or slightly purposeful.  The only thing that kept me going was staring at Tom Cruise for almost three tortuous hours... Now why did we have to stare at a naked Nicole Kidman forever but not once see a naked Tom?

His use of music, particularly the piano, amazing camera shots and some of the best symbolism I've seen to date... all in perfect synchronicity.  Much more than a movie about a married couple, Eyes Wide Shut explores the realm of reality vs. fantasy vs. facade... and the blending of the three that pretty much comprise life in itself.

","The only reason people like this film is because of the name ""Kubrick"". If this came from an unknown filmmaker, people would be calling it pretentious, self-indulgent, boring, and pointless. There's no way anyone would get past that ridiculous orgy party without rolling their eyes. But since it's from the untouchable ""Kubrick"", it's a work of genius. Well, sure it's boring, but that's Kubrick. Yeah, the pace is mind-numbingly slow but Kubrick can do no wrong!<br/><br/>Yes, the film is photographed beautifully. Gorgeous set design. The camerawork is steady. OK...that's all dandy.<br/><br/>What about the story? Is that not an intregal part of the movie experience? Who cares, right? For nearly three hours we're treated to Tom Cruise walking around the streets of what's supposed to be New York, encountering all kinds of unrelated people and circumstances. Yawn. Finally there's a lackluster wrap-up at the end which is supposed to explain everything. By that point we're so bored it doesn't even matter.<br/><br/>And every scene goes on way too long. There's a scene near the beginning where Kidman and Cruise smoke pot and get in an argument. It takes Kidman about ten minutes to speak three or four sentences. Everything is: ""And...(super dramatic pause)...I had....(longer pause)...a...(pauses, closes her eyes)....dream..."" Get to the bloody point, woman! She's the worst offender, but almost every conversation in the movie is like this. And this is for almost three hours!

(Of course I live in L.A., where every young assistant and gopher is a Kubrick wannabe) Look, Kubrick was a great director. DR.

","Sex can sometimes make us do really strange things.  You see it all the time.  You are at a nightclub, there, surrounding you are 100's of scantily clad beautiful women.  And you may be 25 years old and you have had sex 100's of times in your life time but the sight of those women make you act like you have never seen a breast before.  Never experienced the raw energy of lust, even though you may be dating a beautiful woman.  And then sometimes the question arises.  Should I?  Could I?  Is it all worth it? Tough questions.  Love is usually described as the one thing in this life that can make a strong man weak and a rich man poor.  But if that is true about love, then what can be said about sex?  Because there are times when sex can be more powerful than love.<br/><br/>Eyes Wide Shut has a great time exploring that very notion.  It examines what the physical pleasures of the naked body can have on people, not just married people, but people in general.  It looks at what happens when one is tempted.  And it also shows what it is that some people think but rarely ever express.  And when it is expressed in here, a man's jealousy almost destroys not only his marriage, but his life.  And on that psychological level, EWS is a brilliant film.  The first third of the film was mesmerizing.  The dialogue and scenes were so perfect that you could feel yourself remembering situations that were simialr to the ones in the film.<br/><br/>
Nicole Kidman plays Alice.  Cruise plays Bill.  They are a married couple and they seem fairly comfortable in their marriage.  But then one night after a huge party where they were both propositioned for sex by other people, they get a little high and Alice begins quizzing Bill about just how far he wanted to go with the two women that were hitting on him at the party.  It is here that the film hits its best notes.  The dialogue is perfect.  You can see how Alice is playing with Bill's words, twisting them and throwing them back in his face.  And then just when it seems that Bill has said the right words to alleviate the tension, Alice reveals that there was a time a year back when she felt that she wanted to have an affair, just a one nighter, but an affair none the less, with some naval officer that was staying in the same hotel as they were.  She graphically tells her husband how she was thinking of the other man while they were making love that afternoon.  And I felt for Bill.  Just as any man would feel for another man in that same spot.  Then in the next 24 hours Bill goes on this labryinthian odyssey.  He refuses sex a few times from willing women and then he gets into some secret orgy and probably almost loses his life.  Now the movie starts getting clouded and grainy.  It is still enjoyable to a certain degree but it is getting kind of weird.  By the time the third act gets going and Cruise and Sydney Pollack do their thing, it is still interesting. But that is where the movie stops being a great film.  Because when Bill and Alice have their talk at the end, I wanted more.  I wanted to feel more . I wanted Bill to not only tell Alice everything but to show her and tell her how much she hurt him.  But he doesn't.  The only emotion he shows is sadness, but not at what his wife has done to him but because of what he has witnessed.  It is so unfortunate that the film wasn't concluded with more energy because EWS has many things to say but just no way of ending them. It just sort of leaves the viewer hanging.<br/><br/>I loved the way this film looked.  It made me feel like I was watching The Shining or A Clockwork Orange.  It had that 70's feel to it.  And as I have said, it was a good film, with so much energy and lots of insight to sex and infidelity and love and lust, but it just left me hollow at the end.  And that is a shame, because it was so bright, so ambitious, so witty and so sexy.  But the end just feels not so bright, not so ambitious, a little dull but still sexy.  It is worth seeing."

","Stanley Krubick's death is definitely one of the main reasons why this film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"", is surrounded with so much hype and anticipation, however, after watching the film, it is safe to say that the movie does live it up the all the expectations that the country is holding for themselves, there is no doubt about. ""The Shining"" is the only Kubrick film that I have seen before this one, so I was not very aware of his direction style. But as his death generated a lot of buzz, causing everyone to express just how brilliant a director he was, it sparked my curiousity furiously as to what his final film would be like. Comparitively, ""The Shining"" is a horror classic, and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is the current ""hot"" movie that everyone is talking about, but both films clearly manifested a stunning power, a visual, mental and spiritual exploration. The theme of this movie is sexual obssession, and the whole thing is just one mesmerising, thought-provoking odyssey through the streets of N.Y.C at night, seen through the perspective of Tom Cruise, who delivers a fine performance playing the troubled husband of a beautiful but difficult woman (Nicole Kidman) who is trying find the heart of his own enigmatic sexuality. The movie keeps on giving the audience a slew of characters who meet Cruise along his journey, and each one subtlely brings out new-found insights into his own mentality, bringing him closer to his destination. Feelings of envy and obsession are intensely sensed throughout the whole film, and I am totally amazed with the way Krubick crafted the film with such sharpness, you can literally feel of his ambitions, even when the actual content is deliberately vague. When Cruise finally reaches his destination, everything just seems to collide, making him fully understand the true meaning of sexuality. The final confrontation between Cruise and Kidman is absolutely unforgettable, as it honestly depicts the extreme complications that exist in marriage. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is definitely a film that will leave you thinking about the instincts of humanity, and how they are ultimately one of the most puzzling things on this earth. A brilliant film."

","If you haven't figured out by the final frames what ""Eyes Wide Shut"" really means, then you just didn't get this movie.  Ironically, in order to get it, you have to keep your eyes (and your mind) wide open.  Mr. Kubrick has given us, for his final work, an onion -- an object to be examined, peeled, re-examined and peeled some more.  The layers, reverberations, twists, secrets, ironies and more in this film are just incredible.<br/><br/>Did I mention that my initial reaction, as the closing credits rolled, was to just sit there with a dumb grin on my face thinking, ""Wow.""  The nearly three hour experience crept up, until, in the final moments, everything we'd been watching became absolutely clear and the revelation was spine-tingling. It's also the kind of revelation that says this is a movie to see again, then again.  I have a feeling that every viewing will reveal more answers -- and raise more questions.<br/><br/>If you're paying careful attention, you will notice the first time through that the film is spattered with clues and indications of what's really going on.  Not to give anything away, but what seemed to be a blatant continuity error late in the film was actually a red flag indicating reality.  Trusting his audience, Kubrick doesn't bother to explain.  If, as an audience member, you trust Kubrick, you won't need it explained to you.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" most reminded me of ""Barry Lyndon,"" in look and feel -- but, perhaps as a farewell premonition, Kubrick has planted sly references to his other films throughout.  Pay close attention and you'll catch little hints of ""2001,"" ""Clockwork Orange"" and even ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""The Shining.""<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is amazing, and deserves at least an Oscar Nomination; Tom Cruise also pulls it off, with Kubrick using the actor's shortcomings in his favor.  (This is literally true; Kubrick is/was probably the only director who could get away with showing Cruise at his real height -- i.e., shorter than most other people on screen, including his wife, most of the time.) The cinematography is gorgeous.  Once again, there's magic here with light and things just look differently than you've ever seen them on film before. That said, though, the lighting isn't just flash -- pay attention to the changes in shooting style between saturated and flat on your first trip through, they are important.<br/><br/>I have a feeling, once I've seen this film a few times, that it actually might squeak up my list and move ""2001"" and ""Clockwork Orange"" down a notch. Then again, when Mr. Kubrick died far before his time last March, every other living director (hell, every other dead one, too) moved up a notch in the hierarchy.  There just wasn't anyone better than Stanley, and in his swansong, he proved it again more than ever."

","I've always liked Kubrick and respected his previous movies. I have to say though I was quite disappointed with EWS.  Let's not even take all the hype into consideration. Let's look at the movie for itself. <br/><br/>
From the first scene of the movie where Alice (Kidman) is in the bathroom urinating then standing up and wiping herself to the final last line I wonder what????  Kubrick went for every raw shot he could get in this movie. There was more (or as much) T & A in this movie than in a soft porn one. I'm still trying to figure out where the eroticism is.  Many of the scenes were just for reaction.  What was the point of the Leelee Sobieski part?  I have no clue, does anyone?<br/><br/>I can understand the premise of Cruise's obsession upon learning of his wife's fantasy and the depth of that fantasy.  His visit to the prostitute and the mansion where the secret sexual rituals take place bring to fruition his ""I'll show you"" attitude.<br/><br/>EWS has it's moments, but never truly comes together.  There are too many unanswered questions.  What really happened to his piano playing friend? Did the girl who saved him really die by her own hand?  What was the purpose of the scene with the young girl (Sobieski) and the Asian men?  How/Where did Alice (Kidman) find the mask?<br/><br/>Lastly, too often the acting was totally unbelievable.  In the poignant scene when Alice is telling her husband about her fantasy, and they're discussing jealousy, I felt like I was watching Cruise do a bad imitation of Jack Nicholson.  He went on to attempt to act like a man losing his grip when he visited the morgue and then towards the end when some things are revealed to the audience via his rich friend, contrarily, he was wooden and hardly believable as a tormented man.<br/><br/>Watch the movie for yourself, but if I had to choose over again I'd wait for the video."

There's not a naked guy in sight, the orgy scene is anything but sexy, the dialogue is forced, and what's with Nicole Kidman's accent lapses?  (She's a good actress but she's no Meryl Streep, and should have been allowed to speak in her native tongue, seeing as how it would have made no difference to the storyline.)  The colour and poignancy of the supporting characters (also beautiful people in ugly situations) is the only redeeming factor here.

Also, there are many other misconceptions about the film that should be laid to rest; like the one about Cruise and Kidman being Psychiatrists (they're not), or that there are several very erotic orgy scenes (there aren't), or that this is Kubrick's finest film (it isn't).<br/><br/>There *is* lots of female frontal nudity (sorry ladies, no naked men), and sex is certainly ""suggested"", but you never really SEE any of it. At least not in the way people think. There are far more erotic films out there, and if that is what you are seeking I would recommend ""Henry and June"", or something French. You aren't going to get any titillation here.<br/><br/>This movie is far more complicated than simple ""thriller""... it isn't even a very typical Kubrick mind f**k. There are elements of Kubrick's films scattered throughout, and it has a creepy coldness that is both fascinating and uncomfortable. The musical score is as close to excellent as you can get in creating that creepy, cold mood... well done.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's performance was laughable at times, and painfully lame at others. He was certainly not believable as a physician... no medical doctor I know runs around calling himself a ""doctor"" the way Cruise does, and his paternalistic mannerisms with his patients are completely unbelievable in the 30-something character. Perhaps the problem was partially the script (which was awkward and comedic at times), but Cruise is also not even half the actor people say he is.<br/><br/>Kidman was indeed quite good in the relatively small role she had, however I am not sure I needed to see her naked behind so often as it was shown. Kubrick must have been highly interested in her ass, or thought film go-ers would be. Don't know that it adds anything to the content of the film, but male audience members will no doubt love it.<br/><br/>Some great ""cameos"" in this movie: Alan Cumming as the bellboy. Rade Serbedzjia as Milich (costume shop owner) Leelee Sobieski as Milich's daughter (a Lolita if ever there was one, and she doesn't say hardly a word!)<br/><br/>If you are a true Kubrick fanatic you should probably see this movie, but then again maybe not.<br/><br/>For those who haven't experienced some of Kubrick's finer moments in film making, I'd forgo ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and rent the far more creepy ""Clockwork Orange"", or my personal fave ""Dr. Strangelove"", and of course ""2001, A Space Odyssey"".<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I'll reserve my judgement for this summer's best film after seeing ""The Blair Witch Project""...

Maybe that's my problem; my hopes were too high.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Cruise's character, Bill Hartford, and the sexual quest he goes on after an argument with his wife. During the argument, which is over a difference in opinion about the true sexual desires of men vs. women, Bill's wife Alice (Kidman) tells him about her attempt to have a one-night stand with a naval officer a year ago.  If the officer had obliged, she would have risked everything to have sex with him.<br/><br/>This revelation really sets Bill off.  The possibility that he was completely wrong about his wife and her unquestioning fidelity drives him mad.  Perhaps to avoid a reality quite opposite to the one he was living in (where men are controlled by their desire to have casual sex with many different women and women just want to be married and have sex with their husband) he sets out for an evening of cheap sex.  Ironically, his attempts at having affairs don't pan out<br/><br/>The controversial orgy scene is entertaining and a little creepy, but I wonder what the unedited portion would have been like.  Maybe that version will make it to the U.S. on video next year.  In any case, I won't be surprised if this flick gets great reviews, especially from men, for one or more of the following reasons:<br/><br/>1) Directed by Stanley Kubrick, and his last film, no less.   2) Nicole Kidman has some nude scenes.   3) There is an orgy scene.   3)a. There are many naked women on display in the orgy scene.<br/><br/>All in all I thought it was good, but not great."

","Hey, I'm pretty open-minded, but I don't know how they got the R rating on this film! I love Tom Cruise - and he was great.  But don't get excited gals - he never gets beyond a bare chest and foreplay. On the other hand, Nicole (and every other woman in this film) bares it all - to the point that I was embarrassed for her. The suspense was there, I stuck it out, but it dragged A LOT.<br/><br/>Even so it was only mildly irritating until the orgy scenes, which were demeaning to say the least. Everyone in the theater groaned at the ending, expecting a big payoff that never came. Kubrick may have been a master, but I never thought it would be of porn.

","""Eyes Wide Shut""<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I am of the school where Stanley Kubrick is just another director. A man who makes movies like most other filmmakers around. Independent, free do do anything he likes, the 100 take man... What Stanley Kubrick has always represented to me is power and madness. A perfectionist who is beloved for a trait that any kingdom would crumble under. I've spent many years trying to like his work. I feel like an outsider. For his last film ""Eyes Wide Shut"", I have the opportunity to see one of his pictures in the theater. That's something that has never happened before.<br/><br/>Mr. Kubrick has chosen Tom Cruise to lead us this time. A ferociously gifted actor, he seems the natural choice to play Doctor Bill Harford, a man who's wife(a shockingly capable Nicole Kidman) reveals a secret desire for another man one night whiled stoned on marijuana. In a fit of jealous rage, the Doctor hits the streets of New York in search of his long hidden desires and wishes. What he finds startles him. A world of lust that he never really accepted in his private world. It turns him on and threatens his life at the same time. It's also a world he must confront to understand the bond of his marriage. I can sincerely say that this is Kubrick's most low key film ever.<br/><br/>Being Cruise's story, we see everything from his angle of discovery and delight. I was amused by his scenes with a hooker (Vinessa Shaw) and a flirtatious hotel employee (Alan Cumming). I enjoyed most of the first half of the film. ""Sweet"", I thought to myself, ""I finally like a Stanley Kubrick movie!""<br/><br/>The one thing Kubrick does like no other director is to make his films glide effortlessly. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is probably the most well put together movie of the year. The production design is absolutely flawless. Each location that Cruise finds himself in is another chance to glimpse a well thought out world. The use of colors and film grain make a nice addition to the texture of the piece. Kubrick also prefers a stedicam glide through a scene than to cuts. Amen! The actors are better served with one-take shots instead of the usual chop-chop mentality. Technically, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a marvel. The best looking Kubrick film out of the bunch.<br/><br/>It is around the infamous ""orgy"" scene that the seams start popping out of nowhere. The Doctor finds himself sneaking into a ritualistic orgy complete with high priest and absurdly staged ""sex"". It's the scene that climaxes the Doctor's story. Trouble is, when you look down at your watch, the film still has an hour to go. The orgy scene kills the movie on two levels. First being that - forgive me - it blows the film's wad. We get a full glimpse at the depravity and gluttony that the movie hinted at before(for the record, the digitally added figures that were added to cover nudity to avoid the NC-17 do hurt the scene greatly). Second thing is, since we have no idea what this orgy is about, it's hard to feel the danger that the Doctor is supposedly in. The movie works overtime to suggest that this moment has changed the Doctor forever. I never felt that. It came off as more of a goof than a life-threatening situation. And some orgy, about 10 people having sex while 400 look on. I've seen more bodies in heat in a July line outside the Old Country Buffet.<br/><br/>Since the film has nowhere to go after this, we get an hour of forced intrigue and bad acting by Sydney Pollack. Now I want to stress that I did understand, get, comprehend ""Eyes Wide Shut"". It has many layers (the critics keep telling me this), and I'm not a true film lover if I cannot appreciate the film on it's deep emotional levels. But I can't. Kubrick's creation is visually dazzling but is far from pure cinematic brilliance. Other directors could take this material and make the same dead-weight film as well. The only thing that separates this from other movies is all the behind-the-scenes action. If Wes Anderson had his actors do 100 takes of a scene, who cares. But when Kubrick does this, IT'S GENIUS! His films are original. They just aren't all that good.<br/><br/>""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a cold, distant movie. A film that many will love, but many more will leave the theater wondering what to think. While with powerful moments, the final product is a very languid piece that will serve as the perfect example to what Stanley Kubrick could do with a million feet of celluloid.------------ 5"

","Honestly, my friends and I walked out of this movie opening night like we had wasted a precious three hours of our lives. Though Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman made an honest attempt to salvage the film through their decent performances,  the rest of the movie seemed rather plotless, pointless, and contained only one noticeable theme: sex. More storyline could be found on a porn flick.  It wasn't until I read the reviews in the paper the next morning when I realized what the whole movie was even about. Monogamy? I didn't get that from watching the movie at all. Perhaps Stanley Kubrick is just not my type of director.

","It is unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick, one of the few contemporary cinematic masters, failed to leave us with a work properly deserving of its position as his ultimate artistic statement. If Kubrick had not died four days after completing 'Eyes Wide Shut', this eagerly awaited addition to his remarkable roster of films would have suffered the fate of Martin Scorcese's 'After Hours'-  to be first defended, then dismissed as an unsuccessful experiment by a director of genius. The film begins well, immediately seducing the viewer with its visual beauty and leisurely pace. Aided by an appealingly edgy soundtrack, it soon proceeds to constrict itself into a tense knot of psycho-sexual suspense. Whereupon it suddenly loses its way. And stays lost. For a very long time. Following a path from provocative to disturbing to annoying to ludicrous, and finally, to tedious, the film then doggedly stumps on for another 3/4 hour.  While impossible to recommend not seeing it, 'Eyes Wide Shut' leaves little recourse, other than to suggest following its screening with a trip to the video store to check out 'Barry Lyndon', 'Lolita' or 'The Shining'.  To make mention of 'Dr. Strangelove',  'Paths of Glory',  'Clockwork Orange'  or  '2001,' would just be mean-spirited."
"chick-16","3","0","1","18 July 1999"," What were the critics thinking?
","I divide this movie into two parts.  Part 1 Nicole Kidman gets naked a lot, and Part 2 Tom Cruise puts in a series of pathetic attempts to cheat on his wife while remaining entirely confused.  What most bothered me about this film (aside from it's extreme, boring length and painfully drawn out scenes) was it's treatment of the main characters, specifically Nicole Kidman.  The infamous orgy scene is rather dull, and the treatment of women in it is very dehumanizing, but it is supposed to be.  The treatment of Kidman's character, however, is very base.  (I had no real sympathy for the character.  She simpers her way through the party scene at the beginning of the movie in a most irritating fashion.)  At first the quirky treatment of the everyday (we see Kidman on the toilette in her beautiful evening dress) is amusing.  It is nice to see something real.  We've become so accustomed to the fake loud noises of fight scenes and the fact that all phone numbers begin with 555, that it is kind of nice to see a little harmless taboo reality.  It becomes irritating, however, when it is only Kidman's character that receives this treatment.  We see her later putting on deodorant.  In the first half of the film (she disappears for huge portions of the rest of the film) she is treated very differently from the way in which Cruise's character is.  The movie begins with her getting naked, and in the scene in which she reveals a past desire to cheat on Cruise we continually get full body shots of Kidman (who is unquestionably gorgeous and worth looking at). Cruise, however, continually gets the ""money"" shots - head shots.  We see him naked only once in the short and poorly edited, ""they did a bad, bad thing"" shot.  Neither of the characters seems to have an understanding of his or her own gender let alone the other's.  Kidman's character makes the most naive and silly complaints against Cruise for pointing out the obvious (yes, she is a gorgeous woman and men will want to get her in bed). Cruise's character is equally naive when he asserts that women are only looking for security and commitment, not sex. Moreover, it's just a really bad, boring movie, full of horrible (let me say that again for emphasis - HORRIBLE) dialog and scenes that are unnecessarily drawn out (For those of you who have to see it I example the pool table conversation between Cruise and ""Ziggler"") Don't let me forget to say that it's predictable. The only thing good I can say about this movie was that it made excellent use of lighting and exploring the possibilities of grainy film."

Throughout this movie we are entertained and offended by watching Nicole Kidman on the loo, full female frontal nudity (this should arouse the ire of any ardent feminist for it's noticeable dearth of full male frontal nudity), simulated sex with your partner and in groups, a mysterious cabal of rich, oversexed, perverts who gather at a local manse which is entered only if you belong and know the password and their need to keep absolute secrecy. Among this movies grinding and groaning is sown various sub-plots concerning the roles of lesser actors and the mysterious ways one or two disappear or end up dead and you spend some time later with your movie-mate trying to figure out who did what to whom and wonder why do you care in the first place and drop the whole matter.

","Stanley Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut, is simply one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. Although the film was in production and shooting for well over two years, the wait has been more than worth it. The master of cinematic atmosphere, Kubrick explores jealousy and sex in Eyes Wide Shut. I have heard that there is both a R-rated and NC-17 rated version, either way the version I saw was powerful and hypnotic. The imagery in this film will be with you for a long time after viewing, and the score is very eerie. Kubrick knows more than any other director how to manipulate an audience, his films are always thought provoking and this film is no exception. The underground sex party is one of the strangest cinematic experiences I have had the pleasure to witness in a very long time. Kubrick was the greatest director ever and this film shows he was never afraid to explore the dark side of the human race. The best film of the decade. You will be missed Mr. Kubrick."

","Remember that time you got a little drunk at that party, everything slowed down just enough for you to see what was happening but not to know what for? That is the basic gist of Eyes Wide Shut.  Tom Cruise, as are we, is nothing more than an observer in this film that keeps you on the edge just long enough to...keep you on the edge.  An amazingly tense film that leaves you waiting for the sequel that will never come.  Like the Matthew Broderick sex scene in Biloxi Blues, you spend 95% of the time starting to climax and 5% of the time cleaning up what you were sure was supposed to be there but wasn't.

","""Eyes Wide Shut"" isn't Stanley Kubrick's greatest film but then Kubrick's genius was such that he set the bar of his own standards so ridiculously high that even his lesser works are fascinating, compelling and essential.<br/><br/>Such is ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  Despite the tremendous handicap of featuring Nicole Kidman (an actor so impossibly bad that the only positive contributions she makes to the film is when she is naked or silent), Kubrick has crafted a beautiful, complex, almost mystical film that works on layers and levels unimagined by most all of the film makers filling today's cinemas.<br/><br/>In short, Kubrick has created a fascinating character study, based on the flawed and dichotomous Bill Harford as he attempts to reconcile modern modes of sexual conduct with his highly traditional modes of moral conduct. Sexual desire and insecurity is portrayed as an underwold, while everyman Cruise has to navigate through it like a modern Ulyesses searching for his Penelope (now there's a modern irony....)<br/><br/>Perhaps mostly importantly, though, Kubrick weaves through ""Eyes Wide Shut"" a number of touching and occasionally humourous homages to his own work - almost as if sensing his own time was short.  The shot of Leelee Sobieki backing away from Cruise is burned in my memory as sheer Kubrick genius.  A wonderful, evocative soundtrack, sumptuous shots, inventive lighting and the remote decadence that only Kubrick can conjure all contribute to the feeling that this film is washing over you, inviting you to delve into it and lose yourself deeper into it's mystery and dark recesses.<br/><br/>In short, a film that survives Kidman (how does this woman get work?  have people lost Laura Dern or Julianne Moore's phone number?)and in no way diminished the non pariel reputation of Stanley Kubrick, the master film maker and one of the greatest artists of the 20th century."

","Stanley Kubrick's final movie should not be judged against other domestic dramas or thrillers.  It must be compared to his previous films, and you must also take into consideration Kubrick himself.  He must not have been well while he made it, and he left behind, a few months after his death, a film that many have called ""unfinished.""  (Perhaps he meant to put some different music over the ""piano piece"" that is remembered by most people who've seen this movie). The film is like a dream; not much of the central orgy passage makes sense in relation to the events before or after it, but the film is gripping nonetheless.  It is basically about what lack of communication between two people can do to a marriage, or in the case of Tom Cruise's character, one's sanity.  His ""odyssey"" that leads to the Long Island mansion is the result of what happens when a husband takes a wrong turn, and acts on pure impulse, after an argument with this wife and turning off his emotions, when he should have been upfront with them.  Much has been said about the central orgy sequence, which for me recalled The Wicker Man (a movie that also featured a stranger infiltrating a cult-like event, with participants in eerie masks and costumes, with tragic consequences).  The final irony of this misunderstood film, though, comes from Nicole Kidman's last line in the movie.  The final line in the final Kubrick film is nearly as memorable as the film itself, and darkly funny to boot. Give this movie a few years, and it will be re-evaluated and designated a masterpiece, like many of Kubrick's films from 2001 to The Shining."

","This is not your ordinary movie.  If I told you the meaning underlying it all -- and I'm not going to -- you wouldn't sleep so well.  If you're searching for answers, the note slipped to Bill at the front gate of Somerton tells you all you need to know: ""Give up your inquiries which are completely useless, and consider these words a second warning.  We hope, for your own good, this will be sufficient.""  If you've just seen it a first time and are trying to find answers, you've been way out of your depth the last two-and-a-half hours.<br/><br/>Okay, enough with the games.  Seriously now: this movie is quite extraordinary, and it comes as no big surprise that Stanley Kubrick was rumored to have considered this his best movie.  It would certainly be hard to top _2001: A Space Odyssey_, but the movies definitely have a couple things in common: (1) They both play intensely on ambiguity, driving away many a viewer; (2) Reviled so roundly at the time of their release, they did or will both come to be widely regarded as cinematic masterpieces, groundbreaking filmmaking, and classics.  On the basis of visual appearance alone -- and we're not just talking here about all the beautiful women that appear in the film -- the film is tantalizing and rivals any of Kubrick's best along these lines (notably _Barry Lyndon_), enough so to grant some level of credence to the above-mentioned rumor.<br/><br/>On a first viewing of the film, there's nothing particularly extraordinary about the movie on its surface, save for the orgy sequence (notoriously edited in a chicken-salad fashion to satisfy the MPAA's arbitrary-applied standards).  And, really, what you get up front is a fairly standard Hollywood-type ""mystery thriller"" infused with hokey scenes and dialogue. It's only when you take a further look at this film and try to analyze it in terms we can rationally understand, that things really begin to unravel. The reaction to this by many will be, ""Well, then it's just a piece of junk.""  But that would be to miss the whole point of what Kubrick was trying to do with this film.  (At least I think I have some idea of what he was trying to do with the film.)  There is plenty of good reason to think that what Kubrick wanted is a movie that DIDN'T hold together when things try to be explained.  There is a very good reason that ambiguity and bafflement set in when you truly question what the heck you're seeing in front of you.  I don't think it's any mistake that the movie is titled as it is.<br/><br/>One visual cue to note -- and this is one over and above the rich visual tapestry contained throughout the film -- is the character of the film stock itself.  The warm glow given off by the lights throughout is accentuated because of the way the film stock (the celluloid itself of whatever material they use now) was developed in such a way as to give a very slight haze to everything every moment of the movie.  What was somewhat all-too-obvious in a famous scene from Alfred Hitchcock's _Vertigo_ is now used in a very subtle manner throughout the whole of _Eyes Wide Shut_.  That the whole of the movie is infused throughout by this subtle hint of unreality is just the first clue as to what the heck is going on.  Some reviewers have mentioned how the movie could use a good dose of David Lynch's filmmaking technique, but that misses the point: the unreality or ambiguity or duality of things is all-too-apparent right on the surface of his films.  With _Eyes Wide Shut_, to make it readily apparent would destroy the point.<br/><br/>_Eyes Wide Shut_ carries with it a chief virtue of a film: it invites endless wonderment, thought, reflection, etc.  The richly layered meanings, non-meanings, invitations to further inquiry, the seeming contradiction of so much of it, is both frustrating and fascinating.  After several viewings of this film, on and off for about a year now, I won't look at movies the same way again (this goes for Kubrick's other movies as well).  A movie that has the power to change the way you look at film is a rare movie, indeed."

","This movie has been widely hated, even in circles where Kubrick is usually revered. One Salon reviewer even argued that _Eyes Wide Shut_ was a preachy, dogmatic monogamist tract, on the shallow basis that something bad happens to every character that seeks extramarital sex. I couldn't disagree more. The film's final lines suggest both that dreams can be equally as significant as reality, and that a single experience can never define an entire life. Kubrick seems to be saying that a single act of unfaithfulness, whether real or dreamt, does not have to undermine a relationship. Commitment, then, is not a set of arbitrary rules and agreements restricting your partner's sex life, as the Tom Cruise character at first seems to think. This unrealistic, fairy-tale view of his marriage is shattered, plunging him into a surreal, paranoid world of conspiracy and intrigue. By the end, however, he has realized (as his wife already has) that commitment is something renewed from day to day. The film thus points out the dynamic quality of something often considered to be static and constricting, i.e. a marriage, and celebrates commitment without demanding an unrealizable, perfect faithfulness.<br/><br/>Despite many critics' assertions to the contrary, _Eyes Wide Shut_ seems to me to be quintessentially Kubrick in its surrealism, its strong use of color (vibrant reds and purples predominate), and its sophisticated theme. An attentive viewer (unlike the majority of American critics) will see that there is much more to this film than a little supposedly explicit sex. Extra props for Kubrick's ability to create a mood that is magical, erotic, and deeply paranoid -- an achievement that rivals David Lynch's best work."

It doesn't blatantly tug on the heartstrings or the libido. It doesn't attach itself to a genre. It doesn't teach any lessons. Eyes Wide Shut is a simple, honest movie that doesn't try to manipulate or console its audience. Instead it has great atmosphere and a good sense of humor poking at cultural attitudes toward jealously, sexual intercourse, heterosexuality, and flirting. Great escapist entertainment."
"Franki1","8","0","1","17 October 2001"," Kubrick goes out on a high with EWS
","Inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle"", Eyes Wide Shut is a film which divides the critics (as it was often the case with all of Kubrick's films): On the one hand you have to admit that the film takes quite a bit of time to get really started.  Referring to the first part of the film as boring is unjustified, but it's certainly not breathtaking in terms of action. You wonder whether this sly storytelling is necessary for the action ahead-and I think it is: When Dr. ""Billy"" is walking down the city streets, wondering if this wife really cheated him, the action slowly gets into flowing. When he gets to the mysterious masquerade-party the excitement created by the strange atmosphere and the unfamiliar piano-playing suggests a feeling of thrill. At the same time we undoubtedly know that we are in a Stanley Kubrick film. You can argue about certain elements in all his films but no director I know is able to create these stunnig pictures which are in an absolute harmony with light and sound. In EWS we have these fantastic masks in various forms and designs and we see how Kubrick displays the perfection of the female beauty. There isn't a lot more to tell even if you might wonder what this film is actually trying to say: Is it philosophically? Is it all about what dreams can do to us or make us believe? Is it simply about Sexuality in a relationship or about sex in general? You have to find out yourself. Kubrick's films have and will always stand out-the one way or the other!"

"TheHun","10","0","1","26 August 2001"," INDIFFERENCE OF THE UNIVERSE
","The problem with seeing a Stanley Kubrick movie for the majority  is the frustration that it doesn't yield to any cliche. Worse, not only it's not spoon fed, but also it shatters the usual expectations creating an enigmatic feel which deep down disturbs its audience and the critiques in their subconscious. These two elements, integral to each Kubrick film, that is, the indifference/darkness of the universe we live in and the truth of a thing lying in the feel of it, are alien to Americana (in its dominant global sense). Most become perplexed as to what his movies really mean, why they are recognized as great (in fact, most masterpieces), and for whom they are made except perhaps his arrogant self. Again the same questions are asked and the same comments are made on Eyes Wide Shut (EWS). ""Slow, nonsensical, unlike any New York, outdated eroticism, etc..."". From an obscure novella of Arthur Schnitzler (Freud's friend) written in 1926, Kubrick has made another immortal film and despite his genuine desire to reach out to the world, he again couldn't break the box office. That was always his paradox. Making movies on universal indifference that dissect the very same and make people feel their inert apathy is not how you win the tickets. EWS is a dream movie (in line with Schnitzler's original title The Dream Novel) with each shot radiating multiple meanings/feelings in pulsating color combinations, lens selections, set and costume design, and camera movements. Christmas trees appear in most settings, Dr. Harford uses his medical ID as a pass to everywhere, female nudity (from the ingenious opening sequence as a Kubrickian laughter to viewers) is over displayed throughout, masks match character traits... all accompanied and contrasted with an unforgettable sound track starting with Shostakovich's waltz and heavily using Ligeti's anti-Stalinist notes (a favorite composer of Kubrick's), the whole film is one heated feel of dreamy confusion of love, fidelity, jealousy, and eroticism that intensifies the more is gets detached from physical nudity. You may not enjoy EWS now, but you will one day, like all other Kubrick movies which stand the test of time. His death is a real loss to the world. Yet he left behind about 10 kaleidoscopic masterpieces, reflecting new meanings each time viewed. As Scorcese says, ""One Kubrick movie is like ten made by another director"". Aaron"

","Words do not begin to describe the beauty of this movie. Mr. Kubrick made a film of beautiful art, content and performance. This movie, however, is not for everyone.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly slow-paced, but if you see the film, you understand why. The first half of the film is incredibly Kubrick in its introduction of the characters. Tom Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford, a role which he is to be remembered for. Nicole Kidman plays his lovely wife very well also. If you can stick with the film and appreciate the art of it for the first half, the second half will blow your mind. Without giving to much away, I'll just say it contains the usual Kubrick eerieness, maybe even stepped up a notch.<br/><br/>Besides the wonderful plot and acting, make sure to pay attention to Stanley Kubrick's use of brilliant colors and fabulous lighting.

"seandchoi","9","0","1","15 August 2001"," A great finale to a great career
","This highly anticipated film by Stanley Kubrick (his previous one was Full Metal Jacket, back in 1987) was also unfortunately his last. Tom Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford who, after getting into an argument with his wife Alice (played by his real wife at the time, Nicole Kidman) concerning one of her adulterous fantasies, wanders through the night, encountering various sexual temptations of his own, and ending up almost participating in a secret orgy of the rich and the powerful in a giant mansion. Eyes Wide Shut is an impeccably crafted and hypnotically paced meditation on the temptations and trials that can stand in the way of marital fidelity. In contrast to the many superficial films about love and sex that come out from Hollywood, Kubrick's film offers a profound and thoughtful look at marriage, love, and sex. Although the film features a lot of nudity, they are shot in an objective, ""matter of fact"" fashion, instead of to titillate its viewers. Overall, Eyes Wide Shut is a beautiful ""swan song"" to a very distinguished career of Stanley Kubrick."

","This necessarilly slow movie has as main theme the meaning attached to marriage faithfulness. The illusion of a perfect marriage gets perforated by a confession of the woman (kidman); the man (cruise) runs on and seeks a nightly adventure to get square. The tought of an equilibrium is crucial in the film. The sexual orgies in the secret nightly masked ball (the scary, doom-music), make his adventures seem like a dream, sexuality and fear is interwoven. Basically, the unfaithfulness of kidman either wasn't more than a fantasy. The dream - reality theme also dominates the movie. The slowness of the movie makes it all seem so unreal, and fantasy-like, just as the music, often not more than one piano-sound. The end is a view of finding each other in a larger interpretation of marriage and a gives a hopeful perspective of relations. The suddenly unpredictability and confusion of the human mind is to be accepted, and even -to be shared- and can make a relation stronger and 'more real'."

","I've just watched Eyes Wide Shut for the third time.  I think the movie has great depth and can invoke good discussions of its meaning.  The performances of the actors are generally good except for the two principles. I found Cruise wooden and Kidman overemoting but both were passable.  It's just that they were surrounded by a talented cast.  What was the movie about?  (SPOILERS lurk ahead).  I think the movie is a metaphor of marriage. Cruise's sexual ego becomes damaged after Kidman confesses to sexual fantasies, about another man.  He encounters sexual situations that further shake his already damaged psyche.  He then discovers his alter ego,what he might want to be if freed from his conventions, in the form of Nightengale and obtains the password to a place that promises forbidden pleasures.  The apparent orgy he then attends is, in fact, the metaphor for marriage.  The women are anointed, or blessed, by the high priest, then they reveal their sexuality.  They choose a man and go off to enjoy all kinds of sexual pleasure.  Cruise the intruder is unmasked and told to leave and not to mention what goes on within the mansion.  The sexual pleasure is only to be enjoyed within the mansion, or within the confines of marriage.  Outside of the mansion, or marriage, sexual pleasure brings about dire circumstances. A hooker dies of a overdose and Cruise visits another, (naively bearing pastries for the prostitute), and is warned off by the possibility of death from disease, the HIV.  He is further warned to stop his enquires, into infidelity, when he shows up at the mansion again. (How does he get into the mansion? By, falsely, promising fidelity.)  He goes home and finds the mask on his pillow.  Was this an invitation to enjoy sex within the bounds of marriage with his wife?  I've wondered about the ending sequence, and the last word, and its meaning and I think it shows sexual freedom is allowed within the marriage.  <br/><br/>Maybe my interpretation is a stretch but the movie allows for that stretch and that is why is so good."

","Stanley Kubrick's last film ""Eyes Wide Shut"" is a film that is filled with beauty, danger, and ambiguity. The title of this film should have titled ""Fear and Desire"" because these are the two basic emotions that dominate this superb work of art.<br/><br/>WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/> Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise play Alice and Bill Harford, an affluent Manhattan couple. He's a doctor and she's an unemployed art curator. They have a young daughter and everything seems to be perfect, until one night during an argument while they're both stoned on pot (Alice more than Bill) Alice reveals a sexual fantasy about a Naval officer that she saw while she and Bill were on a vacation in Cape Cod. Of course, this revelation shocks Bill, and makes him jealous (the image of Alice making love with the Officer fills Bill's head). It is then where the fun really begins where Bill goes on a strange and comic journey (similar to the Scorsese film ""After Hours"") wandering the streets of Manhattan where the daughter of a dead patient of Bill's (who wants to have sex with Bill in front of her dead father), a prostitute, some drunk College kids, and the very young daughter of a costume shop all come on to him sexually. Bill's journey takes a more bizzare turn when ends up at a mansion in the countryside (He takes a cab to get there which is film's most humorous moment) where an orgy is taking place. From there is where it gets dangerous for Bill and possibly his family because of his journey and the things he has witnessed.<br/><br/>
While watching ""Eyes Wide Shut"", the writings of Kafka came to. Bill is an Kafka-like character because like Kafka characters, he's filled with anxiety and torment in an atmosphere of fantasies, dreams, and unsettling realities. But ultimately this film is really about chances missed and opportunities avoided presented in the form of an erotic daydream that is enhanced by the film's stunning visuals. Kubrick and cinematographer Larry Smith do an outstanding job playing with grain, bright lights (backlighting, underlighting), and strong primary colors giving the film an odd, erotic and melancholy tone.<br/><br/>The performances are solid, particularly that of Nicole Kidman who really bares her soul( and her body in the film's opulent first image)in the revelation that rocks her husbands world. We really believe her as a wife who feels she's been taken for granted and possibly jealous of husband's success as a doctor. Her last line in this film is filled with irony (and totally Kubrickian) that is a fitting resolution for a couple going through some problems.<br/><br/>Although, this film has been dismissed by most people now, it will stand the test of time and be hailed as a masterpiece like every other Kubrick film. But for now, my eyes (and head) are wide open enough to see that it's masterpiece and will continue to see it that way."

","EYES WIDE SHUT was the last film director Stanley Kubrick worked on before his untimely death on March 7, 1999.  And given that virtually all of his films have been misunderstood on first initial viewings, it isn't surprising that this psychosexual drama, containing nudity and sexual content coming just within a stone's throw of being classified as soft-porn, should arouse widely divergent views.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are a very upscale Manhattan couple who, following a lavish party at the home of a good friend (Sydney Pollack), debate sexual infidelities after Cruise is spotted by Kidman flirting with a couple of models.  What follows is an odyssey of sexual tensions for Cruise, including a very strange, almost Edgar Allan Poe-inspired ritual at a Long Island mansion featuring many naked people.<br/><br/>I really can't go into any further detail about EYES WIDE SHUT.  I believe it to be a fitting end to the life's work of one of the greatest post-World War II film makers.  But it is a very complex film, not easy to describe in simple terms.  Kubrick is deliberately ambiguous in his approach to the material (inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle""), which I think is what really bewilders, if not angers, a lot of people.  Like everything Kubrick has made, it requires repeat viewings to get the full impact.  It is very lengthy, and its nudity and language make it very unsuitable for anyone under the age of 17.  Otherwise, however, EYES WIDE SHUT is at the very least one of the most intriguing films from a director who clearly inspired many other great ones, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Brian DePalma."

Bill was warned that he did not belong their and the people find out and warn him that if he says thing about what he saw some thing bad would happen.

It is about a guy going out to have a quickie affair and despite getting propositioned by women, a teenage girl, a gay man and two prostitutes, not to mention attending an orgy, the guy never even gets his pants unzipped. It is like Blake Edwards' ""10"" without the laughs. Worse its soft core porn with no sex, a thriller with no suspense, and a drama with no depth or insight. It is a shaggy dog story, all build up with no pay off. It's like the orgy scene that is the film's center piece; everyone prances around in costumes and masks and never get around to doing anything, sexual or otherwise. (Was Kubrick so isolated from years of being locked away plotting movie scripts that he was totally out of touch with the real world and the sexual revolution? His prissy view of sexuality is like something that might have been shocking in the early sixties, but now seems embarrassingly infantile.) <BR> I will confess that I am not a great fan of Kubrick. True, as a visual stylist, he is quite accomplished, but it takes more than pretty pictures to make a great film. A heart and soul or at least a hint of passion are needed. I write this after having seen A.I., a truly great film. It has Kubrick's striking visual sense, but Spielberg gave it what has been missing from Kubrick's work since before 2001, and that is humanity."

I was so amazed, happy, thrilled to find out at the end of the movie that the story was actually taken from Schnitzler, a writer whom I have always admired. The decadence of The Male is very well conveyed in this movie. I hope I am not forcing the interpretation, but I thought that Tom Cruise was very well chosen as his role is certainly that of a pathetic loser. Cruise's character is a sort of Ulysses restlessly traveling through the most trivial masculine sexual depravations.  It is in the nature of things that most of the public didn't like the movie. It became so famous thanks to Kubrik's name and that of Cruise and Nicole Kidman. However, it's not typical Hollywood movie, and it's difficult to like it without some background. Personally it was a great experience, and I didn't have to put any effort to let myself navigate into the dreamy atmosphere. The part of the masuquerade was superbous. The musics, the masks, a perfect Freudian nightmare. Also, there is no room for women in the movie. They are represetned simply as the object of male's desires and aspirations. Nothing is dedicated to the explanation of their own world. It's a film all in the masculine gender, but extremely autocritical.

","I haven't seen any other movies made by Kubrick, except ""2001"" and that was a long time ago, when I was too young to understand it, therefore I think my comment of this movie won't be biased because of comparison to his previous work. Spoiler Alert So, what is EWS about? Well, if you ask me, EWS is a movie about temptation. Allow me to explain. I'm sure everyone is familiar with this term: ""Just because I am married, it doesn't mean I am dead."". See, when you get married, in spite of the fact that you made an official promise in front of witnesses and made an oath that you'll dedicate the rest of your life to one and only person, you still can't shut off your human nature. Men don't stop looking at other beautiful women and fantasizing about them just because they got married - the same thing goes for women. And they still like it when someone else finds THEM attractive and when they know that they didn't lose the ability to seduce. It's HUMAN NATURE, folks. However, because they are married, whenever they meet a temptation (to be with another person), they must find a way to resist that temptation - some people do and some people don't. So, enter Bill and Alice, our characters from the movie.<br/><br/>I'll begin with Bill. First he meets those two girls at the party and it is more than obvious that they want to have sex with him. And he enjoys the attention he gets. Why? Because of what I've said before - it's a human nature. However, he gets interrupted when they call him upstairs to help one overdosed girl. <br/><br/>Then, later on, when he visits his late patient's daughter, at one point she starts kissing him and though it looks like he feels awkward (her dead father is only 2-3 meters away, doh), he doesn't run away either. However, her boyfriend comes home and they're interrupted. <br/><br/>Then he decides to go to an empty apartment with a prostitute. It's quite obvious he KNEW what he was doing, isn't it? And it seemed to me that something would have happened between them... if only it hadn't been for that phone call from his wife that brought him back to reality. Again, he was interrupted. <br/><br/>And finally, the orgy. He also went there because he WANTED to (he was practically desperate to attend that event: hey, he was willing to pay 200$ more for a costume and he woke up the owner of costume's store in the middle of the night!) and again, he had the opportunity to have sex. Yet, he got interrupted again when they discovered he was an outsider.<br/><br/>So, Bill faces temptation (to have sex with someone who is not his wife) four times in the movie. Does he resist it? We actually never find out, cause he gets interrupted by someone else every time. So, what is the message of this? That men need very little to take the opportunity to shag an attractive woman, and the only thing that can stop them is an outside ""force""? It doesn't look very flattering for guys, does it? :)<br/><br/>But what about girls and their temptations, their fantasies? Do women have sexual fantasies about other men? Of course they do. The only problem is that men refuse to accept it cause it harms their male egos. That is why Bill was so shocked when Alice told him about her sexual fantasy about that navy guy. So, Alice fantasized as well... <br/><br/>And she also had the opportunity to cheat on her husband. First, with that navy guy - yet she didn't do it. Again, not because she didn't want to but because he (navy guy)left. She even said at one point something like: ""When I found out he left, I felt relief."" I think this says it all, doesn't it?<br/><br/>And then, she had another opportunity at the party, with Sandor. She obviously LOVED the attention he was giving to her (remember that part about human nature?), but she managed to resist him. She managed to resist the temptation. So, what does that mean? That women are able to resist the tempation (to be with other guy), at least from time to time, unlike men? Does that mean that females are more faithful by nature? Hmmmm... could be. I assume that Alice refused to ""go upstairs"" with Sandor cause she felt guilt. That's why she reminded him that she was married. And she also felt guilt when she had that dream in which she has sex with other man. I remember, I was thinking: ""My God, woman! It was only a DREAM!!!"" Yet, it affected her so deeply. That because women take infidelity more seriously than men do - at least that's what it looked like in this movie. And that is why women resist the temptation better than men. <br/><br/>So, what happens at the end? They find out aobut each other's ""affairs"" and they have to decide what they're going to do with their future. And then, they finally realize the solution: they have EACH OTHER. I think the message of this movie is: if you're married, it's inevitable that sooner of later you'll meet someone else that you'll find attractive and/or they'll find you attractive and your HUMAN need to seduce and be seduced will come out and you'll have a temptation to face. And the only way you can resist that temptation is that you remember that you DON'T NEED someone else, cause you already have at home someone that YOU chose to spend the rest of your life with. You don't need to go to parties, empty apartments, orgies... to have some lovin' - it's waiting for you at home. <br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this movie is a tribute to fidelity. And that is why I like it so much. 10 out of 10."

","I've seen just about every Kubrick film made, and none other affected me like Eyes Wide Shut'.  For a three hour movie, it was not one that dragged one, I was constantly on the edge of my chair waiting to find out what was going to happen next.  When that final word came out of Kidman's lips and the screen went blank I was shocked that this could actually be the end of the film.  This film takes you on a journey through the taboo; it brings everything we are embarrassed to admit we think about directly to the surface and justifies it.  Obviously the casting for this movie is superb, a genuine Kubrickian trait, the chemistry between Kidman and Cruise, already present due to their marriage adds something to the film that no other pair could.  To many this film was gravely misunderstood, criticized as pornography and unnecessary sexuality and nudity, but to those who do understand recognize it as the Kubrick masterpiece it is.  The storyline follows Cruise's character, Dr. Bill, through a grim confession from his wife about their marriage and his journey to find fulfillment in other places, only to find that the reality of one night' cannot define one's entire life.  As Kubrick's last film, I think that this is a good representation of all Kubrick stood for through his filmmaking, beautiful cinematography, excellent casting, and a story that will blow just about anyone's mind."

","For the first time, first Kubrick's movie... How could I wish for better start. The title of the movie say to me that the main message of it is in conciliation. That effects great on a marriage between Dr.Bill and Alice Hartford. Eyes Wide Shut is a title that greatly say and point out that need for conciliation between a couple on some parts of relationship. The line the couple should follow is sex (between them). The end it's self, says much of where's there a threat of dreams for them. Again this thought is well in the air: 'Women are rotten and men are fools'. I love the movies saying that ultimate truth. (me? -male)<br/><br/>All begins with attack of 'the rotten' one on a 'fool' cause of the lack of suspicion Alice gets from Bill. Then Bill gets in his face all the strings her fidelity stands on. Alice mighty say: ""...and I hardly even mooove."" Oh Nicole, my rotten one. Bill then gets in a numerous situations to get even with Alice. Along with other circumstances, he on his journey of understanding fidelity, gets immediately hit by a girl he hardly knows, get saved from getting HIV virus, get hit by sexual ethics on his head in a store. Near the end he discovers that he and his family were saved by a beautiful redhead who's paid it with her life. Through all that time he is terribly confused by meaning and using of fidelity and cost of unfidelity. Remember the time he got home from the orgy and find Alice smiling and laughing in her dream. He awakes her and she turns cry wildly 'Oh honey I just dreamt of being in the middle of gang-bang and smiling in your face.' Oh yes, the rotten one in her very best! Then, she at home has prepared him a little surprise as a mask on his pillow that he lost and which in a first place say nothing. At that sight, even Alice is asleep, young doctor crashed on her feeling guitly (of nothing he had done!). But, what would happened it Bill have discovered 'what where rainbow ends' on a start of a movie??<br/><br/>I loved Sydney Pollack's acting.<br/><br/>I will have to learn more of Kubrick's work to know how to describe all his skill. It's easily seen that he shows all the scenes constantly on high level. It's amazing how the movie isn't boring at all, very much smooth on it's all length with the slight cut on the end. Music is grand here.<br/><br/>I heard Stanley Kubrick was perfectionist. Who can mess with that? Only rotten can..."

","Arthur Schnitzler's Traumnovelle` was the model Kubrick based his film upon, and after all those almost perverse details that were heard before Eye Wide Shut` was released, it's amazing how slavishly it sticks to that model. For me, this means nothing good because I was as unsuccessful in finding out what Schnitzler wanted to say as I was with Kubrick. Schnitzler had at least a fine, readable language, which of course gets lost in an English language film.<br/><br/>I saw the film shortly after it was released here, but I remembered it when I saw The Cell` recently. The two movies belong to dissimilar genres and try to meet completely different requirements, but the intensity of their pictures and how they prefer them to everything else, even the story. The director of The Cell` justified himself by a reference to the genre he comes from (videoclips), Stanley Kubrick, being dead, couldn't justify himself any more, and I can't imagine what he would have said, if he was still alive. After his masterpieces Full Metal Jacket`, The Shining` and several others, Eyes Wide Shut` seems like the late work of an unenthusiastic old artist, lacking ideas, full of emotionalism and overwhealming pictures, obsessed with sex, visually and in the dialogues. Also the characters (Tom Cruise giving one of his weak performances and Nicole Kidman who is not more than a supporting actress here) seem to think about nothing else. Being in old Stanley Kubrick's brain.<br/><br/>How badly will he rate this movie, some of you might ask. And here is the surprise: Speaking purely emotionally, remembering the feeling I had during watching the film and immediately afterwards, I must admit that the film was a) not boring and b) absolutely fascinating, and two years later I can't, I just can't tell why. Obviously, there was still something, something not tangible left of Kubrick's genius. However, it's a pity that he's not among us. 6 points out of"
