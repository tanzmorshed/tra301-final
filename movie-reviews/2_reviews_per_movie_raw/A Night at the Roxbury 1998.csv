","I'm going out on a limb here.  I've just bombed ""Joe Dirt,"" and now I'm going to do an about-face on modern comedies and argue that ""A Night at the Roxbury"" is brilliant.  Most critics didn't see a distinction between these two bombs, but I do.<br/><br/>Comedy oftentimes depends on suffering.  Comic protagonists always take a beating, and we either laugh with them, or at them, or maybe we laugh not at all because we couldn't care less.  The essential question is, are the protagonists of ""A Night at the Roxbury"" lovable losers or just totally annoying dweebs who deserve all the grief they get? <br/><br/>You know my answer already.  I love the Butabi brothers.  They have a strong fraternal bond, they're obsessed with Emilio Estevez, and they can't get any play.  What's not to love?  <br/><br/>Dan Hedaya is great as the brothers' disgruntled dad, and Chazz Palminteri does a hilarious cameo as an entrepreneur obsessed with ass-grabbing. Richard Grieco demonstrates a remarkable sense of humor about himself by allowing the Butabis to build him up as a big celebrity, when the joke is obviously that he's a total has-been.  What a sport, eh?<br/><br/>Nice song, too.  I like this stupid movie.  Really, I do."

","After watching this movie on television, I automatically went on the net to find out what other people thought about it...I was extremely surprised to see that Roxbury wasn't even given an average higher than 5, many people expressing their disgust for the movie...But, I Loved it. I have never laughed so much during a movie, and there was an actual point to the movie. Some of the gags has me laughing for at least 10 minutes, and I still laugh thinking of them (the ambulance noises, the Emilio story, LoL). I can't believe so many people don't like this movie, it's a great comedy, much better than horrible flicks like Dude where's my car, and Saving Silverman. At least this movie has a point, I came to like the characters of the Butabi brothers. Was this a Good Movie? Noooo....YES!"
"PQTaggart","10","99","120","3 December 2004"," Great and really funny movie.
","""What's up?"" - Either you love it or you hate it. Actually to me Roxbury is one of my favourites. Of course the two guys are hilarious - but that's what they're supposed to be. This movie is full of great innuendos to disco chicks (""Is this your first time?""), to stupid and bored upper class people (""Do you like my new chin? Is it better than last years?"") and to some movies (""You had me at hello!""). Even after watching it the 3rd or 4th time you still can discover some new hints and gags.<br/><br/>It's a funny movie but certainly not dumb!<br/><br/>Emilioooooh!"
"tunafish-2","8","21","23","7 February 2003"," Wasn't expecting much but...
","I haven't laughed this much since ""Something About Mary"". Funny how the critics raved about that one , and gave this this the flick. Also, much better  than the similar ""Dumb and Dumber""...and not a fart gag in sight In it's naive, good-natured way , it was more like ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" or ""Wayne's World""  but out of all these films , ""Roxbury"" is my new favourite."

The music just happens to fit the movie so good that i think its a 'must see movie'. I'm a proud owner of this movie. When i'm in need of a good laugh this is the movie i watch.

In fact this film is similar to ""Saturday Night Fever"" in the way that it helped define a part of popular culture.<br/><br/>Anyone that is not already going to dance clubs should, first, see this film, second, get to the nearest hot night club and dance to the sounds that were so well presented in this film.

","Yesterday, I watched ""A Night at the Roxbury"" for the first time and I absolutely loved it! I think Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell did a great job and were an awesome team. They were VERY funny and kept me laughing and cheering for them through the whole movie. The music in this movie was also great, it made me want to get up and dance (maybe even the head bop! lol)This movie also had the *perfect* ending. I enjoyed all the characters and liked the twists the movie took. I would definitely recommend this movie for a good laugh for anyone, even critical friends.

","This is my all time favorite movie ever. If you are ready to laugh your head off then grab a bunch of friends and watch this movie together.<br/><br/>Doug and Steve Butabi come out with the funniest sayings that you'll be repeating with your friends for a long time. They have got tons of catch phrases you can use everyday. ""Are you two brothers?"" ""No... Yes! get em every time! yea Doug's hilarious!"" I've practically memorized the whole movie! You've got to see it! Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell work wonderfully together and provide non-stop laughter for people of all ages. If you haven't seen this movie then I suggest you see it and then spread the word on how good it is!"
"Margaux1","Null","21","24","1 March 2003"," Funny movie with a great storyline!
","I reluctantly rented this movie for my husband.  He wanted to see it at the theatre but I didn't want to - I had never seen SNL (which DOES make a difference.  If you don't know the skit, you don't really 'get it').  So one night I picked up some movies, including this one - and I became hooked!<br/><br/>
I could NOT stop laughing.  I thought it was so funny.  I loved their clothes and their hair looked great.  Since then I've seen this movie a million times!<br/><br/>One of the things I liked best about this movie is that it really WAS tastefully done.  There was virtually no swearing in it, and no sex scenes (which disgust me).  It almost seems like they were discouraging vulgarity...I had to respect Chris Kattan when his 'one night stand' (Eliza Donovan) said ""Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Joanie loves Chachi.  But does Chachi give a flying - f*** about Joanie?""  He kind of looked at her and made a face that showed he was turned off by her language.<br/><br/>I would actually feel comfortable enough to let my 2 year old see it (which she has and she's decided she has a crush on 'Crissattan'.)<br/><br/>The boys come from a close-knit family with money.  But somehow, they don't see any of it.  They look nice when they go out and it's cool to see brothers who are so close.  Will Ferrell is a tremendous talent. The music is AWESOME! :)<br/><br/>I cannot STAND Molly Shannon.  I don't even understand how she got on SNL in the first place.  She is just AWFUL.  She's unattractive, perverted, and all of her characters on SNL just seem to be the same.<br/><br/>In all, this was a terrific movie.  I loved it!  Just watch it with an open mind and remember that it's a SILLY COMEDY, not an Academy Award Winner!"
"speedny7","10","20","23","19 May 2003"," Butabi Brothers + Richard Grieco = HILARITY!
","Oh my god, this is one of the funniest movies ever made.  The Butabi brothers, who are always funny as loser clubbers in the SNL skits, prove to be just as funny with their pathetic personal lives.  The 80's references in this movie are a huge source of hilarity, with the zenith being Richard Grieco's role.  ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE should see this movie as soon as possible, since it is by far one of the greatest I have ever seen."
"Haze1","10","20","23","21 August 2002"," Full of laughs and great music
","Simply a great movie. I have watched it about 20 times by now and my friends usually put it on when they visit. It also has great eurodance music from the early 90s so you can even have the movie rolling in the background.<br/><br/>But I think this movie is mostly appreciated by us who were out clubbing a lot during the 90s. You recognize the great music, queuing to the coolest club and maybe even some more embarrassing things from the movie. To me, Blues Brothers and Wayne's World wasn't funny at all. On the other hand I wasn't ""clubbing"" to blues in 1980 and doesn't like heavy metal from the 80s.<br/><br/>A Night At The Roxbury is a very funny movie with great music for the ones that wasn't sitting at home in the weekends during the 90s :)"
"tolga009","Null","64","83","23 September 2005"," one of my top 10 comedies of all time
","When this movie hit the screens in the summer of 1998 (or was it 99 in Turkey - anyways), no one knew what it was in Turkey and a very few people went and saw it, I was one of the more fortunate ones to have done so, and i did this twice!!<br/><br/>Yes, i laughed my head off.. Once with my best pal, and the next day with my brother.<br/><br/>It is one of those movies which keeps that stupid smile on your face all through the movie. The Butabi brothers and their relationships with the whole world and their fascination for clubs, women and EMILIOOOO! is a must see for everyone who likes a good laugh.<br/><br/>I can't get the scene where the brothers are loading the flowers into the van. Some really funny stuff.<br/><br/>I bought this on video and have watched it dozens of times and it never gets old. Definitely recommend it..."
"CoalWakKnot","10","19","22","19 January 2003"," An Instant Classic
","A Night At The Roxbury was an awesome movie. When i first watched it i laughed so hard. My friends and i would watch it a lot. One night we watched it 5 times and just couldn't get enough of it. Sad enough I pretty much can recite the whole movie. There should definitely be a sequel. My friends and I always joke around when we hang out about the movie, always going around and being Up Top! and all the lines from the movie. This is definitely on my top ten list. Chris Kattan and Will Ferrel are the best comedic actors. I recommend this movie to who ever likes SNL and is looking for a good laugh."
"BenderIsGreat","10","67","88","5 January 2005"," One of the best.
","A Night at the Roxbury... I loved this movie incredibly the first time I saw it because it seemed to be the story of my relationship with my own sister embodied in a film. With such amazingly hilarious actors as Will Farrell and Chris Kattan, and also Molly Shannon, how could anyone pass up the opportunity to at least watch it once? <br/><br/>The whole idea of two regular, lazy, semi-lame guys trying to fulfill a small but radical dream while following the right paths in life is very appealing to me. But that's not to say it's not a film for adults... Indeed, there was some ""profanity,"" but I'd say it was relatively minor and only added to the hilarity of it all. I think what really got me was the soundtrack for this film, in particular the recurring dance song ""What Is Love?"" by Haddaway. By the end of the movie, it becomes sort of an anthem. It's almost strange to find yourself watching these two younger men and their rich but meandering lifestyle and think ""Man, I wish I could do that!"" <br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh IF your comedy preferences are not too strict. And it's even better if you watch it with your friends, because it makes a lot of inside jokes! I'd suggest this movie to anyone looking for a good Will Farrell/Chris Kattan movie, especially if you have your own brother or sister to relate it to."
"CashMoneyPop","9","15","17","25 December 2002"," Pretty Funny Movie
","First, before any of you read my comments for this movie, I shall warn you that my comments are biased since I loved the skits that this movie was based on SNL.<br/><br/>The skit that the Butabi Bros. did with Jim Carrey was definitely one of the greatest SNL skits I've seen.  The head bobbing gig turning into a movie turned out to be great.  Dan Hedaya did a great performance along with ""Mr. Zadir."" and Lochlyn Munro.  Speaking of Mr. Hedaya, he was perfect for the funny-hardass father type characters.  The soundtrack does have some other nice tunes besides Haddaway's ""What Is Love,"" which is played over and over again.<br/><br/>Do I recommend this film to others???   "" Noooo.....YESSSS!!!!!"""
"Miikaj","9","15","17","12 June 2002"," I can watch it again and again and laugh
","A Night at the Roxbury is not usual comedy. My opinion is that it is a good parody with good music. There are many scenes in the movie, you know they won't happen in any other movie. The way how those brothers talk with each others after wedding, and all those stuff, it is really genius. There are many good jokes in that movie, and if you don't laugh to them, it won't spoil the movie. It WON'T TRY to make you laugh and it is good thing. Because movie won't be spoiled, if you don't laugh. But there are so many good jokes in the movie, that usually it MAKES you laugh.<br/><br/>
A very good movie with 80's and 90's music. This is a cult movie in it's own genre."
"tbaby2290","Null","21","25","2 May 2004"," Good to the last laugh...
","Apparently, not many people are being very fair about the movie, by rating it at 1 or 2 on scale up to 10. Please people, understand that this movie was not made to get Oscars, or Grammys, it was made for the people entertainment, so don't go off giving that crap about ""i dont like will ferrell or chris kattan so it sucked"" cause if you don't like them, DONT WATCH THE MOVIE IN THE FIRST PLACE! as simple as that.<br/><br/>
I myself am very fond of this movie. I think it is a great comedy, and sure it's not for the whole family, in fact, I'd only recommend it to people who enjoy the stupid comedy on Saturday Night Live.<br/><br/>The movie basically goes like this - Doug (Chris Kattan) and Steve Butabi (Will Ferrell) are brothers that try to get into the town's best night club, the Roxbury. Although they aren't successful entering the club on their own, they get help when actor Richard Greico's fancy little sport car rams into the back of Doug and Steve's van. Richard doesn't want the boys to sue him, so he invites them all into the Roxbury as a little appology for the car damage. Doug and Steve meet a few ""foxy"" ladies, get their freak on with them, and get rejected by them. harsh harsh. then the guys get in a huge argument about all the unfortunate events that happened that day, and doug ends up moving out of their bedroom into the guesthouse right nextdoor. and as steve puts it ""I just miss doug"" dad says ""well he's right next door and that things like a mansion!"" steve says ""but theres no cable"" dad says ""sure there is."" steve says ""BUT THERE'S NO HBO!"" haha yeah anyways, steve begings dating the college girl that works in her dad's lamp store next to the brothers father's flower shop. the dad had always been trying to hook steve and the girl up, so in the end they're getting married and.. yeah, you watch the rest yourself.<br/><br/>The music choices in the movie were awesome, pure awesome. the cd is G for Great! anyone who has seen this movie and hates it, hasn't paid enough attention to it. Stop looking for the negatives, and you'll see how funny this movie really is. It isn't meant for the big award shows, remember, it's made for ""fun, comedy and entertainment."" if you don't enjoy any of those things, DON'T WATCH IT. and DON'T HATE will ferrell or chris kattan, cause they're my homeboys and I love them.<br/><br/>peace"

","This movie was better than I expected! These two are such dorks, but that is what's funny! The outfits, the attitude, the car are all part of the comedy too.

","Well the first time i saw this film it kind of reminded me of how me and my friend used to joke around and it really made me feel dumb about myself cause something i would act dumb like that too. I really thought this movie was funny in my point of view. The music in this film is probably the best music in any film to me because i love trance and house music so this was a good movie to watch. In the movie Steve and Doug dont even look like brothers but they sure act like it. I love how they do slow moving shots. makes you laugh and wanna watch at the same time wondering what is going to happen. One of the best parts of this movie are the lines, like did you grass my butt, or you outta town you new, aiight. There are plenty of them in the movie and i even use them in everyday life cause its just funny. This movie should be ranked higher in the imdb. In my opinion i give it a 10 rating."

Will Ferrell is funny in any role he plays and Chris Kattan is so cute. One of the funniest things about this movie was how Doug (Kattan) and Steve (Ferrell) act so dumb. Especially Steve. And I think it's sweet how they love each other so much. And not many brothers are like that!! Emily (Molly Shannon) got on my nerves. She turned out to be this whole different person when she and Steve finally got together. I can't stand people like that. Anyways. This movie is funny and cute and great entertainment.

","Going to see NATR I was not expecting much. But when the opening begins you can sense this is a step above most over mindless comedies. The two Butabi brothers entertain the whole time with thier hilarious antics. As the story goes the brothers dream of owning the coolest night club. The problem is they can't even get in to the popular clubs never mind run one. One night they catch a break and find their way into the club business but as quickly as the next day it goes wrong. Throughout the movie Katan and Ferrel act their parts perfectly. Two spoiled brothers living with thier parents and get everything they need. There complete idiotic actions make this movie a great film to just sit and down and watch with some friends."

","I completely understand why someone would not care for this movie.  In addition to the whole 90's ""club"" environment (which many people may not be able to relate to), it's silly as hell.  But I must say, in my opinion, A Night at the Roxbury deserves legendary status as a comedy. To be honest, I didn't think it was all that funny the first time I saw it, but much like the movie Austin Powers, it really grows on you after repeated viewing. I've seen it at nearly 20 times and I'm still not sick of it. I know at least a dozen people - friends and family members - who absolutely LOVE this movie, and I run into people all the time who say they love it as well. Okay, it may have initially tanked at the box office, but SURELY A Night at the Roxbury has accumulated enough profit through VHS and DVD sales to warrant a sequel. To the studio: please, for the love of god, MAKE A SEQUEL!!!"

I would rate this movie 7 out of 10 because of some of the parts are just stupid as I said before. My favorite actor in this movie would be Chris Catten who plays in Undercover Brother which is a kind of good movie, my favorite actress in this movie would be the girl plays as Candy in a night at the roxberry who plays in i don't know but she played good in this movie.

","This is a film that is better than you expect it to be.  It's sort of Last Days of Disco meets Wayne's World.  <br/><br/>It is based on an idea that came from Saturday Night Live about three guys who are trying to get into discos/parties and are so uncool.  They all bob their heads to the music in a funny fashion and try to pick up women, which of course they are useless at but think they are excellent at.  The third person from this original skit was Jim Carrey.  For whatever reason Jim Carrey was not in this movie but the other two are and despite Carrey's absence the comedy has his distinct style in many ways, particularly with visual comedy.<br/><br/>The music, if you like European 90s disco/house is very good and the support actors are excellent.  There are more than a couple of people from the original Clueless film if you can spot them all.<br/><br/>To give you a basic plot, which in this type of movie isn't really important anyway, you have two sons of a rich LA shop owner.  They live for parties and think they are well into the scene but their dad thinks they are a waste of space.  They try to get into a club called the Roxbury which is more exclusive and through a series of events, mistaken identities and so on move into the partying fast-lane.  There are some ups and downs for our two guys though but in true tradition there is a happy ending.<br/><br/>If you liked Wayne's World and Dumb and Dumber there is enough similar humour for you.  It's worth seeing in my opinion, I gave it 7 out of 10 and I'm normally quite tight."

","If you think this movie sucks, well, it's really your opinion. But my opinion is that it's one of the funniest movies ever made. For those who disagree with me, it all depends on your taste. This movie is more of a weird/cheap humor kind of thing, and that's what a lot of people like. But a lot of people also like smart humor, in which this movie doesn't offer (that much). So this movie (and all other Saturday Night Live movies) are meant to be weird. It's funny to see how some people could act in real life. So people who's of weird and cheap humor, this movie is great! But for those of you smart alecs out there who like smart movies, this one (or any other Saturday Night Live) movie really should'nt be your pick 10/10"

","and i still love it to when i watched it back in 1998. this film is one of those comedies that just hit you in the face with how stupid people can be, and in effect make us laugh. I have actually met people like those in the film, and it adds to the laugh.<br/><br/>Watch it and enjoy, though it may be old, most new comedies are rubbish like "" BRUUCE_ALMIGHTY "" never liked it."
"Cornelius Chesterfield","Null","13","16","22 October 2002"," A must-see
","This is one of those movies that you never bother to check out because you didn't hear good things about it, and then one day someone close rents it and you end up loving it. Note: I've never seen the SNL sketches, I never watch it because I think its terribly unfunny, so I didn't watch Roxbury with prejudice or bias.<br/><br/>What I love the most about it is that its a comedy for all ages. This is something that you can watch with your kids or family and not be grossed out and embarassed by all the dick and fart humour, or the cruel humour. While the characters are silly, and you do laugh AT them, you can't help but like them. They are loveable in their own stupid way, but that doesn't pigeon-hole the movie into predictable physical gags like Dumb and Dumber or what-have-you. The dialogue and characters is what actually carries the movie, and it does a great job for the most part. The Jerry McGuire spoof ending is absolutely hysterical and that alone is worth the price of the rent. But you also have the wonderful music, every single track that plays was a great hit in its day.<br/><br/>I'm a video rental store clerk and I put this movie on the main TVs once a night...it's in my very small circle of movies that contain good enough dialogue to be enjoyed at any given moment, alongside the likes of Big Lebowski and Pulp Fiction, though not quite at their level.<br/><br/>A mere 4.9/10 rating? I suppose it needed more pie-****ing and swearing to please the IMDB audience?"
"AlsExGal","7","5","5","11 November 2018"," This is one of my guilty pleasures
","Yeah, it's one SNL skit stretched out to an hour and a half, but twenty years later it is still funny. It is dated. Lots of people will not know who Richard Grieco is or anything about ""Twenty One Jump Street"", and why are those people talking into bricks? but the human element is still recognizable and therefore funny.<br/><br/>You have two very childish geeky brothers close in age and aspirations - they want to own their own club - but they have a dad (Dan Hedaya) who is completely unhappy with them and their lack of interest in his business and what he hopes will be their business someday - an artificial flower shop in Beverly Hills.<br/><br/>The Butabi brothers think that they are much cooler than they really are, would starve if not for dad's wealth, and go out every night in hope of getting into an exclusive club - the Roxbury. The bouncer is having none of it. Then one night they get rear ended by Richard Grieco, and to avoid a possible lawsuit he gets them into the Roxbury. The plot takes it from there.<br/><br/>What are the human elements that are familiar? Two guys well into their twenties trying to hide their lack of sexual experience, and falling for two party girls who would not give them the time of day if not for who they think they are - rich guys with connections. A man with lots of wealth and business savvy actually liking these two guys who have nothing going for them that anybody else can see. A dad who is particularly angry with one son maybe because he reminds him of himself at that age. And a girl who chases after the other son because she knows she can manipulate him into marriage and unite two empires - her dad's lamp store and the Butabis' flower shop.<br/><br/>I have no idea how one fake flower shop could make Mr. Butabi that rich, but it is still funny after all of these years. And the soundtrack is to die for. It's too bad Hollywood is so broken these days that they just can't make silly movies whose entire point is just plain fun.<br/><br/>With Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan as the clueless and close-as-twins Butabi brothers, Dan Hedaya as the constantly yelling father, Loni Anderson as the unconditionally loving mom who has a permanent scaffold built around her for all of the plastic surgery she gets, and Molly Shannon as the aggressive and mercenary girl chasing after Ferrell's character, sometimes literally."

","This is a fun movie if you can laugh at people totally without a clue. The two brothers have no idea whatsoever and constantly make fools out of themselves although they think they're the coolest people on the planet.<br/><br/>The story isn't to much to care about, it's the situations that arise wherever the two brothers show up that makes the movie worth watching.<br/><br/>A comparison with Dumb & Dumber isn't all wrong but 'A night at the Roxbury' isn't as childish as that one, the brothers aren't really that stupid, just clueless."

It's cheap, laugh-a-minute style is quick and harmless, so that even if only one out of 5 jokes hits your funny bone, you will still have a great time.  Personally I don't like the skit on SNL, but found that Katan, Ferrell, and the writers did a wonderful job fleshing-out these loveable doofs.  If you can't take this movie for the light-hearted, good-natured comedy it is, then look in the mirror and ask yourself if you shouldn't be spending less time in Starbucks and watching Casablanca, and more time just goofing off."

The movie also is short, which was a good move.

","I have seen this movie dozens of times and it gets funnier each time and it never gets old! Although the humor is not very sophisticated, and the target audience is 12 year-old boys, it is still a very funny. Based on an old SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE skit, A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY stars Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan as brothers Steve and Doug Butabi. Steve and Doug are always out ""clubbing"" and partying, but they are never successful with women. Their goal in life is to get their names onto the list of the famed ""Roxbury"" nightclub. Most of the movie is just Steve and Doug head-bobbing to ""What is Love?"" by Haddaway. Although the plot runs very, very thin and is not backed up by a very strong supporting cast, it is a very funny movie, and is great to watch over and over."

"lesleyharris30","8","3","3","22 June 2015"," A Guilty Pleasure, Simple Fun,
","A Night at the Roxbury is a great movie with a well written storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. It's a really funny movie, I know there isn't much about it that makes it an excellent, unforgettable comedy, but I simply have so much fun whenever I watch it, it's really simple, the storyline is easy to follow and every scene is basically just a set up for some pure laughs between Ferrell and Kattan. It's certainly not a perfect movie and it has many flaws, the first hour of the movie barely has a story, and they're clearly trying their best to cram in a bit of a storyline in the last half hour, also some jokes were repeated much too often and others went further than necessary. The cast are certainly the movies highlight and if it wasn't for the fact that they all were clearly having a great time filming this and seemed interested, this movie would have been terrible, obviously the most praise must go to Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan, but there are also some very funny and memorable performances from the likes of Richard Grieco, Dan Hedaya, Loni Anderson, Meredith Scott Lynn and, one of my favourite characters in this film, Lochlyn Munro. It's definitely not perfect, but if you find the two leads as likable as I do then you're sure to enjoy A Night at the Roxbury, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. <br/><br/>Two brothers, Doug and Steve Butabi, try to follow their dreams of starting their own night club, but this becomes an issue when they can't get in to the biggest one in town, the Roxbury. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Will Ferrell Worst Performance: Gigi Rice"

","This movie is such a guilty pleasure for me. I don't know how many times I've seen it now over the years, but every time I catch it on TV it still makes me laugh. Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan are embarrassingly good as loser, poser brothers Steve & Doug. Trying their hardest to get into the best club in town, ""score"" with some hot chicks and stop working in their father's silk plant store. I love how this movie just takes it to the next level with their coolness. The music is good, if dated now and there's a great supporting cast here too. It's just a fun time.<br/><br/>The scene at the end where the brothers make up after their big fight and it feels like its going to be a big climatic romance kiss is too funny. This is one of those comedies that you don't take anything away from but you'll get several laughs while you're watching it. 01/13"

In spite of the recent string of bombed out SNL feature films, A Night at the Roxbury really hits the mark for true fans.<br/><br/>Panned by critics, as always, because they don't appreciate the sort of humor that die-hard SNL fans crave.  Finally, after years of drought, the show has regained that fresh comedy they were founded for--and that freshness is alive and kicking in this movie.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, one of the things I liked best about the movie was the trailer, because they didn't give all the best jokes away.  There were many pleasant surprises waiting for me, and I laughed harder than I had in a long time at a movie.<br/><br/>I give it a very enthusiastic 4 stars out of 5, understanding that this movie is NOT for everybody.  If you've never heard of the Roxbury Guys before, and/or you do not currently believe that Chris Kattan and Will Ferrel are two of the most brilliant comedians SNL has seen in the last 3-4 years, this movie is probably not for you.<br/><br/>Personally, I enjoyed it tremendously and cannot WAIT to see it again!<br/><br/>Favorite Line:  ""My dad already paid for the caterer."""

They're just ""differently successful"". ;-)<br/><br/>Nor is it the film's target audience 12 year old boys. It's fun for people who were of age during the 80s, and my nearly 16 year old daughter and her intellectual friends love it, though it's annoying to watch it with them because they've memorized all the lines.<br/><br/>Some people have complained that the movie has no plot, but it does have a plot, and it even has an arc to the story line, actually multiple arcs to multiple story lines, which is why the end of the movie is so satisfying, because each of several conflicts is resolved in the last ten minutes.<br/><br/>This is an excellent film, entertaining throughout.

"TOMASBBloodhound","7","4","5","25 August 2004"," Only 4.9? Lighten up, people!
","I will be the first to agree that a great many SNL skits have translated poorly to the big screen. This isn't one of them. Unfortunately since so many of these SNL films have bombed, most people seem ready to trash them if they aren't classics. The last time I checked, the only SNL film to reach classic status was the Blues Brothers. A Night at the Roxbury is no Blues Brothers, but there are still more than a few laughs in it.<br/><br/>I like this film. I'm not ashamed to say it one bit. It makes me laugh. Chris Kattan and Will Ferrel are hilarious as the Butabi brothers who try too hard to be cool, and always fail to get into the best clubs. Will Ferrel has seen his career blossom since this film was made. Kattan has had less success, but I think he runs circles around Ferrel in this one. He is basically the snotty, whiny, and spoiled son of a rich man who sells silk plants. Ferrel is his dim-witted brother. There are quite a few nice supporting parts by veteran actors who now probably wish they hadn't been in the film due to its poor reviews. <br/><br/>As I said earlier, this is no classic. In fact the last 20 min or so where Ferrel is planning to marry Molly Shannon are pretty dumb. I do find other parts particularly amusing, though.<br/><br/>How about their walk down the beach in those ""very European-looking"" bathing suits? How about them getting ready to go out clubbing while that Rod Stewart song is playing? How about them being too chicken to actually score with those club vixen when they get the chance to? Their ride home from the failed meeting with Mr. Zadir was also rather funny. <br/><br/>I guess I'd say this: Don't let the fact that this is a SNL movie scare you off. Give it a chance. This is a good film to watch with your friends before going out on the town, for example. I'm sure at least someone will spout a one-liner or two from it before the night is done. <br/><br/>A solid 7 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>So sayeth the Hound."
"LebowskiT1000","8","4","5","2 August 2002"," Good Fun
","I was quite a bit skeptical of this film being very funny when I first saw the previews.  The skit is funny on SNL in 3 minute increments, but an hour and half of it could be pretty bad.  So, I had pretty low expectations going into this film.  After seeing it, I have to say that I thought it was great and MUCH funnier than I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell are a spectacular duo!  The both did a great job with their roles.  Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri were nice additions to the cast, they both did a good job.  I have to say that Elisa Donovan, Gigi Rice, Meredith Scott Lynn and Jennifer Coolidge looked spectacular throughout the film, VERY beautiful women!  Lochlyn Munro (as Craig) was great too, I've only seen him in a few movies, but he really seems to be a great actor.  I was very happy to see Colin Quinn in the film.  This guy is great!  It was also cool to see Michael Clarke Duncan in the film, even though he had a very small part in the film.  I don't know what it is, but there is something about Molly Shannon that really bugs me.  Sometimes, she can be really funny, but other times I just can't stand her.  Maybe it's because she always acts the same, in all her films, I don't know.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought the film was hilarious and was much better than I anticipated.  There are a number of scenes that make me laugh just thinking about them.  If you like the SNL skit at all, then you should probably see this film.  I really hope that you enjoy the film.

","I had never even heard of the ""Saturday Night Live"" skit this was based on. All I knew about this was the massive amount of buzz it created as a meme on YTMND. I honestly think it set a record for biggest meme on that entire website. I admit to not knowing really why, because the movie's mediocre at best. This movie features two brothers who try to get in at a nightclub called the Roxbury. Actually, only half of the movie is that.<br/><br/>The other half is them trying to get girls. It's pretty clichÃ©d, especially with how it's about two guys who split up and have to get back together. I kept thinking Jim Carrey was involved in this somehow. Apparently, he WAS, but it was only uncredited as a writer. Some jokes are good, but for the most part, it's pretty forgettable. Again, the music is amazing. **"

Director didn't use the dumb approach where everything revolves around farts, falls and stupidity, this movie is much better than that. This is the movie where you will laugh out loud if you really want to see a movie that involves 80's and the dance era that made us all wonder did we really look like that? We did look like that, but its only Will and Chris who can put it into the move to perfection.

I was so overjoyed, and got tickets for opening night. Well, let me say, I think they did a GREAT job in turning all those 3-4 minutes sketches into an 80 minute movie. I was reading some of the previous reviews, and I couldn't believe it when I read, ""It wasn't funny"". Well, maybe it wasn't in that person's point of view, but let me ask this person... Is that the only reason why you went to see it ? Because you thought it was funny ? Well, in my opinion, that was a mistake. I know it wasn't entirely his fault. I mean, the previews made it look funnier than it actually was. My advice, don't just rent this movie because you heard it was funny. It wasn't just a comical movie. It had action, tragedy, and romance too. My Point... Some people saw this movie as a ""Tasteless, Not-Funny Movie"". But me ? I saw it as a story about two guys who had a dream, and pursued to make that dream come true. I give this movie as a 10 !!!"

The only problem is that the 2 characters in the movie weren't driving a Trans Am with a gold emblem on the hood like the people I used to run into in the 80's.

If you're a fan of that, you should like the movie.  Actually that was one the reasons why I like it.  The Roxbury Guys were the first thing I ever saw of SNL, and fell in love with them and the show.<br/><br/>Another reason why I loved this movie, because it is one of those movies where you go to it and you don't have to think.  You just sit there and have a good time, and not try to figure out who done it.  If you watch this movie and start to think, I doubt that you will like it.<br/><br/>In closing if you like the Roxbury Guys or other SNL movies, go see this movie now well it's in theatres.

True the story line is not the best but any Saturday Night Live fan can see the true meaning of the film and that is Doug and Steve Butabi! Anyone that gives this film a bad review is not a Saturday Night Live fan. This movie based on the classic Saturday Night Live sketch of 'A Night at the Roxbury' and does a great job of bringing the Saturday Night Live to the big screen.

","Wow. I never knew this film could cause so much controversy. Opinions seem to be split around fifty-fifty as to whether it's a wonderfully funny piece of comedy, or a ridiculous pile of garbage. Personally, I love it, but I can see why people might hate it. If you try to take a film about women-starved idiots too seriously, you're bound to hate it. However, if you accept that the film is inherently stupid, and you're just meant to laugh at the characters, maybe you could enjoy it just a little. Maybe not, but I did.<br/><br/>Obviously this isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's worth a laugh. If you want a film that will have you giggling hysterically (if your sense of humour's as weird as mine) then see it. If not, and you're looking for an intelligent commentary on American nightlife in the nineties, forget it. Anyway, I like it."

I have to admit that my opinion is biased because I enjoy him so much but this movie, though lacking a very persuasive plot to sustain it, was amusing. The best parts, one must admit, are Chris Kattan's relation with a woman working as a creditor and the disruption of Will Ferrell's wedding. It was definately more than 2 hours of head-bopping however, and maybe not worth 9 bucks at theatres, but definately a movie to rent. I give it a B."

","This is quite a subtle comedy. A thinking man's film. I expect that many of the jokes went straight over the heads of many viewers thus causing them to defensively deride this gem. For us few who can appreciate it, it is simply a breath of fresh air. The movie definitely hearkens back to the good old days of eighties movies. It is interesting to note that many of the actors as well as the music have connections to that ""decade"". Gigi Rice and Jennifer Coolidge both were 30+ at the time and of course there was Richard Grieco. I missed the beginning of the movie and look forward to seeing that when next it runs."

","Don't let the 81 minute tally fool you.  This movie is 75 minutes of jaw-droppingly bad movie making.  I saw it for free and I actually consider walking out.  It's one thing to rag on SNL movies; they are easy targets to be sure.  Night at the Roxbury, on the other hand, opens new doors.  The holes created by stretching the dead-horse TV skit to movie length were too big to be filled-in by boring cliches already shriveled from years of overuse.<br/><br/>To be fair, there are several chuckles in this movie.  However, this may have simply been a knee-jerk reaction from the need to find something, anything to laugh at in the midst of this horrible flick.  As it turns out, one of these ""funny moments"" was lifted from Say Anything (I have been told). I think Will Farrell is (usually) fantastic and his was the only line delivered that made me guffaw.  Overall, the performances weren't even phoned in, they were delivered bulk rate.  Don't get me wrong, I love stupid, even bad movies if there is something likeable about them; an earnestness, some charm or good humor.  This has next to nothing in the ""redeeming qualities"" basket."

It's a daffy cross between CLUELESS and 54 with some SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER (and LIVE) as well as DUMB AND DUMBER thrown in. The two brothers are deliciously out of touch, but their innocent thick-headedness causes them to make the world bend to their own view of reality. It was definitely a fun film."

The movie is good for a number of reasons 1. It has loads of laughs in it 2. Will Ferrell and Chris Katten are perfect as Doug and Steve Butabi 3. It has good cameos and is unpredictable. Overall I think this movie deserves an enormous rating something like 73%. So watch this movie for a few laughs and you will not be disappointed."

This would be a 10 if it had at least 90 minutes. It would be better with Jim Carrey, but...taking what we have...this is really great.<br/><br/>The Roxbury Guys is one of the greatest recurring skits, only 2nd to Celebrity Jeopardy! (But Roxbury is the best that is eligible for a movie).<br/><br/>So, in closing, I'm gonna say that A Night at the Roxbury is great if you have a good weekend. 9/10 just for length.

I had never heard of Will Ferrell before this movie came out, but he did a hilarious job here and has of course seen his career proliferate since. He and Chris Kattan play slacker brothers Steve and Doug Butabi, trying to get into a club. Well, that's the official plot; but like other such movies, it's basically an excuse for a bunch of crazy situations.<br/><br/>I've seen some of the ""SNL"" episodes that had this skit.

","A Night at the Roxbury is an amazingly hilarious movie. There are no slow sappy parts where the story drags on like a comedy should be. It is a movie about two brothers Doug(Kattan) and Steve(Ferrell) Butabi who are always trying to get into the perfect nightclub, The Roxbury. It keeps you entertained in the fact that the two don't have a clue about woman or good bar mannerisms but they are always getting after women and are always out clubbing. The music goes perfect with the movie for that year's club dance scene, mostly Ace of Base and Haddaway. Their outfit's, which are worn during most of the movie, are funny in being silk purple and blue. Richard Greico makes a couple of appearances as himself and Lochlyn Monroe(dead man on campus) is funny as the brothers best friend and physical trainer. All in all a very entertaining and somewhat touching movie."

On the other hand if you feel that you have missed this period of your life or are unable tó laugh at yourself you should not watch this movie.

","We're all supposed to hate this kind of movie -- the bonehead comedy, combined with the whole lovelorn-losers shtick. And to be honest, I almost always do. But it was on TV last week. I fell into it during the first 10 minutes and stayed through the end, even though I had things to do. It's FUNNY. It's not a masterpiece or at all Oscarworthy, but it's more than just a check-your-brains popcorn flick. A few specific scenes stand out as memorably cute, most especially the way Doug (Chris Kattan) interrupts the wedding. Kattan's lines, mannerisms, and expressions are probably most of what elevates this film above the crap it could have been, but they're not the overdone mugging one sees in, for example, Jim Carrey (whom I can't tolerate, but who I understand co-wrote this film - hmm.). I think most everyone else's performances were enhanced by Kattan's presence.<br/><br/>Obviously nobody who hates the song ""What is Love"" should see this film.

Try a summer night's fishing with no interest and plenty of beers (Ray Road near Molesey Heath... Ernie!). It's just SO stupid and SO short that last summer (2000) me and my close friend (Ross Batchelor) couldn't get enough of it. To be honest, the first time I watched this film I was not impressed, but then it began to grow on me. Each time I watch it I notice another element of physical or verbal stupidity which was slowly but surely transformed into a big laugh. The Butabi's are ass-wadsmoronic no-hopers with small brains and big hearts. I like it. I laugh whenever I watch it. But don't let that suggest this film is any good. It really is down to your state of mind (or lack of mind). With my other recently favourable films including Happiness (1998)-also featuring Emily Sanderson Butabi (no, really, it sounds better), Buffalo '66 and Rushmore, anyone who has seen A Night At The Roxbury and all of the above must be very confused.

I had two of the biggest laughs I can remember recently when Will Ferrell unwraps the plastic on a new day planner to check if he's busy for a meeting, and when Will and Chris reenacted the scene from Jerry Maguire on a bridge after the failed marriage.

Damn right!<br/><br/>A Night At The Roxbury might go unnoticed by a younger audience today, and yes it may mean more to me because of the memories, but I do think it holds up well and anyone who is a fan of Jim Carrey's early work will love this tale of brotherhood, love and dance music..."
"The-Sarkologist","7","1","1","18 October 2013"," Even donks can run a successful nightclub
","This is one of those movies which I saw an ad for and decided that I wanted to see it. My first impression was that it was about two guys in the vein of Bill and Ted. Afterwards I began to have second thoughts yet I still went along to see it. My final opinion of this movie is that it is good, and quite funny in parts. When the movie's gags stick in my mind then the comedy has succeeded.<br/><br/>A Night at the Roxbury are about two brothers who cruise the nightclub circuit of Los Angeles looking for girls. Their dream is to own a night club, but they really are not all that cool. In fact they find themselves thrown out of more night clubs than let into them. Their jokes are funny to them but nobody else. In fact, they live in their own little world in which they want people to be apart of, but the serious people think they are pure donks. What ends up happening is that the owner of the Roxbury, the best nightclub in Los Angeles, actually likes them and wants to implement their ideas, yet his driver thinks him mad and does not like them.<br/><br/>This is not the plot though. The main focus of the movie is their relationship with their father. Their father has great plans for them, but they don't want to pursue them. One of them is really unsure, and after they have a fight, he is easily taken away, forced to marry a woman that he really does not like, and to run a business he does not want to run.<br/><br/>There is an interesting warning in the movie - don't jump on the woman that chases you around because you will discover that she is trying to mould you to what she wants you to be. I can think of a woman who is like that, and fortunately my friends managed to pull me away from her.<br/><br/>I can't really think of any deep or meaningful thing to say about this movie, but that is not its point. A Night at the Roxbury is not a deep movie, it is a fun movie. It shows you that what normal people consider donks can succeed in their bizarre plans. It is interesting that they get their nightclub and become partners with the most prominent nightclub owner in the city. It gives us an idea of what the night life is like, but at this point in history it is something that we don't need to know. I still liked this movie though."

","A Night at the Roxbury is an SNL production. Most of Saturday night Live productions are pretty good. Excluding Superstar, which is obviously bad. SNL has done films such as Waynes World, Waynes world 2, and Mean Girls. A Night at the Roxbury isn't SNL's best film, but it's hilarious. I know the movie is pretty stupid, but I appreciate it for many reasons. The only problem I have with it is Will Ferrell. Ferrell is a moron in this movie. Who am I kidding? Both of them are retards. But the difference between the two of them are that Chris Kattan is actually stupid funny. Will Ferrell is just stupid.<br/><br/>The Plot: The Butabi Brothers, Doug and Steve, are bar hoppers. The two of them try to get into this club called The Roxbury. But are always turned down. So one night when Richard Greico accidentally hits them with his car, he gets them into the Roxbury this way he doesn't have to pay for damages. While in the club, the two meet this casino owner named Mr. Zadeer, who changes their lives.<br/><br/>As silly as A night at the Roxbury is, it's enjoyable. Most people don't appreciate the humor that the film has to offer. I wouldn't want to be with Molly Shannon either Will Ferrell. I don't like Molly Shannon. It seems to me in every movie she plays this dirty, irritating bitch. She is in this movie. Chris Kattan is awesome as Doug, the more likable brother.

","""A Night At The Roxbury"" is yet another in a string of ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches to make it to the big screen. Not as classic as ""Wayne's World,"" while not as terrible as ""It's Pat!,"" this flick finds a happy medium. It's not comedy gold, but at the same time, it's mindless and innocent fun. Those who are fans of late 90's ""SNL"" in particular will revel in the nostalgia it induces. And even if you're not of that percentage, it's worth a gander to see Will Ferrell in one of his earliest movie roles, as one of two Butabi brothers, opposite Chris Kattan, who has sadly faded away in comparison to Ferrell's success.<br/><br/>About the movie: The Butabi brothers live a simple life. By night, they cruise the city, hopping from nightclub to nightclub, failing to gain entry to the holy grail that is The Roxbury. By day they sleep it all off, while managing to find time to work in the plastic plant store owned by their father. Their dream of becoming night-club hot-shots comes true when Richard Grieco (of ""21 Jump Street"" fame) rear-ends them, and in lieu of a lawsuit, agrees to get the brothers into their dream club. From there they make a new, high-profile connection, hook up with a couple of gold-diggers who give them some much needed life-experience while simultaneously proving to the world that they aren't massive failures and/or losers. Starring opposite Ferrell and Kattan are other ""SNL"" alumni Molly Shannon, Colin Quinn and Mark McKinney, as well as Lochlyn Munro, Dan Hedaya, Loni Anderson, Michael Clark Duncan, Eva Mendes ad Jennifer Coolidge. The movie has got limited appeal and screams ""1990's"" but if you're willing enough to let your guard down and enjoy a light-weight buddy comedy, ""A Night At The Roxbury"" will do just fine. With Will Ferrell showing some early comedic chops and obvious improvisation, as well as a strong nostalgic sense, it's the kind of movie that is hard not to at least crack a smile at."

A Night At The Roxbury, staring Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan, is pretty much a one and a half hour version of the skit from SNL.

","The SNL skits I found funny, but placing such a short one line joke into a feature narrative isn't easy. The storyline is decent but not too exciting - what is worse is some of the totally excessive and forced dialog of the side characters (a la Kevin Smith's less polished moments). The ending is very uninventive, typical of comedy writers who view the ending as ""we just wanna wrap it up fast"" as opposed to making a strong comedic punctuation. This film would have been better if Farrel and Katan had a good long schedule and were allowed to sit down with the others (some of whom are pretty solid actors) and improvise some more scenes and situations. However, with the limited cartoony characters they play, it's not an easy task to make it so interesting to begin with. That said, there are some good simple laughs here, but nothing of the level of humor that even a good Laurel and Hardy film can bring."

How long before we get a Dominican Lou, Mr. Peepers, or Nude Male Model movies?<br/><br/>One gets the feeling from the first 5 minutes of the movie that every second afterwards is totally unnecessary, the gimmick already having been delivered.<br/><br/>A waste of time, talent and money.

","..I probably wouldn't mind it's existence. But this is a paper-thin premise combined with cardboard cutout Characters and such a lack of any development that it's genuinely difficult to care about anything that's happening. Will Ferrell is fairly funny at times, at least he can express emotions. His partner in crime, Chris Kattan, however is clearly struggling to convey that he's an actual human being.
I wanted a comedy film telling a story about people, not a bunch of cartoonish caricatures in an inconsequential sequence of events.
This movie actually manages to be pretty annoying by constantly repackaging their dumb, uncreative jokes within the same movie over and over again.
Being repetitive or dumb really isn't the problem though."" Dude, Where is my Car"" is a dumb, repetitive movie. But it's also self-aware and creative. There is some actual craft involved and it works. A big part of that is that those guys had an actual goal. It's right there in the title.. Where is my Car, Dude? We have to find it to keep our girlfriends.
This tiny little bit of conflict and motivation makes all the difference.
A Night at the Roxbury is just a 30 second SNL-sketch stretched to 80 minutes.
This is best illustrated by the best character in this trash heap: The old Club-Owner who has one joke about someone grabbing his ass, which he repeats about 12 times. Things constantly devolve from kinda funny to ""Can we move on, please?""
But hay, there is almost 10 minutes of entertaining footage to be found in this pile of needles. So don't take my word for it. And if you find yourself desperate for more Will Farrell you might actually get a kick out of this.
This could have possibly been worthwhile if they also had Jim Carrey.
But. They. Didn't."

","There have been several Saturday Night Live skits that were a perfect inspiration for a great feature-length comedy, like Blues Brothers, Coneheads and Wayne's World, but this pathetic excuse for a comedy begs the question of how it ever got made.<br/><br/>I have sat through many Pauly Shore, Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler comedies that were enjoyable in their own cringeworthy way, because the jokes were in bad taste but at least they made me laugh. This film doesn't have a single gag in it that made me crack up, I never got beyond an uneasy smile (thank you for that, Michael Clarke Duncan). Not only is the script unbelievably bad, but the performances really made my eyes bleed.<br/><br/>You'd think that the premise of two deluded losers who try to talk their way into an exclusive nightclub would be a perfect set-up for some good comedy, but it's not. This part of the movie is over in 45 minutes, and the rest of the movie is a badly written attempt to extend the plot with some scattered ideas to get the film up to feature length. But a bad script doesn't have to be the death blow to a comedy as long as the jokes are good and the actors can deliver. But the only thing worse than the script or lack of jokes are the excruciating performances by Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan. Their clearly improvised exercise in hysterics really got on my nerves, and their attempts at picking up women are unbelievably creepy rather than funny. The #metoo movement could submit this film as evidence for how women were mistreated in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Clearly there are people who really like this movie, and that's okay. There are dozens of movies that score below 5.0 that I like. But how this ever got to a 6.3 here on IMDb is beyond me. No wonder that Chazz Palminteri remained uncredited (by choice, I hope). Even Freddy Got Fingered had more inspired jokes than this film. The only area where they put in some effort was the cool 90s soundtrack (although even Haddaway's 'Baby Don't Hurt Me' got stale after hearing it for the tenth time). I have a lot of good nostalgia for the era, but this movie is not part of it."

As some others have pointed out, most SNL spinoff movies fail miserably, with the two exceptions being ""Blues Brothers"" and ""Wayne's World.""<br/><br/>This one should fall into a class of its own, though - it had utterly failed in the first three minutes, which is probably a record. Put it this way: when you make a movie, whether intentionally, that starts off looking like someone shot it on a Sony Handicam in their basement, you're not setting yourself up for success.<br/><br/>And of course, then you get smacked in the head with the idiot story, the moronic dialogue, the forced nature of pretty much everything - the conflicts that fly up to drive the plot are among the most ridiculous and hackneyed pieces of drivel ever to get written into a film.<br/><br/>Sure, there are brief moments where you'll laugh, but not so much because the film is funny. You'll laugh out of pity. You'll laugh because you're uncomfortable and laughing's the only way to escape the mindlessness you're facing.<br/><br/>Skip this one, just like you should skip most SNL spinoffs.

"chr1sberg","7","1","2","20 January 2002"," Even Chris Kattan's pedantics and 81 minute running time don't detract
","Let me start this off by saying that movies based off Saturday Night Live skits are generally not too good. Besides a few exceptions (Blues Brothers, Coneheads, etc), most of them have fallen around the reigns of movies like Superstar.<br/><br/>Night at the Roxbury is an exception, it's right down the middle. It's an enjoyable, light hearted comedy with some very witty dialogue and acting. Chris Kattan is a bit weak in the lead, but Will Farrell makes up for Kattan's lacking humor and delivery. Molly Shannon is likeable as Emily, Farrell's squeeze, and the brilliant standout is Dan Hedaya is what might be his greatest acting performance of his career. Hedaya, in my opinion, is one of the best character actors of the 90s, and has been in many great roles in many great films. For some reason, his acting and dialogue fit perectly, and result in some lines and scenes that make you stop the DVD because you're laughing so hard.<br/><br/>The plot is very thin, there's not much to it outside of Kattan/Farrell's rompings, but it is enjoyable and somewhat unique. It results in an expected but humorous ending.<br/><br/>Chazz Palminteri, also, in an uncredited role (not surprisng for how this movie looked to most people), is extremely funny as Mr. Zadir, the owner of the Roxbury. He offsets the extremely unfunny and very predicatble Colin Quinn who plays his bodyguard and is in almost every scene that Palminteri is.<br/><br/>Because the plot is so shallow and thin, and the entire movie is situational, it weighs in at a very unhefty 1 hr 21 minutes. This is very short for a comedy, and it runs by very fast, but it was probably a good choice to keep it that length, else it might get very repetitive.<br/><br/>The result is an extremely funny situational comedy with a light fun story and some great one liners ( ""and bring your dancing monkey boy brother with you"" ). It's on my recommend list as a good movie to watch a few times when you've got a bit of free time but not enough to watch a normal whole movie. 7/10"

Maybe more so for me because I actually had a friend fix me up in one of those 80's style suits (Of course it was only 1990) to go pick up women.  It didn't work but it makes for a damn funny movie. The characters are fleshed out as much as possible, Doug(Kattan) is the smart(er), weasely one, while Steve(Ferrell) is the dumb, lovable one.  The two of them have some good moments together, especially when they're fighting.  It will remind you of how you fought with your friends when you were younger.  Like when you were 8.<br/><br/>Molly Shannon shows up and miraculously, is pretty funny.  She's a horny broad from next door who tries to get Steve to ""make out"" with her all the time.  Plus the guy who was in Scary Movie, Lochlyn Munro, plays Steve and Doug's trainer at the gym.  He's always telling them how he's ""very concerned about their triceps"".  And Chazz Palminteri is a club owner who asks everyone (even if they are clear across the room) ""Did you just grab my ass?""<br/><br/>So anyfrigginwayz check this one out on cable.

In fact, I'm finding it even hard here to waste 10 lines on this drivel, but I feel compelled to warn people, lest they corrupt their minds.

Neither of the two loonies (Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell) take advantage of handling what should be comedy flavor; the movie isn't even worth a single grin! The return of the ""head bop"" is too awfully planned to stage a cultural comeback. But what more can you ask in a movie that's got plenty of hoochie-koochie gals wearing tight outfits above the knees?

","You ever get that feeling that when you're sitting in the theatre, and you're watching a movie, and it's so stupid, and you want to leave, but somehow you make it through It?, ""A Night at the Roxbury"" is the perfect example. There is no doubt this picture will do well at the box office this weekend, and that's sad because of how stupid it is.<br/><br/>It's about two wealthy idiot brothers, Steve Butabi (Will Farrell) and Doug Butabi (Chris Kattan) who frequent various nightclubs in L.A. Their dream is to party at a legendary nightclub called ""The Roxbury."" The problem is they are too stupid to get in the front door. By day, they work at their dad's fake plant store and by night, and fail miserably at picking up women on the sunset strip. After a fender-bender with Richard Grieco, he gets them into the Roxbury where they meet the owner, Benny Zadir (Chazz Palminteri) and attempt to set up a business deal with him to open up a nightclub of their own If they don't screw it up first.<br/><br/>""Saturday Night Live"" is where skits about the Butabi brothers were born, and It proceeds to make us wonder why the hell we are watching something so stupid and how the actors or the director of this picture, John Fortenberry thought any of it was funny. What's worst is Amy Heckerling is the producer of this as she is responsible for ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" These dummies twiddle their noses like they just sniffed cocaine and proceed to hump every woman in their view. Well, I am surprised a woman doesn't mace them in the movie for sexual assault.<br/><br/>Glittery lights and a cruising BMW open this picture to the tune of ""Haddaway - What is Love?"" with the brothers bopping their heads in unison to the song. After getting kicked out of clubs for being unpleasant and dumb, they waste the night away by driving down the road and trying to act cool with each other. Instead, they end up crashing their car for being stupid. A female cop shows up and begins writing the ticket. Steve attempts to flirt with her at the moronic advice of Doug. The policewoman is the smarter character of the scene for walking away after issuing a ticket which these idiots interpret as an actual date as opposed to the court date for being dumb.<br/><br/>They wake up the next morning and decide to walk around their local beach talking about their dreams of owning their nightclub. Unfortunately, they have their asses hanging out in wedged up thongs and proceed to air hump every woman that comes within range of them. After this, they go to work and almost screw that up with their father, Kazemi (Dan Hedaya). Soon after, they get into the Roxbury, and It doesn't get much better than that. It took the brothers seven years to graduate high school, and they still live at home with their parents and share the same bedroom together. Steve seems to be the one who is the dumbest, but instead, he is clueless. Doug tries to be the brother in charge but flunks every time he opens his mouth and makes himself look dumber than Steve.<br/><br/>After the dreadful ""Superstar,"" which starred Will Farrell as well, Molly Shannon returns as a wealthy annoying daddy's girl who is smitten with Steve. One can imagine why and it's not for his heart. The third act of the picture is a right-off with the brothers getting into a predictable fight and Doug moving into the guest house. From here we move on to engagement and a wedding and so on and so forth. Finally, the picture drags to a likely conclusion that leaves us exhausted. I don't think this movie set out to be as pathetic as it is but it never had a shot anyway at being kind or funny."
"StevePulaski","2","1","5","18 February 2014"," The excitement, once again, alludes me
","We can thank producer Lorne Michaels for giving us such wonderful comedies like both the Wayne's World films, but we can also blame him for giving other Saturday Night Live characters their due in feature-length films when some of them barely had the charisma to carry two minute long sketches. From The Ladies Man to Superstar to MacGruber to now A Night at the Roxbury, Michaels has sought out each Saturday Night Live character and exhausted every opportunity that could be done with the character.<br/><br/>Whether or not that's a good thing or a bad thing is your opinion, but in my own humble one, each one of these SNL films has been a mediocre, less-than-average affair, with A Night at the Roxbury easily cementing itself as the worst film from the long-running sketch comedy series thus far. This is one of the most grueling comedies I've seen in quite a while; one that seemingly struggles to concoct a coherent plot and instead resorts to cheap skits that cobble themselves together and frequently punctuate themselves with the agonizing tune ""What is Love"" by Haddaway.<br/><br/>This combined with the abysmal ratings makes it hard to believe that Will Ferrell became a sizable star after allowing this film to be his debut leading role. However, not long after the release of this film did Ferrell find ways to make his absurdist-style of humor known and demanded throughout the world. But when it comes to A Night at the Roxbury, both Ferrell and Chris Kattan find ways to be grating and dimwitted to the point where comedy doesn't even seem to register on the radar.<br/><br/>Ferrell and Kattan play the brainless Butabi brothers, Steve and Doug, two young club-freaks who have a love for hard-partying. The only issue is that both of the morons never seem to get access to their desired club, the L.A.-based Roxbury due to the club's love for high-profile celebrities over the common people. By day, Steve and Doug mindlessly slave away, running their family-owned fake plant store, anxiously anticipating all the night has to offer.<br/><br/>The plot kicks in when the van Steve and Doug are driving to The Roxbury is rear-ended by 21 Jump Street's Richard Grieco, who agrees to allow them access to the elusive nightclub in hopes the two don't press charges for the fender-bender. Finally, Steve and Doug no longer have to live in the shadows of their favorite club and can be one with the party. A subplot also involves the woman who works next door to the plant-store named Emily (Molly Shannon) at a lamp store, cutely named ""Bright Idea."" The brothers' father blatantly hopes that Steve will wise up one day and marry Emily so that the wall between the two stores can be demolished, effectively creating the first ever plant/lamp store.<br/><br/>So A Night at the Roxbury goes on, doing what I thought was impossible in the regard that it makes seventy-seven minutes feel like an unreasonable, laborious amount of time for a film. With the notable exceptions of The Blues Brothers and the two Wayne's World films, each SNL-adaptation has run into this issue, only proving that these particular characters, setups, and instances were never originally intended to sustain feature-length but rather two to three minutes on an hour-long sketch show. And even at their original intention and length, I don't find these particular characters funny. The opening credits show them forcefully gyrating against women and frantically dancing in a crowded nightclub, illustrating pretty much what the sketch comedy skits were like and even those weren't that funny.<br/><br/>Just last week in my high school journalism class, learning about satire and parody, we watched numerous faux-commercials from SNL taken from as far back as the 1970's to the present. I, shockingly, found none of them funny and surprisingly desperate attempts at generating humor from what seemed like a child creating names to coincide with stupid products. I state that this because maybe it's not just that the excitement and interest of this concept involving two brothers who frequent nightclubs and embrace the party entirely alludes me but the excitement and interest of SNL alludes me. I couldn't tell you.<br/><br/>Starring: Will Ferrell, Chris Kattan, Molly Shannon, Michael Clarke Duncan, Richard Grieco, and Loni Anderson. Directed by: John Fortenberry."

One problem though, I have seen this a million times.  It is bad enough that the Butabi brother's skit is on almost every other SNL these days, but it is a knock-off of the Wild and Crazy Guys characters Steve Martin and Dan Akroyd used to do.  If that isn't bad enough, there is no real story to frame the hit and miss jokes around.  The guys who play the Butabi brothers are okay but for me this played like a boring Wayne's World knockoff.  Now I can't wait a year for Superstar to show up on cable because I'm sure it's much better (not!).  Hey Lorne (Michaels) can't wait for that Goatboy and the preppy cheerleaders movie."

","A ridiculous movie about two utter morons, A Night at the Roxbury had a few amusing moments. However, The main characters' repulsive behavior ruined any humor there was to be found. The only time I'd recommend this movie is if you are with a bunch of friends, and you are really in the mood to laugh while you are making fun of a movie for its stupidity."
"Scruffy88","3","1","5","23 November 1998"," what were they thinking?
","I thought that the movie looked great from the commercials.  All the funny parts from the trailers were dished out in the first ten minutes and somehow presented in a way that I didn't even crack a smile, and I laugh at everything.  Cheesy rip-offs all throughout the movie that should be funny but just aren't like an obvious one from jerry maguire at the end.  What I don't understand is when the film makers saw their finished product they didn't just release it straight to video or debut it on SNL because it has drastically reduced my impression of Heckerling and SNL.  One exception is a dance sequence in the middle which is, well, hilarious.  That almost made up for the rest of the film but didn't make the cut.  The only thing I am waiting for called A night at the Roxbury is the soundtrack.  Lots of groovin tunes including What is Love."

So how come almost all these films based on Sat Night Live sketches almost always suck?  Let's see...let's take a five minute Sat Nite Live sketch and stretch it out to a two hour movie!

","A Night At The Roxbury is very unfunny, as It took me a while to get through it, as I was only amused a couple of times, and it gets quite silly when the brothers get into a huge fight and way too sappy, plus while Chris Kattan, and Will Ferrell make a good team are way too annoying, as I just felt like slapping them, plus what was a quality character actor like Dan Hedaya doing in this he was OK but I often wondered why.The soundtrack is great no doubt about that, and it has a decent cast, but the problem is gets too tiresome way too quickly and never once did I laugh out loud, plus The ending was pretty stupid in my opinion. Most of the Saturday Night live movies are pretty lame in my opinion, as they get too tiresome too quickly, and I just don't find 2 morons bopping there heads throughout amusing, plus Thankfully Will Ferrell has moved onto bigger and better things. Overall this is an Unfunny tiresome film that I say you pass on unless you have something better to do. *1/2 out of 5. <br/><br/>The Acting is OK<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is OK here but not as funny as usual, he also tends to over do it at times, and I just found his character more irritating then anything else, not one of his better performances. Chris Kattan is even more annoying he is so unlikable and selfish, I just didn't find anything funny about him. Richard Grieco plays well himself. Loni Anderson and Dan Hedaya are amusing but not much else as the parents. Lochlyn Munro is unfunny in his role I didn't laugh once. Molly Shannon is somewhat amusing, but never laugh out loud funny as Emily who is obsessed with Ferrell. The rest do OK as cameos and short roles"
"The_Orenda","3","1","6","20 June 2005"," The soundtrack is what you want.
","Following such spin-offs such as Stuart Saves His Family and It's Pat, it would be understandable enough if the next Saturday Night Live feature would have been responsible for the largest mass suicide in modern history. Thankfully, Roxbury is a feature that comes off at only below-standard. Which is a good thing, really. Will Ferrell would move on to better things, and the soundtrack is impressive enough for a good 90s flashback.<br/><br/>Brothers Steve and Doug contend with family and their own problems while trying to get into the Roxbury, all the while dreaming of starting their own outdoor nightclub.<br/><br/>There's one thing you can do, really, to say you've enjoyed the movie. Fast forward to the club dance scene where they all start dancing. It's the best part in Roxbury, with the choreography and the club beat. Otherwise, the rest of the film is pure torture as the brothers fight with their father, and themselves, to realize something that wouldn't even happen in the movies if it wasn't a Saturday Night Live skit. I suggest the soundtrack, and only that to save you your time."

","Expecting this movie to be a good comedy, I left the theatre with disappointment. A funny movie, if you already haven't seen the trailers on TV. The funniest parts of the movie are on the trailer, leaving the movie with little else to laugh at. I was very dispappointed with this movie....which actually was quite boring and just plain annoying at some times. You'd have to pay ME to go see this movie again.

"DaRick89","3","1","7","20 February 2006"," A Night at the Roxburg didn't need to be made and has absolutely no point
","There isn't too much to say about A Night At The Roxbury. The plot basically revolves around these two idiotic brothers, Doug and Steve, who, after visiting a popular nightclub called The Roxbury, want to set up their own disco or something.<br/><br/>Not much of a plot is it? I certainly don't think so. Doug and Steve are a couple of wannabes who are difficult to sympathise with as they are both idiots. The dialogue is also pretty bad and the film itself has absolutely no point. It simply didn't need to be made and I had difficulty watching it in full. The acting is so-so at best, despite the variable talent of the two leads, Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan. If you want to see the best of Will Ferrell, I suggest watching Elf, not this.<br/><br/>Admittedly this does raise a few laughs, although they are too thinly stretched throughout the movie and a lot of these laughs are directed at the movie, not with the movie. Watching these two idiots jerk their heads consistently may also raise a chuckle, because it's so stupid.<br/><br/>Ultimately, A Night at the Roxbury didn't need to be made and has absolutely no point. I certainly don't recommend it. <br/><br/>1.5/5 stars"
"CitizenCaine","4","1","7","9 July 2005"," What Is Love? (Reviewer Bobs Head Ceaselessly)
","Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan take their SNL Butabi brothers act to the big screen. It's amazing to me that I haven't seen anyone mention that they are merely an updated version of Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd's ""two wild and crazy guys"" from the 70's. The Butabi brothers are just as clueless, crass, and narcissistic as Martin and Aykroyd were. Here the Butabi's main goal in life is to score with the hotties at the trendiest night club while living with their parents in rooms that look like they were decorated by kids. They're able to accomplish getting into a club by having an accident with Richard Grieco of all people. The brothers' ultimate goal is to own their own club, so they'll both have top dibs on all the hotties. Yesh! Would any girl really want to go out with the Butabi brothers? Would any guy want to really go out with any girl that went out with one of the Butabi brothers? I doubt it. However, there are a lot of Hollywood in-jokes in here to offset some lack of plot or lack of integrity in the characters. There are several funny gags and lines in the movie, but it all doesn't add up to much. What the movie is really successful at is demonstrating just how redundant, retarded, and superficial the dance club scene really is. Molly Shannon is the poor innocent girl pining away for one of the Butabi brothers. Dan Hedaya is good as their father. Dwayne Hickman even shows up in a small role too. The funniest thing in this movie is the head-bobbing of the Butabi brothers. A guilty pleasure to be sure for some folks. *1/2 of 4 stars."
"jayhonk","2","1","7","10 May 2002"," Sorry. Not funny.
","The ratings don't lie.  This movie is not funny.  4.8 is a gift; I gave it a 1. It is one of the worst I have ever seen.  Any movie where the leading characters are really, really stupid starts off with one foot in the grave. Bad gags and lousy writing will push where it belongs, 6 feet under.  The music is decent and the memories, well you are supplying them, cause this isn't evoking them.  This is the punch line here: any movie with really dumb characters has to make you like them, or it has to make you bust out laughing, otherwise you will quickly despise the characters. These two brothers here are not likable, where is the sympathy in two clueless oafs? How can we play along if the jokes are bad?<br/><br/>Dumb and Dumber I almost liked--same scenario: 2 really dumb guys.  But the jokes were funny and the guys almost sympathetic. I hated Something About Mary for this same reason as this movie: no one to like; many to despise. If you liked that movie (for some reason) then take that into consideration. But I recommend you keep the 99 cents in your pocket and rent Princess Bride or something."
"Glesener","2","1","7","24 August 1999"," Ripoff of ""Romy and Michele""
","Most reviews pan this movie as a painfully prolonged version of the Saturday Night Live skit but actually the whole premise (right down to synchronous head-bobbing) is an uninspired rip off of the Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow characters from ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion."""
"refinedsugar","5","1","7","27 February 2001"," Cheese with a side order of cheese.
","I think Will Ferrell is one talented comic. I watch Saturday Night Live regularly and on a bad night, he's sometimes the only saving grace. Yet outside late night TV, I haven't seen him in anything worthy yet. I doubt it's a question if he's talented, I think more likely it's the material. He captured a couple of laughs from me in the Austin Powers flick, but that was a case in sound effects more than anything.<br/><br/>So here we are with the latest skit turned feature length movie. I'm not the first and definitely not the last, but I'm gonna say it anyway. You can't take a five minute skit and turn it into a 90+ minute movie. Well in this case a 80-something minute movie. Perhaps the first sign of impending doom. Couldn't find the material for another ten minutes?<br/><br/>If you've seen SNL lately then you know about the club hitting dudes who groove to Haddaway's ""What Is Love"". This movie adds that they're brothers and somehow that's not the surprise it should have been. The hassle known as plot has the duo trying to get into to the high profile club, the Roxbury, owned by Chazz Palminteri in a brief, but hilarious unbilled role. What follows from there is just filler. They throw in love interest sub-plots, but it's of little importance. I can't recommend ""A Night at the Roxbury"". I'm afraid only SNL fans or those with a extreme love for cheesy bad movies will find something to cheer for here."

","One must expect that the Saturday Night Live spin-off films are going to be a bit ridiculous.  However, this one was incredibly awful with an anorexic plot, adolescent humor, and a script that makes one question whether or not improvisation would have been better.  I loved Will Ferrel and Chris Katan when they played these two loser club-hoppers on the show, so I thought the movie might be funny, too.  Not only is it humorless, it uses gratuitous, embarrassing sexual innuendo which makes one question how it got a PG-13 rating--but then again, who over the age of 13 could stand to sit through the whole thing?  The best part about this movie is that it was less than an hour-and-a-half long.  This film may just be enough to destroy any future hopes for its ""stars"" which is a real shame."

","Movies made after shows or sketches are usually clever, witty, and full of enough original material to keep an audience entertained; even when the audience has never seen the show (ie - South Park, Family Guy, Simpsons...etc). However, SNL movies haven't been original or clever since the days of Dan Akroyd and Bill Murray. If making this movie was in the wake of SNL's hype popularity amongst the garden variety ignorant average joe, it's no surprise that the movie itself turned out to be a joke with no punchline.<br/><br/>There isn't any new material here different from the SNL sketches, and whats even more depressing is that the jokes just aren't funny. There's nothing amusing about this movie in general, other than seeing which big-time celebrities degrade themselves by making ridiculous cameos. Overall, this movie is a mockery of the entertainment industry. Saturday Night Live just isn't funny, and is a shining example of why people who enjoy this type of mockery have no taste what-so-ever."

","A Night at the Roxbury (1998): Dir: John Fortenberry / Cast: Chris Kattan, Will Ferrell, Dan Hedaya, Loni Anderson, Molly Shannon: Although not a promising effort, the title demonstrates the desire of two males who wish to be more and see the Roxbury nightclub as a place of purpose. Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell play brothers who stand in line every night at the Roxbury only to be rejected. Dan Hedaya has a pushover role as father who employs them in his fake plants store. He informs Kattan that he is a loser and he brain washes Ferrell who cannot make decision for himself to marry a high class snob. Every buddy cliché is in tact with a predictable outcome. Director John Fortenberry makes fine use of flashy locations. Kattan often overplays a role that isn't interesting to begin with and certainly never draws sympathy. Ferrell on the other hand contains a few laughs as Kattan's brainless brother pushed in a direction he wishes not to go. Hedaya is typecast is typecast as their ruthless father. Also featuring Loni Anderson who obviously had an empty schedule the week she was offered this tripe. Molly Shannon can be very funny but nothing in this can render her remotely effective in terms of humour. Instead of an interesting comedy about growing up it is a mindless geek show that applauds idiocy. With that said viewers may see the Roxbury as the place to avoid. Score: 3 ½ / 10"

It's the first comedy I've attended where you feel that to laugh would be cruel to the characters."" That may be a big harsh, but it is not at all wrong. As many have commented, when you take a skit that is funny for a minute or two and try to flesh it out, it rarely works. (Besides ""Wayne's World"", few SNL skits really have a life of their own.) Apparently the film has a cult following. I am not sure why. I cannot say I regret watching it, but I also cannot say I feel the need to ever see it again."

I love Comedies of all types, even stupid Comedies like Old- School, Airheads and Hot Rod, but this is not the good kind of stupid. The two characters are such idiots, they deserve all the hate they got from their peers in this movie. Not to mention, they are the biggest creeps I have seen in a movie in a long time, flirting around with every woman they see, and they don't even freaking care. They just have no shame. I do sympathize with Will Ferrell's character a bit because he isn't as dumb as Chris Kattan's is, but they are still complete idiots that show no respect. I would have laughed a lot more at this movie if it hadn't been for those two characters. That killed it for me.

It just doesn't suit her as an actress to play a girly girl in my opinion.<br/><br/>With Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan, the only times they were hilarious enough was when they were dancing like goof-balls and trying to impress the ladies with their moves. However, I think their jokes weren't so funny really, it was like trying to think the joke then laughing at the joke straight away.

One of their greatest skills is bopping their heads, in unison, to Haddaway's ""What Is Love?"" They love the nightlife and wanna boogie, but can't even gain admittance to the popular ""Roxbury"" nightclub.

Curiously, many go on to become feature-length films. Kattan and Ferrell (as the Butabi Brothers) follow this progression. On television, they were sometimes joined by Jim Carrey; here, he does not appear. We do get to see old favorites Loni Anderson (""WKRP"") and Dwayne Hickman (""Dobie Gillis ""), although the word ""old"" will likely never accurately describe Ms. Anderson. She would have no trouble being admitted to the Roxbury and finding a dance partner. The cast and crew do a nice job and the script seems logical, but the motion picture never seems to stretch.

What really made me laugh my head off is when they are bobbing there heads to the song ""What Is Love"". The scene in the roxbury was just amazing.

","I think I saw just a little bit of this silly comedy in June 2001, on a coach bus on the way to Québec City for a week-long school trip, near the end of my last year before high school. I didn't pay much attention to most of the movies shown on that trip (which is why I could only remember a little bit of this one), and didn't know this one was called ""A Night at the Roxbury"" at the time. A few years later (2005 or 2006), I saw some of it on TV (knowing about one of its two stars, Will Ferrell, by this time), and recognized the part where the two main characters are thrown out of a building. It took many years for me to get around to actually sitting down and watching the entire film, but it has finally happened. However, aware of its rating here, it wasn't surprising when I found the film a bit bland.<br/><br/>Steve and Doug Butabi are two dimwitted brothers who often go to nightclubs and attempt to score with women, but never succeed. During the day, they work at their father's fake plant store. The brothers dream of getting into the Roxbury, the best club in town, but since they're not on the guest list, they are always denied entrance. They also dream of opening their own nightclub. One night, when they go out in the fake plant store's delivery van for another attempt to get into the Roxbury, the vehicle is hit from behind. The one who hit it turns out to be the famous Richard Grieco. Knowing he can get the two into the club with his celebrity status, he does just that in order to avoid a lawsuit. Inside, the Butabi brothers meet the club's owner, Mr. Zadir. They also meet two young women, Vivica and Cambi, and actually score this time! It appears things are starting to work out for the brothers, until they are denied permission to enter Mr. Zadir's office for their meeting, then it all goes wrong! <br/><br/>Even though I didn't laugh very hard for most of the film, quite a few parts made me at least snicker. I can't think of too many great highlights, but there are some notable gags, such as scenes involving the main characters pathetically trying to score with any attractive young woman they see (whether they're in a club, on the street, or on the beach), Steve (played by Ferrell) flirting with a female police officer, Steve getting emotional while describing silk flowers to a customer at the fake plant store (this may be the funniest part), and eventually some of the conflict between the brothers (most notably the part where they're on the road). Some of the gags are kind of lame, though none of them are memorably disgusting, unlike gags I've seen in a number of other crude modern comedies. For much of the time, I was fairly bored, and I get the feeling even my 6/10 rating just might be a TAD too generous, but probably not.<br/><br/>Like ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""Dude, Where's My Car?"", ""A Night at the Roxbury"" is a raunchy comedy about two stupid guys on an adventure that involves a lot of sexuality. It was made in between those two films, and I would say it also comes somewhere in between them in quality. I think ""Dumb & Dumber"" is definitely a funny movie. It's one of those comedies which show that films can be silly and immature but funny at the same time. I've never cared much for ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" This 1998 comedy is basically a mixed bag. Comedies like this are really funny to some viewers and strongly hated by others, but with this particular film, I come in between those two crowds.

","When I first saw the SNL skit with Jim Carrey, it blew my mind. I loved it from the start. Two years later, I saw the movie...<br/><br/>Having been slightly disappointed by the absence of Jim Carrey (who, according to Benny Zadir, was at the Roxbury, but remained off screen), I kept on watching. And here's what I think: the story is sure a bit clichéd, with the happy ending and all, but it's still refreshing when we have two immature idiots as protagonists. Kattan and Ferrel's acting was great, and the supporting cast couldn't have been better. But there's one thing that makes me wanna watch the movie over and over again: the soundtrack! I grew up in the nineties with a brother who loved that music and made me love it as well, and many of the tunes brought me back in my childhood. This is actually the most nostalgic nineties movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Overall, what to say... this movie is a great no-brainer with great actors and an excellent soundtrack. What else to ask when you're too tired of following a long action movie, or just want to have pure fun? That's right, nothing."

","One of my favourite movies. The soundtracks are brilliant from the early 90's. You can be with them in the clubs especially when you hear the music. Fantastic. All respect for the music one more time!!I watch this movie not just for the story even for the soundtracks. The story is funny. They are like dumb & dumber just in expensive suit and with the father's BMW. The two real losers who want to change their life. Their main goal is to get in the famous, biggest club in the town called Roxbury. They tried to get in there many times but they always failed. The other funny thing in the movie is their speech. How they repeat the same story to the girls and how act when telling it. They got different cool/funny sayings when they just approach the girls or try to enter in the club. Most of the time they act like children. A must see movie who likes this kind of comedy and the club music. Have fun, i can just recommend this masterpiece."

It's entertaining. That's a step above mildly entertaining. The Saturaday Night Live skit was always funny and guest hosts made the skit even better. Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan playing it dumb makes it hard to get through some spots. That doesn't help the fact that the movie won't ever become a classic. But, there's enough tongue in cheek humor, in-house humor, and well written jokes to enjoy. Too bad Chris Kattan's career hasn't taken off."

The music is still fresh, almost all the gags are funny.  I had about 5 or 6 laugh out loud moments.  Most of which happened during the hilarious opening segment.<br/><br/>The Middle: This is when it starts to get a little ugly.  Doug and Steve just aren't funny unless they are together.  Steve's interaction with Emily is worth a few chuckles, but nothing more than that.  Doug just drags along when he is alone.<br/><br/>The End: This is when Doug comes out with the boom box to interrupt the wedding.  Everything from here to the end is great again.  Doug and Steve have a sappy, yet funny conversation and the final club scene is also fun to watch.<br/><br/>Overall: 5/10"

"Innsaane","5","0","5","4 October 1998"," A Long Night
","Hearing of the abysmal reviews this movie has earned, as well as seeing the name Amy Heckerling (Clueless) during the opening credits, I feared for the worst.  However, A Night at the Roxbury proves that no one is perfect, and all film-makers can bounce back.<br/><br/>Doug (Chris Kattan) and Steve (Will Ferrell) Butabi are two very atypical young adults.  They work at their father's silk flowers store, ringing up customers and making deliveries.  They still live at home, and have no goal in life except to go clubbing and score!  Although, they own expensive suits and drive (dad's) expensive cars, they just can't seem to get with it.  One night after being tossed out of the famous club, the Roxbury, the brothers get the idea of one day starting their own club. Therefore, the rebellious brothers leave the reins of their father (Dan Hedaya) and begin going into business for themselves.<br/><br/>This movie, which was directed by John Fortenberry, had many weaknesses to begin with.  First off, since the movie was produced by Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels, Roxbury had a very small budget.  It also was very unable to achieve the big names that a movie like this could have used.  Only washed up actors like Loni Anderson and Richard Grieco made the big names list, with fellow SNL cast members Molly Shannon and Colin Quinn getting large billings as well.  Second, the movie starred two characters that previous to this movie didn't have names, identities, or lines longer then `Wanna dance?'<br/><br/>I found myself laughing on many occasions.  Though I was never rolling around on the floor busting a gut, I wasn't bored silly.  The storyline is weak, and the acting is fairly sub-par.  However, the set design and the soundtrack, which features the Butabi brothers' signature tune What is Love, are a very notable highlight to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I guess I would have to say that although this was not nearly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, was not bad either.  I say, if it's raining next weekend, and you don't have anything else to do, check out A Night at the Roxbury. **"

We saw the movie so we could have a good laugh, and we weren't let down.  We loved it!  Then I hear that one of those friends was channel surfing that weekend when she came across the Sickal and Egbert (or whoever they are). They gave it 2 thumbs down. I've come to one conclusion with this: critics to not know how to have fun. This is why you never see those really funny movies everyone says is the funniest movie they've seen and all the critics have to say that the writing was bad and they think it was a bad movie. ""A Night at the Roxbury"" was good and was very funny.  If you apreciate comedy it was fun and very silly, indeed, but isn't that what comedies are supposted to be?

What the hell were the producers of this garbage thinking when they made it, it's not funny. The movie contained no laughs, I felt bad to laugh at these losers and in the mean time I felt like kicking the director in a private area for making this movie- it's not art. Comedy can be an art but this isn't comedy- it's nothing. This movie isn't even so bad it's funny (campy movies like the John Waters retrospect- for he is the true master of comedy). Chris Katan is wasted, he has some talent but it never comes out in this dull script that tries way too hard and never achieves. Whats worse are that movies of this genre allway included the same eliments: dudes vs. big busness, love side plots, the guys being ""nice guys"" and many other clashes.
