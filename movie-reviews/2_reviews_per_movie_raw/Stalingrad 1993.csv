","I can believe this movie will be a serious disappointment for a person, who is used to and likes to watch Hollywood war movies. Four reasons: 1. It's made in a world, where movie makers tries to have some personality. If you think 'When We Were Soldiers'... well, there are hundreds of directors who you can imagine making a similar war movie with personality and values of a hamburger.<br/><br/>2. Screenplay has a different structure. There's no shocking opening scene like in 'Saving Private Ryan'. This movie starts slowly in a very nice place and ends slowly in a very bad place, without hope or feeling that the characters have achieved something by their heroic actions.<br/><br/>3. It is first a movie about lost causes in the world of war, and only secondly a war movie which takes place in Stalingrad.<br/><br/>4. War scenes portray the horror, insecurity and confusion of a battle, instead of how cool, heroic and exciting fighting looks like. In this sense, this movie is closer to reality than most of the war movies you will ever see. 'Thin Red Line' also had similar ""I would probably crap in my pants in that situation""-feeling.<br/><br/>Stalingrad, whether you think it as a movie or a war movie has so many good things in it... like honesty. Even the ordinary German soldiers were dreaming about farms in Russia when they were advancing. What a disappointment they must have had in Stalingrad! If you like to watch war movies, meaning also other war movies than When We Were Soldiers or Saving Private Ryan, you should see this one. (9/10)"

","This film affected me on many emotional levels. I saw the results of the war in East and West Berlin in 1957. While in Berlin I lived with a girl my age who lost her father in the battle for Stalingrad. Her tales made my hair stand on end as he was one of the many young Germans send there to fight as a punishment for errors,(read that as failure to win), in other battle zones.<br/><br/>It isn't well understood, but the Eastern Front was used as a threat and as a punishment by Hitler. Even Schindler in the film Schindler's List used that threat on the train station in order to get his bookkeeper released from the death train.<br/><br/>There are two scenes that will haunt be for the rest of my life:<br/><br/>The scene where Lt. Hans von Witzland, played by a very young and splendid Thomas Kretschmann, and the Russian actress Dana Vavrova who plays Irina.<br/><br/>That scene is so emotionally charged that it left both actors physically shaking. I can't imagine having to repeat that scene more than once. To have to hold that raw, totally exposed feeling/expression and body language while lights are adjusted and a different angle is used must have been physically and mentally exhausting for these two brilliant actors. They perform a brutal Dance Macabre that is both horrific and fascinating. <br/><br/>This scene is no longer about an enemy and the one who has been conquered. It is about a young man desperate to find one moment of humanity on an endless nightmare and a young woman who hates him and herself and yet can not resolve her situation. That he is a German and she is Russian is not as important as that they are both souls in torment with no way out.<br/><br/>The human agony of that scene is superior to anything I have seen in over 60 years of watching movies.<br/><br/>The other is the final scene between Dominique Horwitz and Kretschmann as Fritz and Hans clinging to each other overwhelmed and miniaturized by the vast Russian winter.<br/><br/>That final scene reminds me of Napoleon's death march from Moscow in 1812. The results were to same. No enemy can come marching into Russia and live to march out again.<br/><br/>I began watching this film firmly committed to cheering the Russians and hating the Germans.<br/><br/>By the end I was crying for them all.<br/><br/>That is the message of this fine film. War is a waste...a waste of human lives, of property, and of moral and religious focus.<br/><br/>This is a classic anti-war film not unlike All Quiet on the Western Front or What Price Glory."
"prunders","8","36","38","4 February 2007"," Stalingrad
","This is a film that I keep coming back to, for a variety of reasons. As a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, it is a powerful one. There are a number of very powerful scenes in the film which help to capture the horror of war, such as the tank battle for instance. Furthermore, from what I can see the experiences documented in the film are by and large 'true' - if you read A. Beevor's book 'Stalingrad' you will know what I mean. The film is also successful in the sense that it doesn't allow character or plot to dominate it - it is simply a tale of survival, that attempts to depict the battle mainly from the ordinary (German) soldier's point of view. I've read somewhere that the original screenplay had to be toned down, which doesn't surprise me at all - if they tried to really show what the battle was like, it would have been almost impossible to make I'm sure. Even so, there are still some moments that are difficult to watch - this was made before Private Ryan but is possibly even harder-hitting in places. Just one word of caution - don't buy the dubbed 'English' version, it's pretty awful and spoils the film - try to get a copy in the original (German) version with English subtitles, it's far more powerful. You may need to buy a Region 1 DVD of the film in this case, as I did."
"ItemCo16527","10","163","188","27 March 2003"," Brutal, heartbreaking, & realistic portrayal of the bloodiest battle ever fought.
","I first saw Stalingrad about 7 years ago and to this day it still hits me as hard as the first time I watched it. It is the story of Leutnant von Witzland, Unteroffizier Rohleder, Obergefreiter Reiser, and Oberschütze Müller and their desperate fight for survival in the deadliest battle in the history of war: STALINGRAD. The film starts off in Italy in the summer of 1942 where their platoon is resting following heavy combat in North Africa. Soon they are on a train heading for the Eastern Front. The men of 1st Platoon laugh and joke, play games, write letters home, and enjoy the view of western Russia as they head for the Ukraine. This is as light-hearted as the film gets. What follows is a very accurate and graphic portrayal of the infamous battle. It pulls no punches. It's main antagonist is Hauptmann Haller, a field police officer who thinks nothing of allowing his men to abuse and murder Russian and Ukrainian prisoners. At one point he lines up a group of civilians and has them shot saying they were partisans.<br/><br/>The combat scenes themselves are even more horrific. In one scene a German soldier hits a Russian over the head with a shovel as the Russian is trying to kill Ltn. von Witzland. In another scene a German soldier is cut in half by a Russian tank shell. There are many other gruesome scenes in the film, but they are necessary. The world has to see what happened in the Battle of Stalingrad. To see its brutality. To have its heart broken at the horrendous waste of the soldiers' lives. Over 2 million people lost there lives. Only 6000 of Field Marshal Paulus' 250,000-man 6th Army survived the battle. As with the battle, the film itself does not have a happy ending. And that's the way it should be. And as you watch this film, remember one thing, not every German soldier who fought in the war was a criminal. They were mostly decent people caught up in events well beyond their control."

","'The Finest Ambition of the Solider is to prevent war from ever  happening, but it has always been out of their hands. It is in the  hands of men whom they do not even know.'  Saving Private Ryan, Das Boots, Thin Red Line, When We Were soldiers.  then there is Stalingrad! A perfect masterpiece. The acting and filming  in this movie is top notch! I also think the music in this movie is  great and fits the movie perfectly. Stalingrad holds no punches back in  depicting the siege of Stalingrad by the German Army and ultimately  their defeat in the cold bitter Russian winter! As far as a 'war' movie  goes, I would give honors to Stalingrad over Saving Private Ryan and  even Liberal Hollywood's take on the siege of Stalingrad (from the  Soviet point of view): Enemy At The Gates. Saving Private Ryan, though  a great film, just doesn't bring the horror of war down to the common  foot solider as accurately as Stalingrad. Enemy At The Gates is simply  an awful movie.  Of course with such a movie will come a lot of political overtones.  I'll make just a few comments here. One, I am very thankful the allies  won World War II. Secondly, when I think of 'Nazis', I think of Hitler  and all of his cronies and all the evil villains who executed the  millions of innocent Jews in the concentration camps. I believe a  majority of Americans believe this way. The German soldiers fighting on  the front(s) were simply following orders and bravely fought in this  War as did the American, Russians and British soldiers and to each was  their own personal Hell. The sad fact about Stalingrad, in watching  this movie, is that all of this really happened. Men froze and starve  to death millions of people were killed and generations were lost.  Basically, this is a good War movie that ends with no heroism and  accurately portrays the horror of war for the common man regardless of  witch uniform they are wearing.  'Freedom is just a word until you lose it.'"
"Mitch-38","8","72","85","30 January 2001"," Hell Frozen Over
","Absorbing, horrendous descent into the nightmare of combat. Focusing on the invading German army (into the Soviet Union) in the second world war, the impact no less awful. These men are enlisted men, who had no more control over their government's criminal actions, than US troops had over their government during the Vietnam War. Or any government sending their military in any war, for that matter. To assume they could belies a certain lack of acquaintance or experience, with the structure of a military organization.<br/><br/>These men are trapped like rats, and survival at any cost, to preserve ones life is paramount. Politics and lofty notions fly out the window, as the veneer of civilized behavior is stripped off.<br/><br/>STALINGRAD is gripping, grotesque, poignant and pitiful in its graphic presentation of war time experience. Highly recommended."
"ChuckStraub","9","55","65","14 December 2004"," Very graphic and brutally honest. A must see.
","Stalingrad should be ranked right up there among the top World War II movies ever made. I can't say it's the best but it certainly is a great film and is under rated in its importance. What the movie is about is simple. It shows the German soldiers war on the Russian front, in Stalingrad from the point of view of a few German soldiers. It should not be viewed with the intentions of seeing the battle of Stalingrad or any strategic view of the Russian Front. This is from the eyes of a select few. You won't see the broad picture. Just like the average soldier doesn't see it. He knows and sees the part of the war that is directly around him. That is his world and that is how you will see it. It's often very graphic and brutally honest in its depictions. The cold and the feeling of hopelessness were excellently portrayed. You could just feel it. I did have one major problem with the German English barrier. I watched this on DVD. It was dubbed in English and I chose to also play it with English subtitles. I started to see that frequently the subtitles and the dubbing were different. That was annoying hearing one thing and reading different words for the same lines. I soon shut off the subtitles and started watching it over again from the beginning without the subtitles. I have no idea if the subtitles or the dubbing was the more accurate translation. I'm very glad I viewed this film and I'm sure that I will watch it a second time. Highly recommended. A must see for the historian and war movie fan."
"Tatiana_G","10","31","36","29 November 2008"," “If you start thinking, you’ll go mad”
","The people of my generation and those who are older know about the WW II (or as it is called in Russia – the Great Patriotic War) not only from the school textbooks, but from the witnesses and participants of the event. My granddad was a soldier at Stalingrad and when I was a small girl I used to listen to his stories of how he defeated the Germans. He also told me some anecdotes, not all he told me was gloomy. But it was long ago, and no when I have a conscious interest for what happened there in the battle of Stalingrad, I have to turn to books and movies for information. Somehow most films I saw were made in the Soviet Union, only a few in present day Russia. And “Stalingrad” is an exception. In the movie the war is described from the opposite side, and the fact in itself is interesting. All that is shown in the film is quite different from what I’m used to.<br/><br/>The film reminds me a great deal of Remarque’s “Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben”, because the war is shown through an ordinary German soldier perception. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating he is by no means a fascist. The movie heroes right from neat and enthusiastic Europe, from the Italian coast arrive in the snow-covered hungry Soviet Union. They are doomed to die; it is clear from the very beginning.<br/><br/>After the elite detachment had taken part in their first fight at Stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the phrase which reflected the whole idea for me; he said “If you start thinking, you will go mad”. And to my mind it is true for spectators as well. From the one hand, one may think, OK, I’ll just watch this movie and it won’t dissipate me, I needn’t feel sorry for the people on the screen as it were they who attacked my country and not vice versa. However sooner or later but inevitably one starts sympathizing with the characters. Probably when the lieutenant chokes back his tears at seeing Kolya’s execution.<br/><br/>“Stalingrad” is hard to watch, all these frostbitten legs, dirt, executions, snow, famine, destroyed illusions.<br/><br/>As far as I know, Lt. Hans von Witzland is one of the few films where Thomas Kretschmann played his star roles. I watched quite many Hollywood movies where he was given unimportant parts of small fries, such as “Next” or “Transsiberian” (why did he do it?!). And after I had watched “Stalingrad”, I cannot make out the European actors desire to appear in American movies, even second-rated at any cost. The fact puzzles me deeply. I believe Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those he is given in Hollywood. And out of what I saw with him, “Stalingrad” is the best, beyond the doubt.<br/><br/>In my opinion the worst “Stalingrad” drawback is the way they speak Russian in the movie. I mean of course those who are supposed to be Russian. Say, the boy who spent some time with the Germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape. Was it really so difficult to find actors able to pronounce a couple of phrases without that horrible accent? Initially I set down to watch “Stalingrad” just to listen to native German-speakers because I’m studying the language. I did not expect anything extraordinary of the film. But it impressed me, made me cry when I wasn’t going to at all. I know I’m 15 years late to watch it, but “Stalingrad” is not a run-of-the-mill movie, and after 15 years it is still watchable and shocking."
"bergma15@msu.edu","8","20","23","24 February 2006"," The filmmakers of ""Enemy at the Gates"" should have seen this.
","The film is about the battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who don't know anything about it, it was the worst battle in the Second World War. Over 1 million people died in the course of the battle. This is the only film that I've seen that seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked about it is that the two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were nowhere in the film. Unlike most American films, the Germans are not seen as blood thirsty murderers, but what the average German foot soldier was, a person.<br/><br/>The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were transferred there to try and take the city. The film follows these men from August of 1942 to early 1943. During this time, they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle.<br/><br/>Through the entire film, one feels the desperation of the entire battle. Unlike ""Enemy at the Gates"" the film makers didn't try to put some sappy love story or dress up factual occurrences of the battle. This film may be fiction, but it conveys what happened in the bloodiest battle in World War II."
"bernhard-18","10","23","27","24 August 2006"," One of the historically most accurate war films ever made
","This film is one of the historically most accurate war films ever made in that it displays the reality of soldiers in a battle situation as well as the particular circumstances of the Battle of Stalingrad, obvious when one compares this film to works such as Anthony Beevor's book ""Stalingrad"".<br/><br/>Unlike the better known ""Enemy at the Gates"" where the plot diverts into a sniper/hunting story, this film shows what war can do to individuals. Although filmed by Germans, ""Stalingrad"" is anything but a nationalistic apologetic film. It shows that war films can be something beyond flag-waving, jingoistic distortions of the grim truth of war, like so many Hollywood ""war"" products seem to be.<br/><br/>The scripting, acting, direction and other film techniques in ""Stlingrad"" are of the highest caliber.<br/><br/>It's a must-see film for anyone contemplating to join an army and to obey orders from any type of ""Fuehrer""."
"athena13005","10","19","22","29 November 2006"," To the criticisms
","For the main criticisms of the movie... The love story: that wasn't a love story. Those were two people distraught coming together trying to find humanity in ANYone. The same thing happened with soldiers and the Russian boy. It added a feminine touch, but come on look at American movies...no where close to love story. There was no storyline: does war have a storyline? I think that is a silly criticism. The storyline is this. They start with 400 men and the movie narrowed down to show the lives of about 10 men and how each did their part and died. Death is the ultimate end to any story. Just because there was no happy ending doesn't mean it has no storyline. <br/><br/>There was a horrid truth in this movie. I wouldn't necessarily call it ""anti-war"". It had a political statement of course, but the movie wasn't all about the politics. In fact, except for a few occurrences when the Captain? showed up, there was never a stifling air of Nazi Germany. They were far enough out of the reach of the main Nazi party. The fat cats weren't gonna go into Russia!<br/><br/>Maybe not completely accurate and not a Hollywood hit, but it exhibits a fine knowledge of the common soldier (I'd say exactly of almost any nationality and war)and what they must go through. It was a losing battle, of course the movie is going to be depressing. And to the person who said that it was gutsy (and silly) to even portray Germans as victims: there are victims on all sides in every war (any real soldier will tell you that).<br/><br/>This movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary. A few problems with it when arguing for just one, but it instills the best of both worlds. Watch it as such. Beware however because it is a hard movie to watch if not graphically, emotionally.<br/><br/>I'm waiting til they make a movie about Iraq. It will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial, I want to see who has the guts to do it first. (Jarhead doesn't count)"
"bbusch","Null","18","21","22 May 2003"," I knew a man who was there
","I had the honour of knowing a German soldier who fought in the streets of Stalingrad and was one of the few (about 9,000) who got out, on an aircraft. He was the father of one of my boyhood schoolmates, a quiet decent man, his face would light up in a kind of animation whenever the subject was raised, but he wouldn't talk about it to us boys.<br/><br/>He's gone now, poor old fellow. He spent the last years of his life living in a Caravan/humpy on the foot of a mountain in Southern Australia, estranged from his wife, who never forgave him after she discovered he'd fathered a child to another woman during WW2 and was secretly supporting the child financially.<br/><br/>A kinder, more honorable man would be hard to find. I think this film succeeds in depicting the decency of the people on both sides of the conflict as well as the obligatory sadism of the Officer who ordered the firing squad shootings of Russian civilians.<br/><br/>It's pity the Germans still feel no WW2 Film is complete unless traces of the 'evil Nazi' are included. On the other hand it was not lost on myself at least, that the prayer scene, in which the German Army chaplain made a long point of the fact that each Wehrmacht soldier had 'God with us' imprinted under his belt buckle. While the Godless communists enemy did not.<br/><br/>Maybe this is a sly inclusion by the filmaker showing how European peasantry has been propagandised to hate and kill the enemy for centuries.<br/><br/>Stalingrad was the largest battle ever fought in human history. The Germans lost 300,000 frontline combat troops and later, the second World War. This is the best Film ever made on the subject. It is fitting that it was done by Germans.<br/><br/>Bernhard"
"raymond-15","8","41","53","2 July 2001"," An epic drama that impresses
","There can be no real victors in war if we value human life at all.  That so many German and Russian boys should die in the snow-bound wilderness around Stalingrad is a tragedy beyond comprehension.  The camera crew did a great job in bringing to the screen the vastness of Russia with soldiers camouflaged in white struggling on the point of death across frozen landscapes.  Far from home and missing their loved ones the German soldiers are depicted as rough diamonds with kind hearts sharing their last crust of bread with starving Russian children.  The over-all German plan is to take certain cities important in the flow of oil and supply of food to the Russian enemy, but their plans are thwarted when the Russian armies encircle them.  The close fighting is well filmed with lots of explosions, flames and shattered bodies among fallen masonry.  I liked particularly the contrast of the opening scenes in sunny Porto Cervo (where the Germans are celebrating their recent victories) with the tragic scenes which followed when calamity overtakes them.I thought too that the three struggling figures exhausted in defeat symbolised the horrific loss of human life and the futility of war. While none of the actors shone above the others, their characterisations were adequate enough though I got somewhat confused with such a large cast and all the same uniforms.  The lasting impression is not with individual performances but with the over-all mood of this tragic event captured superbly under expert direction.  One soldier says to another:""This will give us the Iron Cross"" The reply:""Yes...it will look good on your coffin!"""
"Uriah43","8","8","9","17 April 2013"," The German Perspective
","A battalion of German soldiers from the Afrika Corps are spending some time at an Italian port during the summer of 1942. At that particular time their spirits were high as the German army was in the process of advancing victoriously into Russia. But all that was subject to change as their next assignment would be: Stalingrad. And they had no idea what was in store for them. At any rate, told from the German perspective, this film does a remarkable job of showing the hardships and tragedy these soldiers had to endure. Despite proving themselves in battle, their courage and discipline was being tested as much by the Russian winter as it was their Russian foes. And yet they continued on all the same. Now, while everybody knows how this battle eventually played out, this movie allows the viewer to gain a unique understanding of how it may have appeared through the eyes of the German soldier. Definitely worth a watch for those who can appreciate a film of this type."
"J. Steed","Null","45","67","3 September 1999"," 90'S VERSION OF 08/15, BUT WORTH A VIEW
","Well-meant attempt to depict the events concerning the battle of Stalingrad, though the individuals Vilsmaier concentrates on, remain - due to his direction - too far away from the viewer to have him/her really involved and the result is that the drama of the war is never really felt. Thus the film's last and symbolic shot is devoid of a deeper meaning, Thè anti-war film based on the Stalingrad event - as Vilsmaier has clearly given himself as task - is never established. An anti-war film it may be, but ""die Brücke"" by Bernhard Wicki still has far more impact. It also noteworthy that the film concentrates on the German soldiers only and hardly shows anything on the Russian side.<br/><br/>Moreover as far as the political side is concerned the film never surpasses the level of the 08/15 films by Paul May: it is simple in its division between the politically ""good"" and ""bad"" soldier, finding the latter in the higher ranks only, while the lower and lowest in rank are basically decent people;  the soldier is just another victim of the regime. Compare this, if you have ever the opportunity, to what 6 German ex-soldiers tell about their experiences at the Russian front in the documentary ""Mein Krieg"" by Harriet Eder and Thomas Kufus (q.v.). I certainly do not want to suggest that Vilsmaier excuses the war (or worse), but he does not succeed in incorporating the socio-political situation, if he had ever the intention to do so..<br/><br/>There are surely impressive scenes (short truce in the plant; attack of Russian tanks, shooting of Russian civilians e.g.) and the battle scenes ar extremely well choreographed; the cinematography is sometimes stunning. But on the minus side: the cast is never more than average and the music is heavy handed.<br/><br/>In short: despite elementary shortcomings, certainly worth a view."
"nose_smasher","10","19","26","23 May 2008"," It let you with tears in the eyes
","If we compare the movie industry with an ocean, we have the tendencies to observe only the surface. Driven by the strong Hollywood marketing force, we all saw war movies like Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. But underneath the splashy waves grow in silence, from time to time, less known pearls. When you pick one and look carefully at it, you wonder why this pearl lie almost unknown and why it's not already on the crown.<br/><br/>""Stalingrad"" is such a gem. Why, it has a bunch of multi-million dollars rated actors? No. It have thousand of extras? No. It have breathtaking, spectacular, shiny computerized visual effects?. Not at all. So, what's so special? Well, in one word, it's pure past reality recreated and transposed to celluloid fifty years later. The tragedy of the most bloody battle in the history is here. Filthy, wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion, burning villages, collapsing buildings, decayed suburbs, gunfires, explosions, tanks in flames, soldiers shot, burned alive, ground by tanks in their pits or shred to pieces - you got all. But the real horror is elsewhere. People are reduced to simple pawns, without the power to change anything. The soldiers we follow in film try to leave the combat zone and they fail. The civilians stay in prostration in the middle of nowhere, only crying for their children killed. Mercyless, the huge grinding machine of war melt together humans, equipment, villages, cities - and ask for more victims and destruction, over and over.<br/><br/>In all this collective insanity a group of German soldiers struggle to survive and to keep at least a minimum level of normality. They do their duty and fight bravely. But, as everyone know, a battle is almost lost when people start to loose confidence and faith. We see how all those people are abandoned, how they plan to desert, how they struggle to catch the very last plane to Berlin (full of wounded), how some very bad injured soldiers were treated as simulants and shot, how they were forced to execute a small group of Russian civilians, including a young boy, how they later discovered a place literally full up to the ceiling of food and drinks - destined only for some ""superior"" officers, of course. One by one, they drop dead. The end of the movie is one of the most bitter, depressing and touching ending I ever saw, all on the magnificent score of The Munich Philarmonic Orchestra. The war destroyed everything in its path.<br/><br/>This movie is a must-see for everyone. A true movie-lover should have it in his/her collection. The strong anti-war message must be a warning for all of us. Unfortunately, the mankind never learn, nor the politicians. Self-destruction is in our DNA and the human pain seem to last forever. Can we be enough reasonable to stop THE WAR?"
"jcf30","Null","54","84","13 December 2004"," More than a war flick
","Many of the criticisms levied at this film by other IMDb users take issue with conventional aspects of film-making - and I agree with them. It's true, Stalingrad does offer little that's new in terms of character, screenplay, visuals. And yes, any war buffs coming to this film in hope of some depiction of the battle's broader strategic context will be disappointed. To those people I recommend Antony Beevor's highly readable book, 'Stalingrad'.<br/><br/>Viewed from a straightforward standpoint, Stalingrad is a pretty compelling war film that is nevertheless a league below US celluloid depictions of the battlefield: when it comes to depicting the fate of the 'poor bloody infantry', the second half of Full Metal Jacket, the first quarter-hour of Saving Private Ryan, or much of Black Hawk Down is infinitely superior. And yes, its ending is something of a wimp-out. <br/><br/>Consider, however, that many people compare Stalingrad to FMJ, Ryan, or BHD at all, however unfavourably, and you see something of the revolution of Vilsmaier's flick. What he achieves is a pretty conventional squad-level war flick - ABOUT THE WEHRMACHT. A film about the German armed forces in WWII which invites sympathy. This, don't underestimate it, is important. At no stage is this a Nazi-apologist film. In fact, its over-willingness to be Nazi-condemnatory is what makes much of its dialogue and scenes weak. But no matter whether you find it tame or not, you do eject this one from the VHS or DVD tray thinking ""poor b--tards"". As the Holocaust, through the global ceremony of Holocaust Day on January 27 and through the power of global films like Spielberg's Schindler's List, becomes transported away from a specific time and place into a world parable of evil, so we are able to reappraise the role of the German soldier as victim. What attitude you take to this question is your affair - Vilsmaier's film is important for daring to raise it in the first place."

Expensive real estate which, as in so many other conflicts regardless of uniform, has its costs in blood. Stalingrad shows the gut wrenching non-glory side of the nitty-gritty of combat and brings home to those who have been there the non guffaw when you hear, and see, how one soldier loads both his weapon...and his pants. Stalingrad shows well the realities of close combat and what the cumulative experience can do and often does to the human psyche. I would concur with the other reviewers in terms of Stalingrad incorporating the best, that is to say, the reality of Das Boot and Platoon 'sans' the hype when the business at hand becomes one of your basic kill or be killed.

And this primarily from a German perspective, which unfortunately is a rarity.<br/><br/>The plot follows the actions and events of a platoon of war proved ""Sturmpioniere"", an elite Wehrmacht unit similar to Army Rangers. But unlike shown in weekly propaganda news films, the German soldiers are neither depicted as heroes nor as Nazis, but simply as fathers, abandoned husbands and football fans, which share one common will: to somehow survive and return home.<br/><br/>This movie may not be taken light hearted as there is a lot of fighting and dieing and the effects of weapons and ammunition are presented in a rather impressive and authentic way. Yet Stalingrad is not about the battle action but about feeling the madness of war and having empathy for the protagonists' small hopes of escaping the horrors of winter hell. A movies that goes deep under your skin, moving, gripping, thoughtful and making you angry. And, perhaps typically German: a happy ending can not exist.<br/><br/>Finally a big thank you to Mr. Vilsmaier for having the courage to realize this movie. And a request to EuroVideo: please bring this movie to the Blu Ray format in a worthy picture and sound quality!"
"Dwolvesbane","10","8","10","15 December 2008"," A film of Hell
","Describing Stalingrad as a war film may be a bit inaccurate. Sure it centers on the longest and bloodiest battle in world history, in the most expansive theater of the most costly war in terms of lives, money, and matériel that has ever occurred. Yes it contains action scenes depicting bitter battles and terrible destruction. The visceral storytelling and harsh images though make it something more than a war film, even more than an anti-war film. Stalingrad is instead a film about absolute and undeniable hell.<br/><br/>The film is fraught with visual descriptions of the worst kind of war, one that is intensely personal and close, where days are spent in taking one city block, only to have it re-taken in a surprise assault. The early form of modern urban warfare that the Germans came to call Rattenkrieg (Rat Warfare) is depicted in brutal and uncompromising terms. The characters war in sewer tunnels, rail yards, and from building to building in the hellish bomb-scape of ruined Stalingrad, only to be defeated by the unforgiving Russian winter.<br/><br/>The film deals with the issue of Nazism and the vilification of Germans in that period in the way that many other films from both Germany and the rest of the world do. Its characters are a group of soldiers swept along by the winds of war and simply attempting to make it out with themselves and as many of their comrades as possible alive. The characters do not fight the Soviets out of any ideological hatred between National Socialism and Soviet Communism, not for any grand dream of Grossdeutschland or racial superiority. They fight only because if they do not the enemy will kill them, and if the enemy does not then their own officers certainly will for refusing to fight. This portrayal adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped hopelessness that pervades the film.<br/><br/>A sort of ground based companion to Das Boot, Stalingrad frames the epic struggle of World War Two in a personal light and from the unexpected perspective of the ordinary German soldier as a sort of hero made tragic by circumstance and a brutal government that would pervert his sacrifice."

","Apart from the low budget, there never seems to be more than 50 Germans in one scene at any one time, plus the same 2 half tracks, this film is absolute top class. Everything is accurate. That is the point, I think, from the uniforms to to the horror and the disillusionment.Everyone is as grey as the field grey uniforms. Grey men with the life drained out of them. Forget US made Gung ho rubbish like Blackhawk down and Private Ryan. This is one of the best war films ever. Only Cross of Iron beats this for tension and story. Please could we have a proper Un-dubbed German language with English subtitles version in the UK ? Without having to pay ridiculous import charges from Europe. Most other DVD's are multilingual. Why not this one ?"
"dusan-22","10","6","7","31 August 2009"," Die Beste (The Best)
","One of the best war films I have ever seen, if not the best. It is very hard to talk about such films as it is very difficult to point at any film mistake made. The ""problem"" is as it looks too real and by that drags you in to the ruins of Stalingrad and make you suffer for both sides. This is for the reason that this film unlike the most of Hollywood films doesn't glorify the war or the heroism of the main characters. Instead of that, the film makes them heroes only for being human and by that is anti-war as much as the reason can offer. Extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive acting, most of the scenes look like isolated theater pieces. Also, German army is played by Germans which is so convincing as well. The film is produced and realized by Germans where you can see their love for details to perfection. This is the reason why ""Stalingrad"" is one of the films I can watch million times and never feel dull. I watched the film with my father who fought in WWII and the first thing he said was: ""This is like real, this is how the war against Germans looked like"". This is the place you can see how did it look to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of warfare in human history and turning point of WWII: Stalingrad."
"gradyharp","10","5","6","26 June 2010"," '...62 men left out of 400': Realities from the German Stance
","STALINGRAD , released in 1993, remains one of the most brutally honest depictions of war on film. A brief history of the facts behind this film have been well stated: 'The Battle of Stalingrad was a major battle of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in southwestern Russia. It took place between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943, and is often cited as the turning point of the war in Europe. The German offensive to take Stalingrad, the battle inside the city and the Soviet counter-offensive--which eventually trapped and destroyed the German 6th Army and other Axis forces around the city--was the first substantial German land defeat of the war. The battle involved more participants than any other on the Eastern Front, and was marked by its brutality and disregard for military and civilian casualties by both sides. It was amongst the bloodiest in the history of warfare, with the upper estimates of combined casualties coming to nearly two million.' The horror of this battle as written by Jürgen Büscher, Christoph Fromm, Johannes Heide, and director Joseph Vilsmaier manages to allow us to see the 'other side' of the German forces, those not committed to the Nazi hunger for world domination, but instead were simply men serving their required time in the army, hoping to return to their families. <br/><br/>The film opens with a prelude: German troops of the 6th Army are languishing in Italy after their successful mission in North Africa. They are soon assigned to attack a port in Russia - a place called Stalingrad - and off they go to what is perceived to be another quick victory. The unit is directed by Lt. Hans von Witzland (Thomas Kretschmann, in a role that should have won him every award possible, so fine is his performance): he is a man who appears more human than soldier and indeed when his troop arrives in Russian territory he is appalled by the treatment of Russian POWs by German officers, a response that places him in a negative light with the Nazis. But Witzland is assigned to take a Russian strong hold with the close help of his group of fellow soldiers (played with extraordinary humanity by Dominique Horwitz, Sebastian Rudolph, Oliver Broumis et al). For a moment in time they are successful heroes but their commitment to the war is rapidly and fully eroded by the slaughter around them and the orders from the heinous Nazi officers to treat the Russians with less than dignity. They are threatened with death by firing squad for their humanity in attempting to give aid to the Russians being constantly attacked and only released form their prisoner status when the war appears to be aimed toward loss. There are many very tender moments between the 6th army and the Russians trapped by the siege of Stalingrad and as the bitter winter sets in the battle-weary soldiers are dying, committing suicide or attempting to escape and find their way back home. The over two hour study of the cruelty of war ends with a solemn statement, both emotionally and visually and the Battle of Stalingrad, a victory of the Russians, shows the defeat of the minds (and lives) of the Germans. <br/><br/>The film is brave in its commitment to address the fact that the universal 'German image' of World War II is a negative one. This film focuses on individual ideals and the scarring that war, on both sides, leaves on the soldiers and people who survive it. Highly recommended. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","On the eastern front of World War II a group of Wehrmacht soldiers, fresh from time off after a successful campaign in Africa eagerly proceed to their next line of duty: the Soviet city of Stalingrad, the site of history's most brutal battle. The film however is not so much about the battle and how the strategy from either side played out, but of the ordeal that these young men had to go through. After being subjected to what the viewer can only presume as much of the Third Reich's propaganda, many are eager to ""fight communism"" and ""uphold western Christian tradition"" but stronghold of brainwashing soon collapses like a brick wall of a bombed building.<br/><br/>The production of the film is very impressive with a startlingly convincing display of the giant ruined city. Heaps of rubble, wrecked vehicles, bodies, sewers, and soon a savage winter. Humanizing the Wehrmacht has been a sort of taboo, especially in the US where German soldiers appear on screen all too often just to be shot. Some more films from more daring directors, like Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"" have had the guts to show ""the bad guys"" as humans caught up in a whirlwind out of their control. And not as the archetype of the ""evil army"" as the Wehrmacht is often perceived. For instance, there were no SS divisions at this battle, so politically fanatical Nazis are totally absent from this WW2 movie about the German Army... imagine that? To Americans this might come as a surprise. Now don't get all offended, your reading what an American has written.<br/><br/>Secondly, it is not just the dreaded SS that is absent, but also iconography is not shown... or rather it just hasn't been ADDED as in movies like ""Enemy at the Gates"" have done so and, all too often, to more-than-slightly ridiculous extents. Giant swastikas on evil Nazi trains and imposing red stars on Soviet vehicles and banners... not here. HOWEVER, the Nazi swastika DOES make one key appearance - on the tail fin of a cargo plane, an outbound medical flight, the last plane out of the battleground. Wounded soldiers attempt to board the plane to be deservedly flown to safety, but in the chaos the plane leaves; the swastika leaves. The symbol that these men rallied behind to serve their country abandons them in the one moment when they need something from it. It is not just a scene of ""war tragedy,"" it is outright betrayal. And it came after the most brutal battle in all of history.<br/><br/>Without question one of the best war films of all time. --- 9/10<br/><br/>BsCDb Classification: 13+ -- violence"
"Danielramos16","9","5","6","24 July 2008"," Truly Haunting
","I just recently saw this movie in hopes of seeing an accurate portrayal of the bloodiest battle of the 20th Century. I got what I had expected and so much more. Just to think I came across this movie by luck, before I had never even heard of it. It's a German film made in 1993 so I suppose I can't be surprised that it's almost completely unknown to the modern American audience. It's a shame cause this really is a remarkable film, I dare say that its as good if not better then Platoon, Full metal jacket, Apocalypse now, and All quiet on the western front; all of which are iconic war movies.<br/><br/>1942: World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany has over run Mainland Europe and parts of North Africa, then Adolf Hitler orders the full scale invasion of the Soviet Union. A fateful move that ultimately dooms Nazi Germany to defeat. In the early stages the invasion goes well and the German Armies conquer large sections of Soviet territory, but a critical battle ensues at Stalingrad, A city that hold great symbolic & strategic value. The battle soon turns into a blood bath of epic proportions, a nightmare for both the German & Russian soldiers fighting. On the verge of taking the city the Germans are suddenly counter attacked by the Russians who end up cutting off the entire German 6th Army inside Stalingrad. To make matters worse, the Russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the Germans. This entire battle is seen through the eyes of a few young German soldiers fighting for survival not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions but also against their own Sadistic officers who care only about medals & glory and the generals who have little regard for the average foot soldier.<br/><br/>This film is going to haunt me for a while. The German Soldiers the film concentrates on are so young and naive, then their humanity & sanity are stripped from them and you really do feel sorry for them cause their not the demonic Nazi's often portrayed in film. Everything they were fighting for is no longer important, and everything they believed in was shattered, and after fighting a gruesome battle against the Russians inside Stalingrad we see them further deteriorate with the onset of Winter causing many to freeze to death. The Battle & Winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but it also felt so real. It's amazing, in the beginning we see strapping young men in the prime of their life, and at the end they a shells of their former selves stripped of everything. After witnessing so much carnage these men just loose their will to live on, it was really sad. When there is finally a moment of hope they are betrayed by Hitler who ultimately abandons these men to a horrible death, which is just another one of Hitler's crimes abandoning the men who fought for him to be slaughtered by the Russians. <br/><br/>A good Anti-War film depicts the horrors of war and that's what this movie does. The battle for the tractor factory sequence Is the closest thing that comes to hell on earth, but that's really what The Battle for Stalingrad was like. The German & Russian soldiers were depicted with humanity, it was only the bad apples (specifically on the German side) that doomed the men. Bottom line is this film is amazing cause we see how men breakdown physically & emotionally during war. We all have our limits and these men were pushed far beyond their limits in the most deadly battle of our time. What the average foot soldier endured at Stalingrad was beyond imagination. Even if they had survived everything they had seen & done would have scarred them for life.<br/><br/>Stalingrad shows us why War is Hell, and what exactly hell looks like."
"gideon-de-jong","10","5","6","27 February 2008"," A great, realistic World War II movie
","Simply the best and most realistic movie about World War II I've ever seen. Not only because the German soldiers talk German and Russian soldiers talk Russian (no English in a German or Russian dialect)also because of the realistic decor in which the movie was shot. The acting is outstanding. No Hollywood-sentiment at all even no love story...Stalingrad was supposed to be one of the most horrific battles during the war, and in such context there's no place for sentiment or romantic scenes. What you get is a movie which will make you thrill to the bone and which have one of the best unhappy endings a movie could have."
"cr0drigues","8","5","6","18 June 2007"," Maybe the only movie which tries to show what really happened.
","This movie tries to run away to the typical 'I'm fighting because I'm obliged to defend the fatherland. The NAZI's are all bad guys, I'm against them' (typical of German war movies). How? By not talking too much about it, and just referring the war and the POW's. Nevertheless I would like to see a German movie which would be something between the extremity of Come And See and the ""bad NAZI's"" Das Boot. I say this because, excluding this factor, the German movies are the best depicting 2nd world war and the German side. You easily see some of the German hierarchical relations, very different from the ones in US army.<br/><br/>This is a movie which tries to get a real sight of what was Stalingrad, and I was not there, and I doubt most people were there now, but if I would choose one movie depicting this battle, for sure would not be the all American Enemy At The Gates. Why do I say this? Because even the best soldiers are not hero's, and given the conditions they may regard their own lives instead of the fatherland. This goes for all the ranks, and in the end you see von Paulus giving the example."
"eenbom","9","5","6","28 January 2007"," The dark side of man
","An excellent alternative movie demonstrating the horrors of war, in which there are never any heroes. Although Stalingrad was made with a much smaller budget than comparable Hollywood WWII movies, the outcome is touching. However, there is some cliché clumsiness in the outline of the main characters. There are not many movies about the WWII in Eastern Europe & Russia, where the war was the most brutal and where the outcome of the entire second world war was to a large extent settled (something which is often forgotten in the Anglo Saxon world). Stalingrad achieves to large extent in what it tries to describe. The tragic dark faith of over 1 million people would deserve more movies."

Even with this fresh in mind I felt sympathy for the German Soldier. I felt sympathy for all parties that this tragedy could happen. It will take awhile to thaw out from this one.  I'm surprised they have not made a movie based on ""The Forgotten Soldier"" by Buy Sajer.  This movie shares the cold with the book.  Both will haunt me for the rest of my life."
"Theo Robertson","7","6","8","23 November 2012"," Compelling In Parts But Let Down By Clichéd And Contrived Elements
","The battle of Stalingrad is beyond human imagination . It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle . That's if you can even call it a battle , the number of forces involved meant it was more of campaign . And if the scale of the battle wasn't mind numbing enough it's the conditions and ferocity of the fighting that sticks in the mind . As a young schoolboy in the 1970s I vividly remember reading accounts "" that every brick in every house in every street was bitterly fought over "" . Even in the 21st century with the invasion of Iraq military experts have to emphasise that the capture of Baghdad wouldn't resemble Stalingrad in anyway . In short if you want to visualize war at its most cruel and brutal pick up a history book on Stalingrad . You almost feel sorry for the bad guys . I did say "" almost"" <br/><br/>This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s <br/><br/>For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clichés that creep in to the film <br/><br/>Slight clichés are easily forgiven . Unfortunately the more the film goes on the more clichés come firing at the audience quicker than a Soviet counter-attack . What become even more unforgivable is the introduction of very contrived plotting as in "" Someone must do something unlikely and even more unlikely a character who they already know appears to move the plot forward "" A number of people who dislike this movie have pointed out the unlikely coincidences of characters who appeared in the film earlier appear and they're right . It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder <br/><br/>In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with . As it stands CROSS OF IRON still remains the best film featuring the carnage and hell of fighting on the Eastern front"
"Boba_Fett1138","7","7","10","16 October 2006"," Good portrayal of a war time situation and battle but all around the movie doesn't have the greatest storytelling.
","This movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved. It's always interesting to see the story from the 'other' side for a change. This movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers who after fighting in the North Africa campaign are send to Stalingrad, Russia, where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of WW II is being fought.<br/><br/>It's interesting to see the other side of this battle, since we mainly just always see the Germans simply as the 'villains'. In this movie those 'villains' are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you're fighting against. At first it's kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the German's are the evil villains. But of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care -and be interested in them.<br/><br/>The way this story is told isn't however the best. It's hard to keep track of the story at times, as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other. The movie isn't always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague. It also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who. It doesn't always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand, there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one, just not the most coherent one around. In that regard Hollywood movies are always better than European movies.<br/><br/>The production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations, though the movie wasn't even shot in Russia itself. It helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere.<br/><br/>The character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic. But I don't know, for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism. It also helps that they're being played by well cast actors. All of the actors aren't the best known actors around (Thomas Kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor) but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality.<br/><br/>All in all not the best or most consistent WW II drama around but definitely worth a look, due to its original approach of the German side of the battle of Stalingrad and its good production values.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"stouffer001","8","4","5","20 June 2013"," Fantastic ending- less extraordinary fighting scenes.
","Stalingrad is not the best war film. At times, I found the sub-par acting by extras and use of stock sound effects really killed the depth of a scene. I also found that I couldn't keep a track of which characters were which, this may have been due to similar faces and language barriers creating trouble with indistinguishable accents. Between scenes, there would be such large gaps in time that you wouldn't be able to tell how a situation arose or what the situation was in some cases, making the story hard to follow. These factors limited my ability to feel the exhaustion and suffering of the characters, and left me slightly disengaged.<br/><br/>The reason for my high mark, however, is attributed to the final scenes. The raw emotion coming from the few remaining actors is highly visible on this precious smaller scope, and the eventual plight of each character is played out in such devastating detail that I sat in silence in a dark room long after the credits had finished rolling and felt compelled after to even write some poetry.<br/><br/>If you came to this film to see the struggle of a battle, you could do better, but stick around for the ending, it's very much worth it."
"markvanwasbeek","8","4","5","16 July 2012"," Good war flick
","I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I had never heard about it (and I am a huge fan of the war genre) but came across this movie through another site.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes I was not completely sure what to make of the movie. The acting was a little 'stiff' and the introduction of the characters was not very well executed in my opinion. But as soon as they come into the city of Stalingrad itself the movie took a better turn.<br/><br/>The battle scenes can be quite gruesome, but very realistic as well (it's not as bloody as for example Saving Private Ryan but still limbs fly over the place). At this point, the depth of the characters also becomes more important. This movie shows you exactly what happens to normal grunts (in the movie it is once said that they are not all Nazis) under extreme pressure of an ongoing and fierce battle, and how they cope with the emotional/psychological stress involved. What I liked is that it shows the battle not only from the German perspective (although most of it) but also from the defender's side, and civilians.<br/><br/>At his point, the acting becomes very good, and I found myself wondering more than once what I would do if I was in their place. At first they are surprised that the Russians shoot their own troops considered as cowards, but they will soon realize that for them there is no viable option of retreat as well. Unless of course they want to end up as the enemy. The deprivation of sleep, food, and the stress of being in combat for months at a time is very well depicted. I can understand that some people will not like this movie, because it shows the human side of the Germans as well, and not just as savage beasts bringing terror throughout Europe (much like for example 'Der Untergang')<br/><br/>However, this movie shows that we are ALL victims of such a terrible war, and in war the difference between right and wrong fades very fast.<br/><br/>The ending to me was heartbreaking. In fact, I haven't seen such an ending in quite a long time, and the musical score with it was phenomenal.<br/><br/>Overall I would rate this an 8/10.<br/><br/>Recommended!"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","4","5","14 April 2008"," Not the best, but definitely has merit
","I haven't watched many WWII films where we follow the Germans there are obvious reasons why such are not as often made as ones centered on Allied forces. This takes place where the title suggests, and therefore has some points that I've not seen in other features. The real goods of this almost all lie in the details which is not to say that the production values are anything short of amazing. The war scenes aren't bad, but they don't engage the viewer as much as others, they don't create the same amount of tension or an idea of what the situation was like for real, to the extent found elsewhere(although I will admit that I could be somewhat influenced by watching this so close to Saving Private Ryan). There's no Hollywood, as such, herein, but there are one or two ""coincidences"". The writing tends to be pretty good. The psychology isn't bad, and seems accurate. This doesn't particularly downplay any aspect of war(and does include a thing or two that aforementioned Spielberg piece did not), without anything ever being gratuitous. There is no celebration of violence(or anything else), and you are not going to get any warm, fuzzy feeling from a viewing of this. The fact that everyone speaks the actual language(not just German, also Russian) lends this a lot of credibility. The pacing could definitely use work, and the direction could be considerably more effective. The realism does have a noticeable hole or two, but it's also spot-on in places. The acting is mostly a positive aspect the only performer I recognized was Thomas Kretschman, and he does much better in his native tongue than in American, more convincing. I recommend this to any fan of war-movies, and find the seldom used backdrop and the information found within it to be commendable. 7/10"

","Having majored in Western History when I was a student in college seeing the views on World War II are quite discomforting and in a whole completely wrong. World War II was the most graphic and bloody affairs to ever occur in world history. While the Axis Powers conducted many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every German soldier was out to exterminate the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier swung a samurai sword around and flew kamikaze missions, and not every Italian soldier was a Fascist. Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you and I caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved.<br/><br/>The Battle of Stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over 1,500,000 casualties sustained over the course of the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader Lieutenant von Witzland as they are reassigned to the Eastern Front to battle the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as sort of the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in Germany and Poland.<br/><br/>The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle. We are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles (including a firing squad sequence). Overall the battles are the earliest examples that I know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film.<br/><br/>The film does not aim to make the German's completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to, evil. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. The film makes it clear quite quickly that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the Germany Army was simply fighting for a cause they really didn't understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in Russia.<br/><br/>The film really shows how hellish war is, especially World War II. The battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it. It will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the Eastern Front faced. Not recommended for children. <br/><br/>4/5 stars"
"Gurn","Null","4","5","20 January 1999"," A war movie where everyone is human?
","I won't recap the good comments of everyone else - I'll limit myself to an observation. As an American soldier myself (albeit of the nautical variety), I appreciated the filmmakers making the German soldier a human being - I also appreciated how they also made the normally faceless enemy (as seen through a movie camera) human, as well. The viewer could sympathize with the common soldier, but was not spared the consequences of the common soldier's actions. I think they did a better job of it than most American filmmakers - we're good at portraying the violence and terror of war from the viewpoint of the soldier, but we hold back when it comes to depicting the cost to the (comparatively) innocent. Certainly, the Germans were freezing to death - and the central characters more than once saw their comrades turning Russians out to freeze to death. Certainly, the Germans were dying - and the central characters were confronted with a Russian woman grieving over two small children who had either been killed or starved or frozen to death. And what American movie depicts the armed enemy as ""just a regular guy""? The Russian soldier dying next to the young German who had just accidentally killed his friend was far from the faceless enemy.<br/><br/>Besides all this, it was better to hear the soldiers speak German, even if I did have to read the subtitles."
"varun_120","10","6","9","2 November 2012"," Perfect portrayal of reality
","I would daresay this is a better war film than 'The Schindler's list'. We have seen many war films from the point of views of Russians, Jews, Poles etc. But this was my first world war 2 movie seen from a German soldier's point of view. The film starts when a battalion of German soldiers are ordered to go to Stalingrad. When they think about going to Stalingrad, they think of farms and greenery but when they reach Stalingrad, the truth is far different than the reality.<br/><br/>The German soldiers think they could win Russia within a month, their very notion turns into disbelief as they enter Stalingrad, and see thousands of wounded German soldiers. Stalingrad war was indeed the biggest mistake of Germany, and it proved the beginning of the end for Germany, and resurrection of Russia. One thing I always wondered as a child, when a war is waged why there is no confusion, how always a particular army perfectly distinguishes its soldiers from the opponents'.<br/><br/>In the very beginning, when Germans invade Stalingrad, we see a massive confusion within the battalion and a German soldier inadvertently kills his fellow soldier. As you may do research, you will find that there was a huge chaos during the world war 2 and such incidents occurred. One thing that the director wants to convey is that all the German soldiers were not blood grubbing monsters, even they were tired of killing other people, even they wanted to go home. But they had no options, if they didn't kill , they would have been killed by their superiors.<br/><br/>This thing is evident when a young Russian boy is captured by the German army, and the soldiers who are protagonists in the movie are told to shoot the boy with dozens of other people. They are reluctant to shoot the boy, but their fascist superior warns them that if they didn't shoot those civilians, they would be next in queue. Stalingrad is an attempt by the director to earn some sympathy for the German soldiers, who were always seen as culprits, but this film shows they were victims too.<br/><br/>I don't want to get into the war crimes that Germans committed in Russia and other nations, but when you view a film you have to see it impartially. At the very outset of the film, it is very much clear that you are not going to see a happy end as you see in Hollywood. This film makes 'Enemy at the gates' look a very cheap film which is far from reality, as it creates Rachel Weisz's character in the film. This film is not for the people who want to see war films just for the sake of explosions and killings of people.<br/><br/>We see scenes in the film where a German soldier shares his bread with a civilian, and also in the end when the Hans Von Witzland refuses to rape a helpless Russian female soldier. This film tells us about the fate of the soldiers who were stuck there and knew what was coming to them. In fact, this movie tells us about the harsh reality of war and it tells that the war is always bad, and there is no winner in a war. This film doesn't show that Russians were bad despite being a German film, nor it shows that Germans were heroes, but still makes its point of earning sympathy for all the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle of Stalingrad."

","As a stickler for realism in war movies, ""Stalingrad"" is my ideal war movie. It passes my 10-point manifesto for war movies: 1) Combat is hellish and graphic. No chest-clutching and ""I'm hit, tell my wife that I love her..."" 2) Equipment and uniforms must be accurate, i.e., no Sherman tanks with swastikas painted on them. 3) Actors must speak the actual languages (with subtitles). 4) The locations must be realistic. 5) The incidental music must be subdued, not a crutch (frankly, I would ban mood music from films.) 6) Characters present realistic opinions, not clichés. 7) Sub-plots should be realistic (no love affairs with enemy nurses, etc.) 8) No preaching, just realism. No propaganda (""patriotic"" or ""anti-war""), just the feelings of real soldiers. 9) The camera work makes you feel ""in the thick of it"". 10) No all-star casts. Soldiers aren't Hollywood pretty boys, they're regular men. FYI, I also recommend ""Come and See"", a recent Russian film about the Eastern Front."
"niklas-henricson-517","9","2","2","6 August 2015"," Not a glamorous movie
","The reason I like German or in general European war movies is that they don't always have happy endings and don't glamor the war. War is full of cruelty, loss of any reason, inhuman and utterly horrible. In this story we follow Lt. Hans von Witzland. From the name you can figure out the young lieutenant is coming from a long traditional military family. At some point in the movie a higher ranked officer is mentioning his father. The young lieutenant is going through a change of perspective when he comes face to face with death and war, he's loosing his close friends, realizes the pointless battles, the corruption within higher ranked officers, the powerless generals who blindly follow orders from above and seeing everyone as numbers. This is how he looses faith for his country, his people, his army and the identity he once carried proudly in his stripes is now lost as he tries to survive the cruel winter in the front. An awesome movie that shows you the reality of every war. Nothing glamorous, just inhuman, raw and cruel. I would love to see this movie remade and modernized."
"jvdesuit1","10","2","2","22 February 2014"," Journey into horror...
","Nearly 2am in Paris this Sunday. I've watched this movie, this morning and still cant take out of my head the views and sound. This is probably as many here say the best movie ever made on WWII.<br/><br/>We're very far from the eternal Hollywoodian productions, with more or less happy endings, carefully edited not to shock ears or eyes with crude words or views. Joseph Vilsmaier goes straight to the facts. Even if the beginning with its views of the beaches of Italy gives an impression of gradation to the subject, we're very quickly confronted to the reality of what was to happen: young guys who would prefer to be attending their everyday life with families and friends and brought into a storm by a megalomaniac scoundrel named Hitler.<br/><br/>The best example of this is the huge lie of the general in the scene at the beginning of the film when he states that Germany has been victorious at El Alamein!<br/><br/>All along the movie, we can feel the sense of betrayal of the battalion and Hans. It's a huge crescendo just as the horrors of the situations lived by those men increases. Another aspect of the way the film is shot, is at the same time a terrible sense of loneliness. Progressively each character transmits to the audience this terrible feeling of being abandoned to fate and elements i.e. the climate. The director and the writer have made a fantastic analysis of the human nature and its reaction to this terrible trauma. And you cant help thinking, how would I react in such circumstances?.<br/><br/>Joseph Vilsmaier has succeeded not to drop in the great mistake of Jean-Jacques Annaud's version of Stalingrad (Enemy at the gate) which is the relative happy ending. Whatever the facts you depict in a movie treating of this battle, there cant be a positive or happy ending for any of the protagonists. A simple figure attests of it: it is estimated that of the 100000 German POW only 5000 survived and returned to their country.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, and each adolescent should view it to keep in its memory what the so called superiority of a nation can be driven to if by nationalistic propaganda it is driven to expansionism.<br/><br/>This is true on any continent, whether America, Europe or Asia. History repeats itself whether we like it or not and there is always somewhere a mad man to exploit economic circumstances leading to such horrors. France and England have had a huge responsibility in the arrival of Hitler because of the stupid Versailles treaty and the way we ruined the German economy opening the gates to hatred on one side and credulity of a starving nation to the propaganda and lies of its filthy new leader in the 30s."

","Bloody marvelous. Recommended by a friend who knew I liked Thomas Kretschmann in The Pianist and Downfall. I loved the flow of the narrative - how the characters moved from hope and ideals of valour through shock, fear, disintegration, desperation and utter annihilation. A first rate anti-war movie that must have created quite the stir in Germany. Not a proud moment for anyone and the study of a generation lost. This movie was excellent at conveying the remove of the command from the ground troops and in pounding the utter futility of trying to control untamed nature and the Russian psyche. If I didn't know I would have thought it was a Russian movie it was so fatalistic. What an uncompromising ending. A pieta."

On a par with Das Boot. Basically it follows a Company of elite German ""Stormtrooper"" infantry who leave garrison duty in an idyllic Italian seaside town and are immediately thrust into the chaos of the disintegrating Russian front. <br/><br/>A good war movie illuminates both the senselessness and brutality of war and at the same time gives us insight into the experiences and essential humanity of those who fight.

","This is a good movie because we so rarely get to see the other side of the story which in most cases is far more intresting and relevant. This showed the true brutality of what went on at Stalingrad and although I was not there I would think it resembled the image this movie created.<br/><br/>As a response to some earlier posts where people said they didn't like this movie because it attempted to humanize the German soldiers. Well guess what despite what you may think they were humans it is a proven fact. The average German soldier was not a Nazi nor did they have a great urge to fight and die in Russia. They were merely obeying orders from the high command as were the Russians, Americans, British, Italians, Japanese and the many other nations that participated in the war. The German soldiers as well as everyone else that fought and died for their country deserve to be respected equally whether friend or foe.<br/><br/>Back to the movie I feel the actors did a good job of portraying the German soldiers who were broken down to the point of destruction. The movie was well filmed and has created an accurate vision of what Stalingrad was like. I would give it a 9 out of 10."
"perper","10","2","2","28 June 2001"," Gritty war movie without heroes or heroics
","Stalingrad is a terrific movie, well acted and directed, and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and it's politics. This is, together with ""Das Boot"" one of the best war movies (together with the Finnish ""Vinterkriget"" (""The Winter War"", in English, I believe)). It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2. No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war. The mood of the movie is similar to the one in ""Das Boot"", and that should give you some hints on what to expect, I guess. So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywoodish, war movies: Rent it, buy it, just make sure you see it! Finally, a film buff's note: for some of the previous reviewers information, I only want to add that ""Stalingrad"" isn't directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who made ""Das Boot"")!"
"CosmoFelani","3","13","25","6 October 2013"," Doesn't stand the passing of time
","I have wanted to watch this film for many years but only got around to it last week. Many reviewers have highlighted the fact that this is not a Hollywood treatment, which can be a positive. But for anyone who has been exposed to the realism of Saving Private Ryan and similar movies, the absence of Hollywood production values and standards of acting and realism make Stalingrad hard to take seriously. It is highly theatrical, in the sense that the acting is over the top and the motivations and actions of most of the characters do not line up with anything that I'd call realistic, in terms of what I have read about the battle itself or based on what one would consider believable human behavior. Very simplistic in all respects. Probably would have been quite OK in 1993, when it was released, but by today's standards, not something I would recommend."
"wmarkley","4","17","35","9 December 2005"," Deeply Flawed
","With all of its technical flash, the 1993 ""Stalingrad"" movie is very disappointing. Before watching it I had read non-fiction accounts of the Stalingrad campaign and had seen a lot of documentary footage and photographs of the actual battle and its participants. I don't think that any movie can really succeed in depicting the titanic struggle and suffering that actually occurred, but I still wanted to see what a relatively recent German movie production would be like. While there are a few good elements of this movie, overall it is a failure. To me the worst aspect is that it includes substantial anachronisms, and also some very contrived and clichéd elements, most glaringly in some encounters between a German officer and a Soviet woman.<br/><br/>Also there are some ideological elements in the movie which result in very distorted perceptions, including what amounts to a caricature of a German chaplain, some overblown class-warfare messages, and problematic depictions of ""good"" vs. ""bad"" Germans. Certainly the German Armed Forces of World War II included men who were able to maintain some decency throughout the war, and others who did very bad things, but the attempts in the movie to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish. I give ""Stalingrad"" credit in the sense that it doesn't completely portray German troops in the simple demonic quality which is the stereotype that many people now have, yet the movie includes stereotypes of its own, such as an almost too-good-to-be-true infantryman who has attitudes more akin to the 1990's than the 1940's, and two completely evil infantrymen and a rear-echelon officer.<br/><br/>Some recent movies such as ""Stalingrad"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are frequently praised for their ""authenticity"" in depicting graphic scenes of combat, yet these same movies are deeply flawed and distorted in their depictions of the attitudes, values and behaviors of 1940's soldiers and civilians. ""Stalingrad"" and ""S.P.R"" have major and minor characters who lack the unselfconscious stoicism that was common among regular people during the World War II period. Certainly soldiers throughout history have been notorious for their frequent grumbling and occasional cynicism, yet the self-absorbed, talky and touchy-feely characters in both of these movies are something else, and are much more prevalent in our world of today than they were in the 1940's. While many people these days like to denigrate war movies from the 40's and 50's which present more patriotic messages and aren't as graphic about combat, many of those earlier movies such as ""Battleground"" are much more accurate in their depictions of typical soldiers' attitudes, and they are often successful in showing the horrible effects of war in more indirect ways.<br/><br/>One well-done part of ""Stalingrad"" is a battle between German infantry and Soviet tanks, which does a reasonable job of capturing some of the horror and confusion in such combat.<br/><br/>""Stalingrad"" does a poor job though of showing the common look of the frontline soldier. Part of this might be due to the difficulty in finding thin, haggard-looking extras in our pampered and well-fed America and western Europe of today. Also, too many of the German troops in the movie don't wear their uniforms and equipment properly, and don't display the professional bearing that was common in the German Wehrmacht even during the years of German defeat. If you want to get a good idea of how the actual German troops looked, I recommend the following documentaries which contain footage of the Stalingrad campaign: ""The World at War,"" ""War of the Century"" and ""Russia's War."" Also the books ""Operation Barbarossa in Photographs"" by Paul Carell, ""Stalingrad"" by Geoffrey Jukes and ""Stalingrad"" by Paul Carell contain a great many helpful photos. Books written about the battle by Antony Beevor and William Craig are recommended also, and the latter one is especially good about the common soldiers and civilians on both sides.<br/><br/>Relatively recent movies which, in my opinion, are much better than ""Stalingrad"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" in depicting attitudes and characters of persons during World War II, and the general feel, look, horror and grittiness of that war, are ""Der Untergang"" (""The Downfall"") and ""Talvisota"" (""The Winter War""). While ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""The Longest Day"" cover events on the Western Front rather than in the East, they are also excellent war movies, and stick very close to factual accounts. The latter two movies lack some of the grit that is more prevalent in more recent films, but they compensate for that lack with their other strengths, including truthfulness."
"BeneCumb","7","3","4","14 June 2013"," An anti-war war movie, a bit protracted though
","For losers of a war or a battle, it is not customary to create something depicting their defeat, especially if this happened not so long time ago. E.g., Russians have had several defeats in the post WW II period - could you imagine them picturing this? With Stalingrad 1993, Germans have crudely shown the horrors and sufferings in one of the most severe battles in the WW II, without glorifying themselves and without scoffing at their enemy. On the other hand, Soviet Russia was no innocent victim, its treatment of own and neighboring people in the 1930ies was nasty and lethal as well, and Soviet (non-)activities were largely a reason why Hitler had courage to start this horrible war.<br/><br/>As for the movie, the events and background seem realistic (probably shot in Finland), most of actors performing Russians speak decent Russian, and leading men are catchy to follow (primarily Dominique Horwitz as Obergefreiter Fritz Reiser, Thomas Kretschmann as Leutnant Hans Von Witzland, Jochen Nickel as Unteroffizier Manfred ""Rollo"" Rohleder). However, some of the scenes could have been shortened, and direct battle scenes comprise only a small part of the movie. The ending is predictable, although the scenes leading to it are well directed. It seems that the creators wanted to combine profound human aspect with concrete battle, but for this task, the movie was too short - a miniseries could have been more appropriate. Nevertheless, if you like war movies based on real events, Stalingrad is worth watching."

","American WWII movies tend to be slick 'action' films, in which the hero is a sort of John Wayne figure who rises to the challenge and overcome his personal flaws to defeat a relentlessly evil enemy. This basic plot is even central to such films as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon.<br/><br/>Stalingrad deals with war in a much more realistic manner, and in this regard is far more comparable to the American film A Thin Red Line. What we see here is not just the intensity of combat, but one is given a sense of the bureaucratic monstrosity which war engenders, and the film thus has depressing cutscenes of trains, troops, tanks, and endless marching columns. Just as A Thin Red Line dwells upon the heat and misery of the jungle, Stalingrad focuses upon winter and famine. Meanwhile, both films portray the reality of a distraught civilian populace.<br/><br/>Unlike most American war films which one-dimensionally portray the enemy as 'bad', Stalingrad provides a far more realistic view of blended morality, showing warcrimes committed by all sides, whilst truly good-natured and moral individuals are also seen on both sides. In the end, we are thus left with a sense of war as a senseless waste, as a struggle between corrupt leaders who exploit the naive youth who believe it is their duty to defend their country.<br/><br/>Of course, the most controversial aspect of this film is that it deals with the Nazi movement and uses German soldiers as the protagonists. Does it thus glorify or condemn Hitler? The answer to that question will become readily apparent to anyone who watches the film. In the end, the viewer is left wondering just what any soldier could have done to avert these tragic events. What would you have done? In watching the film, you will almost certainly view at least one character trying to do exactly what you believe you yourself would have done.<br/><br/>-Adam Rinkleff"

","This is one of the latest films produced by Germans about the WWII. It started with DAS BOOT , where the Germans dealt with a quite delicate topic from the war ( still many families can remember lost relatives in the Battle of the Alantic, on the allied side ). And now the war in Russia. What make this movie special compared to e.g. Cross Of Iron , is German language and German actors. The film is quite close to the history. Uniforms, weapons etc. are also correct. It could be to debate that not so much time was spend on the war crime committed ( even by Wehrmact ) in Russia, but actually in Stalingrad, this was not a issue , it was pure survival for the German soldiers under siege. The cold weather,lack of everything, desperation and also the short moments in hope, is shown very good in this movie. I have talked about Stalingrad with one family member that was private in the encircled German army ( he manage to get out in last moment ). He said that he couldn't make this film better, yes more cruel - but there is no let us share his daily nightmare. But we got some of the taste. Furthermore the corrupt German high rank officers is real, and the selection between able/disable for service selection is true.

","Even though there is no doubt that this movie gives you an impression of the cruelty and hopelessness of the soldiers involved in the battle of Stalingrad (and any other battle in any other war, I would assume), it fails to be remembered as a great motion picture as well, because from my point of view it is just too cliché-ridden - some examples (*** SPOILERS ***):<br/><br/><ul><li>the officer who remorselessly sends one of his soldiers on a suicide mission during battle - the young, first-time front soldier who loses it and shoots his own comrade - the ultra-correct young officer and the weathered old soldiers - the human moments when the German soldier gives bread to a Russian on the battlefield - the over-evil Nazi officer - the soldier who shits his pants during battle - the guy who learns that his wife is leaving him via a letter she sends to him - the obligatory suicide mission that is undertaken with the main characters surviving</li></ul><br/><br/>... and so on - I believe that all of these things have really happened, but if they all hit you within a few minutes, the whole thing gets ridiculous and looks like 'the compressed Stalingrad in a nutshell'.

","Some of the best directors ever have come out of Germany and other central European countries. Vilsmaier is not one of them. Whether he is primarily responsible for the cut of ""Stalingrad"" I just rented from Netflix or someone else perpetrated it I do not know. But what could have been an excellent film is rendered just so-so by sloppy editing, obvious caricatures, uninspired panorama shots, and a soundtrack that seems to have been dubbed after the fact.<br/><br/>And then there is the predictable rapid-fire dialogue utterly destroying any sense of subtlety or inner tension inherent in some otherwise very good character portrayals. I do not fault the actors. Whenever they do have a chance to go deeper into an odd bit of dialogue, there seems to follow a figurative pie-in-the-face or sudden thrust in another direction entirely.<br/><br/>I thought the fictional though contrived main plot at least equal to those of any one of hundreds of other war movies. There is nothing unique involved here -- in spite of a tendency on the part of many viewers to re-live the specific tactics or political background in which the story progresses. War is war. I first heard that expression from a German cousin of mine who lost his only son (a Wehrmacht Lieutenant) at Stalingrad, and the sad finality in his voice still echoes in my head.<br/><br/>So, although I followed the character of Witzland (curious name, that) from beginning to end with more than a little personal identification, I vote this one no more than a high average."
"billandersen","10","3","5","1 March 2002"," Germans are people too!
","I have to say first that I REALLY like Stalingrad (gave it a 10).  The main reason is simply that it shows a piece of the war through German (albeit 1992 German) eyes, something not done in a significant way by any US-produced movie.  Even more remarkable (and commendable) is that the vast majority of the soldiers depicted are decent people and not faceless child-eating murdering Nazi thugs (as in ""Enemy at the Gates"").  Having learned German (the subtitles are incomplete, sometimes wrong, and generally bad) the movie was made all the more enjoyable - some of the stuff just doesn't translate to English. Sure there are problems - continuity, editing, technical, etc.  But I've read now three different histories of the battle (most recently Antony Beevor's excellent book) and the movie does an excellent job of showing you a cross-section of life for German soldiers who fought, starved, froze and eventually died during the campaign while avoiding a superficial ""check all the boxes"" plot like the one in the truth-bending yet inexplicably popular ""Platoon"". Other commentators have criticized the character development in ""Stalingrad"", a charge just as easily directed at any film with the ambitious scope of this movie.  These comments might just as well be due to the problems of translation.  Through Lieutenant von Witzland and Captain Musk, one sees the traditional German values of honor and service; through Otto, we see the moral crisis faced by the German Army officer corps that found itself paralyzed in the face of Nazi manipulation; in the innocent GG we see the waste and loss of war.<br/><br/>In line with other commentators, however, I have to say that I can't approve of the revisionist nature of the ""Stalingrad"" plot.  Personal accounts and letters show overwhelmingly that even the average German soldier was quite confident of victory and many in their faith in and allegiance to Hitler almost up until the end in February, 1943.  While this would have made the movie less appealing, both in Germany and elsewhere, it would have made for much better history.  One had to ask when viewing ""Stalingrad"" the same question one asks when walking the streets of modern-day Germany -- ""Where did all the Nazis go?"""

You could not expect to watch a picture where Russian and German soldiers, though on opposite sides, were both thrown in the same hell, the same grief, the same pain. This German film actually made it. But that's because it is a GERMAN point of view, the point of view of those who LOST the war. You have here no patriotic propaganda that you could see in Bondarchouk's film - in 2013 - about this so great victory for Ivan...I hate Russian movies about the Great Patriotic War, except COME AND SEE of course. In the other features, German soldiers are ALWAYS shown as idiots, barbarians - which they were in many cases, but not necessarily on the front line; For instance, in Stalingrad battle, there were no SS nor Einsatz kommandos, in charge of population extermination. There were only German fighters, not pure Nazis. The same with the Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps, in North Afrika. To summarize, I love the realistic way of filming and depicting characters.

While at the same time seeing the war from both sides, seeing both the good and evil people in the war. Not just saying the Germans were the only evil people. Seeing the side of the Germans from the very human perspective. Making it, what I think is...one of the best war movies ever made.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the movie tells the battle from a German perspective, creating very interesting characters I can sympathize with and find interesting. As we first see the characters on the way to Stalingrad, very confident in their own abilities, as by this point in the war, Germany was winning. But by the time they get to Stalingrad, they suffer through some of the worst conditions imaginable. And you find yourself caring for the characters, as they weren't bad people, just people fighting for the wrong side.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is also great, many may criticize the way it's shot and edited, but I like it. The way it's shot adds a certain degree of confusion and chaos to it all. As the battle was very chaotic and violent.<br/><br/>The film also stands out, because it has more of a heart and soul. While I appreciate films like Private Ryan a lot, but I think this one is better, because I felt more invested watching it. We understand the motives and flaws of everybody, and it's so interesting to watch. In most WWII movies, your wishing those pesky Germans die. But here, you actually route for these people, even though you know what happened in history.<br/><br/>""Stalingrad"" is an excellent movie about war, and easily...my favorite film about war. ""Saving Private Ryan"" might be better known, or more of a classic, but this is better made and more interesting. This is a war that stands out among countless others like it, and one of my favorite films of all time."

","Now I'm not familiar with every little detail and the movie may not be depicting what happened exactly. Yet this is as realistic and as a war movie can go. I had no idea what a gem they had produced back then. It is unrelenting and it is quite literally down and dirty. War is nothing to joke around about and it does things to people.<br/><br/>And people obviously do things to other people. You especially see people who did follow orders but not always. You see human beings, who got caught in a big lie and who sacrificed themselves for a purpose that was crazy to say the least. But you also see humans who realize what they are and how they are being used (against their will). You see a will to survive - as with every living thing. And you see humility, but also cowardess. Every trait is going to be exposed ... for better or worse. And the war scenes are more than well shot. I am surprised and a little bit shocked! How did it take me so long to find this? You can call it Anti War (because in the end that is what the message is) or just war movie - one thing you will call it for sure is great"

","Being a WW2 fan, i was a bit late to see this brilliant movie. Although there are not many movies which are shot in German POV, i find this movie full of uncompromising quality and workmanship. <br/><br/>Its visually breathtaking, the battle scenes are brutal and chilling, even the conditions are so unbearable and yet greatly filmed.<br/><br/>The Story line is unevenly told and lacks a neat narration. The actions scenes stop abruptly and lacking a final punch. At times, the movie drags on and on. The lead actors are good if not great. I feel that with the kind of brilliant setup the film crew had, they could have shot few more brutal action scenes instead of dragging the whole movie. <br/><br/>If you really want to have a very few taste of German sympathy towards Communist counterparts, this is the flick and its aptly shown in bits and pieces."
"richard6","7","2","3","14 May 2011"," Non-glorification of war
","During the second world war, one city on the banks of the Volga become the symbol of adversary for many nations ensnared in conflict. For the Nazi supremacy the City of Stalingrad represented the doctrines of Bolshevism. For the Soviet Union, Stalingrad represented national loyalty, patriotism and the defence of the whole country. Subsequently, for many generations, the battle of Stalingrad carries an extensive mark of lasting psychological suffering. Most notable, the German nation. Its a striking occurrence that since Germany was unified in 1989, the first moderate budget war film produced centred on this battle in 1942.<br/><br/>The film-makers have skilfully chronologically crafted and edited the film in several ways. To begin with, the scenes of the Warmacht relaxing in North West Italy following combat in North Africa, which resulted in them pushing back the British, Australian, New Zealand and Free-French armies. This method allows the audience a sense of calm opposing expectations before the troops are relocated to Southern Russia. During relocation, we witness the feeling of confidence instilled into the minds of the Warmacht and their future plans for Russia, once conquered. However, on arrival In Stalingrad the first images witnessed are of severely wounded and unresponsive soldiers (the ones they have been sent to replace), Russian prisoners of war being brutally mistreated and close combat soon follows. You can scene the atmosphere and their thoughts, what fate awaits them? ""Stalingrad"" succeeds in a series of scenes containing humanity-combat-brutality-morality-back to combat. The majority of these different scenes, binded together story-wise, accomplish a purpose and question the obligation of the war. Yet, some scenes are over dramatised and amiably over-tender, especially the third and final act.<br/><br/>The director, Joseph Vilsmaier resourcefully adopts a hand-held camera method for many of the combat scenes. This method helps heighten the impending danger. Also, many combat injuries are graphical in detail. Both methods that are now so common in many modern Hollywood war films of the past 15 years, post ""Saving Private Ryan"". The film makes the subtle conformity that is was the harsh Russian winter, lack of supplies and the deficient judgement of their high-ranking officers that defeated them.<br/><br/>It appears the film makers are indicatively expressing the story of the war, not just the battle of Stalingrad, in this film. The rise and fall of the Warmacht, from victory to defeat, and eventually the spirit of the German nation. A principle that sub-consciously last to this day. Not that this should be misinterpreted as passing judgement on the film-makers or the German nationals, it is just a slender observation.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Stalingrad"" is not a documentary of the titles battle, it is film, and a very virtuous one, made for dramatic presentation. The acting is good from all the cast involved, especially, Thomas Kretschmann and Dominique Horwitz as Warmacht soldiers. The production design is realistic and visionary decisive. The combat scenes express savagery and the film contains a image of sombre quality focusing on sacrifices and human interaction of a sensitive issue."
"caspian1978","8","2","3","20 February 2005"," Not so Quiet on the Eastern Front
","For an American audience, this is an amazing movie to watch. Having no part in this story, this is a German / Russian look into World War 2. More than that, the movie is in a way, a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front. Several scenes in Stalingrad are mimics of the original World War 1 masterpiece. The movie begins in paradise as the German soldiers prepare to leave for the battle front. From the start, we begin at the garden of Eden and end up traveling into the belly of the beast at eh gates of hell. The look into the Axis army as more than just foot soldiers for Hitler's pride is more than interesting. The audience gets to see a human side to the soldiers who were not just pawns in Hitler's idea. The ending alone shows a human side to every solider. Frozen in time for the audiences favor, the historical event is placed on stage for us to view. Much like reaching for the youth and innocence of a butterfly, the two soldiers holding onto one another as they take their final breath is equally as human and just. More than an anti-war movie, this is part of our history and is a story than needed to be told."

","After 60 years of constant anti-propaganda, it is a very hard job indeed to have someone  sympathize with the German point of view of the second great war. This movie achieves it.<br/><br/>War on the Russian front was one of the greatest mistakes any leader could have done and Germany paid dearly for that, in terms of causalties as well as consequences. The movie Stalingrad depicts the story of ordinary soldiers caught between the duty of the reich and their own personal consciousness. We see soldiers, warriers, young innocents who for whatever reason are thrown into the firelines and pushed to their physical and offensive levels. The villains and the heroes are on the same side, both are germans..Tribute to the filmmakers and the storytellers and the actors of the Stalingrad that, they achieve to humanize the most loathed subjects of the last 6 decades. They are frightened, traumatized, have dreams and hopes, and want to survive..They could be anyone, from any race, from any country; it is so easy to identify with them. This a one of the best anti-war movies ever made..It is haunting, painfully realistic void of cliches and emotionally affective without being cheesy.."

Not being personally familiar with the actors in the film made it for me, all the more interesting. There are no heroes in this film, only ordinary people placed in a hopeless situation.

","This film used to be one of my favorites as a German teenager and re-watching it after 15 years was almost painful to some degree.<br/><br/>The film now appears a reaction to stereotypical characterizations of Germans in US films, where they are all inherently evil. Unfortunately the film goes completely overboard with there being way too many good Germans. To make matters worse, the ""bad Germans"" are mere caricatures, which seem to have been pulled straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>Such a shame to be so disappointed as I had been really looking forward to seeing this again. Admittedly this is a very juvenile attempt at history and depicting Germans a human rather than evil. As one German reviewer rightly concluded, the film does feel like it is playing down fascism and the Nazism.<br/><br/>Down from 9 out of 10 to 6 out of 10 Definitely will not be buying the DVD after seeing it again."
"heslop1989","9","1","1","20 December 2013"," A total tour de force.
","Stalingrad starts off gentile and jolly enough but it soon descends into an accurate viewing of what hell would be like for a group of young men who are thrown into a situation that they cannot control or have no way out of. Granted the special effects are a bit primitive but with it being twenty years old its to be expected. The battle scenes are brutal but the biggest tour de force are the scenes where the men slowly realise the only way out is death, the torture and the psychological degrade are really hard hitting. It makes you realise that not all Germans in world war two weren't evil and that in Stalingrad they too faced appalling suffering. Stalingrad is a movie that must be seen."
"happy_love_joy","8","1","1","2 June 2013"," Best movie describing the Eastern Front, but...
","The movie has a lot of good points, as have been shown in other review.<br/><br/>However, the battle scenes in this movie are a little bit silly in my eyes: <br/><br/>1. At the beginning battle of the movie, the storm company (or battalion?) was tasked to overwhelm the defenders of the factory. The captain wanted to close the quarter quietly and launch the offensive without rousing the defenders. Yet, a rifle was fired unwillingly by an infantry who jumped in, which waked up the defenders and caused a lot of casualties in the attacking force. Later, the captain gave the soldier a hand-grenade to eliminate the machine-gun which is mowing down the German soldiers. That soldier just ran toward the machine-gun without much dodging movements, not even lowering his body. And he didn't get mowed down by the machine-gun.<br/><br/>This contradicted the usual common sense. What's more, the German hand-grenade's advantage is its throwing distance, but the explosive in it is not as much as the U.S. fragmentation ones. So I am quite doubtful that a potato-masher would destroy a machine-gun pillbox, as shown in the movie. Plus, Stalingrad would not have gained its nickname ""Street-fight Academy"" if the defender's position is so easy to overthrow. In the ruins of the Stalingrad, it is impossible to imagine such a single machine-gun pillbox without supporting cross-fire from other directions. If it were that simple, the 6th Army would have captured the city long before the winter began.<br/><br/>2. In the middle of the movie, over the snow-covered steppe, Lieutenant Witzland's platoon is ordered to hold an area where the Russian wanted to break in with their tanks. The soldiers either used Panzerfaust to give the tank a direct hit, or waited in the foxhole until the tank rolled over, and attached the ad-hoc high-explosive to its rear-engine part to break it down. After that, the infantry soldiers attached to the tank or behind it were mowed down by German MP40 or MG42.<br/><br/>As far as I know, the usual way of fighting with a mixed mechanized formation is to let the infantry soldiers come forward to scout the hidden enemy fire positions, to expose them and let them be licked up by the up-coming tanks. No, the tanks would never thrust forward by themselves. That way, they would be easy targets for Panzerfausts or Bazookas. The tanks would go all by themselves only in very large formations, say, a tank division or a tank army. In that case, the enemy would not have a chance to come behind the leading tanks and explode them from behind - anyone who tried to do this would be mowed down by the machine-gun in the following-up tanks.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is successful in humanizing the German soldiers fighting in Stalingrad, but it made a big mistake in over-simplifying the battle scenes and under-estimating the Russian force too much, just the same errors commit by the Fuhrer and General Staff of Wehrmacht.<br/><br/>The Russian would not have won the Battle of Stalingrad if they fought in the way described in the movie."

","The best most realistic film on the battle for Stalingrad - No question about it! The effects are amazing and the story line as well. If there were high quality camera's back in the 40's this is what you would see on Stalingrad newsreels. This is not enemy at the gates which hardly shows battle footage,this movie is full of action. The only reason I give it 8 out of 10 is because of some of the weapons not being historically accurate - like the Russian's Mosin Nagant sniper rifle,the scope setup on it never was used in the Red Army its just a fake prop. But don't let this stop you from watching it - its an awesome film!"

The graphic action and individual characters gave this movie much to keep me interested through the whole movie. Stalingrad was very brutal battle and the scenes gave this movie that stark reality of this battle. I recommend this for anyone who is interested in military history. This was my second viewing of this movie in a few years and was captivated by it's realism again. The weapons, uniforms, and hearing it German while reading the subtitles gave it much credit for a good military movie.

It will be interesting to see if there is a 'Directors Cut' in a few years time!<br/><br/>If you want a warm fuzzy war film, aka 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Stalingrad' is not for you.

"gmarshall-735-127309","2","10","29","11 May 2010"," Much too one-sided
","For me as a German, the movie ""Stalingrad"" was disappointing as it fails to give a three-dimensional image of the Stalingrad battle. <br/><br/>The Stalingrad battle is presented only from the German perspective and not once from the Russian one. Thus, ironically, the Germans are indirectly portrayed as the victims whereas the Russians are presented as the faceless enemy. It is almost forgotten throughout the movie that the Germans actually are the invaders and that the Russians are defending their own country. What is therefore missing is a depiction of the suffering of the civilian population and the Russian soldiers.<br/><br/>The battle scenes, however, are well-produced and seem realistic from a technical and historical viewpoint and overall manage to portray the futility of the battle.<br/><br/>To sum it up, the movie fails to give a three-dimensional image of the Stalingrad battle and therefore to some degree distorts the historical facts."

The men are soon sent to the eastern front. It's a harrowing fight filled with horrors as they get surrounded by the Russians.<br/><br/>It is a little bit hard to differentiate some of the men. Most have similar haircuts and some look very similar. It's also hard to differentiate by their voices since I don't understand German. I certainly don't recognize any of the actors. Once they get into the battle gears, it's nearly impossible.<br/><br/>The battle sets are big. The rubble is impressive. However there is something old fashion about some of this. It doesn't have the feel of reality. There are too many wildly overacting ""shocking"" cliché moments. Everybody is yelling. The action is also not the best choreographed. It is still impressive that they actually stage them. Overall there are some good gritty bloody stuff going on but it gets undercut by a lot of clichés."

Characters wander around (German and Russian) bumping into one another again and again--as if the city and its environs didn't contain millions of people!<br/><br/>This movie's not in the same class as Das Boot, Der Untergang--or even Saving Private Ryan.

"gigan-92","10","2","4","10 July 2012"," ""The Best Thing About Cold Is"" A+
","To truly appreciate this movie, you must understand director Sergio Leone's quote regarding his film ""The God, The Bad, and the Ugly"" (1966):<br/><br/>""I had read somewhere that 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as Andersonville. I was not ignorant of the fact that there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners."" <br/><br/>I rank this one among the best war films I have ever seen. It details the horrific events of history's ugliest battle from its bloodiest war. The battle for Stalingrad left one million dead, and this brilliant movie shows it all from the point of view of the German Sixth Army. If you know history then you're aware of the fact that this loss for Germany was the first major blunder that would result in the ultimate downfall of the Third Reich. Fresh from their previous victories, the members of the Sixth Army believe they are in for a relatively easy win. However, as the fighting grows more turbulent, the city quickly becomes a hell populated by the piles of the dead. Of course, the suffering doesn't really commence till the Russian winter sets in.<br/><br/>Showing this gruesome conflict from the German point-of-view has many purposes. Firstly, to show just how quickly the tide of a military campaign can shift, even for a superpower. Secondly, it is easy for people of the modern era to forget the suffering on both sides. Soldiers have since the beginning of time been nothing more than the tools of politicians (regardless of the government) to cement their goals. The themes are quite relevant, and the story of these men a sheer tragedy. The production value is just stunning and you really are transported back to that time of old, the battle ruined streets of that city. And the score by Norbert Jürgen, Schneider and Martin Grassl is pretty awesome, ranging from bombastic to moments of brutal melancholy. It's definitely one of my favorite war film compositions.<br/><br/>Do not miss out on ""Stalingrad""."
"dimplet","10","2","4","22 June 2011"," War without the glory
","After watching dozens of documentaries and movies about World War II I realized I was missing the German viewpoint. <br/><br/>Movies and documentaries showing the German perspective realistically and objectively during World War II are far too rare outside of Germany; there is Das Boot and there is Stalingrad. <br/><br/>Perhaps misled by the title, one reviewer complained that Stalingrad did not show the Russian perspective. For that, short of a ""Midway"" type movie of dual nationality production, there are documentaries. But I think this movie gave some sense of the Russian experience. <br/><br/>I have already seen some documentaries on Stalingrad and the German invasion of Russia, so I understood what was going on here. At some point, you need some historical background, before or after watching it.<br/><br/>You can't expect any one movie to fully cover even a limited topic like the German-Russian battle in Stalingrad. Movies must focus. But they can also use this limited subject to convey some larger truths. That's what Stalingrad does.<br/><br/>Stalingrad is not about this particular battle. It is a proxy for the German soldier's experience in World War II. When all was going well, some were content to become the rulers of the world. But these were human beings, and Germany, before Hitler took over, was as civilized and cultured a country in the world. What were the soldiers thinking? How could they do it? Stalingrad attempts to answer these questions.<br/><br/>To say that ""Hollywood"" could not make a movie like Stalingrad is wrong, but this particular movie needed to be made by Germans. For anyone else to attempt to tell the story of the German experience would lack authenticity. We don't see the full, graphic German atrocities against the Russian people, though we see hints of it. And we see what happens to a German officer who protests. Protest too much and you won't be around to protest again. Don't shoot your victim in the firing squad, and next time you will be the victim. <br/><br/>But Stalingrad is not just about Nazi Germany's army. You could put a person of any nationality into this situation, and how differently would they behave? Not much. Why do any soldiers continue to fight for a cause and a leader they know to be wrong and insane? Sometimes they have no choice, but sometimes they really believe. <br/><br/>The old Germany was very authoritarian. The new Germany (and probably all of Europe) has been inoculated against such blind obedience. But how many other countries have an authoritarian streak? I see plenty in Asia and the Middle East. I can imagine certain countries dragging their military into war, and their soldiers obeying. <br/><br/>You want to see what war looks like, without the glory? Watch Stalingrad.<br/><br/>Stalingrad is a fine movie and a valuable contribution by Germany to understanding the war. But where are the German documentaries, produced with similar objectivity and honesty, available outside of Germany?"

"rvm-2","7","2","4","26 November 2000"," Good, though an incomplete statement
","This movie was well-done in achieving its apparent aim of showing how horrible the conditions were for the Germans in the battle of Stalingrad, and in the Russian winter in general. <br/><br/>My problem with this movie is that I think it wanted me to be sympathetic to the suffering of the German soldiers, but my knowledge of what they were fighting for prevented that. There is one scene where a soldier, Otto, heaps abuse on a general, who says ""I am not a Nazi"". Otto comments that it is perhaps worse that they, the generals, could see that Hitler is a madman and yet they dutifully support him, i.e. the sane must stand up to insanity. I think that reflects my feeling towards these characters: At some point you have to look at what you are doing and say ""this isn't right"", or ""why am I going into someone else's house to kill them"", though I know that certainly wasn't part of the German military culture, particularly under a Fascist regime, and certainly more difficult for the foot soldier to do. I have more sympathy for the youngest German soldiers, who might not have the maturity to pose such questions to themselves. I think the movie has value, therefore, in demonstrating the feeling of waste and pointlessness if you DON'T ask yourself questions about why you are killing. By not asking themselves the right questions about their invasion, they got death without any feeling of nobility in their cause. <br/><br/>I think my feeling towards the German soldiers in this movie were different than, say, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" because of who and what they were fighting for. Yes, Germans invaded France in WWI, and as invaders they also got what they deserved, but the nature of the cause would have been harder for the soldiers to determine, and thus answering their own question about why they did it more difficult. In ""AQotWF"", it was very clearly a nebulous cause, somewhat like Vietnam in that sense, but Germans in WWII had a clearer idea of who and what they were fighting for, and thus deserve less sympathy.<br/><br/>For such a long movie that looked at things from the point of the average soldier, I would have liked to have seen the exploration of these issues, perhaps by drawing the characters and plot a little better. For the most part in this movie, we just watch the soldiers suffer in various ways. This does have value is showing what war is, however.<br/><br/>Now, when are we going to get a good movie that tells things from the Russian point of view?  After all, they suffered the greatest losses (20 million dead on their own territory), which was all but invisible in this story. The Russians were also the ones who smashed most of Hitler's forces, and without whom the other Allies would never have succeeded (fortunately for all of us, Hitler went against the advice of his General Staff and started Barbarosa too late in the year, so the Russians were ""lucky"" in that respect). Now that the Cold War is over, I hope it's realistic to see a movie made that gives them the appreciation they deserve."

"fung0","8","0","0","6 August 2013"," Excellent drama, a bit light on the history
","It's hard to deny this is an excellent film. Impeccable acting, direction and photography create a powerful depiction of war at its most miserable, futile and degrading.<br/><br/>But I do think two mild criticisms need to be stated.<br/><br/>First, a movie titled ""Stalingrad"" ought to present at least some vague overview of that historical battle. Aside from a few confusing references to the wider tactical situation, this move sticks to a worms-eye view. After a while, you even have to wonder whether the travails of this particular group of soldiers are at all typical of the huge German force involved at the time. The film works as drama, but if you call it simply ""Stalingrad,"" I think you're promising a bit of historical context.<br/><br/>Second, the pace is a tiny bit over-drawn. In the last third of the film, I reached an atrocity overload, where further horrors had progressively less impact. I began to disconnect from the characters, remaining only mildly curious as to what agonizingly tragic ways would be found to dispatch them. A stronger dramatic hook is needed, to pull us through the admitted hopelessness of this last segment.<br/><br/>These are far from fatal flaws. It's more a question of balance. A bit more context, a slightly tighter narrative, and this could have been a masterpiece. As it is, I'd say it's a really excellent film, that does show - unforgettably - how war deadens the soul, even if it fails to kill the body.<br/><br/>Still, I have to hope that other filmmakers will one day present a broader view of the battle of Stalingrad. There's still lots of historical ground that needs to be covered, if future generations are to understand the madness that created this nightmarish conflict."

","I think Second World War has always been a favorite subject for Movie Making.<br/><br/>Ever since movies like Saving Private Ryan & Thin Red Line hit the big screen we have seen a series of new techniques to uphold the gritty images and the brutality of the War.<br/><br/>Past has always romanticized the subject on World War, pre Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Well we have seen so many movies from Hollywood which has always shown us the story from the Allies POV.<br/><br/>It was refreshing to see movies like 'Downfall' 'Stalingrad', because it really gave us some idea what it was like to be on the other side.<br/><br/>'Stalingrad' can be said as a War Drama, rather than only action oriented Movie.<br/><br/>More aspect has been given to the humane elements to make it more memorable. I think almost every one knows why Stalingrad had been so memorable name in the annals of History. This was the war which was considered to be the most bloody and brutal war of 21st Century. This is where Germans had started to lose the war and their complete 6th Army was annihilated.<br/><br/>'Stalingrad' starts with the story of a German company which gets redeployed from El Alamein Campaign (North Africa) to Stalingrad to push back the Russian Offense. We get introduced to some of the men who will be there through out the movie and we see the confrontation through their eyes. For the most part, the characters which was most unforgettable to me was the battle hardened Corporal Fritz Reiser (enacted by Dominique Horwitz) and the inexperienced idealistic Platoon Leader Lieutenant Von Witzland (brilliantly performed by Thomas Kretschmann).<br/><br/>As said earlier this Movie has only two major battle scenes, one happens within the Factory Compound at Stalingrad and the other one is a well portrayed Soviet Mixed Tank Infantry Offence on a prepared German Positions. Action scenes were well executed and since there was less amount of CGI it was realistic. Note this movie was five years prior to 'Saving Private Ryan' and taking into consideration that I would say the special effects were really good. For couple of times I have mentioned SPR* because I think when it comes to absolute realistic graphic violence SPR * has bench marked the Movie Industry how a War Movie should be depicted.<br/><br/>Overall this movie will be enjoyed by those who like Genre based on Second World War.<br/><br/>* Saving Private Ryan"

","Great Movie to get the other guys perspective. If you know German it's a little more interesting because the translation is not perfect. Sayings like ""leck mich am arsch"" was translated to ""asshole"" when it really means lick my ass. Nothing to profound. Wonder if the Russian's made a ""Stalingrad"" movie? Found out about this movie last year. Saw it at Barnes and Noble, then checked it out on IMDb. Ratings looked good and finally bought it. Nobody rents this movie. It was made in 1993? My son is that old. How did I miss this movie? I saw Das Boot in the theater. Did this movie play in US theaters? Anyway if anyone knows of other German, Russian, Italian, French, or Greek WWII movies please list them up."

","That's roughly the fatality score in the nastiest battle of WWII. Russia won and cracked the Wehrmacht in more ways than one at this turning point. Russia always had a higher body count, at least until near war's end, because they used their infantry as cannon fodder, and civilians added to the count. Russia could keep throwing bodies at the Germans, but the Germans couldn't sustain such a loss as the Russians finally pulled off a pincer movement of their own.<br/><br/>Although the battle includes entire armies, it is small unit action that is on the screen. Platoons and companies, sometimes a battalion. Except for a few recurring characters, largely anonymous actors come and go on the screen. This has been criticized but that is what large scale war is; an anonymous action of brutal firepower where combatants are routinely blown up, ripped apart and smashed. Survivors keep their sanity by a crude apathy about their fate, only occasionally breaking down when a foxhole buddy, a long-lived survivor finally gets eliminated. Such a loss is hard for them to take.<br/><br/>Stalingrad is not the goriest war movie I've ever seen but there's enough. The segment through the sewers was more disturbing for me to watch. Gah! I also think the horrible winter conditions were done well. All in all I'm very glad I've never had to suffer all the extreme hardships almost everyone there had to.<br/><br/>Almost everyone except the elite, of course. The movie just dances around that fact a bit, but the truth is even under the worst conditions the leadership managed to keep themselves relatively well cared for. General Paulus did not have to walk to Siberia; he became a showpiece for Stalin, and to his dying day cursed Hitler for not allowing him to retreat and save his men. Its a big What-if in history as how that might have changed the course of the war. As it was, only about 6,000 of the German POWs made it back alive after the war from this battle.<br/><br/>The movie has a detached feel to it which I think is deliberate, to give the sense of what war is like. But as a result, you don't feel engaged with the actors on the screen. I don't think Stalingrad has a high replay value. You get a taste of what such a bitter battle might be like, but who wants such a bitter experience more than once? It's a good movie to see once.<br/><br/>The DVD has both original German and English dub audio. I watched the subtitles because I wanted to hear the actors on the screen even if I didn't know what they actually all said. My subwoofer was silent and if anything came out of the surrounds I didn't notice. Almost no extras. The DVD is 7/10"

","The Battle of Stalingrad will always be known in Modern History , as the conflict that showed Germany the writing on the wall. The Eastern Front war of 1941-1945 was perhaps the most brutal war ever , in the field of arms and battle. Stalingrad and its aftermath left an indellible mark on both German and Russian psyche. The film was in no way a glorification of conflict and the actors and director showed great art in demonstrating the evil and tragedy that Stalingrad surely was in 1942-43. No punches were pulled on the death of soldiers , the scene where the German soldier is killed by a T34 shows that , only too well. The direction of the film , showed the political division between SS and Whermacht ,officers and soldiers alike.The SS were of course brutal and corrupt , but the director tried to display the ""ordinary"" soldier as brave and honourable...Im not suggesting that they were n't , but not having any experience of warfare of any kind , I can well imagine that war is and will always remain a brutalising experience...The Battle of Stalingrad more so. The film was and remains a German point of view in a deadly struggle and all-round was brilliant , except perhaps the ending. I think the director wasted his own , the actors and viewers time by using the last 3 soldiers valiant attempt at escape like he did. Stalingrad , a war film connosieurs definate recommendation."

","I was very excited when I first saw this movie on the shelf at the video store.  I am a history buff, and I love WWII films.  At last, I thought, they made a movie about the eastern front. How was it?  Fair.  It unfortunately has many shortcomings. The best scenes involve the mid stages of the battle, in the bombed out ruins of the city--although they don't explain to us that it was the Germans who bombed the city to ruins, making lots of places for Soviet soldiers and guerillas to hide.  The scenes of woundings and amputations in the improvised sewer hospital are quite horrifying, also. My problem with the movie is its lack of details of the campaign.  How did the German army get surrounded?  The Soviets launched Operation ""Uranus,"" but that is not explained in the film.  Hitler's stubborness and unwillingness to let his soldiers surrender is also not explored very well, and this is a very significant aspect of the battle of Stalingrad.  We also see the soldiers suffer, however, it is not done effectively enough.  The film also doesn't explain why the battle of Stalingrad was so important--this film could have been the same almost anywhere on the eastern front, during winter. If you're interested in the war, then you might as well see it.  Hopefully we will someday see a film from the Russian point of view of this battle."

","Since the Illiad, the theme of warfare epics is the objectification of the individual.  This one meets that requirement by making the viewer get to know a bunch of regular guys, moving from the stereotype hotshots pumped from their easy victories to just trying to survive a desperately hopeless situation.  And like so many (good) war movies, it shows how coming to terms with mortality can strip the bs away and let an individual be real.   <br/><br/>As to accuracy - the friend who dragged me into it despite my distaste for blockbusters - noted that they even had the different boot height of the officers vs enlisted men right.

","I had higher expectations before seeing this.  But at the end, it was just a sequence of battle scenes.  And the attempts of bringing poetics to the human drama just didn't look convincing.  Even the photography looked dull. Maybe it was the copy made into VHS videotape, or maybe it the dulling of the original Technicolor print, whose colors fade after several years.  But ""Full Metal Jacket"", whose battle scenes (specially the ones in an abandoned factory) really resemble some of the scenes in this motion picture, looks photographically and cinematographically much more convincing, attractive, engaging.  Also, the characters seem just too much alike one each other, very well shaven and clean cut.  I don't know the details of the siege, and maybe it is true that all german soldiers were required to be well shaven at all times, so I cannot comment on this seemingly unrealistic detail.  On the positive side, I enjoyed the multitude of languages spoken in the movie, German and Russian.  I also encourage the idea of having a war movie seen from the german soldier's perspective, something to think about in the overwelming multitude of American GI movies.  Have japanese film makers come to the point of making a movie in a lost battle where Japanese soldiers are decimated?  It could be interesting."

This film speaks about the potential trap of our own system when things go wrong and there is no way out at the level of the individual. This film is about  the character of Russia formed from the inhuman tundra in winter, and what it means to slowly freeze to death without shelter wandering a hostile wasteland in the darkness of winter. This film shows the inhuman coldness as a metaphor of our own blatant denial of our own individuality for the sake of professionalism and following orders- as much as for a lack of reason as for a mere lack of heat. This film shows the real victims of modern chivalrous warfare- defenseless civilians in their homes. This film shows a ragged bit of love crushed as a simple matter of course within this context, and that's more timely and far scarier than some chapter of military history.

","This movie tells us how the Battle of Stalingrad ends, but gives little indication as to why. In a real sense, the battle's outcome was determined even before it began. When Russia was first invaded, the Russians moved many of their strategic factories by railroad into far Easter Russia, out of danger from German aircraft. The factories were reassembled and began 24/7 production of war materials. Workers included men women and children, some very young, who labored up to two, or more, shifts a day. The Soviets amassed millions of first line troops troops as far away as Siberia, training and waiting for a counter offensive. Huge numbers of new tanks (notably the T-34) and airplanes were built and held in reserve. It would be only a matter of time until German armies crumbled before the Soviet might sweeping towards the Fatherland. In fact, Stalin repeatedly asked both Roosevelt and Churchill to open an second front so his armies could begin. He had to wait for over a year. The Russians had more and better food at Stalingrad than their enemy, and legend has it that each Russian soldier had two hot meals a day, with meat that was supplied by herds of sheep and cattle which followed the armies westward. Many of the troops (both men and women)were armed with automatic weapons. In Stalingrad, the Russians sharpened their shovels as weapons for hand-to-hand combat. The Germans, on the other hand, were poorly supplied over a long 2000 kilometer supply line, a line which was constantly interdicted at various points. Bolt-action rifles and fewer automatic weapons were the order of the day. Light-weight uniforms were miserable in the Russian winter. Food was scarce and miserable. The list goes on. Suffice it to say, the Germans violated too many rules of modern warfare.The major tragedy of Stalingrad, as indicated in this film, is that the German soldier had no knowledge of the Soviets's power, and little appreciation of their resolve. The major virtue of this movie is that the horror and suffering is well-illustrated. Even then the misery is understated. I recommend this film highly as a beginning for further study. In a real way, the history of the Battle of Stalingrad exceeds the drama of the movie."

The battle of Stalingrad, no doubt, is the bloodiest and most fierce battle in the history of mankind. And still, there has been made only two big movies about it: this one and ""Enemy at the gates"". Compare to the number of Vietnam-movies, and you'll see, that something is missing here. ""Stalingrad"" tries to capture a bit of the carnage as seen through the eyes of four german (not nazi, of course) soldiers. It doesn't really succeed. If you take a brilliant Vietnam movie like Apocalypse Now, it gives a much more vivid picture of what happends to ordinary men under extreme conditions. That is what war-movies should. Not just roaring battle-scenes, screams and explosions. But the way humans act, when they are confronted with something they cannot absorb. ""Stalingrad"" tries so hard to show the horror of the war, but since its characters are as one-dimensional and shallow as they are, we never really experience, what the ordinary german landser must have experienced in the cold, doomed city. If you want a good personal account of the war on the eastern front, read ""The forgotten soldier"" by Guy Sajer. If you want good history, reed Stalingrad by Anthony Beevor.

","I saw this movie upon its British release on a big cinema screen as its creators surely intended. It came with English subtitles and - although usually a hindrance - within 5 minutes I had forgotten. The dialogue was simple and terse. It was easy to keep reading apace with scene changes. That is something the French invariably forget. <br/><br/>It opens in Italy in the peaceful, barmy sunshine and the drunkenness of soldiers on extended leave. They are bawdy and crude like the crew of 'Das Boot', and I sometimes get the impression from both that vulgarity is used as a cheap substitute for more intelligent script. <br/><br/>The colours are beautiful. The clear blue sky finds even deeper shades of reflection in the sea. Italy is still untrammelled by allied assault and the towns are mellow and picturesque. But the movie is called 'Stalingrad', and you know this is the calm before the storm. <br/><br/>Their leave ended, the troops are shoe-horned into cattle trucks and head east. Through the soldiers eyes, the camera shows the unfolding landscape of conquered territories - the new lebensraum. They sneer at local peasants and sit in awe of endless flat vistas of the steppes. It's their land now; or so they think. <br/><br/>But the conquest has come to a grinding halt at the city of Stalingrad. And it's a battle that neither side can afford to lose. <br/><br/>The movie changes here. The sun is gone. The sky turns permanently leaden. Life assumes the military colours of rancid filth. The scenes of combat are hideously graphic. In one exchange a soldier is blown in half by a tank shell. His torso pleads briefly for help. The situation deteriorates and winter finally crushes what little life and hope is left. The disintegrating order is extremely harrowing. The makers have recreated its chaos and despair with astonishing conviction. <br/><br/>It is easy to moralise. The Germans got what they deserved. Or they were young men just obeying orders. And so on. <br/><br/>The suffering was indescribable, but Stalingrad was a necessary evil. It was here, if anywhere, that the third Reich broke its heart. If there had been a German victory, the Russians would have been expunged en masse. Heaven knows, as things were, Nazi murder squads slaughtered more than could be counted. And sooner or later, Hitler would have returned to the matter of that inconvenient little island just north of France. By then he might have had the atom bomb.<br/><br/>There has been a quiet attempt amongst some intelligentsia to rehabilitate the German people of this time. As if their suffering justified recognition, and from recognition - sympathy. We see a similar presentation in 'Das Boot', where submariners are ultimately depicted as victims - victims who sent thousands of ships and merchant sailors to the bottom of the sea, cheering as they did so and boasting about the 'happy times' before Britain developed effective counter-measures and paid them off in the same coin. <br/><br/>However tragic the war for the German people and their armed forces in defeat, any prospect of their victory would have been a calamity too great to contemplate.<br/><br/>Those who watch Stalingrad and feel an up-welling of compassion for its idealistic and doomed young Germans, should watch 'The Holocaust' afterwards. That wicked people feel pain doesn't make them any less wicked."

Despite Hollywood's attempt to re-write history, 5 out of 6 German soldiers were actually killed by Russians (mostly in this very battle) and one perished every 7 seconds on the horrific 'Eastern Front'. Stalingrad the movie, captures one of the bloodiest battles known to man and where no prisoners were taken (on both sides). Now I have seen this masterpiece in a subtitled format, I can securely award the ten it deserves.

","Any movie set in World War Two which depicts German soldiers as being just like any other soldiers in the war is at best naïve if not downright ridiculous. This movie is the German version of Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan. It is an attempt to depict the war from the German soldier's perspective. The problem is that despite the excellent acting and the harrowing story, the movie fails to generate any empathy or sympathy for the principal characters, all of whom are invaders. They suffer, yet it is suffering that the brought on themselves as representatives of Hitler. This factor cannot be ignored. It's too bad that the these soldiers went through a grinder, but they did it to themselves. Unlike the German soldiers in All Quiet on the Western Front, for whom the futility of their suffering and their alienation generates real sympathy, the German soldiers depicted in this movie do not deserve an iota of respect. That the movie does a great job of depicting the battle from the front line soldier's perspective is commendable, but the movie comes up empty as dramatic story because we already know the ending, and it's not heroic."

","Stalingrand of 1993 is among the many interpretations of this famous Battle of the Second World War and It is the best of them all. It has it all and it also quit accurate in portraying the fight around ,in and below the ground in the city as well as avoiding to glorify it ,but going directly to the meat of the case : The hell that it was and the suffering of the Soldiers in the front lines.<br/><br/>As is the standard, the movie follows a platoon of German which is send to the city in order to help in the capture of the city and all of them soon release that this is not going to be walk in the park for the Soviet resistant is fierce and almost from the first minutes of combat you think ""The crew doesn't waste any time , they go straight to the front lines. Awesome"". The reason why I love this quick transition is that , from the title we all know what will happen and so we naturally expect to see the brutality of war and thankfully Joseph Vilsmaier ,the director, and his team also get that and their efforts are focused to make the fight intense, be accurate of the sake of the period and make the characters ,nice dudes, in order to care if they survive or die. You that feeling it is the same when you are watching Game of Thrones and we get that here ;).<br/><br/>To focus on the accuracy of the film ,I was surprised for a lot of effort it was put in it and the costume ,the weapons and the setting is as close as it gets. For that to happen among the actors, the writers, the director's team and producers, it was also a military consultant in aid with the re-enactment. Man I like it when I see a film crew try it best to recreate a historical period and even if something goes south, you still will appreciate the final product due to the obvious effort ,which is put in it. <br/><br/>Now as wrote before ,thet flick focuses on the struggles of a single platoon and its members, that focus works to the films favor for when you dealing with a historical subject ,is always better to start with something simple and fuse it in the era. Simply put make the story to fit the era and not the other way around. For although this film isn't a biography (so we can call a historical fiction!) the production, the story and the dialogues are made with the final goal to represent the battle of Stalingrand faithfully.<br/><br/>Closing the film is definitely worth watching as a war film, history film and with a good amount of action, so it has the maximum appeal. And the 2013 Stalingrand is a abomination which puts shame to a fight which claim the lives of 1.5 to 2 million people."

","It is film where the greater political propaganda is put aside and humanity, or the destruction thereof, is put on centre stage. It is realist in that there is nothing heroic about any characters, and certainly no intention to impress anyone with action scenes. There is only depiction of the dire daily reality for those on the front line fighting- in between buildings to buildings, underground sewage system, and bunkers, the propagated cause for fatherland is replaced with confusion, disillusion, famine, death, and desperation. Soon it becomes clear that the real enemy is not those who on the other side of the front line, but the few elites that feed on the massive sacrifices of their own people. This message is delivered without making the film a strong political critique. <br/><br/>This film provides a perspective from the defeating side, where, for those who were trapped and abandoned thousands kilometers away from home, fate was collectively decided on the day they received order to march to Stalingrad. I recommend it to people who want to have a real taste of war and are open to a different point of view."

One, as an American, history is very much taught in this country from an American point of view. That may not be a bad thing, but it leaves us with the impression that America won World War II. That is true in the general sense, but it was the Soviet Union that defeated Hitler. The Americans were much more involved with Japan. So to have films that focus on Russia during World War II is always good.<br/><br/>But two, it is interesting to see films like this come out of Germany. You walk a fine line. Obviously, you want to be proud of your country and part of that is being proud of military victories. But, at the same time, you don't want to praise the Nazi regime or suggest that what they did was right. How you promote the bravery of soldiers without endorsing their fight is tough, but this film seems to make a serious effort at doing so."

No wars for justice, no wars for peace. Wars are all meat-grinder, human butching monsters. In this German masterpiece the filmmakers put everything on the scene to show us, to frighten us...There are no one-man-deals-all heroes, no good fellows, no bad guys. Everybody's suffering for nothing...The main characters are no action-movie heroes; just a branch of man trying to get along with the reality. They slowly weaken in number, as there's clear from the beginning: no solution, no way out for them. Once they try to break out, try to escape, but they don't succeed, and finally die as most of them at the outskirts of Stalingrad. The fight for life reaches the absurdity at the end, so they must fail. Might a Hollywood product make at least one of them to reach safety, and get safe and sound in the warmth of home, this movie stays at the realities. In real wars no heroes. All of participating in battles, either soldiers or civilians are flesh-and-blood persons, can be hurt, can die and suffer all the time, as could everyone of us do.

","The movie is a very realistically filmed account of four German soldiers in a Pioneer unit.  Watching the film, with its well researched uniforms and equipment, well laid out sets, convincing dialogue, and (in the subtitled version) use of the German language, one can almost believe they are watching the real thing.<br/><br/>Minor uniform quiffs aside (the summer uniforms are obvious East German standins, the helmets don't have the proper rivets), there are a few cliches thrown in.  The evil officer (who by his uniform is not in the same unit as the main characters, yet shows up again and again, stretching credulity) is just one example.  The gratuitous addition of the woman in the closing scenes is another (was she really necessary to the plot and/or representative of German experiences in Stalingrad?)<br/><br/>The combat scenes, however, are properly terrifying, and the characters act believably.  They are human and likable despite the uniform they wear. Perhaps that is the real accomplishment of this film.  A couple of ""war movie cliches"" shouldn't mar anyone's enjoyment of a powerful movie that teaches how universal suffering is."

Why not make it a glamorous affair? The reality was that many German soldiers fought on not just in places like Stalingrad but Kursk, Normandy, and Caen despite the knowledge that they were doomed. Hell award a Waffen-SS officer the Knights Cross on-screen for saving his unit in action then sit back and wait for the media to gasp. Yes, Stalingrad was a meat grinder but so what? So was the bombing of Berlin.. by day the Americans by night the British. No one is choosing sides here, WW2 is over.<br/><br/>This movie is another back-biting, defeatist attitude, apathetic portrayal of Germans during WW2. The Leutnant in this film is a spectre of the Kapitan of U-96 in ""Das Boot"". He too was clean cut and spit shined in the begining and in the end is a dirty shamble. The main characters in this film could have all served on board ""Das Boot"" for that matter with the exception of the Polizie officer, not SS to another poster. Also this film was not shot by Wolfgang Peterson it was produced by the same producer of ""Das Boot"" and they tagged it that way to make money off the popularity of ""Das Boot"".<br/><br/>I also agree that the film was incorrectly lighted and a much more dramatic effect could have been achieved had they lowered the lighting. If I ever get the chance to make a war film I will not make the mistakes this film made and I will definitely not be cliche in my portrayal of the German soldier."

For some reason this film doesn't reflect the gigantic scale of the conflict or the issues involved, despite the horrifically realistic battle-scenes.<br/><br/>While I can understand the film-makers wanting us to identify with a specific group of soldiers to make the story understandable on a human level, only the scenes of crowds at Pitomnik airfield queuing for the last flight out of the doomed city to show us that a quarter of a million men were in the same position.<br/><br/>The film takes a purely German viewpoint. The men depicted here, however, don't take part in 'cleansing' Stalingrad of Jews and Communists, don't evict peasants from their homes leaving them to freeze on the steppe, and don't take souvenir photographs of death-squads at work, all activities indulged in by German troops. These soldiers are tragic figures, caught in events not of their making.<br/><br/>Their enemy is largely invisible. The efforts of the Russians to hang on to the slightest strip of Stalingrad, ferrying troops back and forth through pack ice in the frozen Volga under German artillery and machine gun fire is never depicted. Taking this view, both groups were equally victims: the Germans of Hitler's crazed desire to take 'Stalin's city', the Russians of Stalin's ruthless determination to deny the prize.<br/><br/>By failing to show the scale of the battle, and in its one-sided view of those involved, the film is diminished and fails to live up to the promise of its subject."

","Having seen the film, read other people's comments and read Anthony Beevor's excellent book, I think it is fair to say that ""Stalingrad"" is an accurate depiction of the famous battle. It ignores a wider focus and instead concentrates on a group of German soldiers, which has the effect of making the film more personal. Although it is arguable that more background of the battle should have been provided, it is fair to say that the basic premise of the film, e.g. a lot of soldiers went there and never came back, makes a refreshing change to a lot of Hollywood films which get bogged down in sentimentality (the second half of Saving Private Ryan is a good example of this).<br/><br/>The only real flaw is that some of the acting and bits of the script aren't absolutely stunning (but then again if one is lying in rubble and bleeding to death, is a magnificent speech the first thing that comes to mind?).

","Europeans love to talk up this film as a great WWII spectacle- so I got tired of some posters on this board lauding it as the greatest war film ever, and decided to actually buy it and see what all the hype was about<br/><br/>So what's really going on here? First of all, it is a good WWII film. There is a lot of good action here, good production values, and a good film altogether<br/><br/>At the same time, people give this film way too much credit- What I don't like: 1) It follows the tired ""All Quiet on the Western Front""/""Cross of Iron"" etc genre where-by all German grunts are noble warriors (except for token bad-seed suck-up NCO) led by evil officers, and are slain one-by-one as the situation deteriorates 2) The Germans are portrayed too positively. Sure, many German soldiers in WWII were good people- I'm not debating that- but this movie really seems to propogandize things and make all of the German grunts look like good people that wouldn't want to terrorize the Stalingrad residents. That is naive to say the least 3) There isn't a lot of action. Budget constraints maybe? C'mon- we're talking the meat-grinder that was Stalingrad- at the height of the fighting the Germans were taking 20,000 KIA a week (and the Russians were probably taking more)- yet this is more of a drama than an action movie, and that doesn't sit well with war-mongers like me.

","While certainly the movie had quite a lot of promise, I have to say that I was a tad bit disappointed by the plot. The entire movie just seems to consist of cobbled-together pieces from the book ""Enemy at the Gates"" by William Craig. While the later picture of that title concentrated on just one episode of the book, this movie tries to cram it ALL in. Basically every scene is taken from the book and as I had read it prior to watching the film, I was quite disappointed. There certainly was enough tragedy in this, one of the bloodiest battles of WW2, without having to try to make the protagonists live through EVERY single publicised part of it. To me, it was simply overkill. Perhaps if I had not known the book beforehand (I have a copy of the original, not the reedition for the Jude Law flic and read it before seeing either film), I would have appreciated the movie more. Concentrating on one facet of the struggle (as the later ""Enemy at the Gates"" did) might have made me feel more for the characters instead of thinking ""hey, I know this from somewhere"" all the time as I actually did with this one, unfortunately. To me, ""Die Bruecke"" and ""Das Boot"" still rank supreme, as far as German efforts to portray the Second World War are concerned. Those movies actually made me feel for the characters and wish that a situation such as they were in would never occur again."

It is a great example of how the army generals, the heads of the state rest in their homes and give directives to do this and that, and see it all is some sort of sacred and holy undertaking, but on the battlefield it is bloody, it is scary and not to be glorified in the first place.<br/><br/>The film is a very sad one.... It hits you with reality. It revolves around soldiers who are tired of the nonsense, want to go home, be with their families and are looking for ways and excuses to escape from the horror. Their conscious does not bother them, it does not call them cowards, for above all they are humans first, like us, they do not want to be killed and tortured, they do not want to play with blood all the time. This is the reality, heroes-like soldiers is greatly imaginary. The ending scene where they die in the cold is one of the saddest scenes that I have ever watched. It had such sever after-effects on me that I thought of this all night.

As with the battle, the film itself does not have a happy ending. And that's the way it should be.

","This is not a good film. It lacks the precise imagination needed to reinvent history and make it look real. Everything here has been done before in other movies, and usually much better. The gotterdamerung street battle in the first half looks like parts of APOCALYPSE NOW, over-lit, garish, and literally over-orchestrated, carried along by constant music. (Coppola, of course, was making a point about Viet Nam which is hardly relevant here.)<br/><br/>The sewers sequence adds nothing to this sub-genre. How effective this scene could have been if the characters had just been illuminated by small flames, and then, when one of them gunned a flame-thrower, suddenly the vast cavern would be revealed in a brief glimpse. But, no, the sequence is totally floodlit in rainbow colors, like a Pennsylvania cave tour. How thoughtful of the Stalingrad city council to fully light all their sewers!<br/><br/>The significance of the battle of Stalingrad is that more soldiers died in this battle than any other; one million Russians died, and the entire German Army of 400,000 was wiped out. Yet here we have the impression that the battle was fought by a small group; everywhere they go the protagonists seem to meet the same people. It particularly strains credulity that the Russian girl they meet in the sewers shows up later. In this respect (and others) it's reminiscent of THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, a massive operation reduced on film to a cavalry mission. It seems odd that in a battle where an entire army perished, the emphasis in the end is on two people alone on a vast landscape.<br/><br/>Another troubling thing is that though the German army is surrounded, apparently getting out and returning home is an option if one wants to ""crap out.""<br/><br/>The film shows little imagination, and repeats all the standard dramatic tricks of other war films (both in the action sequences and the interminably talky ones), which results in the failure of the filmmakers' expressed purpose, to show that there is no glamour of war by choosing as their subject a battle with massive casualties."

The truth is that far too few, almost none German soldiers at all turned their backs on the Nazis.

"Li-1","Null","3","23","26 July 2003"," Stalingrad fails on almost every level it intends.
","* out of ****<br/><br/>Joseph Vilsmaier's Stalingrad poses an interesting question: do laughably bad battle sequences ruin an anti-war film? The answer, it depends. Battle scenes take up only a small portion of Stalingrad's running time (two sequences, adding up to just under fifteen minutes total), so these cheesy segments alone can't really bring the film down to complete garbage. But considering how the film fails on every other level, the battle scenes are really just another icing on the cake that dooms Stalingrad as a war film debacle.<br/><br/>The story is pretty basic and does little to distinguish itself from most war movies out there. We follow a German platoon as they head into Stalingrad, and follow them through each deadly situation they encounter. Each of these men begin as respectable citizens, but by the end, virtually lose their grip on humanity. Actually, the title might mislead some viewers who think they're going to be seeing a film about the bloody battle of Stalingrad. Like Enemy at the Gates (a mediocre but superior production), the city is used as a backdrop for the catastrophic tides of war.<br/><br/>What's wrong with the movie? Okay, just for a moment, ignore the fact that the violence looks like something out of a 60's spaghetti western (the gore wounds look like rubber, the bullet wounds actually sometimes spew sparks instead of blood, so on and so forth). Now we focus on all the other scenes, which as some viewers have noted, are meant to create a hopeless, downbeat feeling. But director Vilsmaier has yet to learn that for such a depressing edge to work, you have to populate your film with three-dimensional characters that are worth caring for, and Stalingrad has none (keep in mind, one guy comes close).<br/><br/>Stalingrad displays virtually none of the same qualities as immeasurably superior character-driven war films such as The Killing Fields or Gallipoli, though it certainly aspires to. The acting is second-to-third-rate, with characters who do little to define and differentiate themselves from everyone else. Let's see, there's the up-and-coming Lieutenant, the Guy Who's Afraid His Wife is Cheating on Him, and a few other guys who make zero impressions. The actor who plays the Lt., Thomas Kretchsmann, comes close to creating a genuine persona, but he's hampered by a screenplay that replaces real personalities with cliches. <br/><br/>Stalingrad features many other terrible aspects, such as the cheap and obvious sets, the grating musical score, and the general feeling that this is a movie, and not a genuine, harrowing experience, probably the most damning flaw the film bears. Rarely for a moment did I actually feel I was in the the thick of the war-torn city streets or the snow-covered tundras, a detachment caused by all the problems I listed throughout the entire review.<br/><br/>
Despite all that's incredibly wrong with the film, the conclusion almost works. The ending alone, a horrifying display of how seemingly inescapable the second world war was, almost creates visceral emotion on the basis of just how cruel and ironic it is (once again, could have been even more effective with great characters)(see Gallipoli for a truly nightmarish, heartbreaking finale). It's during these last few moments that, finally, Vilsmaier shows a competent hand at direction and shows us what he intended the whole time. It's just too bad it took over two hours to get there, and the trip beforehand isn't worth it."

","I saw this film on video around 1995. Since it was by the director of ""Das Boot"", i was expecting the tension and drama of that aforementioned film - unfortunately i was incredibly dissapointed - poor plot, poor acting, and poor attention to historical detail. I honestly turned the film off half way through, and then thought to myself ""Hell, its an intelligent film - i should watch it again"" - i did, and i watched it right through the next day - with exactly the same opinion intact - i.e. it's really a big letdown. This could have been Germany's (since it directed by a German) BIG apology to the rest of the world for what they did in Russia. Instead I got melodrama, and a boring plot. What i was looking for only appeared later on in Saving Private Ryan - what a missed opportunity. This could have been a masterpiece..... If i were you , i would wait until the hollywood version of ""Stalingrad"" comes out (it's currently being filmed)....<br/><br/>Sorry guys - Das Boot was superb, but you really messed this one up..."

","Overall, I was not very thrilled with this movie. I expected a heart-wrenching, teeth-clenching movie. But what I got was a melodramatic film with little tension, violence that did not move me, and a plot that was erratic, at best. There were a few nice battle scenes, and I enjoyed the opportunity to see the Eastern Front from the German perspective, but I wanted a deeper film. One problem was the decision to make the film with an ensemble cast and never focusing on a single protagonist. The German Lieutenant in the film may be considered the protagonist, but he's not even featured on the cover of the video. ""Saving Private Ryan"" focused on Tom Hanks even though it was an ensemble cast. ""Platoon,"" also an ensemble cast, focused primarily on Charlie Sheen. I didn't feel like ""Stalingrad"" put me in the war because there wasn't any single person I could identify with. I recommend the film for historians, film fans, and militeria buffs, but for everyone else, rent or buy ""Das Boot"" if you want a better war film from the German perspective."

"arouet","Null","1","8","25 July 2002"," Truth or Revisionism
","I saw this and I was very disturbed, in a strange way.  It's not that it is not well-done, and historical in a sense.  But to me, and this is my opinion, it's a propaganda film to try to humanize the Germans and try to make us feel sorry for them.  The Germans, who attacked Russia and planned to starve millions of them!<br/><br/>It's true that many portrayals of Nazi Germany portray them as ""complete evil"" and not even human.  It has swung to such an extreme, the Nazi's have almost become a cartoon cliche and when you see the boots and uniforms, you can become detached from their humanity and it can alienate you from the fact that these are real people.  It makes them nonhuman and that can be a great peril because they are so evil, it can make you think that the danger is past and cannot come again.  So I am not for a total ""evil incarnate"" image of the Germans- I'm not talking Hitler- there may have been people who were AS evil as Hitler, but I surely don't think there's ever been someone who has been MORE EVIL - and surely he's the most evil man who ever held the power to back it up.  But I'm talking about the Army itself and while I said I'm for allowing these soldiers to have human emotions, IN THIS FILM, instead of the extreme of robotic evil, it SWINGS the entire other way and tries to convince people that instead, they were a good people in bad circumstances.  There's no middle ground here, I saw.  The characters I saw here simply CANNOT BE this innocent and while I think it's possible for them to have some of the qualities, I find it IMPOSSIBLE they have ALL OF THEM which are presented in  this movie.  I'll elaborate with examples-<br/><br/>I guess there are spoilers here, so don't read if you don't want them. The soldiers are shown to do all of this:<br/><br/>1.  When they come across a Russian boy, they actually give him bread to eat because they feel sorry for him.<br/><br/>2.  When this same boy is supposed to be shot, the soldiers shoot him but in a heart-tugging scene, you would think they are horrified at it.<br/><br/>3.  They are honorable to women.  There is a Russian women who gets raped, and a gentle soldier demands that no one touch her.<br/><br/>4.  They simply don't agree with this war and try any means to get out.<br/><br/>5.  They cry, they talk about their mothers and fathers, they are kind to many people.<br/><br/>Maybe some of these things happened, but it seems to me, knowing what we know of the Germans and Stalingrad, that ALL these qualities could be embodied in the same men is dubious, at best. If so, it has be an anomaly of epic proportions.   It could be a compilation of different memories, but c'mon!  There's no middle ground here!  I realize the film wants the audience to see the German Army as human beings, but they go too far in painting a white picture with no shades of black.  I'm sure, the film-makers want to change people's opinions of the Germans during this time, and I'm not saying there weren't man like this.  But give me a break!"
"getjeffery","Null","1","10","5 November 2000"," An embarrassment.
","This movie is a slap in the face to Russia.  The entire movie is from the perspective of a few German soldiers in the hands of war.  The film portrayed these men as simply doing their duty and at first proud of their rape of Russia but by the end of the film, they were crying to go home.  The film's dark success was that by its end, I found myself feeling somewhat sorry for these men, which were feelings that were not welcome.  I will never watch this film again. If you are one that is not so offended by sympathy to the plight of German aggression, you will still not find this film rewarding.  The history was weak and the pace somewhat dull.  It is not a bad war movie, it is simply 'average' and in very poor taste."
"scobbah","5","1","14","15 May 2004"," Another b-war action from Germany
","Here we go again with another b-war action from Germany. It features the war and conflict of Stalingrad during the WW2, and I presume it requires germans to do it, to get rid of the ""constant-always english talking germans and russians"". Here we are presented to screaming russians, bloody  coats of germans, evil generals and hungry civilians. It starts out a little bit too slow and weak, but as I started to feel dizzy and tired about the piece itself, it slightly developed into some more action-filled story with combat scenes in Stalins pearl in the Sovjet Union, Stalingrad.<br/><br/>If you don't have anything better to do and you like war with effects who's less expensive than effects in other war movies, such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", well then I'll guess you can give it a shot. 4/10"

They even had the nerve to portray Soviets as dumb combatants with no sense of military tactics.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, it's a poor attempt to make viewers try to sympathize with the plight of German soldiers. It wasn't believable and felt forced most of the way through. Save yourself the time and just watch a WW2 documentary series instead."

"jeremy3","8","0","2","18 February 2019"," No One Gets Out Alive
","You can tell this is not a Hollywood movie. It did not have a happy ending. A unit of 400 German soldiers is reduced to zero in a hopeless situation at Stalingrad (Volgagrad), Ukraine. An idealistic young officer tries to point out the injustices caused by other German officers against Russian civilians and soldiers, but the higher command accuses him of being against the war effort. They hint that the only reason he is not arrested and shot is because his father is an important person. The German soldiers go through an unimaginable hell. All die hopelessly, tragically, and painfully. It is hard for any movie to come close to the horrors of war, but this film does about as good a job as possible. It is not too long before the German soldiers discover that they will never make it back home to Germany again. There is no escape, and the winter is another harsh factor. It is hundreds of miles through barren lands that make Midwest winters look tame. The Russian soldiers and Ukrainian people are seen as victims of the war just as much.<br/><br/>Unlike many Hollywood movies, where there is a happy ending this movie has no consolation as every single one of the soldiers of the original 400 is doomed to die. The majority of soldiers are just ordinary folk led by fanatical and terrified officers. In the end, the powerful officers are reduced to starving, shivering animals themselves with no hope of escape. The only knock I have on this movie, because it was focused on the point of view of the German soldier, is that nothing was shown about how Communism was even worse. Stalin was a complete monster. The reason why the Russian boy who was captured is so silent is because Stalin killed any soldiers who had contact with Germans. Stalin claimed that he himself was responsible for winning the war. Stalin was just a coward who was protecting himself. It was the people who were the real winners of the war. Just to show how vile a person Stalin was. A Jewish prisoner who survived the concentration camps was arrested by the Soviets, accused of being infected by Germanism, and sent to a Siberia camp.<br/><br/>Still, this movie is in the tradition of realistic European films. One feels true sadness for the inhumanity of the whole war. Everyone is a victim of a mad situation where no one comes out alive. In the last scene, the last surviving soldier freezes to death in the open fields of snow and winds."
"imseeg","8","0","1","13 November 2018"," Dark, depressing portrait of the defeat of the german army at Stalingrad.Good at depicting the utter destructiveness of war. Bad at portraying the German war crimes.
","Beware: The german movie ""Stalingrad"" (1993) must not be confused with identical titles, yet different movies from 2013, 2003 and 1990. Dialogues, photography and acting in the german ""Stalingrad"" from 1993, are good, although not superb. ""Stalingrad"" is a very impressive portrait of the utter destructiveness of war though. One of the better war movies I have seen in the past decades!<br/><br/>""Stalingrad"" is (thankfully) NOT a crowdpleasing action movie. It as bleak and depressing as it gets. As it should be, because any war movie that glorifies violence is like watching a fairytale. ""Stalingrad"" is true to life though, in the depicting of the demoralizing horrific consequences of war, but it is bad at showing the German war crimes in its full colors, because this story is told from a german standpoint of view. And that shows.<br/><br/>Looking at this movie from a historical point of view it is noteworthy that the german soldiers in this war movie are being portrayed rather positive by the german filmddirector.Not at all a balanced view, because the german soldiers were THE NR 1 cause of 2 million people who were slaughtered at Stalingrad. And if they werent being directly slaughtered by the germans, they would have died of starvation, caused by that same german army.<br/><br/>But this unbalanced positive portrait of german soldiers doesnt make it a bad war movie though, on the contrary. I must admit that this is one of the better war movies I have ever seen during the past decades. Why? Because there are only a few war movies that DONT glorify war violence. And after seeing ""Stalingrad"" one definitely does NOT wanna glorify war ever again. Stanley Kubricks ""Full Metal Jacket"" is another example of a classic ""anti-war"" movie. I felt sick of any sort of violence after watching ""Stalingrad"". For that specific reason I recommend this war movie very much..."

It may frighten American/British viewers not used to subtitles, but do not miss it because of that.
It has among the greatest younger generation of German actors in their early roles before Hollywood careers (Thomas Kretschmann!).
This really brings out the futility of this campaign and focuses mainly on the Wehrmacht, not psychotic Waffen SS-stereotypes.<br/><br/>It is painful to watch, yes, mostly focused on a platoon, certain character portraits from the German side, not the Russian side, but is in no way glorifying or justifying the Nazi ideology.

It's a true account of the horrors that these soldiers were faced with and makes it abundantly clear to the viewer how much of a tragedy this whole situation really was. The film is shown from the German soldiers point of view, and shows the world exactly what Adolf Hitler did to his soldiers. This film makes it clear that a tragedy like this never should have been allowed to happen, and leaves the viewer saddened and disgusted that it really did happen. It leaves the viewer well aware of how inhumane, selfish, careless, and out of reality Adolf Hitler was by this time. This film has it all for a war movie.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","1","21 July 2015"," Positive surprise
","Let me start this review by saying that I am generally not too big on war films. I am pretty interested in politics though, but the depiction of actual battle scenes has never done too much for really. Luckily, this film is more than that. During its over 2 hours it does not only show bloody fights, but also delivers pretty good character evaluations and a smart approach to the idea of how to depict the very well-known fact that war is evil. This is about the battle of Stalingrad, maybe the most known battle in World War II, because it basically destroyed Germany's hopes of winning the War. ""It"" is the Russian winter in this case and the fact that German soldiers just weren't ready to deal with the heavy climate conditions. A bit of an irony that it happened right at the city that is named after the Russian leader at that time. But lets get back to the film. The director is Joseph Vilsmaier and at least people with an interest in German films should know him. He has worked in film since the very early 1970s and was also a co-writer with a couple other guys for this film here. The cast includes some known names, but nobody really where you would say ""oh it's him"". The most known of these today, almost 25 years later is probably Sylvester Groth. The only significant female character is played by Vilsmaier's wife Dana Vavrova, who sadly died far too young from cancer. This is certainly one of Germany's best (anti-)war films and if you appreciate the genre more than I do, you may actually have a pretty great time watching this one. The acting is fine, the character are relatable and memorable and it's really well done by Vilsmaier so that we can watch a credible tale of how they were not only struggling with their enemies, but also with other people in the German army and as a whole with their lives (as soldiers) in general. Thumbs up."

I guess the crazy idea was to join with advancing Japanese armies somewhere in India. Idiotic and crazy! Just as Hitler was. Idiotic and crazy!

","This is a worthwhile movie and I have it on DVD in original German/Russian with subtitles. That certainly creates a certain atmosphere. I have also got Anthony Beaver's excellent historical book on the Battle Of Stalingrad. I understand what the Director was trying to do with the movie; the whole men are just men, the inhumanity of man, there are no winners in war etc. but to me the film didn't seem to quite know whether it wanted to be a depiction of the battle or an anti-war morality tale. It's called ""Stalingrad"" but Stalingrad is really just a stage set where the ""Band of Brothers"" theme can be played out. Some have said Enemy at the Gates is a better movie; I would say it is a complementary movie and between both movies we get a strong feel for what it must have been like to have been there and died. On a more general level I have the view that Cross of Iron is the best movie I have seen on the war on the Eastern Front while Downfall remains for me the best war movie of all. But put those 4 together and you have IMHO an comprehensive package regarding Hitler's folly in Russia."

","I have studied the battle for Stalingrad for some time and this film presents I think a realistic depiction of the trials experienced by the german foot soldiers in that battle. Hitler had a grudge against communism and Joseph Stalin in particular, so he wanted to capture his name-sake city as a special prize. The lessons of the previous winter defeat in the attack on Moscow were not learned. <br/><br/>The fact that the actors in this movie are not known by the north american audience adds to the mood; the anonymous pathetic front line combatant takes the brunt of the ambitions of egotistical power mad political elite. It is not an exageration that women were fighting on the side of the Russians. I was fortunate enough to find the DVD version in a pawn shop. It includes an optional dubbed english track. It was interesting to see how the subtitles diverged from the dubbing during some of the more 'earthy' sections of dialog.<br/><br/>If you like war movies then you will enjoy this presentation."
