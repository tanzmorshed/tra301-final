","Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is a male nurse, poised to propose to the woman he loves, Pam (Teri Polo) but the right thing to do would be to ask her father's permission first.

Her father (Robert De Niro) isn't quite what Greg has been led to believe, and right from the start he seems to have it in for his daughter's partner.<br/><br/>De Niro and Stiller play off each other brilliantly, and both of them give fine comic performances, with a surprising level of depth for comedy characters.

","Haha this is one of those comedies that you will always remember. Full of classic lines that my wife and I constantly use on daily bases, like ""if it has teat then you can milk it, puff the magical dragon, the circle of trust and so on..."" Meet The Parents is full of those phrases that makes me laugh every time I think about it. And that's what defines a good comedy to me. If I watch a comedy I want to laugh and with this one it's what you get. Some people might not like it but then to me they just don't have a sense of humor and that's just a pity for them. You have to like Ben Stiller though because it's basically him that is the great comedian of the movie. If you don't like him you probably not going to like the movie either. Like I don't like the movies with Adam Sandler. I think that guy is not funny and so his comedies are painful to watch for me. In Meet The Parents the whole story is basically about the relation between Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro that plays his role brilliantly as well by the way. The other actors are good as well but it's not them that carry the movie. To me it's already a classic movie when I think about the best comedies I ever saw."
"MovieAddict2016","9","61","87","11 April 2003"," Very funny - but the real strength of the film is being able to relate to the characters
","Our story begins when a male nurse named Greg Focker (Stiller) is about to propose to his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo); unfortunately, things come to worst and before Greg can say, ""Will you marry me?"" he finds out that Pam's father, Jack (Robert De Niro) approved of Pam's sister's fiancé because he asked Jack's permission to marry her first. Taken aback, Greg decides to wait until tomorrow, whence they are going to meet Pam's parents, and ask Jack for approval before proposing to Pam. Should be a piece of cake, right? Wrong. Pam's mother (Blythe Danner) is very nice, but herein lies the problem: Not only is it apparent from the start that Pam's plant-expert father is not really a plant-expert (as Greg learns after Jack doesn't seem to recognize a plant Greg gives to him--one of the rarest plants in the world), but it turns out Jack is really in the CIA and was a ""human lie detector,"" as Pam herself puts it. In fact, Jack even gives Greg a lie detector test in one scene to see if he liked the dinner earlier in the evening. ""Yes,"" Greg replies, to see the needle jumping. ""Well, it was a little rare for my tastes, maybe."" Greg, desperately seeking approval (and nervous as ever), seems to unintentionally cause mayhem in his possible parents-to-be's home. Nerves shot like a drug addict, Greg is the definition of a nervous wreck, and all his problems seem to escalate more and more until a funny-if-sappy comedic showdown.<br/><br/>You know how sometimes you are really nervous, but try to hide the fact? You seem to keep your cool, until you do something, then all your nervousness explodes and you start knocking over things, saying stupid things--single-handedly DOING stupid things that you just never do? And then you look around and everyone is looking at you like you are some sort of freak? Well, that's how it is with Greg's character in ""Meet the Parents""--he is so easy to identify with. Just like all of us, we want to keep our cool and impress people--but once we lose it, the coolness seems to slip farther and farther away from our grip until we are klutzes on feet. For Greg's character, small things turn bigger and bigger and bigger--from knocking over the remains of Jack's mother (and having a cat go to the bathroom on the remains), to setting the house on fire and busting the septic tank. Situations seem to escalate farther and farther out of control and they just keep getting worse and worse.<br/><br/>In one scene, Greg tries to impress everyone while playing volleyball in a pool. His team is losing because of him. ""Get up and hit the ball,"" Jack says to him. So the next time the ball comes around to Greg, he jumps up and smacks the ball with all his might, sending it flying towards...Pam's sister (whose wedding is the next day), shattering her nose. Greg lands back in the pool and seems to be happy, until he realizes he smacked his sister-in-law-to-be in the nose. Then everyone looks at him like he's an insensitive idiot.<br/><br/>Things like that have happened to me countless times, and that is why I can so easily identify with Greg. People are yelling at Greg to do something, and when he finally does it, it backfires and everyone looks at him like he's stupid, even though he did exactly what he was told.<br/><br/>That's the kind of thing that makes this movie so great--not only is it extremely funny, but we can easily identify with the main character countless times throughout the film. That is, perhaps, the best thing about this comedy."
"Movie-12","7","67","97","1 November 2000"," One of the funniest comedies of the year, De Niro and Stiller make the perfect comedy pair. *** (out of four)
","MEET THE PARENTS / (2000) *** (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>	The main character in ""Meet The Parents"" is a Chicago-based male nurse, Greg Focker (pronounced just how it is spelled) who realizes how unlucky a person can be. He is about to propose to his schoolteacher girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo), when her sister Debbie (Nicole Dehuff) calls and explains that her new fiancé, Dr. Bob Banks (Tom McCarthy), received a blessing from her father before he asked the question. This information makes Greg reconsider his method of choice, and instead jumps at the opportunity to meet Pam's overprotective parents when they fly to the east coast two weeks later to arrange Debbie's wedding. <br/><br/>	At the airport, the attendants loose Greg's parcels. Thus he arrives without any luggage. Once at Pam's parent's house, they exchange greetings and aquatint themselves with each other. Pam's parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) learn about Greg's unusual last name, that he does not like cats, and is a male nurse, all facts that do not settle well with Pam's father. Greg does manage to gift Jack with a pleasant supply of rare flowers. However, even though Pam explained to Greg  that her dad is in the hobby of rare flowers, he does not seem too impressed.<br/><br/>
	Even More complications ensue, especially when Greg learns of Jack's peculiar behaviors and suspicious gadgets, such as a polygraph and hidden cameras placed in every room of the house, as well as meeting Pam's brother, Denny (Jon Abrahams), and Debbie's soon to be in laws, Larry (James Rebhorn), and Linda Banks (Phillis George), and Pam's wealthy ex-fiancée, Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson). Soon, Greg's chances of receiving Jack's permission to wed his daughter become less and less probable as his bad luck only manages to increase. <br/><br/>	The film introduces Greg and Pam with silly quirks that come up later in the story. Pam's parents are also quite the treat; the movie does not go over the top but portrays them with serious humor and charismatic wit. It is De Niro and Stiller who make the movie, however. They form an very effective comedic chemistry, even more amusing than the likable shtick between De Niro and Billy Crystal in ""Analyze This."" The filmmakers take advantage of the phenomenal tension between Greg and Jack, and place them in one hilarious situation after another. <br/><br/>	While outrageous and at times explosively funny, director Jay Roach takes the plot seriously. His previous films, including the Austin Powers films and ""Mystery, Alaska,"" have had trouble with taking anything seriously. But ""Meet The Parents"" has emotional connections, develops solid empathy for Greg, and we really believe he has something precious that can be lost: Pam.<br/><br/>
	The movie does not completely develop romantic chemistry between Ben Stiller and Teri Polo, thus there were times when I simply did not believe the two were really in love. The relationship sometimes feels trite and contrived. There are also important plot nuggets left only partially examined: Jack's pot-head son, who could have contributed a lot more to the drug related material, is left as a plot device to provide another string of conflicts within Jack and Greg. <br/><br/>	I really enjoyed the whimsical performances and opportune casting. Ben Stiller reprises his ""There's Something About Mary"" role, with cute charm and the obscured zany flippancy. Robert De Niro is perfect in a role he was born to play, with serious attitude that results in the main portion of the film's funny moments. Blythe Danner is also charming in a kind of role that is becoming all too usual for her.<br/><br/>	""Meet the Parents"" is one of the funniest movies of the year. It gives audiences with a solid story that does not interfere with the comic material, but contributes to it. The top notch performances and lively direction also raise the film to a higher level. During a year in which effective comedies are an endangered species, ""Meet The Parents"" is a landmark achievement in light entertainment."
"the red duchess","8","50","71","21 December 2000"," A modern comedy classic with emotional depth.
","With a hero called Gaylord M. Focker, you might expect this to be a film of snickering silliness.  It IS snickeringly silly - the soon-to-be-immortal champagne/urn scene; the cat-milking discussion; the skimpy swimming trunks; the volleyball bloodbath; the flushing cat; the wooden altar conflagration; the septic tank spray etc.; all good, healthy, daft, slapstick, prurient, scatalogical stuff.  And while I in no way condone Greg's vile rage directed at the air-stewardess, it is very funny.<br/><br/>But, 'Meet the Parents' has the emotional truths that turn it from being merely a funny film into a comedy classic.  Anyone who has ever been married or about to will recognise the horrible accuracy of this film.  My own father-in-law is remarkably like Jack Byrnes here; not that he is an ex-CIA spycatcher (at least, I don't think so); but in his ability to intimidate, humiliate, terrorise, impose his power.<br/><br/>My point is that Jack's profession is only a comic exaggeration of what all fathers- or mothers-in-law are like, figures terrified of losing their children, defending them like animals in the wild, convinced that a prospective so-and-so will never be good enough for our baby, not even thinking that neither might they have been; refusing to admit they are getting old, that they are losing power and control.<br/><br/>It's only logical that the monster in-law from hell should be obsessive about power and control.  His domestic panopticon is a superb metaphor for extended family life, the idea of being judged, marked on 'success' or 'suitability' ratings, your every personal, financial, health etc. problem a matter for family investigation.  Bitter, moi?  Greg should be lucky Jack isn't married to Monica Geller's mom.<br/><br/>But the film doesn't simplistically pit Capraesque good guy Greg against shady CIA man Jack.  If Jack is all about control, then so is Greg.  The film has one of the best musical openings in recent memory ('if you're gentle and sweet, you're an idiot...'), but the opening montage is more sinister, as a faceless cameraman takes home movies of a pretty blonde. Pam is the true victim of this film, the prize in a macho battle of wits, the female bystander in the great masculine generational conflict, as Jack proves he's not past it, and Greg proves he's not a loser.  Those voyeuristic home movies echo Jack's surveillance cameras and perform the same function, to watch, to control, to limit (just as Kevin remembers Pam by his photographs and his erotic memories).<br/><br/>One is heartened by the ironies of the ending, not just Jack breaking his word, determined to keep up his power games as he watches his CCTV's filming the most private places, where people are at their most vulnerable and exposed (revealing, truthfully, that the in-law struggle never ends)<br/><br/>The film also has some cutting things to say about the lingering anti-semitism in WASPish society; nothing much has changed since 'Auntie Mame'.<br/><br/>It is wonderful to see Robert de Niro finally getting a decent comedy.  He has always been hilarious in 'straight' roles ('Mean Streets', 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull' etc.), but his comic vehicles have spluttered to a halt.  He is genius here, his menace, his gestures, facial contortions, way of throwing out a line like he's garrotting it - bliss.  If 'Parents' finally lacks the pull of a film like 'There's Something About Mary', then it's probably the nature of the plot.  'Mary' had an active plot, it was a quest, necessitating narrative and character development, and thus more audience commitment.  'Parents' is purely destructive, as Jack tries to destroy a love that's already been built up.  Sadly, this scenario is much truer."

","Meet the Parents is one of the funniest films this decade and it is not a spoof. I was laughing so hard, soda came bursting out of my nose. Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller did such an amazing job. I was not bored of this movie at all. Gaylord Focker and his girlfriend, Pam are set to become engaged. But to do so, they must travel to Pam's parents. It turns out that Pam's father, Jack is a CIA agent and dislikes Gaylord a lot. Gaylord did many hilarious things which includes losing a rare cat. The ironic thing is that Pam's sister got engaged and will be married....when and if Gaylord can get his act together. The acting is wonderful. You usually don't see De Niro doing movies like this. He did absolutely amazing. Ben Stiller did just as good. If you want to see this movie, get ready to laugh. This movie is full of laughs! I rate this movie 10/10."
"rbverhoef","7","34","52","30 May 2004"," Painfully funny
","Most of the funny moments in 'Meet the Parents' involve painful scenes with Ben Stiller. He plays Greg Focker, a male nurse who loves Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). He wants to marry her with her father's permission. He hasn't met her parents yet. The movie shows us the weekend where Stiller meets the parents. Pam's father is Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother is Dina (Blythe Danner). The more Greg tries to impress the parents, especially Jack who is a former CIA-agent, the more he humiliates himself. Not only with his actions, also with his words and stupid lies to look better.<br/><br/>Stiller is perfect in this kind of role. We already saw that, especially in 'There's Something About Mary'. The more he gets in trouble, the more painful it gets, the better Stiller gets and the more we laugh. There is also a fine little part from Owen Wilson as Pam's former lover. Stiller and Wilson have made a lot of films together and for some reason their scenes always work, they at least make you smile. De Niro doesn't try very hard to be a strict person who doesn't give Greg a chance and therefore succeeds even better. The way he slowly gets harder and harder on Greg is good for a new laugh every time. 'Meet the Parents', directed by Jay Roach who also directed the 'Austin Powers' trilogy, is a fine comedy with a lot of sequences where you might feel a little uncomfortable."
"ironhorse_iv","7","4","4","9 November 2017"," This comedy doesn't fock around. It really does meets the requirement on being funny! I'm satisfied with the results.
","Meeting the parents of your partner for the first time will always be nerve wracking. The pressures of making a great first impression can make any man or woman, feel awkward and nervous. For some of them, meeting the parents can turn out to be, a total disaster. Directed by Jay Roach, the film chronicles a series of excruciating moments that befall, one such man; Greg Focker (Ben Stiller), when meeting his girlfriend, Pam Byrnes's (Teri Polo) parents; overbearing father, Jack (Robert De Niro) & kind-hearted, mother Dina (Blythe Danner). Without spoiling the movie, too much, I thought the series of unfortunate events & misunderstands were very funny at the time and still, is, even if some of the jokes hasn't aged well; such with the common misconceptions and stereotypes about gender roles & sexual orientations. While, the jokes about Greg's unlucky last name were very fresh at the time for a PG-13 movie, I think, rewatching this movie, along with the films badly delivered, sequels; 2004's 'Meet the Fockers' & 2010's 'Little Fockers' have, really run that joke to the ground. It's just not as risky or funny as it used to be. Nevertheless, most of the humor is still, timeless. The whole scene of Greg, explaining, how you can milk anything with nipples, will forever, crack me up! Ben Stiller really does delivered as the good-hearted but hapless goofball of a boyfriend, without going, way, over the top with his reaction and ad lib abilities. I also love, how the movie doesn't play, too much of the slapstick physical comedy that Stiller was known for, at the time. Don't get me wrong, I love 1998's 'There's something about Mary', but I do like, how the film, for the most part, keeps the humor, realistic in tone. It makes for more, well-rounded, appealing movie, because how relatable, some of the actions scenes, were. As for Robert De Niro, it's probably, his best comedic role, ever. Even better than his role in 1999's mob comedy, 'Analyze This'. Although, playing Jack Byrnes isn't much of challenge for Niro, since there was barely any different between that movie character from the normal, dramatic commanding tough guy roles, De Niro is known for. I have to say, the role did help him, bounce back from the awfully of 2000's the live-action/animated film, 'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle', which nearly put a halt to De Niro's comedy acting career. It really does show the public, that the man can indeed make people, laugh. One thing, I thought, the movie could had improve, upon, is giving Blythe Danner's character, more to do. Don't get me wrong, her performance was mostly fine, but Danner's talent really does seem a bit wasted, in this forgettable role. I was really, hoping for Dina, to be, just as hard on Greg as Jack is. After all, the movie is call, 'Meet the Parents', not 'Meet the Father'. Nevertheless, deep down me, I really did like the comedic performance of everybody involve with this project, ranging from James Rebhorn as Dr. Bob, Owen Wilson playing Pam's ex-fiancée, Kevin Rawley to the two five-year-old Himalayan cats that both played Mr. Jinx. I just wish, the female characters, had more to do, than stand them, looking disgust or embarrassed at Greg's actions. Regardless of that, the movie has more to give, than jokes. The movie was very well-shot. There is no better, example of fine-filmmaking than the roof scene. The way, Roach & his crew was able to show, multiply times, happening, at once is amazing. Another great thing, about this movie is the music, compose by music artist, Randy Newman. All of them, are easy-listening & worth checking out on their own. After all, Newman's original song ""A Fool in Love"" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. So it's worth a listen or two. Overall: I have to say, this is one of those remakes that really outshine the original movie. It makes 1992's independent film of the same name look unfunny, cheap, and amateurism. 2001's 'Meet the Parent' is a fairly good film to sit down and watch with the whole family. That's no lie. I truly do like this comedy. No need for a polygraph test to prove that."
"rooprect","7","4","4","5 January 2014"," If you hate cats Robert De Niro will kick your butt
","I know I'm late to the party, but probably so are you if you're reading reviews at this late date. ""Meet the Parents"" is a funny flick that hearkens back to the glorious late-80s, or maybe even earlier, when comedies weren't so preoccupied with shocking the audience with gross out gags or surprise twists. Most of this movie is wonderfully predictable, and aside from a few deliberately clumsy drug references and maybe a sexual innuendo or two, it was good clean fun from start to finish.<br/><br/>Most of all, I'd say it's a good date flick to prepare yourself for the inevitable agony of meeting your own boyfriend/girlfriend's parents. We all know it sucks. (If you don't think so, oh, just you wait. Sometimes it takes years for them to expose themselves as the hideous flesh eating monsters that they are.) De Niro manages to take us to the utter extreme of monster but without shattering our suspension of disbelief. This is a key point. If the situation were to become too absurd , we would lose focus on the story and instead hone in on the individual gags. While there are plenty of funny gags to go round, they are really just dressing on an already funny premise: the story of an underdog who just cannot fit in to a judgmental bourgeois family no matter how hard (and usually because of how hard) he tries.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller shows his acting diversity (while on a different movie set playing the terminally airheaded Zoolander) as a dorky protagonist whose best intentions are always poorly timed or received completely the wrong way.<br/><br/>The antagonists, in this case, everybody else in the movie, tread the fine line of comedy and irritation. That is, at any time you could find yourself laughing or hating them. What's masterfully done is the filmmaker's (and of course actors') ability to turn you on a dime, take you to the edge of wanting to kill someone but then having a hearty laugh at their antics. Like I said earlier, Robert De Niro is the anchor that makes this possible, and any casting short of him (well, or maybe Christopher Walken) would have resulted in the film falling apart due to the demands it puts on our willingness to accept a complete jerk like the character he plays. Really his only redeeming quality is that he likes cats. But that's the point, I guess. No matter how rude a person may seem, there's always something redeeming in there.<br/><br/>Well, maybe except for the hilariously loathsome airline attendant who appears in a short but pivotal role at the film's climax. To me, that scene was worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Don't think twice, this is a movie worth seeing. Other similar films focusing on severely dysfunctional families trying to act normally include De Niro & Billy Crystal in ""Analyze This"", a great Andy Garcia movie called ""City Island"" and--this may be a stretch but--I think fans of ""Meet the Parents"" would really enjoy the original British ""Death at a Funeral"" (2007). Ya just gotta love comedies about trying to be normal in an utterly abnormal situation."
"Buddy-51","Null","20","29","19 August 2001"," a truly marvelous comedy
","Funny as well as touching, `Meet the Parents' blazes forth as one of the outstanding comedies of recent years.  <br/><br/>Co-writers Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke, along with director Jay Roach, have managed to make a film that is often laugh-out-loud hilarious without ever becoming overbearing or obnoxious, the style of choice for far too many other comedies made in this day and age.  Although the film overflows with madcap situations and even outright slapstick at times, these comic elements are always tethered to the reality of the premise and to the emotional states of the characters involved.  <br/><br/>The foundation for any great comedy must, first and foremost, be its ability to connect with its audience on a personal level.  `Meet the Parents' does so from the very start by tapping into the universal dilemma we all face at one time or another of desperately trying to make a good impression on someone we feel holds nothing less than the fate of our lives in their own two hands.  For some of us this person might come in the form a boss or a potential employer or, as in poor Greg Focker's case, those most dreaded figures of all  the prospective in-laws.  The comedy arises from seeing the chain of ever more preposterous events and circumstances that come along to sabotage his efforts.  Greg is a goodhearted, well-meaning nebbish who wants nothing more out of life than to marry Pam, the girl he loves.  First, however, he must climb over the rather formidable barrier of her eccentric father, Jack Byrnes, played to perfection by Robert De Niro, who certainly has his own offbeat way of looking at the world.  <br/><br/>The triumph of this film is that it never overdoes anything.  The people in Pam's family and in their coterie of friends are all twisted it's true, but twisted in sly, subtle ways that knock both Greg and us slightly off our balance.  Like Greg, we never quite know where these people are coming from and this greatly enhances the comedic quality of the film.  Tone is everything in comedy and here the tone is just right.  Byrnes can seem at one moment to be a reasonable loving father, then turn immediately around and make the most unbalanced comments about the most trivial matters.  Even when the movie is at its most outrageous in terms of plot complications and slapstick, it never veers off the scale into incredibility.  Part of the reason is that we feel so much empathy for Greg, the best Everyman character I have seen in a movie in a long time.  Ben Stiller gives a beautifully understated comic performance in the main role.  Greg's completely understandable feelings of nervousness, intimidation and growing frustration help to keep the film anchored in reality, even as the story threatens to spiral off into undisciplined absurdity.  Luckily, the filmmakers never let this happen.  They are also blessed with the genius of Mr. De Niro, who never makes a false move as the seemingly crazy ex-CIA agent who may or may not be harboring a few secrets of his own. Above all, De Niro never lets us bank on the extent of his character's eccentricity, which brilliantly enhances this `weekend from hell' scenario.   For crazy and maddening as he can be at times, we can't help loving this character.<br/><br/>Finally, unlike in many other romantic dramas and comedies, the relationship between the young couple in this film is both believable and touching.  Greg and Pam are so likable - and the odds against them seem so staggering - that we find ourselves rooting them on from first moment to last.  Their moments together are genuinely touching at times, particularly in the film's closing stretches.<br/><br/>Kudos go out to everyone involved for making `Meet the Parents' one of the slyest, wittiest and flat-out funniest movies to come our way in a long, long time."

","This has to be the most uncomfortably hilarious comedy I have seen or I should say felt involved with in years. The whole family and their friends VS Mr.Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller). A father-in-law to be is not just an overly literal and abundantly-overbearing wall in the way of the progress of asking with the best intentions for the man's daughters hand in marriage. Every time he turns around someone in that family of Pam's is verbally being cold blooded or condescending toward Greg Focker aka Gaylord, and then laughing about it. Or even accusing him of doing things that he hasn't done. With a case of nerves as it is it doesn't help to be even more nervous and doing something by mistake that will be under a finer micro-scope by the parents and friend of the wedding party. From the supposed pot smoking that they accused him of to lying about his taking the 'M Cats' test to anything else that they feel like saying to him, or about him. This reminded me of my past in-laws. What a freaking mess.The breakfast scene where he enters their kitchen in pjs and the grooms mother quips, ""looks like someone had a visit from the hair fairy."" Then on Greg's way out of the kitchen to go shower, he jokes and sez, ""Well I guess it's time for me to visit the shower fairy."" And everyone just looks at him as if to say 'Oh Greg grow up'. I can identify with most of this whole feature. The director was brilliant in making an awkwardly close to the bone for me, movie about unwed bliss. DeNiro is masterful in this role. He is simply the one that fits it to a tee. Well scripted and maintained through out the entire story, this one with Owen Wilson was a spectacle to look and laugh and cringe at all at the same time while feeling awkward and gawky and nervously smiling with the rest of the nervous fiancée's out there.<br/><br/>This was a one of a kind fun-filled slightly bend out of shape picture with an original feel, that makes it not equal to all the other cinema fare out there that 'comes and goes' with little staying power.<br/><br/>Jay Roach is a cool and talented director. Keep up the great work. Recommended (****) See it with a buddy."
"klizee","Null","18","31","2 October 2000"," Meet the Parents is a must-see!
","Fresh from a lackluster summer full of sophomoric films, I was quite happy to have found myself in the theatre watching a sneak preview of the Universal/Dreamworks picture Meet the Parents.<br/><br/>I remember the weekend that I first met my husband's parents. Joe and I were not even engaged yet. I spent the entire weekend stressed and worried that I'd offend them (they're Jewish and it was Passover weekend) or make an idiot of myself.<br/><br/>I need not have worried. In the movie Meet the Parents, Ben Stiller's character, Greg Focker (yes, that *is* his last name) breaks all previously held records for making an ass of one's self and sets new, unattainable ones, albeit, through not much fault of his own.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie is simple. Greg wants to marry his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (played by Teri Polo). However, he has yet to meet her family. Pam's sister Debbie is getting married and so Greg goes along, wanting to ask the father's permission since that is what Jack (Pam's father) would expect.<br/><br/>Greg even packs a gorgeous two Carat ring in his carry-on. Unfortunately, his bag is deemed too big and it must be checked. You *know* at this point that they WILL lose his bag. What you don't know is all the ensuing comedy that will stem from this one incident.<br/><br/>The humor in this film reminds me of the TV show Seinfeld. It all connects. Jerry loses luggage. However, in this luggage is something that Kramer put in there that will cause...yada yada yada....which has a domino effect and POW! The audience is loving it.<br/><br/>As was the audience that saw this sneak preview. There were many times when the movie could not be heard because people were *still* laughing over the last hilarious scene. They didn't give you time to catch your breath. People were laughing like I haven't heard people laugh in a theatre in a long, long time. Big, gigantic, full body laughs. I know, because I was one of them.<br/><br/>Greg and Pam, sans Greg's luggage (which was lost) arrive and ""Meet the Parents."" Robert De Niro plays Jack Byrnes, Pam's ex CIA interrogator father who Greg thinks is a retired rare flower dealer. Pam's mother is played with the appropriate level of ditzy dryness by Blythe Danner.<br/><br/>Pam hurriedly tells Greg to get rid of his cigarettes because her father thinks smoking is a sign of weakness. The cigarettes are thrown to the roof. Don't forget about those, because later, they'll be the falling domino for future scenes that you will LOVE. Our audience was losing it.<br/><br/>The supporting characters here are well cast. Owen Wilson has a great turn as Pam's ex, Kevin. Kevin is *everything* that Greg is not, and Pam's dad doesn't hesitate to remind everyone of that fact non-stop. I haven't laughed this much in a too long of a time. I would recommend this film without hesitation. It's smart and funny and just plain FUN. And make sure you pay attention to the last scene. It had me giggling *all* the way home."

","Sorry, but I just don't see how anyone can find this movie funny. I put the spoiler warning on this comment since I am about to give away the biggest comedic device in the movie. As unbelievable as it sounds, the protagonist in the movie has a last name that rhymes with a naughty word. His last name is Focker! Why is this piece of information a spoiler? Because joke after joke after joke after joke is made on this simple premise. In fact, it's so hilarious that they felt the need to put it in the title of the next movie! In addition, the scenarios in this movie were so far fetched that instead of being able to enjoy it, I spent the entire time wondering why the writers were so lazy that instead of coming up with reasonable plot scenarios, they just passed off ridiculous decisions in order to force supposedly humorous scenes. Case and point - Ben Stiller's character loses his luggage while on the way to meet his fiancée's parents. The first morning he wakes up in his fiancée's family's house, he wants to change clothes but doesn't have any. His fiancée suggests that he borrow some of her brother's clothes. So far, this all seems reasonable. Stiller's character then asks her to go get some of these clothes. Instead, she tells him it would make more sense that even though he has yet to meet her brother, he should walk into his room unannounced and feel free to root through his bureau until he finds something he wants. Would any person in their right mind ever suggest such a thing? Needless to say, her brother then catches this man he doesn't know going through his underwear drawer. That's it! That's the big joke! And that is supposed to be funny! I could go on with numerous examples just as ridiculous as this that litter this movie, but I've wasted enough time. If I can convince just one person not to waste the 2 hours of his or her life on this abomination of a film, I will consider this exercise worth while.<br/><br/>1 out of 10"

"Steve W-2","Null","15","26","18 January 2001"," A missed opportunity
","Warning: Spoilers ahead<br/><br/>This film was a real disappointment. It had a good premise and a good cast but, apart from one or two amusing set-pieces, mainly failed to deliver.<br/><br/>The plot partly relied upon mistaken identity due to the main character having changed his name. His real name was Gaylord Foker (oh my aching ribs!). The name was unnecessarily vulgar bearing in mind that it's main task was to set up the confusion of identity scenario (and hey, I liked the dialogue in Goodfellas and Casino so its not a sensibility issue). The name was used at intervals throughout the film to get cheap laughs in a way that was more suited to the ""Carry on"" films. It wouldn't be worth mentioning, except that so many scenes in the film seemed to rely on it for laughs (even before his 1st name was revealed to be ""Gaylord"").<br/><br/>Although one or two of the set-pieces were funny, every single one of them was telegraphed way ahead. De Niro gets all emotional about his Mothers ashes - Greg breaks the urn, Greg floods the lawn with s**t - his girlfriends ex drives up in a truck and sprays them with it, the ex carves a beautiful altar for her sister's wedding -  Greg burns it down. And so on and so on - you get the picture? All we were missing was Greg leaving a rake for someone to step on and wack themselves in the eye<br/><br/>Imagine a comedy that combines the intelligence and sophistication of ""Frasier"" or the ""Phil Silvers Show"" with the slapstick of the Marx Brothers - well you ain't imagining this film. Mixing slapstick/farce with a bit of sophistication is fine when done well (""The Producers"" for example) but here the comedy never got sophisticated enough to provide a counterpoint to the -adequate- slapstick. The only low gag they missed was not having the Thai honeymoon destination being Phuket!<br/><br/>This was a film that intermittently promised to develop into something good (De Niro's poem to his dead mother for instance), and the cast did their best with thin material. In the end though it couldn't build on it's few bright spots - it could have been much, much better with a bit more effort."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Movies are seldom about life, but life is often about movies. Most cultural dynamics are fueled by stereotypes and those stereotypes are manufactured for us in increasing measure by film. There's a feedback loop where filmmakers chase formula and that formula follows from previous films and the stuff of this formula in most entertainment is stereotypes.<br/><br/>This film is pure drek. The slide of DeNiro from great actor isn't even interesting anymore. What IS interesting, at least to me, is how Stiller is reviving a certain stereotype -- the warmhearted, weak Jew: the oddball anti-intellectual. When Chaplin played the tramp, it was a class thing. When Jackson plays a literate killer, its a race thing. The portrayal of Jews at this level is both: it seems unhealthy to me, and somewhat cowardly, much lower than the septic tank jokes.<br/><br/>Instead of the Jew-doctor, Stiller plays a nurse who is belittled by `real' doctors. Instead of the banker powerbroker, we have Stiller easily ridden by the CIA guy (incidentally a John Bircher to judge from his bedtime reading*). His predecessor and still competitor is a Jesus-freak. He is bested by a cat. His name is derided. Shrewdness (that mainstay) is replaced by spinelessness and incompetence. His bumbling destroys an altar.<br/><br/>
But he still aces his grad school test, and once away from the WASPs becomes aggressive, so there is some hint that underneath is a `regular' Jew. These films have lots of managers, so surely this is engineered. I can imagine the pitch, knowing they have Stiller who can play this kind of part.<br/><br/>
Think about it. Not funny is it?<br/><br/>(* For those who don't know, the book DeNiro is reading is perhaps the most influential screed on `global Jewish conspiracies' in the postwar US. Such stuff as: Eisenhower was secretly a commie Jew who gave half of Europe to Stalin.)<br/><br/>((PS This comment was written in the same suspicious-of-everything stance.))"
"LauraH2477","Null","11","18","20 August 2002"," A Terrible Movie
","This movie is almost painful to watch. You just feel sorry for Ben Stiller's character. He basically spends a couple days being tormented and humiliated by his girlfriend's family. There is no way anyone would put up with this crap in real life. I would have left the first night. He is intimidated and nervous around his girlfriend's father, and desperate for approval, so he screws up over and over, each time worse than the last. The father doesn't help matters, as he belittles and embarrasses the poor guy at every opportunity. (Sorry, I forget the characters names.) The girlfriend hardly does a damn thing to stick up for him. Then Dad's friends show up and join in on the fun. One scene in particular has them playing volleyball in the pool and they are ridiculing him for missing the ball. So then he overcompensates and ends up smashing his girlfriend's sister in the face with the ball. They all criticize him, telling him it's ""just a game, Focker!"" and act as if he meant to hurt the girl. Another is when he finally has enough and is leaving and the whole bunch stands on the porch and laughs at his given name, which we find out is Gaylord. The girlfriend says nothing, just letting the poor guy take another kick in the teeth after all the other humiliation he's been through for her sake. The entire family is totally unlikable, Focker is the only one I cared about, and that's only because I was forced to care by watching this poor guy get put through the ringer over and over. Then comes the contrived ending where everything is made good in about five minutes and he forgives all. If I were this guy, I would never speak to these psychos again. Sorry to run on so much, but this movie really affected me and I couldn't see how someone could laugh at this guy's misfortunes. Maybe it's just me..."
"willcundallreview","7","4","5","29 March 2015"," A comedy with Stiller at his most awkwardly best
","Rating-7/10 <br/><br/>Meet the Parents is a comedy and almost kind of romance movie that boats a stellar cast and some funny lines. The humour here is spread out well and the laughs don't just all come in one scene or the other, it makes you laugh at the end and the beginning too. I think the majority of the laughs are more physical than what they say, but what I will add is that when Greg(Ben Stiller) says certain lines, they come off brilliantly. I felt it was just about good and here below is why.<br/><br/>The cast here seem excellent and Ben Stiller as I mentioned is cast well in the lead role as Greg, his physical humour matches up to his line delivery and both combine very well. Robert De Niro as the father in law Jack is great as well, he somehow seems to mix serious but still feel funny and all credit to him on this one. Teri Polo as Pam, Greg's finance, is well cast and so even is Blythe Danner including people like Owen Wilson too to create a first rate bunch of characters. <br/><br/>It's written well, now what I will say is that the script doesn't quite produce as memorable scenes as some of the more physical jokes do but there still funny anyway. John Hamburg and Jim Herzfeld do a good job as I say writing this and both seem to combine past experiences well, with Hamburg who worked with Stiller on ""Zoolander"" yet again bringing out the laughs and the type of humour we have come to expect.<br/><br/>I think the director Jay Roach is probably the best thing in a way about this, yes you may say how is it not Stiller, but Roach is the master here when it comes to the most memorable parts, and a lot of the laughs. Roach seems to be able to not only get good delivery, but make things very awkward, and part of you even feels awkward watching it at times. <br/><br/>Now Meet the Parents isn't the funniest film you will ever see, if it is then there is much else out you need to see, but it does stand tall when it comes to comedy, and laughs can be had a plenty everywhere. I think although it is a typical comedy type plot, the jokes and the cast involved+ some memorable scenes create a movie that is new when it comes to jokes and even maybe creates a new type of Rom-Com.<br/><br/>On the jokes side again, pretty much any scene where it goes wrong for Greg is funny, whether he is hurt, hurts somebody or basically does something to destroy something, It makes not only Stiller's reactions funnier, but also how the cast react, just hilarious on that side of things. I also think how De Niro goes from actually kind of nice to angry in a matter of seconds is perfect, top class acting from the great.<br/><br/>So overall I think this is a good movie, just scraping into being good but still a good one. I think the reason it isn't great is that it isn't smart ENOUGH, it is smart but there could have been some better jokes or maybe even this type of plot just only works to a certain point. Nevertheless I can't recommend this more, whether you like Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro or any of the cast involved, your sure to have a great time and laugh a lot along the way."
"hmmod9","1","26","52","18 November 2006"," Meet the new generation of ""unfunny"" movie.
","This film was a very lame attempt at been humorous. The jokes were poor, overcooked and could be seen at least two lines before hand. I didn't have a decent laugh during the whole movie and was sorry I wasted my time viewing it until the end. The worst thing about this type of baloney is that a new genre of film seems to have been invented by some studios i.e. ""unfunny"" funny film whose only reason for existence is to lull the viewing audience into some sort of trite ""twilight zone"", letting them think that they go home in a jovial and entertained mood where the exact opposite is the case as the discerning viewer goes home unfulfilled, cheated and slightly disgruntled. Unfortunately, we have been exposed to a plethora of these films for too long as more and more of this type of banal movie is served up appealing to increasingly demoralized audiences as certain movie makers lose sight of the hilarious belly busters of yesteryear with their razor sharp script writers, ludicrous plots and acting beyond belief. They have become nothing more that ""cash cows"" for some actors to make a few extra dollars to keep them in the lifestyle that they have been accustomed to and are disingenuous to both, us their audience, and true comedians alike."

It made the movie very tired.<br/><br/>This movie could've been much better (but not less predictable) if they'd had half as many gags but made them more likely and deeper.<br/><br/>Not one of Robert De Niro's better moments.

"darqness","1","15","28","22 April 2003"," Cruel and Unkind
","The very first thing that irritated me about this film was the appalling gag used throughout the film. The man is named Greg (Gaylord) Focker. Although his surname sounds vaguely like a swearword, this is a very thin gag which is the basis of huge chunks of the film. This is the first cruel part of this film.<br/><br/>The film is focused towards victimising the main character. Instead of making gags about the mistakes he makes inadvertently, he is forced to make these mistakes. It is so rigid. It seems that all acting and storylines are suspended until the next mistake happens and then the next five minutes is verbal abuse at what best can be described as accidents.<br/><br/>It seems that the entire family, including his girlfriend are hoping and praying for him to make a mistake so that they can get rid of him. He tries to impress and help the family. They make no attempt to apologise when they are at fault.<br/><br/>Many other reviews focus on the fact that you can identify with the main character, this enables you to laugh at this film. This is the entire problem with this film. The fact that you can identify with the character makes this film even harder to watch. If Ben Stiller hadn't done such a great job at portraying this character then maybe I could stand to laugh. His performance was too good. I put myself in his shoes once too often during this film and was disgusted with the way he is treated.<br/><br/>The character is too nice to laugh at. He is true to himself. (His job choice) He cares about other's beliefs. (Asking her father for permission) He is desperate to please and earn the respect and acceptance of his 'new' family.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is exposed to be cruel and nasty at various points in the film. How can people dare to laugh at the nicest and most honest character in this film.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller     - 8/10 (For his portrayal)<br/><br/>Everything else - 0/10"

","This film is an uneven mess.  It is funny for about 10-15 minutes at the beginning, and for maybe 45 seconds (possibly two minutes) at the end.  The rest of the film is a horrible monstrosity.<br/><br/>After the initial, fifteen minutes (I'll be generous), the film suddenly falls in love with its gross-out comedy.  It began as a kinda strange, funny film about characters.  There's unspoken tension between Stiller and DeNiro, and it was very funny.  Then the film becomes a slapstick gross out mess of a film, and the jokes were seen miles away.  The tragedy is that even when they're being set up we already know they will not be funny, so when they are finally delivered, we completely hate them.<br/><br/>At around the midpoint, you find the film too absurd to be taken seriously, and from there it only gets worse.  The characters are so uneven and poorly written that you don't even really care what they say or do. <br/><br/>
Things get more and more absurd and less and less funny as the film goes on and on (and on and on). Clueless Director Jay Roach clearly had a vision for this film, but it's a shame his crew didn't share the same vision.  It's obvious that no one knew what the hell they were doing in this atrocity besides the director.  And it's the irony of ironies that this happens to be one of the worst American directors working today.<br/><br/>
This film is much, much worse than those Austin Powers films Roach directed, and I think that's saying quite a lot. In fact-<br/><br/>
Wait, wait, what the hell am I doing writing this review?  Why am I still typing?  This film is awful-stay away!  It doesn't even deserve my time in writing a decent review.  If they didn't put that much effort into their film, why should I put that much effort into this?"

He plays violent parts, e.g., Goodfellas, Godfather, Cape Fear, etc.  If De Niro's next meal depended on making people laugh he would die of starvation.  So why was he cast in a main role?

"WHCernan","4","2","2","27 November 2000"," Why I can't watch Gomer Pyle
","First things first: I WANTED to see this film. I think Ben Stiller is a hoot and De Niro is an excellent actor who is perfect for this material. De Niro did not disappoint and Stiller was exactly right for his role. Everyone was well-cast.<br/><br/>So, then, why did this movie stink?<br/><br/>I'll start by saying, I can't watch ""Gomer Pyle, USMC"". It's not that I don't like Jim Nabors; it's just that the show is about how Gomer always does things that are painfully and blatantly obviously STUPID and WRONG. Gomer asks out Sgt. Carter's girlfriend because the Sarge has to work in town and Gomer doesn't want her to feel lonely; then Sarge sees Gomer and goes on the rampage. Well, DUH. Nobody would do anything so stupid unless they really wanted to pursue the girlfriend. It's painful because I see it coming a mile away.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller plays the Gomer Pyle role in this film. DeNiro is superb as the suspicious and unapproachable father in the Sergeant Carter mold. Stiller's character does so many things that are so STUPID and WRONG that you wonder how he could have survived to adulthood. I don't want to give anything away, but you and I and everyone else in the world knows that you don't try to ""replace"" a highly trained animal with one you found at the pound! Well, DUH! You see everything in this movie coming - a mile away.<br/><br/>At least Gomer Pyle was only a half hour long. I kept wanting to get up and leave but several members of my family were along and I couldn't very well leave them there. At least I was treated, at the very end of the film, to a fantastically hilarious airline subplot that really made my wait mostly worthwhile. Every time I am in a situation with obvious airline morons in the future, you know that I'll be thinking, ""Step Off!""<br/><br/>4/10 stars, only because the acting was terrific."
"dointhefish","1","11","20","6 December 2000"," I can't believe that DeNiro was actually in this turkey!
","Basically a bad ripoff of another bad film (There's Something About Mary). It should be retitled ""There's Something About The Father of the Bride."" Every joke is telegraphed and every scene is just as contrived as can be. Stiller's performance as the unlucky suitor is ok but we've seen it before and it's getting old.  Unless you're a Police Academy fan or REALLY liked that Mary movie, avoid this one at all costs."
"mattrochman","1","17","34","27 September 2007"," I dedicate my next bowel movement to this film
","Well let's start off by saying that comedy cinema has been in troubling decline for about 10 years. It's all political correct, contrived, formulaic and worst of all, unfunny.<br/><br/>In all my IMDb reviews, I have not rated one Ben Stiller film. All of them are pathetic (and guess what, there's something about mary was just as bad as the rest). Some fellow actors say he's so serious when he works and so many people think he's side-splitting. If you ask me, he is the most unfunny actor in the history of comedy and has a clear ability to pick the most pathetic scripts circling Hollywood.<br/><br/>Him aside, this film is dreadful. It isn't funny and if you think it is, then I wonder what would happen if i put a flash light to your left ear. Would I see light coming out the right side? Let's look at some of the pathetic attempt at comedy used in this one. <br/><br/>The character's surname is Focker. Gee that's funny (not). The screenwriters must have agonized for months before coming up with the idea of giving the main character a surname that they can milk about 1000 unfunny one-liners and jokes from. Then, after you think they milked that one for everything it's worth, a sequel emerges titled ""Meet the Fockers"", where the surname is giving rise to more material. Suffice to say that the sequel was worse than this, but I won't review it since I can't set the IMDb star rating into negative territory.<br/><br/>Then they set up stupid and deeply contrived scenarios like Mr. Focker going through the brother's underwear draw. Gee, that one was funny and original..... NOT. <br/><br/>After this, the writers obviously had to apply their intelligence as they must have realized that it was seriously lacking. So they ever so slightly raised the bar and tried to come up with the father-in-law from hell, even though that in itself is deeply clichéd. So they made him some sort of ex-CIA something or rather, with a lie detector in his basement so that the future son-in-law's sexual past can be probed.<br/><br/>At this point, I actually felt embarrassed for Robert De Niro. Someone certainly must have called in a big favor to get him on-board this rubbish. <br/><br/>Another pathetic protuberance along the downwardly-inclined road that is Hollywood comedy.<br/><br/>And.... I've said it before so I'll say it again - I'm still waiting for a Ben Stiller film that I actually like."
"ccthemovieman-1","7","13","25","24 October 2006"," De Niro The Comedian
","Odd to state that ""Robert De Niro is the star of this comedy,"" but that's the case here. One doesn't normally associate him with comedy, but he's a pretty versatile actor, and can play a lot more characters than Mafia-type thugs. He's also a pretty darned good comedian, as he first proved way back in the early '80s with Rupert Pupkin in ""The King of Comedy.""<br/><br/>Anyway, De Niro and Ben Stiller provide a lot of laughs in this modern-day comedy. No sense going into detail as there are plenty of other reviews here. I hate to see the ""hero"" of a movie being a character who is chronic liar (Stiller's ""Greg Focker"") but that's not unusual in the world of films. That, and Blythe Danner's excessive use of God's name as exclamations gets annoying. <br/><br/>Other than that, it's a fun movie that turned out to be a hit and justifiably so. I imagine you could get a lot of laughs from watching this over and over. That would be better than watching the sequel."

"Kevken93","1","8","14","26 June 2011"," The worst movie ever.
","OK before i talk about this i have to say that there will be two spoilers and those two spoilers are the only two 'jokes' in this thing we call a movie. How anybody can find this torturous thing entertaining or humorous in any way shape or form baffles me.<br/><br/>The first o so funny joke the seemingly 10 year old writers throw at us is our main characters name being GAYLORD FOCKER. I would nearly consider forgiving the movie this joke if it was never brought up again and the movie went on to even being a pretty good family comedy but sadly no. What is funny about it?, because it sounds like a curse word maybe....No still not laughing. If you have not watched this movie yet and you wonder whats the big deal about one stupid little joke well the answer is that they use it about 20 times during this 90 minute horror. It was not funny the first time, it most certainly wasn't funny the second time and guess what it isn't funny the 20th time either.<br/><br/>Amazingly though that is not what wreaks the movie no that would be our second joke. When i say joke this time it is actually more of an scenario rather than a run of the mill scene, this is of course awkwardness (if that makes any sense). The situations that our main character gets himself into are always the same awkward situations time and time again. Of course meeting your girlfriends or wife's mother and father will feel weird at first but for god sake. There isn't one shot in this movie that doesn't involve our main character(stiller) making a complete fool of himself, it gets to the point where its almost hard to watch the rest of the movie. This makes the movie uncomfortable and boring and also makes you hate stiller or should i say Gaylord.<br/><br/>Having the audience hate the main character in a comedy is unforgivable. The casting is pretty standard having Stiller (who is very hit and miss in a lot of his films) as our main guy with Robert De Niro who continues to destroy his once gracious career as the spiteful father. Teri Polo plays Stillers girlfriend but she seems to have forgot that people are meant to have personalities and a little acting ability. As for the rest well none really stand out except for the always unfunny Owen Wilson as the successful ex-boyfriend.<br/><br/>Its not as if this is completely meant for kids either because there are some jokes that kids wouldn't understand this begs the question do the film makers actually think that adults will find this garbage amusing. I would almost go as far as calling the movie insulting as it is obviously meant for fools which you are if you find this good to watch."

""Because he's a man.... get it?""  just does not work for me.<br/><br/>That said, I think DeNiro did a good job with the script he was given, and Ben Stiller did well as the nervous fiance to be."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","6","10","2 May 2008"," Meet The Parents Or Not?
","'Meet the Parents' is a comedy that's funny enough for an evening watch. The central characters Pam and Greg are very likable but the Pam's family are portrayed to be slightly a bit of a caricature. I find it a bit far-fetched that everyone hates Greg. Even Pam's mother reacts with indifference. I mean she does 'object' but it's as if she could care less. But then again, 'Meet the Parents' is about the tension between Greg and Jack and both De Niro and Stiller do well with their comic abilities. Even though De Niro's character is less likable, it is nice to see him in a comedic role for a change. Stiller is his usual goofy on screen persona (a part he's best at doing). However, due to the director's focus on this, the romantic angle between Polo's Pam and Stiller's Greg isn't well developed, but Teri Polo does a good job. Blythe Danner is adequate (though I don't know whether it was the director's intention to present her as being indifferent towards Jack's cruelty). The toilet and sex humour could have been toned down as it is the overload use that brings the entertainment factor down for me. Also the story follows the old formula of a guy trying to impress his girlfriend's parents, therefore the freshness is lacking. Even so, there are a lot of loose ends such as what happens to Jack's son and his pot. But, in spite of the flaws there are a few genuine funny moments and I liked the 'race' scene towards the end, Greg's problems with the flight attendant, and Greg's attempt to propose to Pam at the beginning of the movie. Roach's direction isn't of the remarkable sort and 'Meet the Parents' mostly works to an extent because of the actors. This could have been more of a fun ride had it not been too over-the-top but it's hell of a lot better than the sequel. There are a lot more other comedies I can recommend over this, but 'Meet the Parents' isn't so bad that you won't want to give it a chance either."

","Has Ben Stiller made a good movie yet? Not so far as I can tell. He is living proof that nepotism works. Even though his dad has never been that funny either. How he continues to make movies is beyond me, all he does is string together a series of events that have shock value but no real humor. Plus teaming him up with Owen Wilson is a double negative. Let's see: he's not a good actor, he's not a funny comedian, he's not cute enough to get by on his looks... Explain why people continue to waste money on any film he pollutes.

","Perhaps this film gets better towards the end. I wouldn't know; I walked out after about forty minutes.<br/><br/>The central premises of the film are that only a monster wouldn't find the Ben Stiller character lovable; and that the Robert de Niro character is a monster. It didn't work for me; Stiller was silly and tedious - the sort of guy any responsible father would want to keep out of the family - and de Niro was much less overbearing and unpleasant than he might have been. Perhaps he should have been played by a slimy Limey? That could have made for much more interesting (but less contrived) plot and characterisation, without necessarily changing the nature of the film."

I am a great fan of both Mr. De Niro and Mr. Stiller. Still, I could not bear to finish the film. This is one of the few movies I have ever stopped watching while in progress.

Robert DeNiro should have made his comedic debut in something original or at least funnier. He has a couple of good lines and has good chemistry with Blythe Danner. Ben Stiller is given pointless and stupid stuff throughout the movie and really makes no connection with Teri Polo, Owen Wilson would go much better with her. The usual drug references and literal potty humor are uninspired, it's as if the writers gathered around some inane sitcom scripts and padded them with this stuff that wouldn't be allowed on TV. A really weak effort, but at least it's better than the sequel, which manages to misuse Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. If you want to see an intelligent, actually funny comedy, watch ""Analyse This"", ""My Cousin Vinny"", ""Runaway Bride"" or ""Legally Blonde"", better yet the best comedy ever, ""Some Like It Hot""."

The full house audience in the theatre I was in didn't laugh as much as I did, so I figure it didn't go over really well with them either.<br/><br/>The Movie might be more funny if I had never seen another one, but I have. So when a movie beats you to a bloody pulp with the jokes before they even happen, it loses the laugh.  The dialogue in place was good, but I just kept knowing that certain things were going to happen.<br/><br/>EXAMPLES: ( SPOILERS )  We know from the moment they get there that the CAT is going to be a MAJOR joke prop.  What is it with Ben Stiller and evil animals?  I KNEW from the moment the urn was mentioned it would be broken, I KNEW the cat would not use the toilet the whole movie.  I KNEW Ben Stiller would end up on the roof smoking.  I KNEW it would probably result in something bad happening.  I KNEW the stupid wooden alter would end up defamed in some way.  <br/><br/>I could go on all day.  These things were set-up with such bluntness that Helen Keller could see the sight gags coming.<br/><br/>While I did laugh at some points, overall I was really disappointed.  The only way to make something funny is to catch the audience off guard with a new twist.  There were none in this film.<br/><br/>P.S. Deniro is VERY Funny.

I can't understand why Robert De Niro accepted a part in this movie. Robert De Niro is such a great actor, and this is almost a silly kids movie. Ben Stiller's character in constant fear of, well, nothing is a bad plot concept. The idea that he would allow his future father-in-law to connect him to a lie detector and answer questions just shows how truly wimpy he comes across. His love interest, is also one-dimensional.

And yes, we are again exposed to yet another ""typical American family"" living in an upscale neighborhood with riches and privileges only few outside the movie colony can afford.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller as the hero does the best that he can with limited material. Robert DeNiro as the prospective father-in-law is again parodying his tough guy image, but it doesn't come off this time as well as it did in ""Analyze This"" (1999). DeNiro's performance, I thought, was a bit over the top, and was for the first time a performance of his that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. The performance of Teri Polo as Stiller's love interest didn't impress me. Blythe Danner is wasted as DeNiro's scatterbrained wife. Owen Wilson's character is a bit of a mystery. How are we to believe that a hugely successful businessman such as he seems to be, can't even get a date for dinner ""at the Club"". My god, even ex-beauty queen Phyllis George is in the cast, but if you blink you'll miss her.<br/><br/>I was not impressed with the be-belittling of the nursing profession or the continuous insults heaped upon the Stiller character.

Her parents, especially her father (Robert De Niro), not only reject him, they treat him like a piece of unwanted garbage.  Personally, I would have just walked out after the first five minutes with the parents and never would have seen her again.  I wouldn't WANT to marry into a family as arrogant as that.  But anyway, Greg spends an entire weekend with the in-laws where NOTHING goes right for him.  This is an obvious take on the the first sequence of ""There's Something About Mary"".  It's wasn't remotely funny in ""Mary"", and it doesn't work here either.  If you have the mentality of a 12 to 16-year-old, you may enjoy it.

These are just three of the words I'd use to describe this film.<br/><br/>To call it family entertainment is laughable - in fact it's probably the only laugh you'll get. Stiller and co can do better than this and yet seem quite happy to be dragged into this horrible film and its two sequels.<br/><br/>The only people who would find this funny are immature teenagers with nothing better to do. Every joke is signposted and even then are boring.<br/><br/>If this is what passes for entertainment then I despair. It is a very poor film."

","This film is off and on very funny, and overall it is a good time. Mainly due to Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller's performances as the father and the guy who wants to marry his daughter. Stiller meets the parents (De Niro and Blythe Danner) in one very chaotic weekend in Long Island where anything that can go wrong for Stiller does (a spray-painted and potty trained cat, burning down by accident the alter, overflowing the septic tank, being caught with a dragon that he likes to puff and telling a story about a cat that is a show-stopper) and enhances the comedy. A feel-good comedy, even if it may hit close to home for many a lot of men. Directed by Jay Roach (or Austin Powers and Mystery Alaska fame)."
"Star_Red","3","5","9","12 July 2002"," Was that supposed to be funny?
","I was looking forward to seeing a comedy that would make me laugh and make me feel cheerful, but I was devastatingly disappointed. Though a very few scenes captured the clumsiness and embarassment of such a weekend quite nicely, they were completely overshadowed by all those exaggerated, contrived, and unfunny mishaps. What's so funny about spraying s**t at people? None of Greg Focker's misfortunes made me laugh; they were just annoying. It also doesn't help that all characters in this movie are not likeable at all; I didn't care what happens to them.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and avoid this overrated wannabe-comedy. It would only be a waste of time."
"jjo999","10","4","7","4 June 2005"," Funny and pretty realistic too!
","I usually don't laugh as many times as I did while watching Meet the Parents. This comedy was hilarious and I enjoyed watching the relationship between Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller on the screen. One of the things I liked most about this movie was that it stayed focused on the plot. It didn't go off in different directions and it maintained a sense of reality that a lot of comedies lack. At the same time, it was funny from beginning to end. I'd have to say that another thing that makes this movie work well is that the relationship between Gaylord (Greg) and Pam is already in progress from the start of the movie so the viewer is immediately able to get to know the two of them and the relationship they have with each other. I have no complaints about this movie."

I honestly laughed more and harder during the trailer for ""Emperor's New Groove"".<br/><br/>The only fun or interesting characters were DeNiro, Blythe Danner and Ben Stiller.  Almost everyone else was a major irritation.  Especially, Teri Polo's character, Pam.  She turned me off from the second she took the cell phone call over the guy on his knee saying he loved her.<br/><br/>There were so many long, painful periods between the few laughs, I felt in agony.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you insist on seeing this, I recommend waiting til it's in the bargain area of the video store."
"tmpj","5","5","10","1 July 2010"," Hard to warm up to it.....
","Frankly, I did not find the film to be very funny or entertaining. It seems that the measure of a film now-a-days is not how much it entertains, but how well it does at the box office. Some pretty lousy films have done well with ticket sales, while some other films have had something to say, but have fallen short of the dollar mark. This was an OK film, but not one that I would call a ""must see"" movie. And then, for it to spawn a sequel is beyond all belief. I tried to give the movie a fair watching--after all, I assumed that with De Niro on the screen there would be much there to watch--but I kept finding myself mouthing off the words of the kids in the back seat of the van ..."" are we there yet??"" De Niro has a broad spectrum, a big range for his acting talents. But he is an extraordinary actor who, it seems, falls flat on his face when he is not cast as an extraordinary character. It was awfully big of him to take the role of the father, but it felt more like casting Humphrey Bogart as an extra. And as for Ben Stiller...he still has a ways to go to establish a screen persona. His character was somewhat nebulous...though he did well at defining how vulnerable the character was. Comparing Stiller to De Niro, or even to his father, Jerry, is something of an unfair comparison, but he has yet to come up with that defining character or characteristic. The situations are stretched somewhat out of proportion, and Jay Roach's direction works far better with Mike Myers, where reckless abandon of plot and characters are the rule and not the exception. Based on what I saw in this film, I am in no hurry to see ""The Fockers"". I only recommend this film if you have nothing better to do."

","This movie might very well be one of the best executed comedies I've ever seen! Most of the jokes and situations are predictable but they are executed so well that it's funny nevertheless.<br/><br/>The key element of the movie are the two male lead characters played by Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro basicaly plays 'Robert De Niro the guy who played dozens of gangster roles' which because of that makes all off his scene's fun to watch at. Just the way he looks through his eyes at times is enough to make you laugh. He perfectly knows how to make fun of his image. Owen Wilson also shows up, in a fun role.<br/><br/>The timing in this movie is spot on. The movie is filled with jokes and good comical situations. Director Jay Roach shows that he also can handle other comedies beside the ""Austin Powers"" movies.

"DavidSim240183","9","3","5","25 November 2003"," One of those rare comedies that has everything!
","When I first heard about this film, I had my doubts Robert De Niro could do comedy. His previous work has never really embraced the art of slapstick. But I'm happy to say he pulled this particular role off in spades. Meet the Parents and Midnight Run are among his finest comedies because of the way they skillfully avoid conventional clichés. <br/><br/>It begins with male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller, and yes, Focker is his actual name) wanting to propose to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). But just as he's about to pop the question, he learns her sister Debbie is about to get married. But her fiancé asked her father's permission first, so Greg decides to do the same before he marries Pam.<br/><br/>He uses Debbie's wedding as an opportunity to meet Pam's parents, where he can ask for permission. So far, so good. But things quickly take a downward spiral for Greg. Pam's father Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) takes an instant dislike to Greg, (being a male nurse doesn't help matters) and in his eyes, Greg can't do a thing right.<br/><br/>Much to Greg's consternation, Jack was in the CIA for 34 years. Jack is an expert at spotting lies, and Greg's eagerness to please leads him to tell harmless white lies that balloon into an elaborate web of lies. They become so elaborate (Greg is a dab-hand at cat-milking) even Greg can't keep up with them. Because of this, every attempt he makes to please Jack backfires in a spectacular fashion.<br/><br/>From losing the cat, Mr Jinks (who Jack is crazy about), to burning down the wedding altar, Greg is a potential accident waiting to happen. The reason I like Meet the Parents is because it's one of those rare comedies that has everything. Ben Stiller does an excellent job trying to appear like a suitable husband to be, and making a complete mess of things (the dinner table scene is a definite highlight). Not to mention how hilarious it is watching Greg back himself into corners and then trying to squirm his way out of them.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is also excellent, using his trademark sinister characteristics to great effect when judging Greg. They both have a terrific chemistry, and every gag in the film is tailor-made for their talents. A lot of people can relate to Greg in this film, because of meeting prospective parents to be and how to relate to them properly. A lot of their ""heart to hearts"" are hilarious, especially the way they degenerate into nightmarish situations for Greg:<br/><br/>""Right now look Focker. I'm a patient man. That's what 19 months in a Vietnamese prison camp will do to you. Now I will be watching you. Studying your every move. And if I find that you are trying to corrupt my first-born child, I will bring you down baby! I will bring you down to Chinatown!""<br/><br/>Mrs Byrnes is good too (Blythe Danner), who's brilliantly quirky and all the more likable for it. She's the only member of the family that likes Greg, while the others unfairly crucify him every chance they get. Although at times, it's understandable why they do.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson puts in an excellent performance as Pam's oh-so-perfect ex-boyfriend Kevin. He stands out very well among the whole family, while some of the others fade into the background. That may be the only complaint I have. With so many family members present they're not given enough to do.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, the film has an ending that is very satisfying. Greg going insane at an air-hostess is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a film, as is Greg getting a few things off his chest about being Jack's son-in-law.<br/><br/>Overall, the jokes range from small to enormous. Some are packed away into the background for you to find. Like a rare flower Greg buys to impress Jack. To the casual observer its a flower pot filled with soil. Because the flower hasn't bloomed yet. In a later scene, the pot is put with the other flowers, where it looks really out of place. Its jokes like these that impress the most for the way the filmmakers don't draw attention to them. Subtle puns that only further illustrate how far apart Greg stands from the Byrnes clan. Which is why you feel such sympathy for Greg while you're laughing at his misfortunes. A rare thing.<br/><br/>A magnificent film, and the best comedy I've seen since Groundhog Day. Because of it's simple theme and a stellar cast, Meet the Parents becomes something quite special. It avoids all of the obvious pitfalls, it never becomes tedious, and there's quite a bit of subtlety to the slapstick as the embarrassing humiliations escalate steadily.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the sequel!"
"exdumpling","10","3","5","21 November 2002"," Hilarious!
","I noticed that some people have said that the gags in this movie are unfunny and predictable... they complained about not very many laugh-out-loud gags. I completely disagree.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the smartest comedies of the last few years. It does not rely on gross-out gags (like Something About Mary, etc...) and still manages to be hilarious. All of the humor is contained in the intelligence of the writing and the tenseness of the situations in the movie. Yes, you feel very sorry for Greg, but it feels OK in this movie to laugh at his expense.<br/><br/>When I initially saw the previews for this movie a few years ago I had no desire to see it, as it seemed like it would be just like any other generic comedy. I only ended up seeing it because I had nothing better to do some random Friday night. I was very pleasantly surprised!<br/><br/>This movie is not at all a generic comedy. The gags are brilliantly crafted and completely original. I think that people who think this movie is generic do not appreciate intelligent, non-bathroom humor. The praying scene and Jack's poem at the dinner table are brilliant. Also Greg's run-in with the flight attendant is great.<br/><br/>Maybe the thing that really did it for me in this movie is that, despite their weirdness, Pam's family is completely believable and real. I actually know people like that. There is a whole culture of upper-class people who really do behave like the Byrnes family in this movie. I thought it was hilarious that the movie was making fun of that culture (I am also reminded of the groom's family in My Big Fat Greek Wedding). That part really struck home with me and made the movie even more funny.<br/><br/>Great movie! Not generic at all! Very original and laugh-out-loud funny."

"Megabuck","5","4","8","7 October 2004"," Good idea, shame about the movie
","On the inside of Meet the Parents is a great plot idea, struggling to get out. Actually, that's not strictly true - the plot is actually realized pretty well; it's the supposed timing and unrelenting nature of the events that, for me, make this film no better than mediocre.<br/><br/>The premise is simple: About to propose to Pam (Teri Polo), his girlfriend, Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) realises he's expected to ask her father's permission first. Of course, Jack (Robert de Niro) turns out to be every suitor's worst nightmare: demanding, condescending, belittling. Worse, it seems Greg can do nothing right.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film documents everything that happens over a weekend at the parental home. Pam's sister is getting married, so it's a big get-together with family and friends. The battering starts immediately; Greg's luggage goes missing. Jack makes snide comments over the colour of his rental car and choice in pets. Greg even causes chaos when opening a bottle of wine.<br/><br/>He is mocked for his choice of career - he's a nurse. Guess what: half the guests are doctors. He's intimidated by Pam's previous boyfriend, the seemingly perfect Kevin (Owen Wilson). His surname makes him an easy target. He manages to lose the family's pet cat, so he buys a replacement which looks nearly identical - which promptly tears the wedding dress to shreds. His luggage turns up, and Jack searches it, finding a pile of women's clothes - because, of course, it's not his bag.<br/><br/>It transpires that Jack is a former CIA agent - except Greg becomes convinced he's still involved in some covert operation. So he blurts out what he knows - and, wouldn't you just know it, he's put his foot in it again.<br/><br/>Taken individually, each incident is at least passably funny; some are hilarious; some make you cringe on Greg's behalf. But it's the whole thing - the relentless progression from one minor disaster to the next - where I felt the movie fell down. At first, it's pretty funny, watching this guy make a complete fool of himself; but when it goes on and on, and you realize you're in for an hour where nothing, NOTHING goes right, it just gets depressingly tedious.<br/><br/>And it's not all perfect. The surname gag grew old fairly quickly; the way people addressed him using only his surname was downright rude rather than funny; one leaking toilet would NOT flood a yard, no matter how full the septic tank (and what kind of planning is it to hold a big wedding party with the tank ready to blow?) The happy ending was also pretty unconvincing.<br/><br/>I haven't really said anything about the performances. I felt everyone did a reasonable job, nobody excelled. de Niro *can* do comedy - Brazil, Midnight Run - but here, I thought he was too deadpan, and the role just a bit *too* psycho. Stiller was a good choice for the lead, and Owen Wilson is great as the all-too-perfect ex. But, as I said, it's the pacing that spoils things. If they had spread the pain out a little - shown meetings over several weekends - along with scaling it back a little, I'd have enjoyed it a lot more."

","This is a film that takes misunderstandings and awkwardness to new levels with a Jewish male nurse named Greg Focker (Stiller) visiting his girlfriend's parents' house during a wedding about to take place for her sister. He attempts to fit in to the social circle of this traditional family, who has their own set of rules and specific ways of living that keeps him thinking on his toes and attempting to fake it till he makes it.<br/><br/>Greg tries to make an impression with the overly protective father, Jack Byrnes, played by Robert De Niro, who has a clandestine past and is growing suspicious due to mix-ups that put Greg in a negative light for being the right man for his prized daughter. He has to drop a few habits and pick up new ones to keep up. If it could get any more worse the ex, Kevin, played by Owen Wilson, is on top of everything without evening trying, not to mention close to the father and on good terms with Greg's girlfriend. You could say he's got a lot on his plate, as he's the extreme of polite and can't say what's really on his mind out loud in order to save face in front of others.<br/><br/>""Meet the Parents"" was fresh for its time and still holds up as a situational comedy with some relating points about meeting others for the first time or just trying to be one of the gang. It can make you cringe for the main character as he fumbles to do things right by these new people with hilarious trial and error. Just in time, some of the zany pile ups begin to get far-fetched but is saved by seeing Greg in the cross between imploding and running away from everything going wrong by his own hands. This is a Hollywood film, so some sentiment is going to be offered in order to give it that finishing touch. This was a well-done film as it steadily paced the timing of its jokes instead of trying too hard to completely shock the audience. That's what gives it its replay value to this day as the scenarios are memorable, not to mention identifiable if still exaggerated for comic relief."

","Greg ""Gaylord"" Focker played by Ben Stiller is a male nurse who is invited to meet is fiancé to be Pam's parents so that he can get their permission. However, former CIA Agent Jack Byrnes played by Robert De Niro puts Greg through a living hell before anything happens. While staying at the house he finds out that his luggage is misplace by the airport and later gets the third degree from Jack. With Jack, being a former CIA agent he uses tactics he learned to make sure that Greg is the right man for his little girl. The motif based around Greg's struggles thought the whole movie. From the struggles with his luggage, the male nurse insults, to the invasive questioning from Jack. Yet being a heavy struggle for him the comedy is flowing like all movies that star Ben Stiller. Furthermore, although Jack does play sarcastic, aggressive parents there are many comic scenes that make the movie funny as well. Next, Kevin played by Owen Wilson is trying to get back Pam the girl he had lost in his past. During time that Kevin had met Greg, Kevin keeps telling Greg about the good times that him and Pam had in their past. This puts a little frustration as well as comical competition between them. Since her family is completely overwhelmed with Kevin, Greg has to go out of his way to show Pam's family he is the right man her. Another one of the more comic parts of the movie is when the cat goes to the next-door neighbors but Greg thinks he is lost and tries to replace it with a stray. When the stray gets into the house the wedding dress of Pam's sisters shredded by the cat, yet everyone else is at dinner. While Greg is placing calls to find out about his luggage, Jack is finding about the cat and also finding out more about Greg's past. The final draw is when her family is insulting him about not becoming a doctor and his name, which is Gaylord. Whenever Jack gets the rest of the information back about Greg, after Jack finds out that everything that he said was true he feels that Greg should be placed back into his family's inner circle once again. But by that time Greg is getting on the plane to head back and gets arrested by security for attacking a flight attendant and Jack has to use his CIA Agent security to get him out of trouble. Throughout this movie, there have always been struggles against Greg but the audience will laugh through every one of them."

","Meet the Parents. Something that any couple does not like doing. We've all had our experiences of bad first impressions, failed conversations, and overall just embarrassing moments the first time we meet the parents. Meet the Parents (the film) takes all these to the next level showing how bad a first impression may get. Doesn't seem like something that can make a story but it holds its own. Just look at the two leads and you'll know why the film works.<br/><br/>Greg is a male nurse with a lovely girlfriend named Pam. Greg is considering asking her to marry him. Greg, however, must meet the parents first. He hopes to make a good first impression then do an old school move and ask Pam's father for his daughters hand in marriage. Greg sees this as polite while everyone else sees it as a waste of time. Fate seems to have other plans for Greg as everything that could go wrong does go wrong and he tries to impress the hard nosed father bent on not letting anyone take his daughter away from him.<br/><br/>The film follows Greg for the most part as he struggles to impress Pam's stern father, Jack, and caring mother, Dina. Stiller really does a good job as the struggling Greg. He has some great spurts of humor and the pool scene is one of his funniest moments to date. I couldn't have seen anyone else in the role of Greg other then Ben Stiller. He is just too good in these kind of roles. I really do think this was one of his best roles of his career.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is one of Hollywood's top actors. He's one of your greatest actors in history. To see him in a comedy did not make much sense to me after seeing him in films such as The Godfather and The Deer Hunter. However, I underestimated De Niro. He has a great sense of humor and a great comedy style. His seriousness makes it all the funnier when something wrong happens and his constant saying of Greg's last name ""Focker"" brings a laugh every time.<br/><br/>Meet the Parents is well written, well acted, and well directed. There are a few slow parts and a few unnecessary parts. Somethings you know could just never happen but this is why it is a comedy film. The impossible happens. De Niro and Stiller propel the film to being a decent film. I enjoyed it and like seeing it every once and a while. There is nothing bad in the film. No heavy language, no nudity, no violence. Just good old fun for a family audience. <br/><br/>3/5 stars"
"general-melchett","9","2","3","19 February 2007"," Great and occasionally cringe-worthy comedy...
","Meet The Parents is far better in terms of genuine comedy than most of the cr*p we get in cinemas nowadays. It has its cringe-worthy moments, it has its hilarious happenings and it has its occasional disgusting humour (especially when Focker flushes the toilet and covers the back garden in poo), but it actually manages to fit in a real plot and real character, rather than just feeling like some sort of overlong sketch show. A lot of the humour relies heavily on Focker getting himself into very sticky situations - and some of the more serious things will have you cringing to death. As the movie continues, luck gets worse for Focker and the cringe factor gets higher, until the end in which everything is resolved. From cats to shrines, Focker finds himself having trouble with everything he encounters. The ending sets the scene for the sequel - which was just as good, if not better. Sometimes the emotions become painful in the film - especially at the dinner table when Jack reads the poem in memory of his mother - which only helps to make Focker get into even more trouble. There's nothing better than building up the tension... 9/10"
"Stampsfightclub","8","2","3","5 January 2007"," enjoyable comedy
","My View on the narrative:.<br/><br/>Not being a fan of the slapstick comedy drama as such I had my doubts over this film, however I'm glad to say I was surprised when sitting down to watch a completely daft unrealistic comedy but that is simply good entertainment. Ben Stiller (There's something about Mary) stars as Greg Focker, a simple nervous soul put in a vulnerable position when his girlfriend takes him to meet her parents. The simple idea spells disaster and although it's a very ambitious plot, the nature behind it is there with physical humour (watch for the garden scene) which although not laugh out loud is easy to smile to. I often felt embarrassed for the characters as this film has plenty of those 'awkward' silence moments none of us want to be involved in when meeting the parents but the fact that this conforms to every person's nightmare by the central character Stiller making a complete hash of everything is comic genius. <br/><br/>Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>Surprised to see him in such a role, I was very intrigued. Gone are the days when we would see him pull on the boxing gloves to fight powerfully in Oscar winning Raging Bull and the days when he would mutter 'are you talking to me?' Saying this, I am very happy to say that for me he made this film great. His observation tough guy image is reflecting in his dominance of his household over his children and guests. The comic humour De Niro presents is obviously a contrast to his tough guys days but the 'bitchy' hard hitting lines he mutters simply made me smile throughout and he was the star of this film for me. <br/><br/>Synopsis.<br/><br/>Meet the parents conforms to the comedy genre brilliantly and through the sensationally stereotyped Robert De Niro as the dominant intimidating father the film is a joy to watch. Although certain scenes were too ambitious for my liking but there's no question its an enjoyable watch from start to finish."

","MEET THE PARENTS, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller. You go, guys! My favorite parts were when Greg (Ben Stiller) accidentally hit Debbie (Nicole DeHuff) in the eye and nose with a volleyball, verbally abused the flight attendant (Kali Rocha), which resulted in an interrogation from Norm (Bernie Sheredy), and whenever he goofed off. I also laughed when Jack (Robert De Niro), and when he imitated a bugle trumpeting a fanfare right before saying, ""People, people, people, come get your revised itineraries."" I thought that he was really psychotic. This was because he couldn't seem to stop messing things up for Greg. Plus, he expected his daughters' (Nicole DeHuff and Teri Polo) boyfriends (Thomas McCarthy and Ben Stiller) to meet him and Dina (Blythe Danner) and then ask his permission before proposing to them. Also, I thought that Pam (Teri Polo) looked very beautiful in all the fancy clothing that she wore, especially the maid of honor dress she wore at Bob (Thomas McCarthy) and Debbie's wedding. I especially liked Jack's tuxedo, especially with the top hat. If you ask me, that gave it a nice touch. The ending, however, made no sense to me. It's hard for me to explain why. In conclusion, I highly recommend this smash hit to all you Robert De Niro or Ben Stiller fans out there who have not seen it.

Before he asks Pam (Teri Polo) to marry him, he would ask for her father's approval. The father, Jack (Robert De Niro) is sort of this suspicious and overprotective father that just wants ""the best"" for his daughter. He would give disapproving glances at Greg, which causes Greg to have numbers of flops and seem to be nervous ... all the time, which causes Jack to hate Greg more and more. We then find out Jack is a former CIA agent that has been to different countries and has a lie detector in his ""private office"" downstairs.<br/><br/>Comedies are pretty predictable. Especially recent ones. We know about 100% that Greg and Jack are going to be happy in the end, approve of each other, and not try to kill each other. And that is what happens. What I liked about this movie is that it's not predictable-predictable, it's more like - you just enjoy it. You have a mindless head on top of you and you just want pure entertainment. Not some serious dialogue with Oscar-worthy performances, but just have a good time like what movies are made for. There are a few hilarious scenes between Stiller and De Niro. They just seem to be having fun, which is a good thing because it's always nice to watch actors have fun on screen. Stiller seems happy that he gets to work with De Niro and De Niro seems happy that he is in a light comedy and doesn't really need to put a single effort in it because he is almost considered ""legendary"" in modern Hollywood.<br/><br/>So, it's worth your time. I saw this film two times and I won't be afraid to make it three. It's totally harmless. You're not going to really think about this movie after you seen it, but you're satisfied because you like it. It has very, very funny dialogue between characters and nice physical comedy. Ben Stiller is probably not a bad actor after all - just needs some motivation. And Robert De Niro steals almost every single scene in the movie. They're a good duo. Very, very enjoyable to watch. Watch this film when you just need a light-hearted comedy that doesn't require great use of intelligence."

","This movie was really good, Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller have unbelievable chemistry. This movie is very funny, almost every scene has a piece of comedy in it. The race to the house was my favorite scenes, the stop lights just added such good comedy. Great casting in this movie, poor Nicole DeHuff, her career shortened earlier this year, but this movie will allow us to remember her and she will be missed. Her scene with her getting hit by the volleyball was a hit scene for Meet The Parents.<br/><br/>The only downside to this film is from the middle of the film, it seems to get dumber and dumber, but the introduction of the name Gaylord Focker made almost everyone laugh. Who would of thought one name would be a hit line.<br/><br/>Overall, 8 stars, very good, and 5 years later, would be joined by an even bigger sequel."

","I know it's a bit weird, but I saw ""Meet the Fockers"" before I saw this movie. The reason for that is because I hadn't had the chance yet to see this one, when I went with some friends to the cinema and they all wanted to see the sequel. They all loved the first one, so I didn't mind giving ""Meet the Fockers"" a try. And all I can say about it is that I was rather disappointed by it. The only thing that made me believe this one was better, was because my friends didn't like the sequel all that much either.<br/><br/>In this movie we see Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Ben Stiller) who wants to ask his girlfriend (Teri Polo) to marry him. But first he'll have to meet her parents, because her strict father (Robert DeNiro) expects to be asked for his daughter's hand before she can accept. Normally meeting the parents of your fiancée shouldn't be too bad, but Jack Byrnes is a former CIA agent who never has liked any of his daughter's boyfriends and Greg Focker won't be an exception to that rule. He makes Greg's life miserable, while Murphy's Law does the rest by turning Greg into a master of disaster...<br/><br/>I have to admit that I didn't have too high expectation about this movie after seeing the sequel, but now I know one thing for sure: they should have stopped with the first one, because this is an excellent comedy. I was laughing all the time and really liked it enormously. Even though I'm not a big Ben Stiller fan (I hated ""Zoolander"" and wasn't all too keen on ""Duplex"" and ""Meet the Fockers""), I must say that he did a great job in this movie. Together with Robert De Niro he's the main reason why you should watch this movie. I give it at least a 7.5/10"

I thought it was really sweet the way Greg tried proposing to his fiance with the group of school children holding up signs ""Will you Marry Me?"" and it was really funny when the kids had trouble spelling it. Every time (Robert De Niro) calls greg by his last name ""Fokker"" it brought me to a whole new round of tears and laughter.

In ""Meet the Parents,"" I'm strongly reminded of ""Blind Date"" (with Bruce Willis and Kim Bassinger)---same sort of uncomfortable, unfulfilling character exchanges, totally predictable storyline, and enough half-baked, poorly directed physical comedy to make you urp your granola.

","In comedic films, the plot is often a secondary consideration. Like an unplanned vacation, the destination is not what's important--it's the journey itself that matters. Meet the Parents is a predictable plot based on an overused cliché, and I give it two thumbs up. What counts here is not the plot, it's the humor and the performances that make it worth the ride.<br/><br/>Jay Roach is the director who inflicted Austin Powers on humanity. Fortunately, he is able to dial it down a notch here and give us humor that is a little more subtle--not much, but every bit helps. Ben Stiller plays the unfortunately named Greg Focker, who is on his way to meet the parents of the woman he loves. His character here is almost a reprise of his character in There's Something About Mary. Greg is desperate to make a good impression on his girlfriend's parents and his general anxiety turns into full-blown terror when he meets Pam's father, Jack Byrnes. Jack (played by Robert DeNiro) is a rather humorless man who deep down believes that no man could be good enough for his little girl.<br/><br/>Greg has been led to believe that Jack is a retired florist, but he soon discovers that Jack has an entirely different, and much darker, past. DeNiro is perfectly cast as the foreboding father figure, and DeNiro plays the part superbly. Greg soon discovers that even the most benign chatter is a kind of test, and he feels--quite rightly--that he is failing miserably.<br/><br/>Virtually every character in this story lies to another character at one time or another. Much of the humor revolves around little lies that necessitate either full confessions or even bigger lies. The characters choose bigger lies almost every time. (""Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive""). The biggest laughs come as we watch Greg trying to extricate himself from one of his self-spun webs or as we watch Jack setting another trap.<br/><br/>The tone of the film reminded me of Father of the Bride. Like that film, the predictability of the plot doesn't really matter. We know from the beginning how it will ultimately end. Films like this rise or fall on the strength of the writing and the power of the performances. While there are thoroughly adequate supporting performances here, the real dynamic comes in the chemistry between Stiller and DeNiro. <br/><br/>This is not great art or profound social commentary. But the audience roared as they watched these characters play out situations that were close enough to real to make them feel the embarrassment and frustration of the central characters. If you don't get a chance to see it at the theater, save it for a video rental. For extra fun, invite your future in-laws and see if they think it's funny."

","""Meet the Parents"" (2000) is a professionally produced comical take on self-sabotage. The story is about a man, Greg Focker played by Ben Stiller, who sets out to gain approval to wed from the father of his girlfriend, Pam Byrnes played by Teri Polo. The father, Jack Byrnes played by Robert De Niro, pushes all the buttons to allow Greg to make himself appear as an unfit partner. This film is hilarious and filled with lessons to live by.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, viewers will realize there is two stories in this film. The main being from the point of view of Gregg and the secondary is about Jack and his love of his first-born child, Pam. The film has moments of emotional impact, mostly sadness for Greg, but I feel it is more educational than emotional. The lesson is: be true to yourself and allow others to formulate their own opinion after seeing the real you. Overall, this is a great comedy."

So many times you think that Greg is finally going to make a good impression but he messes things like only him can, sending you into inevitable laughter.

Only Jack isn't the trusting kind.<br/><br/>This starts off pretty much as expected with awkward uncomfortable interactions. The movie goes from awkward laughs to uncomfortable silences. The lie detector scene is especially funny. What makes it problematic for me is that Focker is a bit of a weasel. He's constantly trying to lie his way out of things. It's not a likable trait.<br/><br/>I'm not talking about the cat lie. That's a defensible move. But he's too weasely even when it makes no sense. When Kevin (Owen Wilson) is getting his goat, Greg tries to puff himself up even though Jack is right there who could easily out him. It's in his nature and that's a problem.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of fun, and the ending is heart warming. But I have to downgrade it a little for Greg's personality. Ben Stiller plays him a little too pathetic when it would be better to have a little confidence. It's better to have him as a reasonable nice man who's dealing with a crazy Jack. He needs to be more a straight man."

"postmanwhoalwaysringstwice","7","1","1","27 November 2007"," Stiller Strikes Again
","It's not entirely clear why Ben Stiller continues to get work and acclaim for his performances, since he really doesn't do much at all. His main role in any given film is to stand there and look dumbfounded as the world falls apart around him. He played one of his most successful versions of this when he played Gaylord Focker. The first time was in ""Meet the Parents"", which was a remake of a little seen independent film. Stiller plays a male nurse, a detail that punctuates several of the running jokes. He goes home with his fiancée for a wedding, at which point Murphy's Law strikes, his patience is tested, and all of that.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro is here too, fresh off his uncharacteristic comic turn in ""Analyze This"". He plays the fiancée's overbearing, ultra-critical, highly suspicious father. It's a role that was originally slated for Christopher Walken, who would have ruined it with an added sense of creepiness. The main meat of the film comes from the tug-of-war between DeNiro's psychological testing and Stiller's struggle to be heard and accepted. This is a classic formula that works surprisingly well as a modern-day screwball comedy, given the weaknesses in Stiller and his irritating and frequent co-star Owen Wilson.<br/><br/>""Meet the Parents"" is a formulaic comedy with a bit of a dark streak. It's a decent movie with some memorable bits, but it's more of a trial to get through than enjoyable which is something ironed out in time for the sequel."
"Isaac5855","7","1","1","28 March 2007"," DeNiro and Stiller make a surprisingly effective comic duo...
","MEET THE PARENTS was the surprise hit of 2000 that firmly established comic credentials for dramatic actor Robert DeNiro and put Ben Stiller on the map. Ben plays Greg Focker, a male nurse who after becoming engaged to a schoolteacher (Teri Polo) nervously agrees to accompany her to her sister's wedding in order to meet his future father-in-law (DeNiro). Greg is naturally freaking out and try as he may, once he and Dad meet, everything that can go wrong for Greg does and it just gets worse for him as the story progresses. Stiller is wonderful as the hassled and harried everyman whose intentions are always good but the end results are never what he planned. But the real surprise here is two-time Oscar winner DeNiro in a deft comic turn as Jack Burns, the father-in-law from hell who turns out to be a former CIA agent. DeNiro proves to be equally adept at comedy here, instinctively knowing when to take center stage and when to let young Stiller shine. Polo is attractive as Pam, the woman caught between these two guys and Blythe Danner is lovely as Jack's wife and Pam's mother. Owen Wilson also provides some grins as Pam's ex-fiancée who Jack adores. Though the misery that gets heaped on Greg throughout the length of the film seems to be a bit much, the smart screenplay and attractive cast make for an entertaining comic romp. Followed by a sequel called MEET THE FOCKERS."

Ben Stiller wants to marry his girlfriend but before the proposal he thinks best to meet her parents. However, he chooses the most inappropriate time as the DeNiro house - the bride's parents - are busy with the wedding of their other daughter. Stiller tries to win DeNiro's sympathy by paying attention to his rules (he cuts smoking and having sex - just for a while of course). However, the groom's family - including Polo's ex-boyfriend - seem to snob Stiller's name and job by their way. They think Stiller is a stranger and they ignore him by the first moment. However, he turns to a hero when he finds DeNiro's cat but he turns to a jerk again a little later when the real cat is found. As a result, he becomes nervous and his bad luck leads to a series of goofs: he loses his suitcase at the airport, turns the garden into a swamp, sets on fire the wedding place and breaks the vase with what-is-left by DeNiro's mother. And that's where the people laugh. By watching this bad luck. Stiller tries to prove that he values more than what they think and at last he manage to marry his beloved girlfriend... but there is something else in the air. DeNiro wants to meet Stiller's parents... You will understand my thoughts if you watch this film by Stiller's eyes, which I believe was the ideal choice for the role. DeNiro remains in our minds as the old-CIA agent, not that this matters a lot in the movie. Many trivia will appear however in ""Meet the Fockers"" where this unique surname is used. This is a famous movie, a great comedy, there is nothing more to say... Just watch it! And you will not lose."

","With this and ANALYZE THIS and MIDNIGHT RUN, De Niro proves that he's one of our best comic actors.  And MEET THE PARENTS is one of the best comedies ever made.  Ben Stiller is great, too, but he's on familiar ground here. It's good to see a funny movie that's character-centered rather than one that relies on dumb and gross sight-gags.

","""Meet the Parents"" was the funniest movie I've seen this year. Jokes were hilarious, especially Stiller's name jokes and cat milking joke, and the plot sure was superior to other comedy movies. Especially, I enjoyed the pair up of Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller, my two favorite drama and comedy actors. After ""Analyze This"", De Niro once again proves that he can play a funny character as well as mafia. Ben Stiller's character was similar to ""There's something about Mary"", goofy but likable.   I heard that Jim Carey was offered to do Ben Stiller's part at first but I think Stiller was perfect for the role."

","While I found Meet the Parents to be an overall enjoyable experience, I didn't think it was a great movie.  The movie tried too hard to include as many gags as possible, forsaking believability in return for a few forced laughs.  If it had been toned down a little bit it would have been much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Actually in many regards it has the same foibles as Something about Mary.

"deadkerouac","7","1","1","6 April 2002"," Amusing...somewhat
","Ben Stiller stars in director Jay Roach's MEET THE PARENTS, a somewhat amusing farce about a male nurse named (yes) Greg Focker, who travels with his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) to her family home, not only because of Pam's sister's impending nuptials, but also because it will give Greg a chance to meet her parents and ask her father for Pam's hand in marriage. Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner, an onscreen couple you thought you'd never see, are absolutely believable as Pam's folks, especially in their first scene with the younger couple. Unfortunately, this is perhaps the film that has made De Niro into a comedic rather than dramatic actor (THE KING OF COMEDY wasn't meant to be completely amusing), and you'll begin to miss the Bobby of old (TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS, even the action-packed RONIN).<br/><br/>I'll admit that I enjoyed this film, but only in a few scenes. Greg's scene with the female ticket agent on the airplane was memorable, as were the scenes where Jack (De Niro), apparently ex-CIA, hooks Greg up to the lie detector, and where Greg does too much to impress the others during a game of water volleyball.<br/><br/>What I did love about the film were its subtle touches, especially in the way Greg is treated, because it's happened to me--it's happened to a lot of us. Ever say something that causes other people to look at you and go, ""What the heck are you talking about?"" It's happened to me several times, and it happens to Greg. A lot. That's where the amusement in MEET THE PARENTS lies, and I hope that MEET THE FOCKERS, a sequel due out next year, keeps some of that. 7/10<br/><br/>Side issue: the film is apparently based on an earlier (independent) film by screenwriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke. I just hope this film (the 2000 version) wasn't made just to make more $$$ on an older, funnier film. It'd sound too much like a remake that way. Personally, I wouldn't want to see CLERKS remade with hot young stars instead of the New Jersey slackers we grew to love."

Ben Stiller plays the boyfriend with a most unusual name who becomes very uncomfortable in getting to know his girlfriend's father. There are many goofy moments in ""Meet the Parents"" that I didn't believe, but the fact is I laughed alot while watching it. Only DeNiro and Stiller could pull it off and make it so funny. Blythe Danner (the mother), Teri Polo (the girlfriend), and Owen Wilson (the girlfriend's ex-boyfriend) join in on the fun.

His little white lies -- a domino effect begun when his girlfriend whispers ""Oh, yeah, and we're not living together,"" as they arrive -- keep coming back to bite him in the backside.

I think his girlfriend was the most maddening character of all, not taking up for him and basically setting him up for failure.

","Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Blythe Danner and Owen Wilson star in this 2000 comedy. Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Stiller) is a male nurse who wants to marry his longtime girlfriend, Pam Byrnes (Polo). He decides to go with her to meet her parents, Jack (De Niro) and Dina (Danner) for the weekend in honor of her sister's wedding. Things start to go very wrong for Gaylord when he tries to get Jack's approval, but eventually wins his support and proposes to Pam.

I have seen it. I have seen him handle very funny roles, and even dramatic ones with skill and flair. He appears to be asleep through most of this film, just saying his lines when it is time to say them, without real emotion or concern for how bad this film really is.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro can act. Most people have seen that. He is one of the greatest actors ever. But his most recent roles have been... well... less than wonderful. He needs a new agent -- today -- before his legacy is destroyed.<br/><br/>The film has a decent premise -- we have all had that awkward moment when we need to meet the parents of our significant other. And this film had some real potential to shine. But the writing is so formula-based and lack-luster that one has to wonder if any of the main cast members bothered to read the script before they accepted these roles.<br/><br/>Just skip this."
"PADMark1984","Null","2","4","8 July 2004"," Sinister Comedy
","Ben Stiller is quite a funny guy. He has one of those rubber faces that you can instantly crack up looking at. He plays Greg Focker, a male nurse in love with Meg Byrnes. The two are blissfully happy...all until it comes to meeting her parents. There's the charming, helpful mom and the ex CIA (psychotic???) dad (Robert DiNiro). I won't blabber on too much about the story except to say that you can tell just what's going to happen...one disaster after another. It's funny stuff...sometimes, with the slapstick of Stiller, but DeNiro's character may be hard to swallow and leave a bad taste as he interrogates and sometimes cooly humiliates Greg. DeNiro does play a good part; the naive father wanting the best for his daughter and no man is good enough for her. Good performances all round, but don't expect to be laughing your heart out as this film has a quite uneven balance of slapstick and sinister dryness. *** out of *****"
"bob the moo","Null","2","4","7 July 2002"," Funny  but it gets difficult to laugh at Greg's misfortune
","Greg Focker is ready to propose to his girlfriend Pam but before he does he finds out that she would expect him to ask her father first.  On the visit to meet her parents however nothing goes to plan and Pam's father Jack dislikes Greg immediately.  Matters are only made worse when Greg begins to realise what Jack used to do for a living.<br/><br/>I first saw this in a cinema and recently watched it again on video.  In the cinema I roared and on video I laughed but not as much  the crowd helped the first time.  However it is still very funny  Focker is the most put-upon man I've ever seen!  However with this comes the main problem  I almost felt too sorry for him to be able to laugh at his misfortunes.  This isn't help by the fact that most of Jack's doctor friends are really unpleasant obnoxious people who I wanted to slap.  However much of it is still funny but the final act is difficult because he is so downcast you can't help but feel sympathetic rather than amused.<br/><br/>Stiller does a good character but really is almost too realistic  like I said, I felt a bit guilty laughing.  De Niro and comedy are not always best friends (he has some good ones and some real bad ones), happily here he is really good sending up his tough guy image spot on.  Of the rest of the cast I have nothing to say, except that Owen Wilson has a great cameo playing up his laid back character really well.<br/><br/>Overall this is really funny even if it lacks subtlety.  However it is really a bad point that, once the misfortunes begin getting worse and more severe we do begin to feel for Greg and dislike those who mock him.  However when we laugh we also mock him and therefore I found the second half a little harder to laugh at  mind you it was still funny for the majority."

","Magazine reviews, word of mouth and trailers had me expecting to see the next all American comedy hit since 'There's something about Mary'.  What i experienced when i sat down to watch this film was a film that aims to achieve such accalaids as its '...Mary' but instead offers a flat, dull comedy that does offer some very funny set pieces, (most of which had been used in the trailer).<br/><br/>Stiller is consistant as the likable romantic lead who cannot please his future father in-law, played by DeNiro, who although is fully competent in a comedic role, is let down by a very dull character.<br/><br/>The principle for the film is very good and the set piece ideas are all potential comedy classics, but the script (which excells in new levels of dullness) and the direction, hinder these scenes form fulfilling there potential.<br/><br/>If any of you have ever seen 'The Bachelor party' with Tom Hanks, the 10 minute scene where he goes to his future in-laws house, you will see the potential this plot had.  The characters are all superior to Meet the Parents, which at the end of the day is the reason why Meet the Parents is a big let down.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, its no disaster, I've seen worse movies, but for a film that promised so much and aimed so high, it misses the target by far too big a margin for it to ever sustain its place in 'comedy-classic' territory.... 5/10."

This leaves Greg up creek without a paddle and forces him to realize that he cannot control other people's perception of him.<br/><br/>The film is among the best comedies of the early 2000's. The story's pace alone sets the film apart from other comedies. There is never a dull moment or loss of speed. Meet the Parents is smart and engaging.

Critics often associate Ben Stiller with ""trash comedies"" that favor slapstick and gross humor over intelligent humor. Yet, Robert DeNiro's presence guides the movie along and helps qualify it as the best of its class.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller's apparent cheap quality beautifully contrasts DeNiro's Oscar winning visage.

The main characters are Greg, our antagonist, his girlfriend Pam and her father Jack. Greg's main goal in this film is to win the approval of his girlfriend's father and then ask his her to marry him. What stands in Greg's way is Jack's automatic disapproval of him and a continuous strand of bad luck that hijacks his every move. Although Greg tries his best to keep a level head this back luck is only further instigated by Jack's disapproval. Although the movie is a comedy and I thought it fit into its genre quite well - it is not a movie that I found particularly ""moving"" mostly because I don't enjoy this style of movie.

","Meet Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller), a very genuine but unfortunate guy. Gaylord, better known as Greg, is madly in love with his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) and wants to marry her.  But before he can win her hand in marriage, he has to win her parents approval; a task which proves to be extremely difficult.<br/><br/>Greg and Pam go on their way to meet the parents.  Greg doesn't exactly get off to a very good start when he manages to break the urn that holds the remains of a late relative.  Pam's father Jack (Robert Di Niro) takes an instant dislike to Greg and makes it his business to push Greg to the limit and see just how far he can go to get him as far away from his daughter as possible.<br/><br/>The film is full of exceptionally funny moments.  The unfortunate events that unfold and the stupid ways in which Greg tries to cover them up, make this film worth a shot.  Granted, it's not the funniest film out there but it is very good for a laugh and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.<br/><br/>Robert Di Niro proves that he is still one of the most talented actors around, taking on the role of the control freak father and Ben Stiller settles in nicely to yet another role as the geek, trying to win his girl (Something About Mary)."

Robert De Niro also shows the lengths of his acting range as the over-protective ex CIA spy hunter dad Jack, I love the way he calls Greg by his surname FOCKER.

","Contains Spoilers! The plot?  Ben Stiller is a nurse, very much in love with Teri Polo. Just as he is about to propose, he comes to know about Teri's sister's engagement to some doctor  guy who was courteous enough to ask Teri's father before asking her sister! Obviously Ben wants to be in the good books of Teri. As a result, he decides to spend the weekend with Teri's parents (and propose to her parents, before he proposes to Teri). Of course, he screws up the weekend, with the aid of my man  Robert De Nero, who is Teri's father (surprise!) and is, in not in a mood to have a nurse as his son  in  law. A slew of idiosyncrasies exhibited by Ben soon follow, till the movie ends. The end? (Take a guess.) The movie is a war between a nurse (Ben) and an ex  C.I.A. interrogator (De Nero)  the former trying to win the heart of the latter, and the latter finding it hard to accept the former because of a lot of things, such as the former's name, profession, hatred towards cats, and a whole lot of other goofy things, which make up the movie. Ben can be looked upon with pity, considering the things he has to go through, throughout the weekend, but the movie is, by no means, a warm hearted  comedy. So, laugh your heart out on Ben, as he makes a total ass of himself (very seriously), with no sense of pathos. The humor is not merely slapstick and is, in a lot of parts, very subtle. Apart from Ben, falling off the roof of the house, making a fruitless attempt to catch De Nero's pet cat and almost setting the house on fire and making a healthy contribution to overflowing the septic tank (and blaming the cat for doing it, on top of that) the funny bits are well contained within formal conversation between Di Nero & Ben, with a stoic expression on the faces of both which makes the comedy more mordant and funny. The exchange of words between Ben & Robert which appear seething on the surface, is what gives a high to the movie. Even as Ben breaks up before the flight attendant, towards the end of the movie, while returning home after a terrible weekend, makes us laugh rather than feel sorry for him. The end is as sweet as it can get, with things, somehow patched up between Di Nero and Ben, of course. All is well that ends well."

","In this movie Ben Still plays the childish named Greg Focker. Focker is dating one Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). Pam is off to her brother's wedding and invites Greg along - giving a chance for Greg to meet the parents (ohh. like the title). Unfortunately for him he never expected the paranoid father, Jack (Robert de Niro) and it quickly becomes clear that meeting the demands and expectations of this parent is not going to be very easy..<br/><br/>I've always found Ben Stiller enjoyable to watch. He has a decent sense of balancing both elements of comedy and drama, generally with decent delivery. There's no exception here and his character Greg, while somewhat similar to other roles, is a nice guy whom you can't help but like. Robert de Niro, as the paranoid parent, shows a great talent for comedic timing that he first evidenced in `Analyze This'. He's able to put a touch of both menace and heart into the role and the chemistry between him and Stiller is quite strong.<br/><br/>Thankfully the comedy is never sacrificed to the big star's prowess. The humour may have some farcical slapstick moments, but generally the set-up is credible enough (and at the expense of Greg) that it makes you smile, rather than wince. There's a great desperation by Greg that wins laughter and heart.<br/><br/>Overall this is a decent comedy. It's script is sharper than most, and the performances that bit better. There's good characterisation with people you wish to succeed. There's enough here to make me see the forthcoming sequel and, with that, the team here have done their job. Try it out. 6.9/10."

","Finally, a Jay Roach film I can tolerate!  ""Meet The Parents"" is a very funny, almost laugh a minute riot.  Storyline is pretty basic slapstick stuff, daughter brings boyfriend home to meet the parents, boyfriend finds himself in one bizarre predicament after another.  <br/><br/>What makes this idea so good is the good performances delivered by the two main characters Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro). Greg is a well intentioned young man who makes an admirable living as a male nurse.  One day he decides to propose to his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo). While in the midst of the proposal, Pam gets a call from her sister.....she has just gotten engaged and in the course of that call Greg finds out he is ""expected"" to gain Jack's approval before proposing to Pam.  With sister's wedding day just a couple weeks off, they head to the Byrnes' residence to not only be at the blessed event, but to get dad's permission as well.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller performs admirably in the role, handling every single crisis that comes along.  Greg is a too close to his ""Something About Mary"" character than is comfortable, but it works well and Stiller makes the guy likeable.  <br/><br/>Robert DeNiro is Jack Byrnes.  A CIA operative, Jack is a master at reading human emotion and can make a person nervous by a simple glance.  A decent enough character but a bit dry.  He loves Pam's cat though, treating him like a son rather than a household pet.  <br/><br/>Teri Polo as Pam, Blythe Danner as Dina Byrnes (Pam's mother), Jon Abrahams (""Outside Providence"")as Pam's druggy brother Denny are all good characters but don't add much to the story.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson chimes in as Kevin Rawley, Pam's ex-fiance.  I have no idea why this character was there.  Nicely done by Owen, but the segments involving him are basically throw-away and inserted strictly to allow Greg to have another disaster.<br/><br/>""Meet The Parents"" is funny enough to carry what little dead-weight the script has (mainly Greg's disasters reach the point where you wonder what could possibly happen next).  If Jay Roach can smooth out the rough edges as mentioned above that have plagued all his movies, the next one could be pretty sharp.<br/><br/>2 1/2 out of 5"

This story directed By Jay Roach (Who directed Austin powers 1 & 2) is original and hilarious. It revolves around Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) who wants to marry Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). To make Pam fall in love with Greg was easy. Before Greg could propose, he figures he needs to get the parents' approval. So he goes to Pam's parents' house in long island. I know it's Long island because a certain scene was filmed in Manhasset.<br/><br/>Greg tries to impress Pam's father (Robert DeNiro)and mother (Blythe Danner),but each step he tries to make,is one bad step he messes up. Then, Greg finds out he can't be with his future wife. He must sleep in the basement. He finds out Pam's father, jack Byrnes, is with the CIA, resulting in a very great game of.. Lie Detector. That's basically the plot, I don't want to spoil it for you.<br/><br/>DeNiro gives a great as protective father with a cat,Ben Stiller in his best role ever, so far. Blythe Danner is marvelous, reminding me of Sissy Spacek from ""Blast From The past"".DeNiro and Stiller have the funniest roles, and always give a good hearty laugh. I have never heard an audience laugh this hard. I watched the movie 5 times and I can't get enough of it! The audience roared with laughter at Stiller's funny antics, and DeNiro's comeback to shine.<br/><br/>This movie is pure genius. Even better than Happy Gilmore. I can't help but laugh. My sides burst out as well! I recommend it to anyone. So if you haven't seen it on the big screen, see it NOW. Better than Scary movie. Scary Movie is nothing compared to Stiller and DeNiro. Two BIG stars, one great movie you have to see."

","Years ago, movies USED to be funny. No more. Now they're just tasteless and painful, thrown together by Hollywood insiders who haven't had dinner in a normal middle class home in years and have no idea what life is like for most of us. Nowadays, the characters in movies are not inspired by real life flesh and blood people but by other characters in other movies (in this case I believe the moviemakers are mining Stiller's role in Something About Mary). In this picture, the main character is a nurse who has a smoking problem. Huh? I am sure there are a few nurses who smoke, but the vast majority of the ones I know don't, but hey, who cares about accuracy, this is a movie. And besides, a nurse who smokes is really funny, right? The father, played in his best scenery-chewing fashion by erstwhile Hollywood screen icon Robert DeNiro (is anyone besides me tired of seeing his grimacing face up on the big screen in every other movie?), is so over the top mean that it's hard to guess what's at all funny about him. He has pictures up in his den of himself with world leaders even though was actually a CIA agent with a cover. Whatever.<br/><br/>And then there's the lame attempts at humor and comic timing in the plot. Caught in a lie about living on a farm, the Stiller character makes up a story that he once milked a cat (the bride-to-be's family has a beloved cat). Ho ho. The slow pacing of the movie only amplifies the staleness of the many bad jokes like this one.<br/><br/>I would love to tell you what I thought of how the movie turned out, but I got tired of watching a bunch of actors in obnoxious, unfunny situations portraying people you would only see in a movie so I left early and went home to talk to some real characters.

If it had a point to it, some deeper meaning, it would be in my running for best movie of the year.<br/><br/>Put simply, this movie is one giant situation comedy without much anything more to say.  The gags are logical, but in no way truly predictable (i.e. you know *exactly* what's going to happen, to the very detail).  Granted, if you're really looking that far in advance for it, you're going to find it -- though you're not really enjoying the movie.  Overall, no cheap laughs, everyone is hard earned and set up nicely and logically.<br/><br/>MTP generates a lot of laughs without being crude (unless you consider the play on last names).  It truly blew my expectations away.  The preview does not do this movie justice.  Even when I recognized some of the bits from the preview, they were funnier in the movie (except maybe the polygraph test, which is about the same).  There was no sap, no cheesey moments, save for the end, which tidies things up nicely.  Normally, I have no place in movie for those types of scenes, but this movie makes no attempts to say anything more anyway, so it is excusable.<br/><br/>Watch this movie.  It destroys Scary Movie (vulgar and crude, ""so stupid it has to be funny"") in terms of sheer hilarity.  I also rate MTP above There's Something About Mary, and American Pie because, again, it does not have to lower its standards to get cheap laughs.

Robert De Niro plays the father from hell who grills Stiller every chance he gets.  Every lie, ever statement, every action is under De Niro's scrutiny, and believe me, Stiller does more than enough to alienate himself from the father.  It starts out badly and gets worst as the movie progresses.     This is Stiller's best work since Something about Mary.  He plays basically the same type of persona, but lets face it, it's a funny persona.  The nice guy who is just caught up in events that start out innocently , but quickly spiral out of his control, and every attempt to right things just brings up more problems.

"machine-13","Null","0","0","15 October 2000"," Meet this movie
","I had a good time at this movie.  Ben Stiller is Greg Focker, ""It's pronounced like it's spelled...Focker""  who is getting ready to engage to his girlfriend (Teri Polo).  But first he must meet her parents.  His girlfriend's father, (Robert De Niro) is a ""flower expert"" who is well known for not liking some of his daughter's choices in boyfriends.  First off, Focker is warned not to smoke in the house, because the father finds smoking as a sign of weakness, and his girlfriend throws his pack of cigarettes on the roof (which come in later).  To help his craving, Focker purchases some Nicarette gum, in which he chews several pieces at a time.  The big laughs start with an urn containing a dead grandma's ashes and the family cat, who has an unusual talent of using the toilet.  <br/><br/>Ben Stiller's character is similar to his character in There's Something About Mary, he's a clumsy, shy guy just trying to impress his girl and her parents, but everything seems to go wrong for him.  For anyone who has tried to impress a date's parents, or has had bad experiences at airports will be able to simpify with Stiller's character.  There are many big laughs in this movie, and most of the jokes all join together perfectly (ex, Focker is trying to catch the family cat on the roof, but ends up just causing more trouble in a hilarious sequence I won't ruin for you.) <br/><br/>
Meet the parents is one of the better quality comedies recently, and I recommend that you give it a chance."

I felt that his performance for a comedy was even better than his role in Midnight Run.  Ben Stiller was also excellent as the guy who has everything possibly bad happen to him. Terri Polo, Blythe Danner, and James Rebhorn are solid in supporting roles, but it is Owen Wilson that really shines.  Keep an eye on him--because he will be a star.  A lot of people have been badmouthing this movie, but I feel that it was a really well-written and acted movie.  I think some people were expecting too much or are hard to please.

I thought things were looking up with the early scene with the kids. I thought it was clever, funny and romantic, but due to the overheard comment he backs down on this planned event. His intelligence went down from there. The gags are all predictable as were the characters. De Niro & Danner give solid performances. What is it with Stiller and animals?

","""Meet the Parents"" plays pretty much like one of these Chevy Chase Vacation-movies, in which the comedian plays a lovely father who just tries to darn hard to create the mother of all vacations. Planning everything, even the fun, he removes every chance at spontaneity, and eventually manages to accomplish quite the opposite of what he originally had in might. Everything he didn't goof up himself, will be done for him by the numerous crazies he meets along the way.<br/><br/>In ""Meet the Parents"", likeable nurse Gay is about to propose to his lovely fiancée Pam Martha in a rather cute way, when she gets a call (blast those infernal cellular phones!) from her sister, who announces she'll be getting married within two weeks. Not wanting to ruin the momentum, Gay postpones his proposal and joins Pam for her sister's wedding, seeing it as a chance to meet -and impress- his future parents-in-law. <br/><br/>The Father-in-law is played by Robert deNiro, who has played a friendly character on one or two occasions, but is best known for his psycho's. Along with the equally semi-sane looking Jack Nicholson, he is the manifestation of all sons-in-law fears. You do NOT want to see either one of those popping up behind the door.<br/><br/>""Meet the father"" would have be a better title as this is Ben Stiller's and Robert DeNiro's film from the start. Mom is just there to gasp and shriek once in a while.<br/><br/>It is almost impossible to get off on the right foot here, as Gay's last name happens to be Focker, and since Pam's middle name is Martha, her parents quickly realize her name will be Martha Focker (don't read it, say it!).<br/><br/>The best scene is obviously the diner scene, because it is fairly recognizable and painful. Guy manages to say and do all the wrong things and mock up beyond your own worst disaster scenario's. The moment when he verbally corners himself with the 'if it has nipples, you can milk it' story, is a great laugh-out-loud moment.<br/><br/>But then, a whole bunch of relatives show up and the movie went somewhat downhill from there. Up to this point, it was just Stiller and deNiro one-on-one, but now there's distraction from a bunch of quite unnecessary and shallow characters, like Pam's little brother who is only there to give the impression that Guy is a 'smoker'.<br/><br/>Will there be a happy end? Would it be a spoiler if I said ""yes""? But, fortunately, the ending stays in tone with the rest of the film, so at least we don't have people falling into each others arm, stating how much they love each other.<br/><br/>Really good fun.<br/><br/>***"

","I just got out of Meet the Parents and simply put it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Maybe I'm biased because I love Bobby De Niro and Ben Stiller, but this combination on screen is the best I have seen in a while.  Why is this such a great movie????  Every piece of comedic action is right on the money, DeNiro who is a great actor once again takes a comedic role and has so much fun with it... Ben Stiller who is probably one of the most underappreciated comedic talents around is hilarious as well.  Every comedic segment is a great belly laugh.  As the dad, DeNiro has this psychotic presence surrounding him with traits from some of his best roles (Goodfellas, Cape Fear) and in this context it is funny.  If you liked him in Analyze This, you will really love him here because he is about 5 times better in this.  Overall the story is simple but very very humourous. We have all been in a situation where we had to meet our significant other's parents.  Here it turns into a nightmare and Ben Stiller as the common man boyfriend is you or me having probably the worst weekend of our lives.  It is impossible not to like Stiller and you immediately feel bad for the idiot as his weekend and relationship go awry.  Go run and see this it is so worth the admission."

Life is not like in the movies: things do not simply work!<br/><br/>I didn't laugh very often during the movie, but I grinned without interruption from MARRY ME MAP` right until the end. For me, Meet the Parents` is one of the most perfect romantic comedies since let's say Four Weddings and a Funeral`."

","Meet the Parents is the funniest movie of the year, no questions asked! Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller are absolutely HILARIOUS! I knew I would love this movie from the very beginning.<br/><br/>This movie works on so many levels. Not only is the movie absolutely hilarious from start to finish, it also has a lot of sad and touching elements. Ben Stiller is great as the unfortunately named Greg Focker (who does resemble his character in There's Something About Mary a little too much) and Robert DeNiro is fantastic as Jack Byrnes, a would-be father-in-law from Hell. DeNiro is much better in this movie than his terrible role in the atrocious Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle simply because he is more relaxed and has much more fun with this character. Stiller and DeNiro make such a good team in this movie, also. Both of them make the perfect reactions to all the absolutely humiliating mishaps Greg does in the movie. All the horrible things Greg does, from losing DeNiro's dear cat to breaking a girl's nose to setting the house on fire, none of them would have been as funny as they were if DeNiro didn't do such a good job reacting to the accidents when he would find out about them. And some of the scenes (Greg saying grace at the dinner table and the fabulous interrogation scenes) are absolutely IMPOSSIBLE not to scream out laughing.<br/><br/>And although the movie does have a little too much in common with There's Something About Mary, it still has all new laughs that are very fresh and are absolutely a riot!"

","Seeing this film was a a pleasant surprise. I don't remember laughing so hard since *There's Something About Mary*. Not that I'm usually fond of outrageous comedies, but sometimes I am.<br/><br/>The only cast member I knew when I got in the cinema was DeNiro. I didn't know about Teri Polo or Ben Stiller, and sure this was a good way to get to know them. I think she is very cute and not yet the spaghetti-like figure Hollywood seems to be obsessed with. I enjoyed Robert DeNiro's comic side, something he hasn't showed too often, unfortunately, being Midnight Run the only exception as far as I know.<br/><br/>Some detractors of Meet The Parents have come down really hard on it, saying the comic situations are too exaggerated, but that's what makes the movie so hilarious ok? I will not spoil it because wouldn't be fair to those who haven't seen the movie.<br/><br/>It may be not perfect, but who cares?

","This movie has its moments, but it underutilizes most of its cast (particularly Owen Wilson, Stiller and DeNiro) and as farcical plot device is heaped upon farcical plot device it drives towards a particularly boring and empty dramatic crisis, necessitated by the dictates of its formulaic and manipulative narrative.  Fortunately that crisis lasts only 10 minutes, but while it's going on you really wish you were somewhere else.  Stiller is excellent as always, and his performance, basically a reprise of his Something About Mary role of comical downtrodden everyman, is what really holds the movie together.  The scene on the airplane, the car racing scene, and the final scene of the movie made me laugh pretty damn hard.  It was definitely a good date movie--lots to laugh about afterward and lots to complain about."

","Meet the Parents is a movie about a male nurse Greg Focker, played by Ben Stiller, who is meeting his girlfriend's parents before proposing to her. His girlfriend, Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo,) has an over protective father Jack Byrnes, who is a former CIA agent (Robert De Niro.)  From the moment that Jack and Greg meet, Jack feels that he is not good enough for his daughter. So when Jack discovers that Greg is a male nurse, he never lets him forget it by bringing it up in conversation every time that he can. Many hilarious parts of the movie come when Greg is caught in a situation where he has to lie or break the `circle of trust,' which happens quite often.  Greg goes from breaking Debbie Byrnes' nose days before she was getting married to losing the dear family cat, Jinxies, to catching the house on fire as well as flooding the backyard with fluids from the septic tank, nearly ruining the wedding.  But the funniest part of movie is when you discover that Greg's real name was Gaylord, which meant that his full name was Gaylord Focker.  Greg's name was an effective form of a cheep laugh because it was somewhat vulgar but not overly done, and you could always get out at least a giggle when you heard De Niro yell out `Focker!' Even the music couldn't save Greg, when asked about the song `Puff the magic dragon', Greg explained to Jack about its drug meaning, literally `puffing a marijuana cigarette.'  This gave the illusion that Greg was a pothead. But the audience sympathized with Greg when he was kicked out of Jack's house.  Most of the things that Greg did wrong were because he loved Pam. He was just trying to gain Jack's approval so that he could marry Pam. Only after Greg left did Jack realize that Greg was the one for Pam.  Thus the perfect ending happens when Greg is allowed to propose to Pam. Overall, I feel that De Niro was magnificent in portraying the overprotective father because he was quick to jump on the character of Greg at any instant and he gave the impression of the overpowering head of the family.  This movie had an excellent supporting cast with Ben Stiller and Teri Polo.  Stiller, who also starred in There's Something About Mary, kept up to his usual self, providing plenty of comedy. Director, Jay Roach, who also directed the Austin Powers movies, didn't try anything fancy to overwhelm us, but showed a more sophisticated comedy. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being a masterpiece and 1 being not worthy for the space on the bottom of my garbage can, I give Meet the Parents a 7.  The movie has a good cast, good directing and a good story line with plenty of laughs.  The only problem is it isn't one of those movies that you see and you are like `wow,' and it changes the way you look certain aspects in life. Overall, it is one of the funniest, if not the funniest movie that I have ever seen."

When he wants to ask the question to marry him he finds out he has to ask Pam's father played by Robert DeNiro, Jack. When Gregg and Pam get an invite to stay at her parents house while her sister is having her wedding there that is Gregg's chance. This is a comedy you won't want to miss.

","My expectations for Meet the Parents weren't very high going into it, but I was pleasantly surprised by the time it was over.  Its one of those great ""disaster comedies,"" like What About Bob? (1991), when the protagonist arrives to a new place hoping for the best, but problem after problem arrives beyond his control, making our protagonist's life a living hell. <br/><br/>
There are several differences between the two films, but in Meet the Parents, the protagonist is being thwarted in every way by his girlfriend's father (Robert DeNiro, perfectly cast), an intimidating former CIA agent who is determined to prove that he (Greg, played by Ben Stiller) isn't good enough for her.  <br/><br/>Many of the jokes in this film don't go ""bang,"" which is probably why mainstream audiences were somewhat disappointed by it.  The key to many of the jokes is in how predictable each is.  Such as an innocent little volleyball game in a pool, or a situation with a missing dog.  We discover how each little conflict will backfire against Greg before it happens, leaving us laughing before the actual event and laughing harder when it strikes.  <br/><br/>DeNiro and Stiller have impeccable comic timing here.  DeNiro plays a character we love to hate, and his character gets the best of Greg in every situation.  Watching his reactions to Greg's goof-ups are as funny as it gets.<br/><br/>I recommend you don't enter this film with high expectations.

I have no problems with the casting or the acting, but it's just that this movie never seems to come to a conclusion. Oh it does, but it seems a bit contrived, more like an afterthought.

I just don't think it's funny to watch Ben Stiller struggle through a weekend trying to get along with his parents as the movie and the script have already made it impossible for him to do so. Robert DeNiro is one of my favorite actors. He is a very likeable guy even playing a hard-nosed father-in-law. He does a very good job doing comedy, I'd like to see him do it a lot more, but the movie just isn't as funny as everyone thinks it is.

When Pam invites Greg to spend the next few days with her parents in New York, where they will attend her sister's wedding rehearsal, Greg realizes this is the best opportunity to meet the parents and ask for Pam's hand in marriage. Soon after their arrival at the Byrnes' mansion, while trying to dismiss the ill-experience of having lost his suitcase in transit, Greg greets Jack (Robert De Niro) and his wife (Blythe Danner) with optimism. Yet Greg 's efforts to be liked and respected aim in all the wrong directions to either disappoint or offend Jack, a retired horticulturist who lacks a sense of humor and who decides to become Greg's most adverse judge.<br/><br/>Meet the Parents follows Greg Focker along a comical series of misadventures aimed at testing the character's composure as he struggles to disprove his faultfinding father-in-law. Never abandoning its central character's good intentions yet emphasizing its antagonist's unattainable consent, Meet the Parents also creates a few bittersweet moments as it questions the future of the character's plans to wed his increasingly distant girlfriend.

","I just saw this movie today and I loved it.  When I saw the previews for it on TV, I thought it looked quite stupid.  That just proves that you can't make a proper judgment on a movie just by seeing its previews.   Male Nurse, Greg(or Gaylord)Focker is engaged to teacher Pamela Martha Byrnes.  I liked the scene at the beginning of the film where the children at Pam's school keep screwing up on the letters that they use trying to spell out: MARRY ME PAM (on one try, they spell out: MARRY ME MAP).  After Pam agrees, Greg has to ""meet the parents.""  The mother is just fine and likes Greg, but Jack(played by Danny DeVito)the father is a real jerk.  I didn't like him too much.  One part I found funny was where Greg was eating dinner with Pam and her parents.  He brought out a bottle of wine for them to drink.  He popped the cork, which hit  a vase that contained the ashes of Jack's mother.  The vase breaks and Jinks the Himalyan cat rushes over to the ashes and urinates in them.  <br/><br/>The acting in this film was wonderful.

","MEET THE PARENTS is a comedy like STRIPES, ANIMAL HOUSE, and TOOTSIE. It's a film that you'll still be laughing after watching it five times, as much as you did the first time.  As for director Jay Roach, I find this film to be his best personal achievement, far better than both AUTSIN POWERS films and MYSTERY, ALASKA.  And after watching this film, you'll more than likely agree with me. Ben Stiller stars as Greg Focker (that's F-O-C-K-E-R), a Chicago male nurse who is in love with school teacher Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo).  Just when Greg is about to propose to marriage to Pam, Pam gets a call on her cellular that her younger sister, Debbie (Nicole DeHuff) is getting married in a week after knowing the guy for a few months.  But what is all right with this marriage is that they got permission from Pam and Debbie's parents, Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro) and Dian Byrnes (Blythe Danner).  But it's Jack who calls the shots for the family. So as Greg and Pam head over to Long Island for Debbie's wedding, Greg figures that this is the perfect opportunity to get approval from Pam's father to marry her.  But Jack Byrnes is very protective of his ""first born child"" and doesn't really care much for Greg.  Greg is very nervous and worried around Jack, and who can blame him, Jack has got to be the most intimidating father of all time.  As Greg keeps making accidental blunders around Jack, it makes Greg even more worried when Pam tells Greg that her father worked as a interrogation agent for the C.I.A.  Also, Jack favors and adores Pam's former fiance Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson), who is a multimillionare who is a carpenter for a hobby.  So one mistake happens after another builds on top of each other making this a weekend of hell for poor Greg. Where director Jay Roach crashed with his last two comedies (AUSTIN POWERS 2, & MYSTERY, ALASKA) Roach scores again, if not his best score with this film.  I found this along with CHICKEN RUN to be the funniest film of this year.  I was laughing on and on again throughout this entire film that I nearly lost my voice.  And what makes it better is that like AIRPLANE and A FISH CALLED WANDA the jokes keep on coming to by the end you're tired from laughing so much. Both DeNiro and Stiller do very great jobs in this film. Stiller is fun as the poor fella Greg, similar to his Ted character in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, Greg tries his hardest to make things right, but they turn out to be the opposite.  And Robert DeNiro is proving that his comedic work is just as excellent as his serious work.  With, ANALYZE THIS, WAG THE DOG, and my favorite film of all time MIDNIGHT RUN, DeNiro is a natural with the comedy genre.  And with this film, it shows that DeNiro still has his talent, after almost losing it in ADVENTURES OF ROCKY & BULLWINKLE.  The rest of the cast are also good, but Owen Wilson stands out as the very impressive Kevin. Before Jay Roach was making this movie, he said that the script was ""the funniest thing he has ever read.""  And by watching this film, you too can see on why this movie is so hysterical.  If Roach continues to make more movies like this one, he'll be a stand out in Hollywood. It's a shame that the American Film Institute has already picked the most funniest films of all time.  Since if they picked the films out later next year, PARENTS would have been at least on the top twenty as the top comeides of all time.  Even when I sit and write reviews, I still get chuckles from thinking about scenes from this movie.  This is quite a impressive fall season, after experiencing one of the most disappoining summers in film history.   With PARENTS, along with TITANS, NURSE BETTY, and ALMOST FAMOUS it seems that this fall there needed to be a funny and witty comedy, and MEET THE PARENTS is it!

There are a lot of funny moments in the movie, many of them seen in the trailor mind you, but there are a lot of moments when it's just taking things past the point of funny.  It has a slow start, a friend 20 minutes into the film asked me, ""when does it get funny""  It does get funny eventually but has a few dynamite moments with a lot of filler. Robert DeNiro is excellent in anything I've seen him in and as the overbearing father/former FBI spy he's perfect, Ben Stiller who I think is not funny, isn't that bad, but then he's not great, and not even that funny except when the script writes it out for him. Overall I'd say this film is worth a few laughs but not a solid 100 minutes of comedy.  A few standout scenes are the airport and the dinner scene, if they could carry that out through the whole movie it'd be a 10."

I like the way the De Niro character is revealed bit by bit. We think we know him, and then we see something new. This continues throughout the movie, so things stay interesting. I'll never look at a lie detector again without thinking of this film.<br/><br/>One of the most amusing moments is when Ben Stiller has to say grace. The movie telegraphs his prayer, though.

Almost everyone has a nightmare story when meeting your boy/girl-friends' parents. I for one can relate the story depicted in this movie. Although not as bad, but certainly memorable.<br/><br/>Even if it's rated Comedy, the film does present a drama of relationships, how the Daughter Loves Greg; how the farther-in-law from Hell (ROBERT DeNIRO) leans to accept Greg for what he is. It proves Love is inseparable. Even it's a CIA agent in between.<br/><br/>it's laughs were all funny and good. But it does not bring it self above the bunch with that. (in fact Jim Carrey does it much better) What really sets MEET THE PARENTS apart is the fact that, beneath the laughingstock surface, there is a serious human story of love to be told.<br/><br/>I give it an 8 out of 10"

I just recently saw `Meet The Parents' and did think it was a funny film, but not as funny as I though it was going to be. That was probably because of the hoopla. I guess I should have familiarized myself with `Meet The Parents' when it first came out in the theatre. But that is what happens for being a lazy `focker.' Oh `god!' I just thought Robert Deniro was so funny as the overprotective `father', and there is something about Ben Stiller that is making him the acting king of the bad luck characters in cinema today.

This is when all of the good comedy happens. Ben Stiller is very funny as the nice-guy boyfriend that at sometimes it seems that he can do nothing right. The reason it is funny is, because most guys can relate to this. All boyfriends get nervous and screw-up when they are meeting the parents. They will either say something that is totally wrong for the occasion, or they will make a fool of themselves. Also, Robert DeNiro was suprisingly funny too. I highly recommend this movie.

"snelling","5","0","0","5 October 2000"," There's Something About Mary Part II
","Beware! In order to critique this film I may have to reveal some key plot points!! Turn back if you don't want me to spoil it for you!!! OK, you were warned... I had high hopes for this movie. The trailer looked quite fresh and amusing. The first act started out cute and light, establishing the characters quite nicely. Ben Stiller (Greg) plays basically the same mensch he played in 'Mary,' a likable schlub who only wants to marry his sweet, loving girlfriend and live happily ever after. But first he has to 'Meet the Parents.' Actually he has to meet her father, Jack, played by Robert DeNiro. Here he's basically playing the same jerk he played in 'This Boy's Life,' but now it's for laughs, I suppose. Me? I was squirming in my seat whenever Jack was on screen. He would make any possible suitor nervous. But how can you root for Greg, who is the main central character, when the script stacks the deck so clearly against him from the outset?<br/><br/>From the moment he arrives with his soon-to-be-fiancée at her parents' house, every single thing goes wrong. He says the wrong thing at every instance. He inadvertently lies because he is so nervous. Things get broken (and of course they are irreplaceable) and the cat goes to the bathroom on the debris. The cat! This cat named Mr. Jinx should have had second billing right under DeNiro's name. Jack is so in love with this cat, he immediately dislikes Greg when it is revealed he is more of a 'dog person.' And who tells Jack that Greg hates cats? His girlfriend Pamela! Oops, but what are you gonna do? Of course, Mr. Jinks gets lost. But how can we believe that Greg would be so naive as to think he could pass off a lookalike cat to Jack, its owner of fifteen years? Especially when the cat knows a myriad of tricks that no other cat could possibly know? Suddenly Greg is an idiot! According to the plot, Jack can read people. This means he can spot a liar a mile away. How can a man like Jack be so suspicious of everyone around him and yet not know his own son sneaks out at night, presumably to buy pot? This wasn't even played for laughs. It's simply an inconsistency in the plot. Later a bong is found in Jack's son's coat pocket. But since Greg was wearing the coat at the time, Jack thinks it's Greg's. Ha ha, it never stops. There are so many marijuana references, it's no wonder this movie was directed by a guy named Jay Roach. Seemingly insignificant plot developments are scattered throughout the dialogue to come back and bite Greg on the butt later on in the story. More truths are revealed between Greg and Pamela that only come out when Greg is on the spot with her dad. For instance, Greg buys a special gift for Jack upon his first introduction to him. It is believed that Pamela helped him select this gift (It's a rare flower that will bloom in six months.) on the condition that Jack used to be a florist. After Greg embarrasses himself thinking that Jack would loooove this little reference to his past profession, it's revealed he was never a florist at all. But who reveals this? Pamela! Why would she set him up for a fall like that? Some girlfriend! The writers of this thing even give Greg a silly last name to add insult to injury. You'd think with a last name like Focker, that every kid Greg ever knew growing up would have mocked him so mercilessly, he would have changed it or gotten used to it by now. By the end of this movie I was p***ed off because I felt cheated. I got more agitated by everything that went wrong for poor Greg. I just wanted him to get back at Jack somehow; yell at him or something. But, no. What does this script make him do? He takes his anger out on a dopey flight attendant whose only crime was making him wait until his row was called before he boarded his plane the hell out of there. Some comeuppance.<br/><br/>And the ending is from out of nowhere. Booooo! Liked the cat, though, and I'm not a 'cat person.' Take that, Jack."

"TxMike","Null","0","0","9 March 2001"," Good comedy, some ribald humor, I rate it a solid ""7"" of 10.
","CAUTION -- THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS --<br/><br/>I put this film in the general category that ""What About Mary"" and ""Analyze This"" fall into. Ben Stiller is in one, Robert De Niro in the other.  These two stars, plus Terri Polo, make the film, ""Meet the Parents.""  Make no mistake, this is ""over-the-top"" humor.  It starts with the name, Focker, of Stiller's character. At one point the parents say, ""If they get married and have children, she'll be known as 'mother Focker.' In another, since his real name is 'Gaylord', the characters observe, he is a 'Gay Focker'.<br/><br/>
 In one scene, trying to retrieve the family cat on the roof, Focker sets the leaves on fire in the gutter, dislodges an electrical line, and ends up burning up the backyard perparations for the wedding. Later he finds a different cat, paints its tail black, and the cat later tears up the inside of the house.<br/><br/>They all take turns making fun of the fact that he is a nurse instead of a doctor.  They refer to him as the ""male nurse."" <br/><br/>The father, De Niro, is a former CIA and has hidden cameras all over, and late in the film proves that Focker flushed the toilet that flooded the back yard.  A truck gets stuck and throws feces all over the bystanders. The father doesn't believe any man is good enough for his favorite daughter (Polo) and that is really the root of the story anyway. The boyfriend (Stiller) is dead set on proving himself, and only gets accepted after he totally screws everything up, then finally becomes comfortable being truthful after he has lost, he thinks, everything (Polo). <br/><br/>
In the hands of lesser actors and director this could have easily been a ""3"" film.  But I rate it ""7"" because it is well done and isn't intended to be taken too seriously. Like ""Mary"" and ""Analyze This.""  Terri Polo became one of my favorites in her role in Northern Exposure. There are few women more attractive, and she is also a decent actor."

","Robert DeNiro is developing into quite an entertaining comedic actor. In his latest comic opus, which he also produced, he is the future father-in-law of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller).  Greg's girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo) has brought him home to `Meet the Parents'. From the moment he drives up to the front door nothing goes right. Jay Roach (Austin Powers) has ably directed his actors getting just the right combination of humor and character without being too slapsticky.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the trailer gives away many of the film's best gags. However, the characters are likeable so that you sympathize with their plight. Blythe Danner is the future mother-in-law and isn't given much to do. Of course, the end of the story seems to lead to the possible sequel, `Meet the Fockers,' Greg's parents. Who would be better to play them than Ben Stiller's own folks, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara.

","At $165 Million, this film was number seven at the box office for 2000. Though it is funny in parts, as is often the case with blockbusters I am left scratching my head at its runaway popularity.  Comparisons with `There's Something About Mary' are unavoidable.  Ben Stiller plays the same kind of sincere but hapless character in each film and they both have a wry and offbeat presentation.  However, the humor in this film is far more lowbrow than `Mary'.  It is also highly predictable.  The least perceptive of viewers can see the outcome of each gag a mile away.<br/><br/>I suppose there is an element of identification with the premise, since most people remember their own consternation at the big meeting with the parents of their beloved.  Perhaps the appeal of the film is that we love to laugh at people who are more luckless than we are, and Greg (Ben Stiller) clearly has no equal when it comes to the bad luck he has in this film.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is fast establishing himself as one of the most accomplished Sad Sacks in film today.  He portrays characters with such sincerity and misfortune that you can't help but love him.  In this film, he continues that tradition with an outstanding performance as Greg.  Robert De Niro, who is a great dramatic actor, continues his recent trend away from serious drama and toward offbeat comedy roles (`Flawless', `Analyze This', `Rocky and Bullwinkle').  Although his very presence in films like this is comical due to its incongruity, he is not a particularly good comedian.  I'm looking forward to seeing him in his latest film `Fifteen Minutes' which is a more serious dramatic role better suited to his enormous talent.  I was very impressed with Teri Polo, who played Pam.  She has genuineness and an affable nature that is well suited for romantic comedy.<br/><br/>This is a good comedy, but nowhere near as good as the box office would lead us to believe.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is a fun flick with absurdly exaggerated humor and numerous belly laughs, but don't expect it to be as good as `Mary'."

A question: ""Mr. De Niro, are you going to show us the level of performance you had 10 years ago or so, or should I put the film out of my agenda when I see your name in the cast?""<br/><br/>Anyway, other cast members were not any better.

","Meet The Parents is a revelation. A great script, superb cast and very solid direction from Jay Roach (director of Austin Powers 1 & 2) are all redeeming factors. Ben Stiller stars as Greg Focker (what a surname) who has plans to marry his beautiful girlfriend Pam, played by Teri Polo. However once he's met the parents (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) he begins to have second thoughts. Full of comedy moments and sharp one-liners, Meet The Parents is by far the best comedy of 2000, because it does not need gross-out moments to provide laughs, whereas flicks like Road Trip and Scary Movie do. If you don't see this film and like it, you need your head examined. A fun movie recommended for almost anyone."
"Richie-33","Null","0","0","18 January 2001"," Right, that's it, the wedding's off
","This highly enjoyable comedy is based on a simple premise that we can all easily relate too, the first efforts of someone to introduce their partner to the prospective in-laws. Even if you haven't had this problem directly, it's easy to empathise, and surely everyone has been in the awkward situation of being a guest in someone's house and being petrified of putting a foot wrong. There is plenty of scope for humour with this situation and there are also several great set pieces as the weekend takes a turn for the disastrous. Even when they seem fairly predictable, each one hits home and gives a great payoff.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller plays pretty much the same kind of role here as he did in 'There's Something About Mary', but that's no problem as his everyman likeability means you root for him throughout his tribulations. As Greg Fokker, he is desperate to impress his girlfriend's dad with a view to asking him for his blessing for her hand in marriage. Robert De Niro is great as the father who is not everything he first seems, and shows a knack for comic timing which you wouldn't expect of such a heavyweight actor.<br/><br/>Even if the ending is slightly contrived, it's great fun getting there with laughs aplenty. One for those who can reminisce and those who will be filled with dread anticipation alike."

","I went to see Meet the Parents a few days ago, with high hopes for the film. I had heard only good reviews from friends, and I am a big fan of both De Niro and Stiller.  I was not disappointed. The film is about Greg Focker(Stiller) and his planned marriage proposal to Pam(Polo).  But before he can propose to Pam , he first needs to meet her father Jack(De Niro), and gain his approval, and his permission to propose. Things, however, do not go quite as Greg would have planned. De Niro is superb as the over protective, suspicious father.  He showed in ""Analyse This"" that he has a talent for comedy, and there is further evidence of this in ""Meet the Parents"".  His comic timing is spot on, and there are very few actors around, who I believe could have played this character with more style. How was Ben Stiller as Greg Focker(this name was the catalyst of many an amusing scene)?  I have been a fan of Stiller since ""There's Something About Mary"", and his performance in this film has only enhanced my opinion of him.<br/><br/>My only criticism of this film, is that I feel they could have given Owen Wilson a slightly bigger role.  He showed how funny he can be in ""Shanghi Noon"", but was not really given the opportunity to shine in this film. On the whole, this is an immensely  enjoyable movie, that will leave everybody with a sense of humour, thoroughly entertained!"

"alafolle","8","0","0","4 January 2001"," Just a good old-fashioned comedy
","Once upon a time, comedy writers sought to create humor through plot and character development, rather than merely packing the script with crude sight gags and one-liners.  ""Meet the Parents"" is a long-overdue renaissance of this lost art form.  While most modern comedy films are all punch lines and no joke, this one earns its laughs the old-fashioned way--building comedic situations and using its one-liners as mere icing on the cake.  As a result, ""Meet the Parents"" bears more resemblance to ""Some Like it Hot"" than it does to ""There's Something About Mary"".<br/><br/>Having recently been married myself, (inheriting a stern set of in-laws) I found myself identifying strongly with the ill-fated Ben Stiller character. The increasingly complicated situations in which he becomes ensnared were physically stressful to watch.  The father (Robert DeNiro) is demanding and intrusive.  The girlfriend (Teri Polo) is too self-absorbed to notice how badly things are going.  The hapless suitor makes increasingly boneheaded decisions in a desperate effort to curry favor.  We've all been there.  We see ourselves in the characters, and we're forced to laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all. <br/><br/>The acting is solid, the script is as tightly wound as a good episode of ""Seinfeld"", and the laughs are abundant.  You can't ask much more than that from a comedy."

Most comedies are very funny the first thirty minutes or so and then keeps going and going with about one joke per 15 minutes. That's not the case with this movie. Sure, one can discuss whether Ben Stiller can play more than one character or not, but his acting style suits this film perfectly. Of course, De Niro is brilliant as the father-in-law from hell. Meet the Parents is a genuinely funny and entertaining comedy. (7/10)"
"Sam_Gray","9","0","0","29 December 2000"," Best comedy in years
","I like comedies as much as the next guy, but I think that comedy as a genre tends to produce mediocre films more often than any other genre, and even the best of comedies aren't as likely as other genres to produce a film worth more than one viewing.  It could be worse for comedy, though, as I think horror and action produce more outright bad movies than other genres.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think the mediocre tendency in comedy has been even more prevalent then normal in the past few years, as most of the major comedies releases have been, well, average efforts in my opinion, and I'm speaking of films such as: There's Something About Mary, both the Austin Powers movies, and Analyze This.  You might notice I haven't included any of the ""teen"" comedies, but that's because I consider ""teen"" to be a genre onto itself. And, now that I think about it, ""teen"" is even worse than horror and action because it produces almost nothing other than terrible films, particularly if teen and horror combine without the word ""scream"" in the title.  Comedy's looking better all the time.<br/><br/>But, alas, I digress.  The point of the matter is that, with Meet the Parents, I've finally found a comedy that beats this mediocre trend.  And, if you're anal about movie knowledge like I am, you're probably noticed that Meet the Parents includes, in its stars and director, people involved in each of the average films I mention above.  In fact, that bit of trivia had made me somewhat wary of seeing this film.<br/><br/>Luckily for me, I crumbled.  Meet the Parents is not only funnier that any other strict comedy in years, but it is also smarter.  Part of my problem with a lot of comedies these days is the overuse of sight gags and toilet humor.  Not that I have a problem with either, but I feel like movies insult my intelligence when they use either too often.  Meet the Parents has its share of both, but most of the really funny stuff is verbal or situational. There's even an instance or two of choice satire near the film's end.<br/><br/>What surprised my the most about Meet the Parents, however, is how many of the laughs come from De Niro.  He's definitely the straight man, but he's got some good lines.  He's also well cast, and he has essentially taken a lot of his more prominent roles and toned them down into an overprotective father.  At the same time, he's likeable, and that impresses me.  His is the best performance in the movie and also his best in years.<br/><br/>True, Meet the Parents is a little over-the-top, but so what?  It's also highly entertaining, and the fact that I would willfully watch it again, knowing the jokes, says a lot for it in my book.  9/10"
"flickjunkie-3","Null","0","0","29 December 2000"," One of the best of the year 2000!
","I got told by my parents that Meet the Parents was 9.5/10 film. I was really looking forward to seeing this, and from the first minute of the film, I could tell I was going to like it...and I loved it in the end!<br/><br/>On the verge of proposing to his lovely girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo), Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is faced with one final hurdle: meeting her parents. And when it transpires that daddy, Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro), is a retired CIA spycatcher masquerading as a florist, the weekend from hell commences as Greg's every attempt to impress his prospective father-in-law goes hopelessly awry.<br/><br/>Meet the Parents is a real winner. All the jokes are successful and funny, I was laughing so hard I barely breathed. Sometimes there are downright sad and emotional scenes, though, but it is the comic writing that wins the day - if the script does not get some sort of award there will be no justice, it is an endlessly creative, mercilessly entertaining piece of writing to be truly cherished. The performances are excellent - Ben Stiller is immaculate once again, he is becoming one of my favourite actors, many of the jokes relate to his other characters (especially about his Jewish Rabbi character in Keeping the Faith) and Robert DeNiro, who is already one of my favourite actor's, puts in a clean-cut performance, he hasn't done a film this good in God knows how long. Jay Roach is also a star, this is even funnier than his previous project, Austin Powers! And that is a big achievement all on it's own!<br/><br/>Easily one of the best of 2000, Meet the Parents is comedic brilliance in filmmaking. A must-see for everyone.<br/><br/>I rate Meet the Parents 9 out of 10."

","There is a scene in ""Meet the Parents"" that is almost perfect.  The main character, played by Ben Stiller, is waiting to board an airplane.  He is forced to wait until his row is called, although it is obvious that there is no one else waiting to get on the plane. The one scene perfectly conveys the anger that has been building in Stiller's character throughout the film while winking knowingly at the frustration all of us feel in similar situations.  Unfortunately, the scene takes place at the end of the film, and it's the only one of its type.  <br/><br/>If you've seen the previews for ""Meet the Parents"" you've seen the film. Stiller's fiance, played by Teri Polo, takes him home to meet her parents, played by Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner.  This turns into a trip from hell.  There are some funny scenes, but most of the characters are not fleshed out and much of what takes place is predictable.  My guess is a director such as Harold Ramis would have done a better job than Jay Roach.<br/><br/>Much has been said about De Niro's comic performance as the father, but he's not nearly as good as he was in ""Analyze This,"" perhaps because he was playing against type in the latter.  Blythe Danner is still beautiful, but is given little to do as De Niro's wife.  Polo barely registers as the fiance.<br/><br/>What makes the film passable is Stiller.  He wants to please De Niro, but senses that things are rapidly deteriorating.  But he comes across as so sincere we almost ignore the fact that he has brought much of the trouble upon himself by exaggering his background.<br/><br/>One final complaint:  The flim ends with a type of flashback.

It was pretty stupid and unoriginal at times, and often elicited groans from me (more stupid pet tricks.)  But it was also delightful and funny at times, mostly in the smaller moments that were a little less over the top, but also in some of the setup and ""payoff"" in some of the writing.  For instance, I thought the outcome of the pool volleyball game was funny and kind of shocking at the same time -- but in a very good way. ;)<br/><br/>Most of what made the film mildly entertaining for me was simply the performances by Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro.  Neither role was that much of a stretch for either of them, as they both were firmly planted in self-parody territory, doing what we've seen them do many times before. Still, even though Stiller and DeNiro are doing little more than selling their ""dog and pony act,"" they are really good at it, and I still enjoyed what they did most of the time anyway.<br/><br/>All in all, if you go in with the right attitude (not expecting too much), you'll surely get a few good laughs before you get back in the car and go home.

","The trailer for this film was on TV incessantly and also, of course, in the theaters, and I laughed.  I laughed at Robert DeNiro and his ""I'm watching you"".  I laughed at Ben Stiller's kung fu chops recorded on one of DeNiro's covert cameras.  I especially laughed at the sister being bopped in the eye with the volleyball scene.  But wait a minute, are there any big yocks that aren't in the trailer?  Answer:  Very few.<br/><br/>That said, let me say that I think that this is pleasant movie well worth seeing.  Waiting for it to come out in video may not be a bad idea, though. ""Meet the Parents"" is a good old-fashioned American comedy in the mode of ""Father of the Bride"" and many of the other movies of the '50's with Spencer Tracy, Jimmy Stewart, etc.  That is, good clean fun with the emphasis on family and an ending that you know is going to be happy.  Excellent performances from all, but especially DeNiro and Stiller and special mention must go to the unique acting ability of Mr Jinx.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie to see with your family....the kids and Grandma, too...I think they'll all have smiles on their faces at the end even if they're not rolling on the floor."

","The shock value Farrelly Brothers filmmaking that spawned ""There's Something About Mary"" is in abundance here, even going so far as to have Ben Stiller essentially reprise his role as a put-upon nebbish who can never seem to catch a break and winds up in the middle of disasters. ""There's Something About Mary"" was funny in spots but when it hit, it hit: the gags were so outrageous they compensated for the slow spots. ""Meet The Parents"" has the same fits-and-starts rhythm but the gags are merely pleasant and don't make up for the dead air that comprises most of the film. Stiller is an entertaining performer but he's beginning to typecast himself and is beginning to wear thin. Robert DeNiro, as the former CIA man whose daughter Stiller intends to wed, is enjoyable but he never manages to convey his intensity to the audience so they never feel completely, deliciously enthralled by him. Jay Roach directed, in a style typically subservient to Hollywood dictates. Not recommended."

","Throughout the film, even at the end, I felt like imploring the guy, 'run for your life! She's not the one!' Pam's neglect of Greg's feelings and most of all her blindness toward her father's obsessiveness demonstrates how we never see our own family the same way other people do. You know your family is weird--but just how weird is only found through throwing a stranger at its mercy.<br/><br/>""Parents"" begins as an overprotective-father-versus-boyfriend story, moves toward the ridiculous, but always remains believable. After a while it becomes clear that the real problem between Greg and Jack (Robert DiNiro), Pam's dad, is simple: they just don't get along. We've all come across people we know we don't like from the moment we meet them. Greg's tough luck is that his father-in-law to-be is one of these people.<br/><br/>""Meet The Parents"" is good because it gives each character enough of a life that each has something to learn. It's also got a lot of humanity at its core. Most everyone who sees this film will be able to relate to Greg's predicament. Most everyone will recall a time when they were in Greg's shoes--or they'll come to the shocking realization that they were torturing someone and didn't know it at the time.<br/><br/>This is a rare story in which there really is one main character around which everything else revolves. Everything that happens is connected with Greg Focker (Ben Stiller plays it perfectly; he's never been funnier). There are no unnecessary subplots that enhance supporting characters. They don't even bother giving Pam her own life. All she is, from first frame to last, is Greg's girlfriend. Jack is Greg's girlfriend's dad and so on. This puts you inside the main character's world in a way few films do.<br/><br/>While the writers show great control over their material by doing this, they fall short in other areas. Greg's last name, Focker, and the various ways people pronounce it, is a running gag that isn't nearly as funny as the film's creators seem to think it is. Whenever things start getting dull, they pull out the old Focker joke so at least the small-minded people in the audience can get a giggle. There are moments of agony, such as truck tires spraying sewage all over Pam's family, that are so gross you can't believe what you're watching. The goal is to set this lewdness against a backdrop of suburban normalness, which makes it funnier.<br/><br/>Supposedly anyway. More times than not, though, it works. The film does what all good entertainment does: holds a warped mirror up to real life, so we can laugh at ourselves a little.<br/><br/>Grade: C+"

","Just when I thought that ""fat, drunk and stupid"" wasn't the way to ""go through life"", cinema provided me the perfect example of a man doomed for failure. His name? Gaylord Focker. His profession? Male nurse. How does he look? Slightly below average, but a Tom Cruise, he ain't, if you except some pretty blue eyes no really, he looks like that poor schmuck who thought he had a chance with Cameron Diaz in ""There's Something About Mary""  see? <br/><br/>What else from that glorious portrait? Well, he's in love with Pam (Teri Polo), a pretty blonde from a Conservative WASP family, and being Jewish wouldn't help either. Except that she loves him, she would probably say 'yes' if he manages to propose her, granted Pam's sister doesn't steal her thunder and the ring doesn't get lost with the luggage in the airport  yes, I forgot to mention Greg (that's how they call him) is also unlucky but that was quite easy to find out. Anyway, Pam loves him and her sister's wedding seems like the perfect opportunity to introduce Greg. Except that opportunity doesn't rhyme with formality, there has to be a catch otherwise, the film wouldn't be one of the funniest of the 2000's.<br/><br/>The catch is a hard-nosed man in his early sixties, who loves his wife Dina (Blythe Danner), his two daughters and Jinx, his Siamese cat. He's over-protective and over-suspicious, he's a Conservative Christian, and much more than this, he's an ex-CIA Agent. His name is Jack Byrnes and he's played by Bobby De Niro, who else could? ""Meet the Parents"" all relies on the antagonism between Greg and Jack and it follows a simple yet effective pattern: whatever Greg does, he'll be ridiculous. No matter how hard he'll try to make himself within the family circle, Jack's beloved concept, he'll end up displeasing him. It feels like a one-note approach to the subject, but for some miraculous reason, it never feels redundant and here's why.<br/><br/>The credit goes to Jay Roach, the director, each scene prepares us to a funny pay-off. Secondly, there's not one single 'funny' character, they're all, within their own state of mind, normal and well-meaning persons. One might argue that a CIA agent who trained his cat to use the toilet might be a little twisted, or a name like Gaylord Focker is too funny not to belong to a goof-ball, but fact is, there's no clown in the film, the two opposite leads are straight men with clearly defined personalities. The average schmuck who wants to propose the blonde daughter and must get the approval of the father, and the conservative father who believes his baby girl deserves the best.<br/><br/>The comedic situations result in all the interactions between Greg and Jack, and their one-sided attempts to get along. There is a family dinner scene that crystallizes whatever is funny in the film, Greg tries to make a joke, he ends up insulting Greg's mother, he start talking about a random subject such as 'milking' cat, making the gesture as if we didn't get it, and arguing that you can milk anything with nipples to which Jack's ""I have nipples, Greg. Could you milk me?"" is the perfect comeback and the film's most memorable line. There's also a jar containing Jack's mother ashes which makes us expect the worst but the point is to laugh, not at Greg, but at his desperate attempts to accommodate with his soon-to-be family-in-law. The film is never mean-spirited, well, maybe a little but, but we never laugh in a mean-spirited way I think so<br/><br/>I believe one of the reasons the film succeeds is because the recurring theme is being an outsider, which is a situation most viewers can relate to. And meeting the parents of your beloved one is probably one of the nightmares everyone must get through once in the life, the issue is undermined by Greg's differences, which are never mocked, he's proud of his job, which is all to his honor. He's Jewish but accepts to say the blessing, although it doesn't really turn out as we'd expect. The point is that there are more cultural gaps in America than anyone would believe, and at a time, where 'mixed' marriages are so common, it's also something many can relate to. And God, what can be worst than a lie detector test from your father in law? <br/><br/>The film introduces Pam's sister and her future husband, a doctor (a real one, from Jack's perspective), the ideal man for his daughter, there's also Owen Wilson as a priest and carpenter who lived a passionate romance with Pam, 'only physical' (was that supposed to comfort him?) and Jack's son who'd be responsible for a minor drugs' subplot, not the best part of the film. Indeed, it loses its pacing at some point where Greg becomes the public enemy number one, Greg, but then it takes us to a hilarious airplane climax where Greg finally goes berserk and vent his anger out on flight attendants and a last and final confrontation with Jack.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller has already proved his value as a character –actor for poor and well-meaning schmucks, he reprises his role from ""There's Something About Mary"" but gives it an even deeper feeling. De Niro has no comparable talent to make fun of his own intimidating presence and knows how to parody his own gangster mimics for grabbing a few laughs. He was rightfully nominated for the Golden Globe. Blythe Danner also provides a sweet touch as the understanding mother who asks Jack to ""go easy on Greg"", but fate is that no matter what can go wrong, it all go wrong. Murphy's law indeed.<br/><br/>And if one thing, the film proves right the idea that marrying someone, no matter what we want, is also marrying the family."
"sddavis63","7","1","2","22 December 2011"," Deniro And Stiller Worked Well Together
","What made this movie work so well was the combination of Robert Deniro and Ben Stiller. Both very good actors, put together they did a wonderful job of making this a very funny movie, largely by playing their roles so seriously. Stiller's character of Greg Focker was one any man can relate to - if you've ever been in the position of having to meet your girlfriend's father for the first time. In this case, the pressure was really on. Greg wants to marry Pam (Teri Polo) but finds out that her father would expect to give his permission before he even asks. So he accompanies Pam home for her sister's wedding, and discovers that Jack (Deniro) isn't your average, everyday potential father in law. Instead, he turns out to be an ex CIA agent who's extremely protective of his daughters and has more than a few quirks of his own - not the least of which is an obsession with his cat, Mr. Jinks. Desperately trying to impress Jack (or at least trying not to get on his bad side) Greg ends up unintentionally causing chaos in the home. He breaks the urn holding Jack's mother's ashes; he lets Mr. Jinks outside and loses him; he accidentally breaks Pam's sister's nose while playing volleyball; he sets fire to the backyard; he causes the septic tank to overflow. If that sounds like it might be going a bit overboard, it really doesn't go overboard. It never falls into mere slapstick humour. Greg's misadventures all seem very natural and believable. It's simply that nothing goes right on this weekend with his potential in-laws, and the end result is that Jack becomes convinced that this guy isn't good enough for his beloved first born daughter - a feeling compounded by the fact that her sister is marrying a doctor who's also the son of a doctor, while Greg is a nurse. Deniro and Stiller played off each other perfectly and produced a number of very funny scenes together.<br/><br/>The movie was weakened a bit, in my opinion, by supporting performances that weren't as strong. Polo was very much in the background. She was likable enough, but added really very little to the movie (except that her character was necessary to push forward the tension between Jack and Greg.) Blythe Danner was underused as Pam's mother, and I found Owen Wilson's character of Kevin (Pam's ex-fiancé) to be irritating more than anything, and maybe a little too much for the story.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this is an enjoyable movie; one of the better comedies of recent years.

","This awkward comedy of errors has gone on to spawn a whole franchise, with the latest installment, ""Meet The Parents: Little Fockers"" just wrapping up its run in theatres as I write. Ben Stiller is Gaylord (Greg) Focker, who is trying to impress his prospective father in law, Robert De Niro on top form, as he plans to propose to his daughter.<br/><br/>The couple 'meet the parents' as they stay the weekend for his future sister in law's wedding and things obviously go down hill from there, with the inevitable comic effect. He meets the rest of her family and several friends, all of whom seem not to care a jot that Stiller's Focker is given little consideration.<br/><br/>On top of all this, De Niro's father character is an Ex-CIA agent, which further compounds the problems, but when all is said and done, I find it hard to completely sympathise with Stiller's protagonist, as whilst some of the problems and situations are beyond his control, many of them are caused by his constant lying.<br/><br/>The film seems to be a little confused as whether it supports Stiller as he lies his way through the film, to everyone, including his hosts, or De Niro who correctly points out towards the film's conclusion that things might have gone better if he had only told the truth.<br/><br/>I personally agree with De Niro. The hero of this film is a liar and he pays for those lies, but that is turn makes it difficult for me to sympathise or empathise too much with him. Having said that, this is well-played cringe-worthy comedy, and it does a great job of conveying that sense and drawing us into the discomfort of the characters. Owen Wilson's lengthy cameo as the perfect, divine ex-fiancé was pitched perfectly, truly capturing the ideas that we have over matching up to the past, though over-played, on a metaphorical level, it was brilliant.<br/><br/>Overall, it made me laugh throughout, but I wouldn't say that it was hysterical, though it was entertaining, moderately thoughtful but promotes a brand of humour that isn't what I would consider to be number one for me."

In the film Meet the Parents he does just that. Ben Stiller as Greg (Gaylord) Focker has staring in this film with him Academy Award winning Robert De Niro as Jack Byrnes, sure does make Greg's life a little more difficult than it already is. The film's theme displays how love can cause one to do crazy things and to accept people for who they are. Another film that can be compared is American Wedding 2003. <br/><br/>The film begins when Greg a male nurse decides his girlfriend Teri Polo as Pam is the one he wants to marry. The couple flies to Pam's parents' house for her sister's wedding at the Byrnes, along the way Greg starts his line of bad luck. As they drive up Pam's father Jack is staring out the window, he is already judging Greg. Jack calls for Pam's cat Mr. Jinx and she tells her parents that Greg hates cats. This puts Greg in an awkward situation and he lies saying he does not. Jack questions him on why he likes dogs over cats.

","I enjoyed this film quite a bit as it was a nice look at what the male of the species has to go through when meeting his girlfriend's parents. This one plays a bit more realistically than does the sequel which only enhances this film a bit above that one. Greg wants to ask his girlfriend to marry him and is about to do so when he learns that she wants him to meet her parents so he prepares to meet them and get her father's approval before he asks her. What occurs is the old adage if something can go wrong it will. From making a poor first impression to accidentally uncorking a champagne bottle so that it hits the urn of someone's final resting place, one really has to feel for poor Greg. He not only has to get passed these sort of self inflicted wounds, but also must deal with the fact her dad is also an ex-CIA agent or something to that effect and poor Greg is in for a very troubling stay. Throw in the super smart cat capable of using the toilet, the only one on his side seems to be his beloved. Though the mother is not quite as bad as the father, in fact she is no where near as bad. Throw in an ex-boyfriend and a pool party that starts out very embarrassingly and turns ultra competitive and nothing is going right for poor Greg. Very funny movie and great performances all around. I liked that Owen Wilson was in it as he is always good in movies such as these. DeNiro and Stiller were very funny as well as both played their parts well. An all around good comedy, which me liking a comedy made after like 1999 is a rarity."

","I have this movie on DVD, so I recommend to anyone who loves it, buy a copy if you don't already have one. Although if you watch it too many times, it may not be as good as it was the first time, because then you didn't know what was going to happen. After repeated viewings, you'll still enjoy it, even though you won't laugh as much or often. This fact applies not just to this movie, but comedies in general. I still get a kick out of the part where Ben Stiller is laughed at by two of the relatives because they don't believe he's a nurse. Not a big part, but funny nonetheless. I didn't see the movie just on DVD. I saw it years ago on the big screen, and on pay-per-view.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","As it were ... complications ensue through this comedy of errors, especially when our male nurse, Greg Focker, learns of Jack's peculiar behaviors and suspicious gadgets, such as a polygraph and hidden cameras placed in every room of the house. Cue, hey I was with the CIA. Then we meet the well placed pot head brother who nobody but Greg seems to know is smoking. Denny (Jon Abrahams), does not make it back for the sequel. Then it is time to meet the in laws, Larry (James Rebhorn who is in every film west of the Pecos), and Linda Banks (Phillis George), and Pam's wealthy ex-fiancée, Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson). Owen and Stiller mesh together best when they are both not the star of the film. Soon, Greg's chances of receiving Jack's permission to wed his daughter become less and less probable as his bad luck only manages to increase.<br/><br/>Outrageously funny, certainly you'd never expect DeNiro to be this funny. Stiller is pure genius in virtually every scene. He basically reprises his role from There's Something About Mary and you can almost see that character enter fully into some of the Parents scenes.

","When I first heard about this pairing coming together for this movie, I was pretty excited. Even though he's starting to bug me now, Ben Stiler is one of the best comedy actors of the last 15 years. Put him together with in my opinion the best actor ever in DeNiro, and give them a half decent script, and hilarity should follow. DeNiro has done some terrible comedies, most notably the ""Analyse This"" series, two movies based around a ""emotionally fragile"" mafia boss. C'mon! ""Meet the Parents"" focuses on Greg (Stiller) and girlfriend Pam going to see Pam's parents in the hope of softening them up for a marriage proposal. Greg is understandably nervous and when a few things start going wrong, he begins to break. The movie is full of brilliant one liners, sight gags, tragedy gags and lots more. Most of it is based around some dark or unlikely events which nonetheless have you in stitches. There's also a fine cameo by Owen Wilson, playing Pam's ex.<br/><br/>The teaming of DeNiro and Stiller works brilliantly and this has to be one of the great comedies of the 2000's.<br/><br/>WARNING: Do not see the sequel to this ""Meet The Parents 2"" under any circumstances. It is a pure cash in on the first and very little effort went into the script. One of the worst sequels ever. I think I laughed twice."

The humor in this movie was a bit stupid, but once again, it did have meaning in it. I was surprised when a person mentioned that Greg's last name is Focker, which is surprising when I saw this movie. And there was another part when you realize that Greg's real name is Gaylord Focker. I was also surprised by this, too, because who would name their son, Gaylord? I hope to see the reason why the Fockers decided to name their son Gaylord, because I've seen Meet the Parents, and now I want to see Meet the Fockers.

"ryan_kuhn","7","1","2","13 February 2005"," Fearing Papa De Niro
","For a man, there is nothing worse than meeting your woman's father. Fear and trepidation do not even begin to describe what it's like to meet the father. And nothing can prepare any man for meeting your girlfriend's father when he is Robert de Niro. This is the main problem Ben Stiller's character faces in the 2000 surprise comedy Meet The Parents. Stiller plays a male nurse with the unfortunate name of Greg Focker, dating pre-school teacher Pam Byrnes played by Teri Polo. Pam's sister is getting married back in her native Long Island, so a weekend trip is in store for the happy couple. After losing his luggage and being spit up on my a baby, Greg meets the man of the house Jack Byrnes (de Niro). Through various misunderstandings and lying to cover up the misunderstandings, Greg begins to fall out of favor with Jack. Stiller has a wonderful knack of displaying insecurity, and that severs him well in Meet the Parents. He knows he is not living up to the standards of Jack, especially when he meets Pam's former fiancé, played by Owen Wilson. The more uncomfortable Greg is, the more he squirms, the more he lies, and the deeper he gets. The final scenes are great, especially the one dealing with the airline workers who are on autopilot, and poor Greg almost causes an international incident. The movie is cute, has plenty of laughs, and puts most men into a situation they can relate to, and fear more than an all-day Oprah marathon."
"KathyBatesLover","10","1","2","27 December 2004"," Amazing Movie
","Meet the Parents has to be one of the best movies ever created in the history of the cinema. It got me laughing in the first 10 minutes of the movie and I always die laughing when that cat pees in the grandma's ashes. The whole movie and every character in it was hilarious and Robert de Niro was an excellent father in that he was always overprotective of his daughter and would always nitpick everything Greg did like most father-in-laws-to-be would. Greg was funny in that he was very loving toward Pam and was EXTREMELY jealous of her old boyfriend Kevin. That stewardess lady was hilarious because she was such a pain to Greg and the sticks and the BOMB BOMB BOMB was funny until 9/11 but still is sort of funny. All in all I give this movie a 10 but I wish to give it more but regrettably I cannot! EXCELLENTE!"
"mommyoftna","10","1","2","22 December 2004"," funny movie
","I loved this movie. This movie introduced me to Ben Stiller's work. Him and Robert Deniro were a perfect match. The cast was wonderful and worked well together. I can relate to the plot, it seems like any time one is trying to impress another something is bound to go wrong. Poor Greg (Ben Stiller) just seems to have the worst luck. It puts a different perspective on how airlines deal with people. The airline doesn't handle baggage very well and so I can understand why he would not want to check his bag again. The fact that he said ""Its not like I have a bomb"" does not make it less funny just because 9/11 happened. If airlines actually took things this seriously then they might have prevented 9/11 from happening. So those who don't like this scene should lighten up and not take it out on funny movies made before the horrible event occurred. I enjoyed this movie very much."
"CurtMan@LVCM.com","Null","1","2","18 October 2004"," Hilarious, Entertaining Comedy Hit
","""Meet The Parents"" succeeds marvelously at the hands of two brilliant, engaging comic actors, Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro, period. Their amusing collaboration as would-be in-laws is nothing short of absolutely convincing and flat out hilarious! From the moment Greg is introduced to the intimidating Byrnes family, he is enthralled by every snare, every ridicule, and every miserable catastrophe that is inevitable to befriend this ""critical acquaintance"". Talk about the desire to impress your fiancé's family going horribly, miserably wrong! It seems that every possible mistake, every possible ""gotcha"", and every possible ""slip of the tongue"" conceived by man befalls the hapless Greg, and all he set out to do was leave a good impression to his future in-laws. This is such a hilarious premise to begin with, but the execution is bounds and beyond what you might expect in a comedy such as this. The acrimony and uneasiness between Stiller and DeNiro is so convincing, so apparent, and so amusing that they work as a team to virtually steal the show! You just couldn't imagine any other pair of actors collaborating so effectively and so hilariously in a comedy such as this, and Stiller and DeNiro are the real reasons to watch this film. All I can say is, I can't wait until their next outrageous outing in the upcoming ""Meet the Fockers""; I can't see how the sequel can surpass such a hilarious and amusing film as this. From the polygraph tests, to the catastrophe with DeNiro's mother's ashes, to the striping of the cat, to the mishap with Stiller's name ""Gaylord Focker"", this is one classic comedy of misadventures, brilliant comic collaboration, and an ingenious barrel of genuine laughs! **** out of ****"

","I really expected a lot more from Ben Stiller. I am surprised because I can find the humor in even the worst comedies on TV or at the movies. It seemed bland and pointless. The only thing I laughed at in the whole movie was the fact that their house looked Exactly like my girlfriend's on the outside. In fact my girlfriends dad was in some ways like the guy played by Robert DeNiro. I found it even more strange that even though I related to the character in the story in some strange way, I found it to be one of the most boring movies I have seen in years. Oh well, I hope the next one is better."

","Greg (Ben Stiller) is a regular joe trying to impress a psychotic manipulative trouble-making father-in-law to be. It seems to make matters worse, however, that he's also a male nurse, jewish, and his legal name is Gaylord Focker, in this movie which is about as pleasant as taking a visit to a tooth-pulling dentist who is against using anaesthetics.<br/><br/>The riffing on Greg's name is primary-school grade humour, and has that feeling of a cheap joke, kind of that ""i can feel a song coming on"" feeling in bad musicals, just as bad is the ""we're throwing in a funny line"" feeling.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where everything you could imagine might go wrong - does - and always to the detriment of poor Ben Stiller. By the time the resolution started happening, it was too late. There were just too many bad things that happened to Greg Focker.<br/><br/>All this is not to say that its bad quality. Stiller hits the uncomfortable fiance thing perfectly. And the script is good - there are many moments, especially within the first half hour, that anyone who's ever met the parents before can associate with. <br/><br/>Is it enjoyable, though? No, i didn't think so. Ironically, its because they draw you in so much that its so upsetting. You simply can't accept these tragic situations as comedy - you feel too sorry for Greg Focker.<br/><br/>The resolution is fairly forced and implausible.<br/><br/>6/10. But not for me. Too sadistic.<br/><br/>Highlight: the airline hostess at the end."

"yenlo","Null","1","2","26 January 2004"," Yeah it is a comedy but it's hard to root for a wimp.
","As several other reviewers stated this film while it has its funny moments it is not a comedy classic but still it is not bad at all.  Any normal male would have been `outa there' after the first few encounters with the parents and certainly after the pool volleyball game. That is perhaps the most interesting element of the film is that the Ben Stiller character continues to put up with all of it and makes the viewer want to shout out ""TELL EM OFF YOU WIMP"". However any guy with any self-respect would inform their girl friend that if they do in fact end up getting married it is with the understanding that he is going to have nothing to do with her family.   The Greg character putting up with so much made him hard to root for or feel sorry for and it was impossible to side with her parents' side/clan.  Again it's comedy so should be viewed that way however even in a comedy nobody can side with a total wimp.  A great scene for the viewer would have been to have had the Stiller character go off on the parents' etc the way Stiller goes off on the airline rep."
"MovieLuvaMatt","7","1","2","13 October 2003"," No comedy classic, but definitely has its moments
","I'm not going to appraise this movie in the same way most people have, but as a whole it is funny.  It has its flaws, but the laughs outweigh those flaws.  First of all, I have to give most of the credit to Robert DeNiro. Many compliment this movie because of Ben Stiller, but I feel DeNiro added more of the laughs.  His reactions to Stiller's foolish antics are what made me laugh the loudest.  It shows that comedy is best when you play it out seriously.  Certain gags, some of which the film is best known for, simply fall flat.  The dinner table scene where Stiller talks about milking a cat and DeNiro gets choked up reading a poem drags out and is badly paced.  In the volleyball scene, when Stiller spikes the ball on that girl's face, I wasn't laughing either.  I don't think I'm being a stickler when I say that you can't show someone bleeding and in pain in a gag and expect a laugh. But there are other gags that work with flying colors.  I liked the bomb-bomb-bomb joke, and many of the latter scenes when Stiller's at the airport and running into problems with dumb employees. <br/><br/>
All in all, it's an uneven comedy that's way too silly at times, but there are enough laughs for it to deserve a recommendation.  As I said before, much kudos to DeNiro for a priceless comic performance. <br/><br/>
My score:  7 (out of 10)"

It's the only performance of his I've seen that wasn't stellar.  I probably laughed twice during the entire picture, and those were only light chuckles.  I found myself feeling sorry for Ben Stiller, more than laughing at him.  His antics through the film were cliched and generally not funny. It was more like the director was going, ""Let's see how many times he can get everyone to hate his guts in an hour and a half, and then we'll make it all better!""  My advice to those who have not seen it is SKIP IT!!!!!! Go rent ""Airplane!"" or ""Dumb and Dumber"" if you want a good laugh, because you're not going to find many here."

","This kind of lame-brained comedy that is so cherished by the mass market must fill some kind of masochistic social need, but I personally don't get it.  I loved and admired such dark comedies as ""After Hours,"" ""The Out of Towners"" and even ""Something About Mary,"" but they had something that this one lacked: intelligence and a sense of the unexpected.  This script seemed to be written around Stiller & DeNiro, a series of gags and sketches that add up to a big rollicking nothing.  This is very much in the ""Home Alone"" vein, written for adolescents who revel in unsubtle physical humor, much of it based in cruelty (S&M all the way) with a sickly sweet ending that was a foregone conclusion from the beginning."

When a funny turn of events make him not say the speech, his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) is taking him to meet her parents before proposing.<br/><br/>Greg obviously is nervous, and meeting Jack (Robert De Nero), Pam's dad, doesn't do anything to help. Robert De Nero has a knack for comedy, which seems to be his main thing nowadays. He's very good as the perceptive and yet naive father of teacher Pam.<br/><br/>Blythe Danner, who is underused in the movie, plays Jack's loving wife, Dina, who likes Greg and doesn't like Jack digging so deep into Pam's boyfriend's lives. Greg gives the Byrnes a gift-a rare plant. Pam had told Greg that Jack was a retired florist; what Greg doesn't know is that Jack is actually a retired CIA agent, which makes sense, since Jack is less than thrilled at the gift. It's obvoius that Jack doesn't approve of Greg, but Dina and Pam tell him to take it easy on Greg. Yeah, right.<br/><br/>Pam's sister, Deborah (Nicole DeHuff), is getting married to Dr. Bob Banks (Thomas McCarthy) in the Byrnes homestead while Jack is living there. Do you think the wedding will go flawless? One of the only things I don't like about Meet the Parents is that it has too many seconday characters, like Dr. Bob's father, Dr. Larry (James Rebhorn) and Bob's mother, Linda (Phyllis George). But if you don't really pay attention to those people (although they're needed later in the movie), it works better.<br/><br/>As more and more mishaps happen by Greg, Jack more and more dislikes him. He pains to like, or at least tolerate, Greg for the women's sakes, but it's tough. Luckily he's got hidden cameras around the house to look at him 24-7. Why is it so funny? Because it's by the director of the Austin Powers series, Jay Roach. Although Meet the Parents doesn't have the randiness of Austin Powers, it still holds some laughs.<br/><br/>Overall, Meet the Parents is a very funny movie that doesn't lack on plot and doesn't stoop to the Austin Powers level. The supporting characters leave something to be desired, but that doesn't even dent the otherwise wonderful and comedic movie that we have here.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for language, sexual humor, and drug refrences/content."

","How do you make a good first impression on and win over your prospective father-in-law on the very weekend you intend to ask for his first-born daughter's hand in marriage?  A tricky, touchy, very delicate and serious situation that must be faced and addressed by a young man in `Meet The Parents,' a hilarious comedy directed by Jay Roach and starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  Greg (Stiller) is in love; he knows Pam (Teri Polo) is the one he wants to spend the rest of his life with, and is ready to propose.  But certain circumstances clue him in to the fact that he should meet her parents first, approach her father, Jack (De Niro), and make the formal request, thereby extending him the respect he has come to understand Jack demands.  Plans are made, and the weekend begins with the flight from Chicago to New York.  And when a slight problem arises even before they board their plane, Greg should have seen it as an omen, because after that, absolutely nothing seems to go as planned. He finds Pam's mom, Dina (Blythe Danner), fairly accessible, but Jack turns out to be quite the formidable opponent, and from the minute they meet it becomes one long dance and spar of witticisms and revelations that make this one weekend Greg (and the audience) will never forget. 	What makes this movie so funny (and this IS one funny movie) is that the humor is character driven, situational and all very real; the laughs (and there are plenty) are all earned and are derived from inherently comical events and circumstances.  The ongoing banter between Greg and Jack is clever, the dialogue is superb and delivered with such sly and subtle shadings that it rings true at every turn.  And De Niro and Stiller play off of one another so perfectly and with such impeccable timing that it's like watching art come to life.  Stiller is a master at playing comedy dead-pan straight, and De Niro proves to be his equal here.  They never go after cheap laughs, and what little broad humor Roach employs evolves directly from the story and is never gratuitous or overdone; Roach and his cast let it all flow naturally and play it with a seriousness that makes it all the more hilarious.  You can literally feel Greg's pain and discomfort as he tries in vain to stand tall and impress this intimidating figure of a man he hopes will soon be his own father-in-law.  And De Niro makes Jack everything a suitor dreads in a prospective in-law; he doesn't merely scratch the surface of this character, but goes deep to make him a multi-layered personality, enigmatic and hard to read.  You know instinctively that there's more to this guy than meets the eye, and given the fact that nobody is good enough in his eyes for his little girl, he is a nightmare waiting for any and all `Gregs' that may come a-calling. 	Polo is charming as Pam; she's charismatic, has great screen presence and a winning personality that makes her character likable and totally believable. In a supporting role, Owen Wilson gives a stand-out performance as Pam's ex-boyfriend, Kevin; he so wryly underplays him, and what he does contrasts so well with what De Niro and Stiller are doing that it makes him one of the most memorable characters in the film.  Rounding out the excellent supporting cast are Nicole DeHuff (Debbie), Jon Abrahams (Denny), James Rebhorn (Larry) and Phyllis George (Linda).  With `Meet The Parents,' Roach leaves no doubt as to what he can do with a comedy; this film is filled with truly funny, memorable scenes and has an endless number of quotable lines, the best of which belongs to Jack (spoken to Greg ):  `If I find that you are trying to corrupt my first born child, I will bring you down, baby, I will bring you down to Chinatown'  In the final analysis, it's all a lot of fun, and there are many things here with which many viewers will readily identify.  This movie, in fact, may well be the perfect comedy; certainly it is nothing less than a modern-day classic that you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10."

Unlike their previous two films, ""Meet the Parents"" seems forced and contrived. Sure there are some laughs, but there is little humanity in this outing, it's more a cold fish. I found I didn't like either Stiller's or De Niro's characters. And the chemistry between any of the characters is missing. Therefore, for me, the jokes weren't funny, and were often disturbing.

","I can barely describe how bad this movie is.  There are movies that are bad, but are still fun.  Then there are films like this-""shining"" examples of mediocrity and crushing banality that make you root for a plague to wipe out a good portion of the world's population, just so the ""lowest common denominator"" is represented by a smaller number of people. <br/><br/>This is one of those situations where I am forced to believe that someone must have had compromising pictures of Robert DeNiro with an underaged goat to get him to appear in  this picture.  You know the basic plot, so I will, instead, list a number of details (that in an actually funny film, would not have distracted me)  that annoyed me to no end, and exemplify just how little thought went into this movie:1)DeNiro's character has supposedly spent his entire life undercover as a trader in rare plants, but can't recognize an orchid (might this astounding lack of knowledge ever have compromised his secrecy?); 2)He also seems to have collected ""tourist"" photos of himself standing beside very influential foreign leaders (again, would a real secret agent do this?);3)and anyway, does the CIA, or FBI just let you take home their equipment?  <br/><br/>Ben Stiller, on the other hand, seems to be singlehandedly leading the crusade to destroy the stereotype that the Jewish culture has a uniquely funny, and intelligent take on life (Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Gene Wilder, etc.).  Here, he is just grating.  Not a single line of dialogue exists in this film for any reason other to set up another lame joke.  And since the upcoming joke is painfully obvious, it's never funny. It's just painful. This is the sort of film, that if it were an animal, you would beat to death with a shovel just to put it out of its misery, and not feel too broken up about it afterwards.  <br/><br/>This is the stinking sludge of our strip-mall, brain-dead culture, written by your drunken frat-brother who thinks that septic-tank overflows and guys named ""Focker"" are the height of ""edgy"".  It's worse than bad-it's a bad film convinced that it's hilarious.  Avoid it like crap-on-a-stick."
"Denver53","5","1","2","2 May 2001"," Stupid characters, inexplicable actions, a few laughs
","I'm one of those people who have to see a sort of logic in a movie character's behavior to fully enjoy any resulting comedy. If a character takes a wrong turn somewhere and tries to get back on course but in the process takes an even more wrong turn and fun ensues, that's fine. But if a character gets lost and instead of trying to turn back decides to set his pants on fire or run over someone sitting on a park bench for no apparent reason, that is not funny to me. That's why I rated Meet the Parents a 5.<br/><br/>The main character, played by Ben Stiller, lies for no reason and then gets caught in his lies and makes them worse. He takes actions that he isn't supposed to and has been warned not to do then lies when he is asked if he did so and blames something (a cat) else. And when Greg tries to find the missing cat, he quickly stoops low enough to paint a different cat's tail and try to pass it off as the missing feline (why no one notices the paint smell until later that night, and then they do, is a mystery).  The guy isn't especially likeable and you keep wanting to slap him and say, ""Just tell the truth! It works!""<br/><br/>Meanwhile, his girlfriend expects Ben (called ""Greg"" in the movie) to instantaneously act like he is a member of a family he has never met. When Greg needs clothes, his girlfriend tells him to wake up her brother -- whom Greg has never met and whose bedroom door is closed while the brother is apparently asleep -- and borrow some of his. Uh, not a good idea. Later, his girlfriend drops little bomblets on Greg, such as the fact that the best man at a family wedding is her ex-finacee (by the way, Greg never even knew that his girlfriend had been engaged), or that the dad had a different career than what she had told Greg earlier.<br/><br/>All in all this group of characters spends a lot of time cleaning up messes that would have been easily avoided if a little truthful communication had taken place beforehand. It is that fact that kept me from enjoying any of the contrived situations that ensued. In fact, to me the funniest part of this movie was an airline gate agent who acts like, well, an airline gate agent, regardless of the actual situation around her. *That* was not contrived at all and was laugh out loud funny."

","Meet The Parents is an excellent comedy, despite the fact that the casting director was not the most brilliant person in the world. A lot of the material in the film was clichéd or simply not creative, such as the fact that Greg's (Stiller) luggage obviously got lost, but the film as a whole is an excellent and very entertaining comedy. Robert DeNiro is horribly miscast as the overprotective father, but he is such a good actor that he makes his performance in the role work very effectively. He didn't get to really be the startlingly effective tough guy that he is so famous for, but at least he was introduced in a domineering low angle shot, as he looks down at Greg and Pam from his bedroom window (a very smart move by the film's director).<br/><br/>
Ben Stiller plays the part of the charmingly named Greg Focker, who wants to marry his girlfriend but has to earn the approval of her parents first. His name is bad enough, but he has to constantly explain his job as a nurse, a profession which provides him little to no respect from Pam's family. The majority of the film relates the events of the weekend spent at Pam's parents house, and everything imaginable goes wrong for him. The thing that makes this movie so funny is the well-written script and the way that some of the actors deliver their lines, particularly Robert DeNiro. The casting director deserves little to no credit for DeNiro's quality performance, but he just did such a good job in an uncharacteristic performance that he really steals the show. Some of the situations and especially the dialogue in this movie are destined to become classic lines  `Not many men in your profession, are there, Greg?' `I have nipples, could you milk me?' And, of course, there is the hilarious way that DeNiro constantly calls Greg `Focker' or, in at least one instance, `Greg R.N.' <br/><br/>Meet The Parents is a film that a surprisingly wide variety of people can enjoy. Meeting the parents is a part of relationships that the vast majority of men go through, and this can either be a smooth or devastating experience, so they can relate to what goes on in this film. Also, the point of view of the woman whose parents are being met is thoroughly presented, so the female audience will not feel left out at all. Even parents can enjoy this movie, because what parents don't worry about their kids and their dating experiences? Some of the situations may go a little too far, I mean, it's not very often that an eligible bachelor meets his girlfriend's parents and nearly burns their house to the ground, and it's a little excessive that EVERYthing goes wrong, not just a lot of things, but the comedy is so good that these excessive things are okay.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is actually a good choice to play the role of Greg Focker, because he is such an annoying actor that it is very effective in the way that he gets all of Pam's family and friends to hate him. He makes a good scapegoat, and his unfortunate luck produces a good portion of the comedy in this film. But it is DeNiro, above all, who makes this such a good movie. He is cast strongly against type, but Meet The Parents is still a very well-made comedy that is just a lot of fun."

There is nothing redeeming about this character, he's sneaky, he lies, he doesn't seem to know anything about respect, he tries to manipulate those around him, he is just a horrible, unlike able person.

In fact, for the most part you can see the 'jokes' coming a mile off. The Art of Humour works when the unexpected occurs. Most of hilarity surrounding De Niro's plodding, sceptical overprotective nature as a prospective father-in-law gave a one paced, one dimensional feel to what ought to have been very funny. A good attempt all the same. The film kept itself above the level of pure slapstick. One or two moments generated sighs of sympathy rather than laughs. Still, as humour goes this was infinitely better than 'Police Academy' slapstick. There was a plot. The young man was on a mission, to win the consent of the de Niro for his daughter's hand, only it might have faired better with a little more complexity and depth.<br/><br/>

However, since all the comic scenes were so heavily foreshadowed, you knew what was going to happen before you got there anyway, and the effect was ruined.  I'll admit to a few chuckles, but nothing that even resembled a true laugh.<br/><br/>The humour was dry, the characters awkward and by the time you got to the end, I really didn't care what happened to any of them.<br/><br/>I really wasn't a fan of ""Something about Mary"" either, but it was a piece of comedic genius compared to this one.  If you really want to see true comedy, rent a Robin Williams, John Cleese or Jim Carrey flick (just to name a few).  Now THERE's comedy!"

","Ben Stiller has shown throughout the years that he does great at starring in fun comedies, and this is no exception. Stiller stars as Greg Focker, a male nurse who is going to meet his girlfriend's parents for the weekend and ask her father for approval to marry Pam, the aforementioned girlfriend. Stiller creates a character that is hilarious, believable, and one that many can relate to.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro steals the show as Jack Byrnes, a former CIA agent who is a nice guy but has strict rules. There are times when he suspects and knows that Greg is up to no good, but is accepting of who Greg is and isn't afraid to say anything. Jack likes to have fun but makes Greg nervous. Nobody can pull off the chemistry better than De Niro and Stiller do in these roles.<br/><br/>Teri Polo plays Greg's girlfriend Pam and Blythe Danner plays Jack's wife Dina. They both do fine jobs but are not given a whole lot to do.<br/><br/>Director Jay Roach takes an idea of what it'll be like to spend a weekend with a girlfriend's parents and makes an original story out of it. Roach is great at telling funny and heartfelt stories. Roach does an excellent job at getting the performances that he wants and is able to tell a good story."
"alangalpert","9","1","3","30 April 2010"," Extraordinarily funny!!
","""Meet the Parents"" is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Someone once said that ""only the truth is funny"", and that certainly applies here. Every young man who is going to meet his girlfriend's parents for the first time is filled with trepidation, and has the feeling that he is about to be subjected to an Inquisition. This film takes that impression one step further, making literal what is ordinarily only figurative. In this case, the hapless suitor (Greg Focker, played by Ben Stiller) is to be probed and dissected by an ex-CIA man, who has years of experience and all the tools of the trade at his disposal, including contacts at the Agency. To say that Jack Byrnes (Robert de Niro) is an overprotective father is like saying that Krakatoa was an explosion. Unlike her husband, Dina Byrnes is generally supportive of Greg and sympathetic to his plight, but Jack is calling the shots. Greg strives gamely to win them over, but everything he does backfires, or at least fizzles.<br/><br/>I have only one minor criticism. The lie detector idea was brilliant, but it could have been used to better effect. After the earlier scene when Greg is questioned about his feelings toward cats, the polygraph gave Jack the perfect opportunity to find out the truth, but he doesn't ask Greg about it.<br/><br/>There was an earlier, much shorter version of ""Meet the Parents"" that came out in 1992. It had basically an unknown cast, and very few people saw it. The lie detector bit from the 2000 film was the inspiration for a television reality show called ""Meet My Folks"", which ran on NBC for all of one full season. In contrast to the film, it was not primarily funny, although many viewers found it so."

So he goes to spend a weekend in her parents' home. Well, that weekend will not be easy to GREG, as an amount of unlucky occurrences happen, having always the same protagonist, GREG. Or I should say GAYLORD FOCKER (his real official name! LOL!).<br/><br/>One more time Ben Stiller is great doing this kind of character. He's perfect performing the unlucky guy who just want a change but for whom everything gets always wrong! Robert De Niro, on his side, also performs a good and funny character, but that stills too close to his image. I thought that at least in this movie (a romantic comedy!) he wouldn't be a member of CIA Anyway I liked the performances from all actors. I just think that Owen Wilson's role is too short. Funny as he is he deserved better, but he was at the beginning of his career I suppose <br/><br/>It's a funny and entertaining movie, with great laughs. Some of them made me cry of laughing!

","I loved both Meet the Parents films. I don't know which one I liked more because they were both hilarious. Both Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller are fantastic in these films. Director Jay Roach has brought us his best films to date. Some people find Austin Powers stupid. I think it's really funny, but I prefer Meet the Parents more. Robert De Niro's Jack Byrnes' character reminds me of my father. I mean my dad wasn't in the C.I.A or anything like that but he sure does scare some people. De Niro's character in Meet the parents is kind of an asshole because he goes out of his way to make Greg(Ben Stiller) look bad. It feels that way at least. I think that, though Austin Powers was hilarious, Meet the parents is a comedy that everyone can enjoy. It is the definitely better version of Son in Law. I wasn't a fan of Son in Law, but I love this film. The acting is a lot better and the film is a lot funnier than Son in Law. Not that I have a problem with Pauly Shore, it's just that I prefer Ben Stiller. I am one of those people. Well, I doubt that Ben Stiller will go and fake his death like Pauly Shore did. Well, it was just a film, but Pauly Shore really hasn't done anything in so long. Both Meet he parents' films are laugh riots, and I love the original. Both of them are great though."

Flushing the basement commode will flood the yard with sewage and ruin the wedding. Gosh, that'll never happen!

","This is one of those films that was advertised so heavily, I felt like I'd seen it before I actually saw it. They used all the best gags in the ads (which isn't saying much) and the presence of De Niro dominated. Maybe it's just me, for I know this was a big hit, but I couldn't stand seeing a highly regarded actor like Robert De Niro mugging his way through this lowbrow flick like it were a 108-minute Saturday Night Live sketch--which is what it should have been. It is staggeringly annoying watching Ben Stiller endure thinly veiled threat after threat, and it's not even rewarding when he finally stands up for himself.<br/><br/>Judging by this films box-office take, I guess I'm not in the majority when I say I am sick of the whole ""you're not good enough for my daughter"" schtick in movies and TV (the dreck known as ""8 Simple Rules"" is another example). However, I would like to thank IMDb for this website which allows me to vent my extreme displeasure at this totally unoriginal and irritating trend. I found this ""comedy"" utterly awful.<br/><br/>P.S. If you agree with me, you might want to check out the Roach's previous film, Mystery Alaska.

","Unusual but not entirely successful feel-bad comedy. At first glance, ""Meet the Parents"" seems to be a hybrid of Blake-Edwards-style farce and uninspired mainstream movie comedy (sort of like every movie Steve Martin has made in the past 15 years). But before long we realize it's actually much crueler than that  unlike those essentially safe entertainments, which are always rather boringly humane in their treatment of their characters, this film isn't afraid to get ugly. Its poor protagonist may not be particularly likable (and Ben Stiller's performance doesn't help a lot where that's concerned), but he nevertheless gains our sympathies because of the incessant, unreasonable series of tortures it rains down on him. It parades ugly character after ugly character in front of him, but unlike ridiculous farce figures such as Martin Short's Franck in the ""Father of the Bride"" series, these people are all too believable, the kinds of smug hypocrites we encounter all too often in life (and that includes Focker's fiancée, actually). That's sort of where the problem comes in - the glitzy Hollywood veneer never really jells with the elements of real pain, and we never particularly want to see Stiller accepted into this family. Worse than that, the film's not consistently funny, though of course it is frequently appalling, and to some that's going to be close enough. 6.5 out of 10."
"toclement","2","1","3","6 January 2001"," ""Meet the Parents"", I'd like you to meet the rubbish bin
","I went into ""Meet the Parents"" with an open mind, in the mood to see a lighthearted but somewhat intelligent comedy.  Considering the two stars (DeNiro & Stiller), I thought I had a good shot at getting what I was looking for.  Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed; ""Meet the Parents"" is nothing more than a 2-hour cliche, with a horrible script full of more holes than Swiss cheese.  <br/><br/>For example, Stiller's character name was Gaylord Focker.  So everyone in the film keeps addressing him ""Hey Focker!""  That's not funny, that's sophomoric!  Once would have been okay, but from beginning to end?  Focker is a male nurse, which makes him an endless target for being less than a whole man.  Isn't that fodder for an after-school special from the 1970s? <br/><br/>
But the thing that destroys this film is the horrible plot.  I guess we're supposed to recognize that DeNiro's character (the father of Focker's girlfriend) is kind of a psycho, but at the same time, Focker is exactly what the overprotective Dad claims: a habitual liar.  Then, after Focker has wreaked all kinds of havoc on his future hopeful in-laws DeNiro does an about face and realizes that Focker is the right guy for his daughter, as long as he loves her.  What the hell??  You just spent two hours developing a character and then in two minutes you tear it down...  I know that it's written in the U. S. Constitution that all films must have happy endings, but you could have found a more plausible way to arrive at that legally binding conclusion.  The movie makes absolutely no sense.  So Focker didn't lie about his MCAT scores, he lied about everything else.  But the MCAT score is the thing that saves him?  Why is an MCAT score from 10 years ago more important than the dozens of disasters he has caused?<br/><br/>I know it's just a comedy, but where is it written that comedies don't need to be written and filmed in a logical and intelligent way?   If you want to see a GOOD dark comedy about a bad luck streak, check out ""After Hours"" or ""The Out of Towners"" (the 1970 original).  Leave ""Meet the Parents"" for another lifetime (I know it's too late, you have all already seen it)."

It could have been from Hollywood though. Like I said, I don't remember so please don't IM me about this information).<br/><br/>For starters, why would anyone need to meet someone else's parents when they have parent's of their own (that they do not need to meet, unless they were abandoned as children and left either at an orphanage or for dead on the harsh, realistic streets of New York City. Even then, I really don't see the point of meeting the parent's who never loved you). What made this idea even more improbable, was the idea that there was a great deal of distance to travel for that meeting to occur...I'm not sure what Owen Wilson was thinking when he accepted this part. What I do know is that I have never met anyone else's parents other than my own (my parents loved me very much and did not abandon me in New York City). And I'm glad too, because from what this movie portrays, other people's parent's are very mean and would probably judge me off of my character.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a realistic film about social situations I would much rather you watched Saving Private Ryan.

","Meet the Parents (2000): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Teri Polo, Blythe Danner, Owen Wilson: Comedy about every man's fear as his dating life grinds to a halt. It is about making the right impression but one of the film's problems is that it doesn't really address both parents. It regards Ben Stiller meeting Robert De Niro. Stiller plays a male nurse who proposes to Teri Polo who plays a kindergarten teacher. They plan to spend the weekend at her parents house, which is surveillance. Simple yet inviting setup predicable with numerous tasteless jokes. Interesting conclusion between De Niro and Stiller where an interesting truce is met. Directed by Jay Roach who is famous for the Austen Powers films, the original being superior to this one but obviously not the sequels. Stiller brings out the embarrassment of being viewed as a male nurse but that is the least of his problems when his future father-in-law interrogates him. We can see where this is going but De Niro counters the formula with a hilarious performance. Polo serves as a method of introduction only, and Danner is underused as De Niro's wife, which hinders the affect of the title. It certainly ties into every man's trauma when it comes time to furthering his relationship connection but perhaps if the material met with a better screenwriter then the parents might be worth meeting.

"StevePulaski","4","0","3","6 July 2015"," A very serious, relatable story squandered
","Is there anything more nerve-wracking or heart-racing than meeting your significant others parents for the first time? This seems to be more of an obvious fear for the male in a heterosexual relationship than it is a woman's; the desire to make a presence that's simultaneously meaningful and respectful, but not too brazen, is a tricky dance to accomplish and the anxiety that accompanies such an event is usually too much to even begin to adequately articulate. One winds up overthinking everything to the point of either saying something they didn't mean to say or feeling like they have just made a complete fool of themselves in front of the person they love and her own family.<br/><br/>I suppose I can rest easy knowing that writers Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg have made a ""worst case scenario"" film about the subject, which effectively makes almost any evening spent with the parents of your significant other seem desirable and successful in comparison. Jay Roach's Meet the Parents is the kind of film that takes those fears and persistent worries and etches them into a film that ups the stakes so high that, after a while, it becomes difficult to laugh given how far the film has fallen from its own sense of realism. it takes a realistic and common fear and repeatedly throws so many incredulous situations towards it, turning it into a farce, that, by the end, it's not only hard to take the film seriously, but the characters as well.<br/><br/>We meet Gregory Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse who has been in a relationship with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) and is working to execute the perfect marriage proposal as soon as he gets off work. Just before he's about to pop the big question, Pam gets a call from her sister that she is now engaged, right after her fiancée asked Pam's father for her hand in marriage. While Pam claims it isn't necessary to do such a thing, it's a sweet, traditionalist gesture. As a result, Greg keeps his plans under the wraps and agrees to go to Pam's family's home in Long Island for the wedding.<br/><br/>Upon losing his luggage on the flight, Greg meets Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro) and her mother Dina (Blythe Danner). Right off the bat, Jack is cold and offputting to Greg, emphasizing Greg's less-than-positive view of cats and his own career choice of being a nurse. This sets the tone for what will be the next few days - awkward, uncomfortable interactions that will revolve around Greg trying to please Jack, but, in the end, only resulting in frustration or anger on Jack's behalf. Things only get intensified when Greg winds up meeting Kevin (Owen Wilson), Pam's ex-fiancée who is helping organize her sister's wedding.<br/><br/>Meet the Parents has a committed cast of greats, starting with De Niro and Stiller, the two obvious, and even making strong uses of Polo and Danner, who transcend supporting roles and have a few of their own moments to shine. Consider Polo's character consistently trying to tow the lines of loyalty to her father and express her love for Greg, while Danner's character's cheeriness is usually diminished by the sternness of her husband. The glaring effects of the male characters on the female characters is an interesting dichotomy, especially seeing as the female characters are the whole reason everyone is brought together.<br/><br/>Other than that, and some surface relatability based on the basic premise of the film rather than the actual details, Meet the Parents is one long sitcom. The film houses a barrage of overblown sight gags, caricatures instead of characters, and a case of ""maximum antics, minimum laughter,"" where the writers continue to dogpile awkward scenarios on the characters while forgetting to humanize the characters in order for the gags to actually work. This is less a film and more an assortment of asinine events that work to beat the audience down with slapstick and a great deal of comedy that is almost too desperate to be funny.<br/><br/>Meet the Parents will get empathy points from many, but the points it receives from its obvious brand of comedy should be relatively minimal. There's an appalling lack of human interest here outside of the film's concept, which is a big problem when you have a film that has the ability to resonate very deeply with people. Many of us have been in Greg's situation and many of us have found ourselves to be the worst enemy at times, but these elements, while substantial and ripe for exploration, can even be taken in a haphazard manner.<br/><br/>Starring: Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Robert De Niro, Blythe Danner, and Owen Wilson.

As Pam's sister has just been proposed to, the couple is invited to the wedding, and meets Pam's parents. On first glance, Pam's father Jack is kind and loving; however, we soon see Jack calling someone for Greg's legal records and files. Even for the most innocent person, this is something that you do not want someone to be investigating into. As the two men talk more and more, Jack becomes more and more suspicious and unforgiving towards Greg. Not long after, polygraph tests are given, events become disasters, and life for Greg becomes a torment.<br/><br/>I originally wanted to see this because it featured my favorite actor, Robert De Niro. Though he usually is in a role where he is a mobster, hit-man, etc., this is one of the roles where he tried his hand at comedic acting. After successes like Analyze This, where he made fun of his tough- guy persona, he received more lighthearted roles, and this is one of them. The plot itself is simple. A man meets his potential father-in-law, and the father-in-law makes his time miserable. Before I hit ""Play"", I thought, ""Well they'll have some good jokes, Stiller will do his usually shenanigans, and it'll end soundly. Needless to say, it did not go as I thought. The basic plot's humor wears off within the first 40 minutes, and the remaining 1 hour and 8 minutes is just potty humor, distasteful sex jokes, and Ben Stiller looking stupid (as usual). I'm not sure if it was my expectations coming into the film that were too high, or the quality of the film was so low in actuality, but I did not like this film very much. <br/><br/>I can appreciate low-brow humor when it is done correctly, but the Stiller brand of comedy is not one that I've ever found good, and I doubt that I ever will. <br/><br/>www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com"

","Saw this one on a boring afternoon and I was quite entertained. The title of the movie explains itself. A guy meets his girlfriend's parents. As usual he has to prove he is the man to her father, who is not quite convinced of that. Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro both give great performances which takes just average comedy to the good level. There are many laugh out loud moments and also some silly gags here and there. I haven't seen much of Ben Stiller except in 'Night at the Museum' series, he really shines out here. The story is quite predictable but humor is there every now and then to keep you hooked. Also we all know how it is going to end,nothing new in that zone. Not much to talk about, all I would say its worth a watch.<br/><br/>RATING: [3/5]"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","1","9 June 2014"," Better in the small moments
","Meet the Parents' tries to be equal parts subtle human comedy and slapstick comedy. The first works, the second gets in the way.<br/><br/>The movie stars Ben Stiller as a likable guy in love with his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) but is thwarted in almost every attempt to ask her hand in marriage (his latest proposal is interrupted when she gets a call on her cell phone). They've been dating long enough that Pam thinks that it's time for him to meet her parents in Long Island.<br/><br/>Pam's father Jack is a nightmare of smiling intimidation from the moment he meets Greg and Greg tries mercilessly to manuver his way from one social blunder to the next. Robert De Niro has fun as the father who manages to catch Greg in little white lies in such a way that he has to tell bigger ones to get out of it. One social blunder falls into another especially when Greg tries to make small talk about 'Puff the Magic Dragon's supposed drug theme which leads Jack to think he's a pothead. I especially liked the way that Greg tries to reason out why he was looking at a breast pump ad, which leads to an explanation about cat milking.<br/><br/>I wish that the movie would have stayed at this level with the way in which Stiller gets himself in deeper and deeper and the way that De Niro has of stepping on every sentence like a cat playing with a mouse. The problem is that while the dialogue works, the screenplay allows for a whole series of overblown slapstick scenes that don't.<br/><br/>I can deal with the sweet verbal intimidation on De Niro's part but when Stiller sets the gutter on fire, floods the backyard with sewage, gets arrested for being a terrorist and accidentally breaks Pam's sister's nose I cover my eyes in embarrassment. For every scene that I liked, there was a scene that I didn't like.<br/><br/>I liked the running gag about Greg's last name Focker which plays into some of the film's best lines, especially when we find out Pam's middle name. But I found it painful when De Niro reads a tearful poem about his late mother which is followed by Stiller accidentally breaking her urn.<br/><br/>There is a wonderful scene at the end in which the two men, sitting at a table, finally just work everything out. But it's followed by a scene in which De Niro watches Stiller lash out on his home Nanny Cam. This scene is funny but why is it at the end of the movie? It seems to come too late.<br/><br/>De Niro is an actor who can turn the most mainstream role into a brilliant performance. Here he plays a guy who loves his family but is overprotective of his daughter especially from a guy who stumbles as much as Stiller's character does.<br/><br/>The movie was directed by Jay Roach to directed the 'Austin Powers' films and like the sequel, 'Meet the Parents' is better in it's smaller moments."

","I have heard nothing but positive things about Meet the Parents, and I watched it, boy was that an epic waste of time. I'm not one for ranting on a movie that I think is atrocious so I'll try to be brief. Let's start with the positive of this movie.<br/><br/>...... Yea that's about it. There isn't much. There is very little that satisfied me, but it's a matter if preference with this movie. Here's why.<br/><br/>Everyone was essentially a miss on casting, in my opinion. They did their job, but other actors could have done it better. For example, this is a comedy movie that relies on awkward comedy. It is exactly that. 100% awkward. If that's the comedy you like, this is your movie. I'm not a big fan of awkward comedies like this, so they have to be really good comedies for me to enjoy them. The cast does their job, but it could have been done better by other people. I feel like I'm starting to rant, but I'll conclude here. It's a great movie if you like this style of comedy, if you don't this movie will not win you over, or even come close."

","This movie tried to be both and failed at both.Di Nero saves the movie from being a total failure.

"gattonero975","8","0","2","27 September 2012"," ""A So-So Comedy""
","The only reason I watched this film because it has starring one of my favorite actors of all times: De Niro. he wasn't the De Niro I'm use to seeing and expecting from other films. playing a retired CIA type, OK I guess and that's because I'm basing it on his past film work. I figured he could get away with it. Him playing Teri Polo's dad, don't think so. Didn't work for me. Blythe Danner did a way more believable job as her mom. They kinda look like each other also. Danner didn't have to much to do here, the whole film really revolves around De Niro vs Stiller.<br/><br/>Ben did and still does a good job playing these geek-like/ white-bread types. I could not identify with him at all because I am more of an aggressive type and would never stoop so low as to impress my future father-in-law the way Ben does here. So the scenes where he is trying his best to impress DeNiro's uptight, conservative, anal-type ex-CIA guy just is not funny to me. It's annoying. I'm like if she loves me and I love her, then the hell with what anyone thinks, especially our parents.<br/><br/>Teri polo did an excellent job as Ben's love. You can actually believe he is doing and taking all this BS for a girl like that. it's funny that she turns out not to be all that Ben thought she was. She was living a very care-free almost purely sexual relationship with Owen Wilson's character!! In which Ben knew nothing at all of it! she saved all explanation though by saying, she loves Ben and that she never ever really ""loved' Owen! Ka-Ching! Hooked! <br/><br/>Owen Wilson did a good job also as the former love of Teri. Owen was just being Owen-Obnoxious, basically himself. He still carries a torch for Teri. (He still has all the pictures of he and her doing all kinds of adventures like :Sky-diving, skiing, bungee-jumping, etc..) All things Ben has not done with her yet! Yet he still stays because why? ....She loves him. Awww... Give me a break! Yeah right.<br/><br/>Character actor James Rebhorn does very little here except basically be set background. He plays Teri's sister future father-in-law since his son is actually marrying Teri's sister.<br/><br/>The cat scenes and the weird airport lady scenes which includes the on the plane scene which Adam Sandler also used for his Anger Management movie, in which Sandler has a similar scene, is almost a bit way funnier than anything else in the film. But if I wanted to watch cute pets, I could have easily seen any America's funniest video's. BUT ANYWAYS, The film was good enough to make a sequel. And in the end it's not half bad considering all the talent that really was involved. A first time pairing for some. now that's always a treat to any film-watcher."
"motorfocus82","5","0","2","23 August 2012"," Not painfully funny to me, just painful
","Five out of ten isn't a horrible review, and I'm giving it because everyone looks at these kinds of things differently and the theme of the movie was simply the opposite of what I find enjoyable to watch. The movie was well-produced, well-paced, and well-acted, so I'm not faulting it on its technical merits. It's all perspective, and I know that. Some fool on here said the thing was all about power and control and anti- Semitism among WASPS, which simply doesn't scan at all to me and seems to indicate that some people really want to see things how they always see them anyway. <br/><br/>The problem that I have with the movie is that pretty much the entire thing revolves around 'embarrassment humor'. Quite simply, I empathized with Greg's character enough that I didn't like watching him get beat on for nearly two hours, watching him make things worse for himself by being both stupid and pathetic, and then have a five minute resolution at the end that makes it all 'worth it'. It's just not funny to me. Rather, it's about the last thing I want to subject myself to, especially in the guise of a comedy. Some people enjoy this kind of thing, I guess because they're glad it isn't them or can think back to a time it WAS them and be glad it's over. Don't get me wrong, there needs to be some tension in any film and the risk of embarrassment works very well, even for me, in moderate doses. But this wasn't moderate. Watching 'The Passion of the Christ' is less painful for me, because as I see it, physical pain happens. This kind of social pain is more unjust.<br/><br/>Good scenes? The cat milking discussion was hilarious. The lie detector scene was fun. The resolution at the end was far from adequate, but still a good scene. DeNiro is a far better comic actor than he's given credit for, and Stiller has made much of his career by being victimized by various forces on screen, so of course he does it well. It was just overload as far as I'm concerned."
"lancecherubin","6","0","2","20 February 2011"," Good for a few chuckles, not laugh out loud funny though.
","This is a decent comedy which provides quite a few laughs and entertainment throughout. The spoken humor is not very funny except for the constant use of the very unique surname ""focker""; but the screw up jobs that Greg keeps employing in an effort to impress Pam's father were enjoyable. I would have rated this movie higher, but there are some points which are very boring and uninteresting, but the few exciting moments cover up nicely to save this film from being a complete bore. Overall this is a fairly enjoyable romantic comedy which effectively uses play on words to keep its audience amused when the plot does not have much going for it."
"bowman20","9","0","2","5 December 2010"," Meet The Parents
","This review includes a spoiler. Meet the Parents is about a man, Gaylord Focker, who goes by the name of Greg (Ben Stiller). He is living with his girlfriend, Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), who he going to ask to marry him. He is not able to ask her yet because Pam invites him to parent's house to attend her sister's, Debbie (Nicole Dehuff), wedding. Pam's father, Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro), is a retired CIA member who does not trust anyone and he still acts as if he is in the CIA. Jack and Greg do not get off on the right foot because Jack does not act like he likes Greg. So, the movie continues with Greg trying really hard to get Jack's approval while Jack does not make it very easy. Jack thinks that Greg is someone else because Jack could not find evidence of Greg taking a test to become a doctor. Jack tries to convince Pam that he has been lying to her. Greg tries to be helpful, but he ends up almost ruining Debbie's wedding so he gets ready to leave and his luggage arrives. The guy asks if he is Gaylord Focker, and he agrees. Jack realizes that Greg's true name is Gaylord and he made a mistake. So Jack goes to the airport to convince Greg to come back. So, Greg returns and asks Pam to marry him and she says yes. The movie ends with Jack stating that they have to meet Greg's parents. The theme of this movie is that people are always what they seem on the surface. Jack thought that Greg was a liar because Jack thought his first name was Greg except Gaylord is his first name. So, Jack was completely wrong which does not happen very often. Throughout the movie the viewer really roots for Greg because he is a good guy who is trying to impress his girlfriend's parents. He becomes the underdog of the film who can't catch a break. Greg has good intentions that usually end badly in this movie. The angle technique that is used in this movie is great. The viewers really feel like that could be Greg's character. Everyone has been there when they are trying to impress someone and it turns into a disaster. Another great technique that was used was the lighting. It was very natural and the viewers will feel like they are really in the movie. If you like the Family Stone, then you will love Meet the Parents. Robert De Niro does a great job as a bored retired CIA member, and Ben Stiller plays Greg's role very well. Enjoy this film as it unravels that things are not always what they seem."
"Melanie82-1","7","0","3","3 September 2009"," de ja vu
","Every one who sees this film should relate to this type of nervousness. Everyone dates and every one has to face the parent or parents of their significant other at one time or another. I thought this film was very good. De niro's character is very realistic. The movie has a lot of laughs because of the genre background of the actors. I think Jay Roach definitely knew what he was doing when he casted Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller. Both of these particular actors carry an opposite approach on comedy. When you put the two together you will have a hard time keeping a straight face. Just as the actors did in the making of this genius comedy. If you watch the extras on the DVD you will see the how hard it was for two totally different styles collaborating to bring you this type of ""de ja vu"" experience. I highly recommend the purchase of this DVD to anyone. It was all the round funny for the whole family. Fathers, daughters, boyfriends, mothers, and even children can relate. Nothing less than brilliant for strategic marketing. As an actor myself i can say clearly that everyone in the film was casted perfectly. The story is as simple as any really. Greg Focker wants to marry his girlfriend and has to face her (ex cia agent) father. He is gonna be very mysterious and psychological in determining whether Greg is right for his little girl or not. Trust me, you'll love this film. Of course at the climatic point Greg experiences nothing more than just a thorn in the Burn's eye's. He must quickly think of solutions to capture their hearts and acceptance into the family. Everything he does negatively turns around on him. I don't want to spoil any more of the film, you will have to watch to see the turn-out of this hilarious addition to cinematic archives."
"jboothmillard","8","0","4","22 November 2008"," Meet the Parents
","I have to admit I never saw this entirely before seeing the tame sequel, Meet the Fockers, and thank god I finally did, it is a fantastic comedy, from director Jay Roach (Austin Powers). Basically Jewish male nurse Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Ben Stiller - originally it was meant to be Jim Carrey?) was planning to propose to girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), but he sees that first he should ask permission from Pam's parents first, like the boyfriend of her young sister Deborah 'Debbie' Byrnes (Nicole DeHuff) has. So begins the weekend visit from Hell when Greg meets mother Dina (Blythe Danner), and strict father and ex-CIA agent Jack (Robert De Niro), and trying to make a good impression, with no embarrassment or humiliation, everything that can go wrong, does go wrong, and very disastrously. In the course of the weekend trying to get on with the parents, especially Jack, Greg manages to knock over Jack's mother's ashes (and have the cat pee on them), have a personal lie detector test, hit the bride sister Debbie in the eye with a volleyball, flood the garden with the toilet water and sewage (because of the sceptic tank not being emptied), burn some of the garden and the altar made by Pam's ex-fiancée Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson), and lose the cat Mr. Jinx. There is obviously the point where Greg pretty much gives up trying, and is told to leave, but Pam has a real talk to her father, and he knows that she is old enough to make her own decisions, and he has to get used to one of her partners, so they all make up in the end, and it ends not only with a wedding (Debbie and her boyfriend), but you know a sequel is inevitable with Jack saying ""all we have to do is meet his parents"". Also starring Jon Abrahams as Denny Byrnes and James Rebhorn as Dr. Larry Banks. Last time I saw De Niro manage some comedy was in the dark Scorcese classic, The King of Comedy, and he proves himself capable of being not only a great method actor, but a great comedian, oh, and Stiller excels too, a very funny film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Randy Newman's ""A Fool In Love"". Robert De Niro number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 18 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!"
"Global_Marketing_Pros","7","0","1","26 September 2006"," DeNiro as himself using the Jewish Kabbalh and Hasidism in art.
","DeNiro plays the part of a retired intelligence about to marry his daughter to the character Gaylord Focker. They claim in the movie that the character Jack used to be in the Central Intelligence Agency. But if anyone knows about the intelligence community this could be any organization authorized to operate with U.S. intelligence data.<br/><br/>From my point of view I like to think of the actor DeNiro using and wearing his yamaka in some film to express his hidden heritage as being Jewish. As in the movie Analyze That when DeNiro ties up customers in a diamond shop. So in this movie Meet The Parents I think DeNiro again is playing the the concept of religion with the Jewish Kabbalh and Hasidism. This religious concept has the religious concept written from my research that it is common to pass on the family secrets to a son-in-law.<br/><br/>Of course throughout the movie Jack is cautious and skeptical, which is probably common for a retired intelligence agent with world culture. The acting is pretty good creating a relaxed environment for entertainment with good setups for the short exciting action sequences. Camera lighting and film quality are also top noch."
"fredrik-josefsson","3","0","2","9 September 2006"," Why i didn't like this film
","I generally like these type of ""silly"" comedies. But I didn't like this one.<br/><br/>What makes this movie different from other movies of this genre, is that our main character Greg Focker isn't the typical stupid guy with a good heart that we see in comedies of this sort. Instead, Greg is a real jerk, who takes every chance he can to do something nasty. He displays himself as a coward and a liar -- a rather spine-less person. Incidentally, he is revealed to be Jewish, and perhaps one could say that he fits a stereotypical Jewish movie depiction: whining and full of self-pity.<br/><br/>However, there were actually some surprisingly comical moments in the movie that made me laugh out loud. But the plot was just too stupid. Greg doesn't miss a single opportunity to blow something. In fact, he must have done damage for around 1,000,000 $. But will the father, Jack Byrnes, forgive him at the end? That was what I asked myself during the film: ""how will they stitch this all together"". I won't reveal the end, but I did find it uplifting compared to the previous hour.<br/><br/>I feel a little sorry for Robert De Niro who had to act in such a silly film. However, he does his part very convincingly, of course."
"barnabyrudge","6","0","1","3 September 2006"," Solid comedy in which the comic timing of De Niro and Stiller masks the predictable plot and gags.
","Meet The Parents is a predictable but fairly funny story about a guy whose attempts to impress his potential future in-laws go disastrously wrong. There's a lot of talk on the IMDb about it being the funniest comedy ever and the best film of its decade to date, but in all honesty such talk is rather naïve. Instead, Meet The Parents comes across as a solid, enjoyable comedy of errors. Anyone who watches a lot of comedies will see some of the punch-lines a mile off, but the performers demonstrate a nice sense of comic timing that raises a smile from even the more obvious gags.<br/><br/>Male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) plans to propose marriage to his steady girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). However, she mentions during a conversation that her father is a very traditionally-minded man who believes that potential ""suitors"" should ask his permission before proposing to his daughters. Greg decides to accompany Pam on a weekend visit to her parents' place, hoping to make a good impression in their eyes before asking for their approval in his plans. Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro) turns out to be a pretty intimidating guy, and things only get more and more awkward for Greg when he learns that his future father-in-law is an ex-CIA interrogator. Trying too hard to make a good impression, Greg almost always invariably does just the opposite. an attempt to shower everyone with champagne results in a vase containing Jack's mum's ashes getting smashed; a game of water volleyball ends with Jack's other daughter getting her face wounded; an innocent cigarette causes some pretty disastrous fire damage to the Byrnes' house; etc, etc. Ultimately, Greg causes so much unintentional havoc that he virtually shatters his chances of being accepted by the Byrnes.<br/><br/>The film is actually based on a rarely seen low-budget 1992 film of the same title. Here it gets a more polished makeover, though is not necessarily the better of the two films. Stiller is likable in his accident-prone role while De Niro shows a nice flair for comedy as the terrifying father. Polo doesn't have a great deal to do as the girlfriend, since her role mostly consists of hugging the insecure Greg and assuring him that he's doing great, and Blythe Danner is similarly under-used as De Niro's sweet-natured wife. Of the lead actors, the other one who has the best of things is Owen Wilson, in a small but amusing part as Pam's ex boyfriend. In essence this is a situation comedy of the kind seen on TV virtually every day, but scaled-up with A-list stars and an expensive, cinematic sheen. The script contains some funny one-liners which the actors seize upon with plenty of verve, and Jay Roach directs it with the pace and confidence he invested in his Austin Powers movies. Meet The Parents is plenty of fun, especially when treated on its merits, but you shouldn't be hoodwinked into expecting the comedy-to-end-all-comedies. If that's what you expect and demand of the film, you may come away feeling a little let down."

This also happens to be the first time Greg has met Pams parents, hence the title-'Meet the Parents'. Pam's father isn't the most laid back of people in fact he's rather scary and they couldn't have chosen anyone better to play Jack Byrnes than Robert DeNiro. This is a different role for DeNiro from his other films but you can still see his character hold some of his old roles. Poor Greg is taken on a roller-coaster with only himself to blame. You can't help but feel sorry for him as he seems like an outcast especially when they all go and party at Kevin's mansion (Wilson) who's Pam's ex fiancÃ©e-I mean can you actually imagine that happening to you, it's so cruel. Ben Stiller is great in this film and I love his acting. He's great at playing the vulnerable, clumsy guy who only wants to keep everyone happy. I mean this guy was never given a chance even from birth when his parents named him Gaylord'Greg' Focker. This film made him one of my favourite comedy actors. He doesn't need to pull faces, and go OTT like the Jim Carreys of the acting world.

And sometimes things don't go as they are expected...<br/><br/>By making this movie, it's clear that the director Jay Roach gave the actors a free hand perhaps so as to try to compensate an unremarkable plot. The success of the movie rests on their shoulders. I would grant a special award to Ben Stiller and of course to Robert De Niro who shows that as an actor he's always at ease and excellent after all these years spent in the cinema. Of course, we're obliged to recognize that the humor isn't always subtle, certain characters are nearly stereotyped (Owen Wilson) and the sequence where De Niro blames Stiller for not being honest whereas honesty isn't his strong point appears quite conventional. As Jack Lemmon said in ""Some like it hot"" (1959): ""Nobody's perfect"". But there are quite a lot of funny situations and hilarious gags.<br/><br/>So, a mastered topic that gives a spirited comedy."

","When I(finally) saw ""Meet the Parents"" which I had heard SO much about I was expecting a lot. Maybe my expectations were to high, it definitely wasn't the laugh fest I had expected though I still kind of enjoyed it and would rate it about a 6 or so out of 10. I wouldn't really strongly recommend it though.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes, to me, just weren't funny. Like for instance the volleyball that hits the girl in the face and the ern breaking with the ashes in it. I also thought some of the jokes directed to Greg(Stiller's character) were a bit cruel. I thought I was the only one who thought that until I read some of the other reviews on here and found that others agreed with me. Some of the jokes were funny-there were a few great one liners and fun dialog(the ""martha farker"" thing, the ""milking"" scene for instance)but after awhile I was just getting mad at everyone for tormenting this guy and angry at his girlfriend Pam for not sticking up for him. The movie to me rated somewhere between a 5.5 and 6 which still means I thought it was average , just not great or the ""10"" I thought it would be.<br/><br/>De Nero easily steals the movie in his best role and should consider more roles in comedy, somehow he manages to keep Jack Likable through it all(even while I started hating everyone else picking on poor Greg I couldn't hate Jack)and he absolutely makes the movie, with another actor I probably wouldn't have liked it at all.The best scene in the movie was when Jack ""proposed"" to Greg, THAT was great. Meet the parents was definitely not perfect but OK to see as a rental if not already seen. My vote's 5 or 6 out of 10."

Aside from the fact that Pam doesn't stand up for her man until the very end, which really bugs me, I think this one of the best comedies of the last 10 years, easily. Particularly because they don't resort to the gross-out stuff that virtually every other comedy contains these days. De Niro is the best thing about this film....I think he has great comedic timing.

","MEET THE PARENTS (2000) spoilers in grammar((( Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro plays the two main characters in this very good comedy that takes like the same showdown as the TV-series about three women/men in ""Meet the folks"". The film is surprisingly good with many memorable sequences as when De Niro and Stiller challenges each other in their cars. But we also have a nice small role in Owen Wilson (who's a great actor). The movie is so choosy and nice but in the same time hysterical as when Stiller climbs on the house roof and when De Niro takes the lie-detector on him. I really urge you too see the movie (and the sequel who's soon finished). STARS: **** 4/5 (this is comedy!)"

No wonder De Nero was p***ed at the dude, and father would be!

","It's quite rare for me to really laugh at a comedy because most of the time the jokes are too lame, mega-predictable, sometimes too vulgar or just not funny for whatever reason. But this one... I can't remember the last movie that made me laugh so much... brilliant! To me, only one joke was really predictable and just waiting to happen. The rest was, in my opinion quite original and totally hit the right tone. I can't believe how much fuss was made when ""There's Something about Mary"" came out. The humor in that film was so much 'cheaper'...this film was classier and way, way better."

This movie works on two levels.  Yes, it's hilarious.  It really is. But it also works as a thriller.  I know that sounds silly, but this movie had me on the edge of my seat.

"Theo Robertson","6","0","5","12 August 2002"," A Major Disappointment
","You'd think black romantic comedy + Robert De Niro + Ben Stiller = great fun wouldn't you ? But MEET THE PARENTS is an extremely disappointing film . Some of my disappointment might be down to the trailers I'd seen ( Which basically contain all the amusing moments ) which led me to believe I'd be seeing a film similar to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY . Okay there's a couple of bad taste moments and there's a subplot involving a cat but there's nothing I found to be laugh outloud funny . De Niro - Like in WE 'RE NO ANGELS - seems to think comedy involves entirely of mugging for the camera , it's sad to point this out but De Niro is doing himself no favours by appearing in all these films , a few more unfunny comedies like this and Travis Bickle will be a distant memory . And as another reviewer pointed out watching this film after September 11th 2001 makes it even more unfunny<br/><br/>Update 2005 : Having recently rewatched this movie I wish to point out that is does slightly improve over time"

But in this case, they were saddled with an unfunny script and unlikeable characters.<br/><br/>None of the jokes were funny. Stiller raising heck on a jet might have been mildly amusing before 9/11, but it certainly is not now. The scene with Stiller hooked up to the lie detector was just a yawner.

","Greetings again from the darkness.  This is a cute movie with some great comedy, ruined for me by the Hollywood brass that decided to spend 2 months promoting the movie by blowing every punch line and sight gag in the movie, save one (the ""drag racing"" scene).  I do think there should be a law or rule, that only allows ONE Ben Stiller movie per year.  He is good in small doses.  DeNiro is his usual scene-chewing greatness as the over-bearing dad, Gwyneth's mom (Blythe Danner) is wasted (and looks out of sync) as the too-quiet mom.  Owen Wilson has a nice turn and should consider specializing in the character actor role.  If you have not seen more than 3 previews to this movie, you should go.  I BEG you Hollywood, give us credit ... we will go see your movie if it is well written and well acted.  Don't ruin it for us before we arrive!  My special note on this one is that one of the producers is the former goofy stand-up comedian, Emo Phillips.  Also, kudos to Jay Roach for his direction.  This is a giant step from the underrated ""Blown Away""."

","So you know the plot.  The stupid decisions that Greg Focker makes during this film and coupled with the growing anti-""Greg"" sentiment building up from Robert De Niro's character made me antsy, angry and not buying it. Kelli Polo's character also makes some stupid mistakes that I didn't buy into.  Yes, it seems to be a bit of way out ""something About Mary"" kind of humor, but the puzzle pieces don't fit together.  Too much anti-Semitism for me.  Too much anti-male nurse teasing for me.  There is a point at which Ben Stiller's Greg becomes harassed and that's when it lost me.<br/><br/>This stellar cast did the best job possible with a twisted, disjointed, unbelievable and doesn't know when to stop script!<br/><br/>Yes I laughed out loud at much of the physical humor.

","My guess is that people who love this film laugh at comedies because they know that they are supposed to be funny. It has its moments, but lacks. DeNiro is about as scary as a bag of bunnies. Why Stiller outappeals Wilson is unexplained. Why Stiller hangs around DeNiro after suffering the worst insults is sitcom crud writing, dragging out the story.

","This romantic comedy is scattered with laughs and hilarious situations. Greg Focker(Ben Stiller) is a male nurse and hazards to spend a weekend getting to know his girl friend's parents. Robert De Niro is the over protective father, with Blythe Danner playing the sympathetic mother of Teri Polo. Misunderstanding runs rampant in this comedy of misfit errors and bad timing. The weekend is heading south rapidly and Focker is desperate to impress his future in-laws.<br/><br/>Also in the cast are:James Rebhorn, Phyllis George and Thomas McCarthy. The versatile De Niro hands down steals the whole show. I'm sure the many Stiller fans will disagree, but the multi talented De Niro can successfully play roles not expected of him.

","This is one of the few films that i ever went back and saw twice. It is that good. I remember that the editor of my hometown paper even praised this film in his column. I don't think that I have ever laughed so hard at a movie in my life. You just watch the film and you have such a wonderful time that you just never want it to end. Robert De Niro is one of the great actors of our generation and he is hilarious in this film. I think this is the first comedy I have ever seen him in and this man is a natural. He is wonderful because you can see that his character is basically a good and decent man who is just a little overprotective of his daughter. Ben Affleck is also wonderful, he brings a sort of awkward, charming boyishness to his role as Greg Focker. You can sense his insecurities and you really feel for this guy as he tries to make a good impression, but just keeps screwing up! I feel that the best performance of this film belongs to the great Blythe Danner as De Niro's wife. She should have at least gotten an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. She is truly someone who has never gotten the credit that she deserves (she is best known as Gwenyth Paltrow's mom) but she is a great actress in her own right. Check out her work in The Great Santini and The Prince Of Tides."

"mattymatt4ever","7","0","1","25 April 2001"," Often funny, though over-the-top
","""Meet the Parents"" is an over-the-top comedy that begs for laughs like a cinematic vagrant.  It attacks you at every corner, begging for some laughs, hoping you can spare some.  Luckily, I was generous and was gracious enough to donate a sufficient amount of laughs.  This is a boisterous sitcom of a movie that occasionally drives you nuts, but often pleases. <br/><br/>
Bobby D has made a fine transition to comedy, and although others feel he's not suited for the genre--being stuck on his Travis Bickle persona--I think he's cut out just fine for films of this kind.  You know why?  He doesn't GO for laughs.  He lets the laughs come to him, and disciplines the material to a reasonable level.  Ben Stiller, on the other hand, does the complete opposite.  Stiller can be extremely funny in roles in films like ""There's Something About Mary,"" but in lame roles like in ""Heavyweights"" he can be really obnoxious!  And sometimes he tries a bit too hard to get the laughs. So hard that you just want to shoot him with a tranquilizer dart.  During lame points of the script, Stiller tries to elevate the material to a good comical status, but instead ends up looking like a complete...idiot.  Like he should be locked up in a cage.  And it's not funny.  It's just obnoxious.<br/><br/>I am going to reccomend this movie, because I can't deny I was laughing 75 percent of the time.  And that was my motive for seeing the movie.  Of course, that and I'm a big DeNiro fan.  However, there are moments where you just want to yell out at the director ""Enough already!  We get the joke!"" The makers of the film just merge way too many jokes into one scene, and it gets pretty lame and/or predictable at times.  <br/><br/>My score:  7 (out of 10)"

The film is a well assembled series of comic moments, with Stiller coming out on the short end of each, which builds from the almost normal early on to the utterly preposterous near the end. The director puts a bow on the flick by tidying up loose ends with a ""feel good"" ending followed by a little kick. All in all the flick may be a small step down from ""...Mary"" for Stiller but is still quality comedy which will be enjoyed by most adults."

Robert De Niro slips into a humorous role of an ex-CIA man who is overbearingly suspicious of his daughter's intended (Ben Stiller) and does so with dignity and savoire faire. The outrageous story line as Stiller tries to impress his future father-in-law and digs himself in deeper and deeper is so well acted and well-told that it is easy to forgive the glitches (like, why would a sophisticated young woman with an impeccable background want to marry a total dick-head) and enjoy the film.
