","I walked into the movie theater expecting to see Adam Sandler make a complete buffoon of himself. However, when I came out I was impressed. There was a depth to this movie I did not see coming, and it took me completely off guard. ""Click"" proved to be a powerful, emotional, and humorous piece of work. There was a certain philosophical message in this movie, in which I think, we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a work-aholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie, and in ""Click"" he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh. Definitely a 10/10 in my book."
"nic-165","8","383","530","18 June 2006"," Refreshing comedy gags meets heartfelt, reflective story to appreciate life's little details
","Going in to this movie I expected to have the normal 2 hour thoughtless escape from everyday life that these type movies normally deliver. Instead I laughed. I even cried. I left pleasantly surprised. Leaving the theatre I couldn't help reflect upon the need to really appreciate life's little moments and close friends and family more. Walken was outstanding. Sandler was effective and really funny in his toned down approach to this more intelligent comedy than the usual Sandler fare. Kate Beckinsale is very lovable as the wife and mother of his children and Hasslehoff couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the cluelessly self-absorbed exec/ boss. I liked it a lot and I'm not normally one to feel either way about these type of movies. I'd go see it next time with family and friends that I really should spend more time with anyway!"
"uziallo","10","435","629","14 June 2006"," Surprisingly Fantastic...
","Being an Adam Sandler film I went into the preview expecting the same Adam Sander film which I do enjoy quite a lot, sometimes it's great to escape and not get too critical about the film you are viewing. I went in with this mentality to Click and I was surprised with how good this film really is. A lot of the time people that write comments will judge a film without seeing it and it gives the film a bad name. Ignore what you hear about this film and take a look, I'm sure you will be surprised with it also. Adam Sandler has shown that he is capable of playing a serious character in contrast o the aggressive and funny character he normally plays in his film, Click is no different, Sandler is both funny and serious at the right moments, Kate Bekinsale is great as Donna his wife, and Christopher Walken is excellent as always as Morty, the Bed, Bath and Beyond Employee. David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, and Jennifer Coolidge are funny in their supporting roles in this film. Australian audiences expecting to see Sophie Monk in a major role will be disappointed as she is honestly a very minor character in the film, in contrast to what the Comedy Chanel is running about her on Foxtel/Austar.<br/><br/>All in all I do recommend seeing this film, if not to learn a valuable lesson about priorities in life, but to have a laugh and to enjoy a film that is better than what was expected of it."
"lisa81659","10","188","269","19 July 2006"," Must See
","I have to say I did not expect to enjoy this movie. My son wanted to see it and finally I gave in & said yes. I thought I was going to have to sit through an hour & a half of mindless comedy. WRONG! This movie did not have a slow moment. There were plenty of laughs for all ages. The 10 yr olds with me didn't get the meaning behind the movie but enjoyed every moment of it. When the movie was over people clapped and were saying that was a great movie. You really must see it! I think a movie that keeps the attention of children and adults is absolutely worth seeing. Although it was full of laughs, keep a napkin handy for a few moments of tears....."
"FilmLover-4","8","236","344","23 June 2006"," Surprisingly touching
","This movie surprised us. We cried. Yes, we cried. The trailer barely tells you what the movie is about. There were some unfunny dumb things having to do with dogs, etc. (no one in the theater laughed much) and some cheeseball stuff, but the emotional core of the movie delivers a wallop that is unexpected. Along the lines of a sort of combination of ""Family Man"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" -- more ""Family Man"" -- this movie didn't just bring tears to eyes, it makes you cry. Because of that, I liked it and give it a thumbs up. The annoying stuff is a relatively small price to pay for the lessons the core stuff teaches. Lastly, Kate Beckinsdale (the epitome of domestic beauty in this movie) is absolutely a dream and the actress that played her grown daughter had eyes that matched -- well done. Enough said."
"minorchord","9","357","534","23 June 2006"," Amazing movie, top to bottom...
","What a pleasant surprise ""Click"" turned out to be! Based on the trailer, one can assume that Adam Sandler, playing Michael Newman in his latest movie, has made a movie that is just like Adam Sandler's last movie... and Adam Sandler's movie before that... and the one before that... i.e., the comedy at which you groan, shake your head, say ""what the..."", and yet can't help from laughing out loud. That's what you get in the first hour of this film. That hour is also as much as the trailer shows, and for good reason.<br/><br/>Director Frank Coraci, who also worked with Adam Sandler in directing The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer, makes excellent use of a technique that should be taken advantage of more often by more directors. He sets us up in the aforementioned first hour of the movie for laughs, and manages to do this quite a few times, and not just with the moments seen in the trailer like other comedies. And, based on one's presupposed knowledge of the typical Adam Sandler movie, one expects there to be a spiral out of control for Michael, a realization of the ""right thing to do"" and everything to end happily with a monologue and one final punchline, all while remaining light-hearted and humorous. However, having this expectation makes the power and the drama of the movie's second hour so much more heartfelt and emotional. This drama never comes off as forced or unnecessary, because the pacing of the transition between the two utterly different tempos is perfect. Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe, the co-writers of this movie, used a similar technique in ""Bruce Almighty"", and it worked very effectively there, as well.<br/><br/>There's not much to be said about the ending without the possibility of spoiling it for someone, but suffice to say it accomplishes what it needs to accomplish without making you feel like you've just been cheated.<br/><br/>Far and away the best movie I've seen all year; likely one of the best I have or will seen for many, many years. There's so much more to see in this movie than what the trailer offers. See it... you won't regret it."
"xnightwingx","9","236","349","23 June 2006"," Adam Sandler's best movie
","Click is by far Adam Sandler's best movie.. and that ISN'T a cheap shot at his previous films.<br/><br/>Sandler has done a ton of comedy movies with terrible jokes and corny plots, and until Anger Management really he didn't have much to his characters other than his goofiness.<br/><br/>He reminds me of Jim Carey before The Truman Show - just comedy, no substance.<br/><br/>The trailers for Click feature some of the comedic scenes of the movie, but don't worry there are a ton more that aren't spoiled. That being said, this movie isn't all that the trailers portray it to be.<br/><br/>If you're going to see Click solely for a good laugh, you'll love the first 45 minutes and hate the rest of it. The script takes a swerve closer to the end and, unlike any of Sandler's previous movies, the ""down"" part of the movie (where the main character goes through rough times) is actually very well done. Click goes from being a comedy to a drama - just for a little while.<br/><br/>The dramatic portion of the movie allows Sandler to act as a regular human being; a man who faces the real life consequences of putting his work ahead of his family. It's something a lot of people can relate to, and all of the characters in the movie contribute to the storyline very well.<br/><br/>Click provides great comedy and Sandler's best dramatic performance in a movie. It's clean enough for the kids (okay, the early teenagers), a good laugh with the guys or girls, and turns out to be a surprisingly good date movie.<br/><br/>Thumbs up"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","84","125","15 December 2006"," Funny & Touching - A Good Combination
","This was a funny and - near the end - a touching movie. That's a nice combination to have. My only complaint is that it certainly isn't ""family fare"" for a nice story and should have been rated ""R,"" not PG-13. There's simply too much sexual material (and and f-word) for PG-13. With some editing, this could have been a great story for everyone.<br/><br/>However, for us adults who like to laugh, there is plenty in here to do that. The jokes come pretty fast, right from the get-go. The premise would good: with a (television-like) remote control, you could control your life. You could fast-forward through all the unpleasant scenes in your life, or freeze frame something that is happening now, or you could go back into time with your life. It all sounds good, but as our main character ""Michael Newman"" (Adam Sandler) found out, it's not so cool. That's a key message here, too, that avoiding the bad things is not necessarily what's best for us. The major message, however, was that spending time with your family is more important than putting your job ahead of them, as far as priorities go. That theme leads to some touching scenes in the final 30 minutes of this comedy. As funny as this film is, you would be hard-pressed not to have some tears in your eyes at some point near the end of this film.<br/><br/>Sandler plays a typical role for him, and utters some great lines and uses sight gags as well for plenty of his laughs. Kate Bekinsale, who plays his wife ""Donna,"" looks absolutely beautiful, the prettiest I've seen her since ""Pearl Harbor."" She plays a nice lady in here, too. Their little kids - especially the girl (Tatum McCann) - are cute and funny at times. I won't mention the dog. I can't without being crude. Christopher Walken is here, and that usually means good news as he tends to play fun-and-interesting characters. <br/><br/>Unfortunately - just a warning - this comedy, as so many modern-day ones are, has its share of crude moments, some language and the above-mentioned sexual material. Overall, it was extremely, entertaining, however."
"zkonedog","7","5","5","10 March 2017"," It ""Clicks"", Alright
","When one thinks of an Adam Sandler film, the phrase ""juvenile humor"" immediately comes to mind, filled with low-brow humor and outlandish acting. Fortunately, ""Click"" is a departure (for the most part) from that categorization by providing an interesting story, developed characters, and very solid acting.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Click"" sees Michael Newman (Sandler) struggling to find time for his family while wearing himself out for his never-impressed boss. On a routine trip to find a universal TV remote, Michael runs into a crazy scientist (played by Christopher Walken) who gives him a ""universal remote"", alright...one that can control his entire life! Hilarity, emotions, & hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>Besides the novel concept, this movie outshines other Sandler flicks due to its heart. While shaping up (in the early goings) to be a hijinks comedy, somewhere along the way a heavy dose of emotion is thrown into the proceedings. By the end of the film, the viewer will actually care about the main characters and want to see their resolutions.<br/><br/>Granted, ""Click"" does still contain some of the typical Sandler low-brow humor, but it isn't too over-the-top or suffocating. Far outweighing that aspect is the above-average acting from pretty much the entire cast, which produces a real connection between characters and audience.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Click"" is a fun little movie (though not for the younger kiddies) that may (at least in a small way) change your perception of Mr. Sandler. This isn't his goofy ""Waterboy"" or farcical ""Billy Madison"". Instead, director Frank Coraci crafts an actual storyline filled with character development and fun concepts."
"MartinHafer","7","18","24","1 June 2008"," This review is for those who generally DON'T like Adam Sandler movies
","I have never been a fan of Adam Sandler, though I have seen a few of his movies. I am in my 40s and I notice that the appeal for him seems to be with teenagers and young adults--and I assume most of the reviews here are by younger reviewers. So here is a review that might be a little different--a 40-something who is a bit of a hard sell.<br/><br/>Overall, I was surprised that I did like this film as much as I did. It was far deeper and less dopey than films like BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE and seemed like an attempt by the rapidly aging Sandler to make a more adult film. While there are still lots of crude jokes that fell flat for me (such as the dog and the stuffed animal), there was still plenty to like and a depth that surprised me. Also, while there were some comedic moments, after a while it became obvious that this was really a comedy-drama--with the second half of the film being very serious and even touching.<br/><br/>So here we seem to have an Adam Sandler movie that might just appeal to kids AND parents--one that everyone can get something out of and enjoy. I am happy I saw this one and wouldn't mind seeing more films like it."
"Jobi14","8","132","216","25 June 2006"," Where did the old Adam Sandler go?
","Where did the old Adam Sandler go? I'm not complaining mind you. I never really liked the fire breathing, short-fused Sandler and it seems that with every new movie I like him even more.<br/><br/>I went to see Click expecting it to be some flash-in-the-pan comedy...but it was much better. The funny jokes weren't a result of Sandler's screaming, but of plot development. The especially sad part of the movie was fantastic and showed a completely different side of Sandler.<br/><br/>The only problem I saw with the movie...they didn't develop Christopher Walken's and Nick Swardson's characters enough. What little parts they had were great, though, and I recommend it for anyone who doesn't over analyze movies. It's a well-spent two hours, and you'll enjoy the film."
"claudio_carvalho","8","86","142","19 February 2007"," Family Comes First
","The architect Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) has a typical middle-class family with his lovely and gorgeous wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale) and their son Ben and daughter Samantha, and a constant visit of his parents. However, Michael is workaholic and under stress, trying to satisfy his boss with overwork and get a partnership in his company, giving priority to his work and neglecting the family issues. When the tired Michael goes to a department store to buy an universal remote control, he rests on a bed and he meets the weird salesman Morty (Christopher Walken) that offers him a remote control capable of controlling his own universe. Michael uses too much and loses the control of the device, having his own life controlled by the remote control. Then Michael sees the worthwhile parts of his personal life he missed while working, and in the end of his life he lately concludes that the family comes first.<br/><br/>""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. Adam Sandler performs the role of a liberal professional that does not give priority to his family trying to be successful in his own career, and having the chance to see how his procedure would affect his beloved family. There are some low level jokes, like the ""entertainment"" of his dog, but they are also hilarious. Kate Beckinsale is extremely beautiful, as usual, even when she is aged, and shows a great chemistry with Adam Sandler. Christopher Walken is very funny in the role of a quite crazy angel. In the end, this highly recommended ""Click"" is a big surprise, leaving the important message that family comes first and many entertaining moments. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Click"""
"kycats1963","10","134","230","23 June 2006"," Loved It!!!
","This movie is very entertaining, and will make you think long and hard about your own life for many hours after you leave the theater. I was expecting a slapstick comedy, and ended up shedding some tears. This movie sends lots of messages about life, and teaches us all a very good lesson. I also loved the soundtrack, lots of great older songs used throughout the film. I left the theater, and drove to Best Buy to purchase the soundtrack, but was disappointed to learn there was not one! Bottomline, GO see this movie, you will NOT be disappointed! Two thumbs way...............up! I took my 10 year son, and he loved it as well, however, some of the humor is a bit crude, and may be offensive to some younger children. For example, there is lots of ""dog humping"" shown throughout the movie. But it's the message the movie sends that's the most beneficial. It will truly make you ""think""............"

"Lady_Targaryen","7","14","21","30 March 2007"," What If You Had A Universal Remote... That Controlled Your Universe?
","Michael Newman loves his family. But he wants to be promoted no matter what, since in this way he could spend more time with his wife, Donna, and Ben and Samantha, his kids. One day,he argues with Donna that he could not stay with his family in an important camp day, and goes out, angry, to buy a universal remote control, since he always had problems with the amount of remote controls they had in their house. He then meets Morty, a strange man and inventor that gives him a one-of-a-kind universal remote control, that cannot be returned. Michael finds out that the remote is literally universal: it controls the universe, and interprets his wishes,altering time and reality, as well as he can ''forward'' things he doesn't want to wait and ''pause'' others. Michael starts using the remote in his way, and discovers that he boss waits forever to give him a promotion, while making him spend more and more time with work each time. The time passes very quick, and the remote is automatically programmed (by his usage of it) to skip or fast-forward many important things of Michael's life. When he sees the thing is out of control, he tries to destroy the remote, but it doesn't work.<br/><br/>''Click '' is a mix of comedy and drama, but if I needed to choose a category, it would be drama for sure. The funny parts are only in the beginning and the rest of the movie it's actually sad. It's the first movie with Adam Sandler that I think is worthwhile to watch, since it is the first movie I watch with him that is not full of silly jokes. ( I think comedy actors should make more drama movies - it's impressive how many of them actually are good and beyond the silly cheap movies. Like Jim Carrey, who was great in ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind''). The movie is a life lesson for itself, since it shows a man who faces the consequences of always putting his family behind his work duties, a thing that happens a lot in our modern society. It's very sad to see how Michael's anxiety for promotion, made him be so away from his family and a cold man, as well as his family giving up on him.<br/><br/>As I read in the message board, this movie has many things in common to ''It's a Wonderful Life'', a movie that I would definitely recommend to everybody to watch before or after ''Click''."

","Click was a movie that words cannot even describe how AWESOME it was.From Beginning to the end you'll laugh and you'll cry.I know all of us want to have be financially successful,have that position etc but let me tell you one thing I've learned from this movie FAMILY comes first.No matter how good of a job it sounds or how much it pays off if it takes away from time with your families its NOT worth it because none of us are promised tomorrow and cherish every moment every second you have with them.Parents enjoy the time you have with your kids no matter how young or old they are.Because you won't be able to make up for the times you've missed.Even if you have missed time it's never too late to start.Time is so precious and goes by too fast But I would not recommend this to younger children under 10.It does have some scenes that are not appropriate for them to see.But I do recommend this incredible movie to teens,parents,and grandparents.This is a life-changing movie that will make a difference in your life as well as your families.Don't miss your chance.This film will change your life forever and the way you look at life.Life is too short to miss out on the things that are really important and matter most.Lastly this movie has opened my heart and reminded me of is to tell your family (husbands,wives,kids,brothers,sisters,mom's and dads) you love them everyday and always make time for them."

","Click is a 2005 Comedy film starring Adam Sandler as Michael Newman. Michael lives a very average life, and is not very much respected by his family. He's frustrated with everything thats going on around him, and one thing that starts off the movie. The TV remote. He can never manage to find the right TV remote to turn on and watch TV. Until one day he finally had enough, and goes to a store named 'Bed, Bath & Beyond' to which he finds a secret compartment to which Christopher Walken in working. He receives this special remote, which doesn't only control the TV, but controls everything that goes on around him. This is a very funny, and well remembered comedy by Adam Sandler, and is one i have scene many times and don't ever get bored of it.

"brettchatz-1","7","8","14","17 December 2006"," Sandler spins his charm yet again
","CAST: ADAM SANDLER; KATE BECKINSALE AND CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is renowned for his irrepressible comedic genius. He possesses a rare talent consisting of an ensemble of slapstick buffoonery and egocentric satire. His formulaic comedies have spawned a generation of die-hard Sandler fans expecting nothing less than the pervasive wit and guile of Adam Sandler in full swing.<br/><br/>In Click, Sandler plays Michael Newman a workaholic trying desperately trying to make partner in a successful firm. His demanding boss is adequately portrayed by David Hasselhoff. Sandler tries frantically to please his superior, but his efforts largely go unnoticed. The result is continual work dissatisfaction and mounting pressure on his home life.<br/><br/>Sandler's wife is played by the exquisite Kate Beckinsale. To label her gorgeous would be doing her a grave injustice for she is the quintessential picture of beauty. She is the doting wife of an overworked architect and the attentive mother of two delightful children. The strain of her relationship with her husband is driving a wedge between them Â– that is until Sandler is gifted a universal remote.<br/><br/>This is no ordinary remote though: it controls the passage of time and allows for a thorough revision of the past and a rapid transition into the future. What it doesn't allow for are changes to deeds already committed. The angel of death, who hands Sandler the remote, cautions him that the device is non-returnable.<br/><br/>Naturally Sandler's curiosity is piqued and he begins toying with the quirky device. A series of humorous incidents ensue, but the comedy is hardly worth laughing at. The audiences remained largely quiet throughout the duration of the film, with the exception of the usual sexual innuendo and toilet humour which cracked a few smiles.<br/><br/>The film goes off the rails for a while but just when it starts losing the audience; it utilizes drama to great effect to reel the crowds back in. Sandler is surprisingly effective in his dramatic performance. It is a detraction from the norm but one which will leave you teary eyed and heartbroken, until the final ten minutes of the film. Christopher Walken is a spectacle to behold in this dramatic comedy.<br/><br/>This is a must-see Sandler film, not because the laughs come thick and fast, but because it is able to work on raw emotions so effectively. The concept of family and priorities are essential to the film and you are bound to be wiping the tears from your face in the last quarter.<br/><br/>Two-thumbs up!"

"eichelbergersports","7","12","25","20 June 2006"," Not the best Sandler vehicle; but quite enjoyable
","In a nod to Jim Carrey's ""Bruce Almighty""  in which a regular Schmoe becomes almost omnipotent  Adam Sandler stars as a loser who is offered a ""universal remote"" control device, which gives him power over time and space  among other things.<br/><br/>The remote is given to him by the otherworldly Morty (Christopher Walken), who is tinkering in the bowels of a Bed, Bath & Beyond store. Actually, the plot is taken from the ""Twilight Zone"" episode, ""A Kind Of Stopwatch,"" which originally aired on Oct. 18, 1963, but this contraption also allows Michael Newman (Sandler) to mute, pause, review his past and (especially) fast-forward things around him.<br/><br/>It's that latter feature, though, that causes the most havoc in his life, because as soon as he zips through one crisis (getting a cold, arguing with his wife, wishing for a promotion, having sex, etc.) after another, the machine programs itself, automatically forwarding through similar situations, and causing his existence to pass all too quickly before his eyes.<br/><br/>While he strives to climb the company ladder at his architect firm, he begins to use the thing to avoid the months and years of hard work it would take for him to succeed; soon, however, as in most films of this fantasy ilk, the bad side is revealed. While his brain is fast-forwarding through bits of unpleasantness, his body remains - with little or no reaction to the things actually going on around him in his family's reality. <br/><br/>Before he realizes it, his wife, Donna (Kate Beckinsale), is drifting away from him, and the relationship with his kids, Ben and Samantha (Joseph Castanon and Tatum McCann) is going to pot. Donna eventually divorces Michael and marries swim instructor, Bill (Sean Astin, ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""50 First Dates""), while the kids grow up estranged from their father. He's a big man at his company, sure, but no amount of success on the job can compensate for failure in the home.<br/><br/>The lesson here is to spend as much quality time with your loved ones (""Family comes first"") and there are no quick fixes in life. A bit maudlin and sappy, at times (although there are some pretty funny moments), plus about 10 minutes too long for my taste; but nice supporting work from Walken (who steals the picture), Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner (as Michael's meshugana parents), as well as David Hasselhoff, as his weirded-out boss, make this one of Sandler's better vehicles.<br/><br/>Not his best - that was ""The Wedding Singer"" (so far) - but good enough to enjoy."

","We've seen this movie way too many times...<br/><br/>A fisherman catches a magic fish, let's say. Magic fish gives him all the power in the world. When it comes down to it, the magic fish's power doesn't mean anything at all because the fisherman is a lonely guy with no love around from friends or family. Or let's look at ""A Christmas Carol"" (a classic Christmas-time story about how it's better to give than to receive).<br/><br/>Then we have ""Click,"" a glimpse of a busy working-man in America who has a strange amount of laziness when it comes to his family. He doesn't deserve anybody in his life the way he treats them, especially given his choices after he receives a magic remote control that allows his to speed his way through life or alter the way things are perceived to him (ie muting his wife's girlfriend or pausing his wife in the middle of an argument). So in the beginning you really don't care about him because his character is so selfish and lazy...as most of these movies go, he'll quickly learn the error of his ways...or will he? I really don't know what the originality in this film was. I used to love Adam Sandler in everything he released that he starred in, but what is this cheap ripoff of so many films as ""Truman Show,"" ""Bruce Almighty,"" ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" and ""Christmas Carol?"" And ""Pleasantville"" comes to mind, although to put that great movie alongside this doesn't seem right...<br/><br/>I had to give it a 5. It had slightly funny parts (especially when Rob Schneider wasn't on-screen), a terribly overused comedic soundtrack, interested gags, Christopher Walken was in it for a second (like in ""Envy"")...yeah, average..."

Now, there is one more to add to the list... Click.<br/><br/>Any time I get to look at Kate Beckinsale usually makes the rest of any bad movie go away. But not even her beauty could overcome the rest of this stinko.<br/><br/>It started with the dog humping the oversize stuffed duck... and then again... and then again. And then remark by Donna about the repairs needed to the duck. And then came the ultimate insult to my movie going sense... the ""fart joke"".<br/><br/>I don't know why anyone over 12 in the movie industry won't come to the realization that ANYONE can do ""fart jokes"". They are the most common form of humor because anyone can do them. And if that is the range of your comedy, whether it is ""The Family Guy"" writers or Adam Sandler, then you are pretty limited. I have now seen Adam Sandler urinating against a building, farting in someone's face, beating up an old man (Bob Barker) and making fun of someone with a disability (Carl Weathers). Is there no limit to how low Adam Sandler can go with his humor? Take a look at Robin Williams... at least he balances out his ""potty"" humor with something worthwhile every now and again like ""The Fisher King"" or ""Awakenings"" or ""Midnight Sun"". And Steve Martin can go for hours without one ""fart joke"". But not Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider or any of the lot of ""new comedians"". It is as old and thread worn as wearing a dress and thinking that no one since Uncle Miltie has done it.<br/><br/>I couldn't even watch the end of this movie. I had to turn it off. It makes my list of 10 worst movies, which is now populated by at least 4 Adam Sandler movies; ""Little Nikita"", ""Big Daddy"", ""Happy Gilmore"" and now ""Click"".<br/><br/>I just ain't cut out for this ""new comedy"" stuff. Give me a good pratfall artist or someone quick with a quip any day over someone who's idea of comedy is a fart in the face. I guess I just don't get it."

","An architect (Adam Sandler) with pressures aplenty from work and a general lack of time unwittingly solves his problem by getting a remote control that can literally control his universe. The remote is given by a mysterious man (Christopher Walken ala Christopher Lloyd in the ""Back to the Future"" series) and it comes equipped with all the features, but these features go way beyond just manipulating the boob tube. Immediately the device becomes a prevalent part of Sandler's life as he is able to fast forward through mundane parts of his life and also make potential difficult feats go by in a matter of seconds. But what happens when the great power gets abused and the device takes on a life of its own, making decisions to fast forward by itself as Sandler just becomes an unfortunate spectator in his own life? Amazingly impressive feature that markets itself as a typical summer comedy, but is that and so much more. More dramatic than comical, ""Click"" is a curious over-achiever that is best-described as ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""A Christmas Carol"" without the holiday season settings. Throughout Sandler is presented with choices and unfortunately he has to prioritize his life and of course the pressures of work (represented primarily by boss David Hasselhoff) sometimes overshadow the time that his family (wife Kate Beckinsale, their children and parents Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner) rightfully deserves. Director Frank Coraci (best known for light weight Sandler vehicles like ""The Waterboy"" and ""The Wedding Singer"") shows real growth as a filmmaker as he handles the deceptively heartfelt script with style and flair. Wonderfully clever, well-executed, entertaining and life-affirming, ""Click"" is one of the more pleasant cinematic surprises of recent memory. 4 stars out of 5."

It was awful. <br/><br/>It seemed that the only reason that the main protagonist was accepted at the wedding of his son was that he had paid for it.<br/><br/>The childish, and disgusting scenes, the farting into someone's face, the pulling down of trousers are jokes that my sons might have laughed at when they were aged about four or five.

(Sorry, sensible fourteen-year-old people).<br/><br/>The replacement husband was a cipher. I cannot remember anything much that he said, and yet someone like Kate Beckinsale fell for him.<br/><br/>The angel of death was a ludicrous character in a (?) comedy.<br/><br/>I think I was expecting a clever, comedic, fantasy film and was given rubbish. Only amazement that this film could exist kept me watching.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale seemed to be in another film altogether, apart from her character's acceptance of the dogs' behaviour!<br/><br/>If the only reason for going into a bedding shop to get a television remote control was to use the word ""beyond"", the film failed before it started. Beyond what, exactly? And how does Bed, Bath and Beyond like the way that their salesmen are portrayed? Shown as needy and friendless, do they like that?

It's an interesting premise. with a different actor, one more capable of pulling the audience in, it would have been spot-on. instead, with him, it came off as syrupy, trite and heavy-handed, eliciting no audience empathy at all. to me, sandler seems to have a smirking, sleepwalking quality to his performances, like we're both in on some joke. i never bought him as a father, a husband or an architect. boo!"

She read it to me (I read it to her sometime ago first) and both of us were amazed at the similarities. In Stine's ""Click"" story there is a kid named Seth Gold whose dad (not surprisingly) brings home a universal remote that allows him to replay, fast forward, mute and slow mo' real life at his home, school and with his friends.

After a while I started to get confused. Not because I didn't understand, mind you, but because this movie had been built up the entire time as a comedy, then was randomly turned into a drama-esquire feature. When Sandler died at the end, I was extremely confused, because the movie, although it did a good job of building character, was labeled as a comedy. Quite frankly, the two just don't mesh. Of course... neither do Sandler and movies... Sure, there has been the occasional decent flick, but for the majority, Sandler just can't make a good movie. He should consider himself lucky for landing the role of Happy Gilmore. I was even more disappointed after reflecting on the cast of this movie. This movie was loaded.

After just seeing the movie (against my will btw) I can now say that the trailers for this awful movie missed the mark on both counts. The 'best' parts of this gimmicky crapfest were shown in the trailers, and even they weren't very good. And I can honestly say that short of figuring out every detail, anyone with a half (maybe even a quarter) of a brain could have figured out the entire plot for this crapper from the trailer, thereby invalidating the whole enticement idea. I mean, who could have seen that revelatory ending coming?!? (Yep, that was sarcasm) <br/><br/>This movie might have been OK as an SNL skit, back when Sandler was funny, but instead is drawn out, relies way too much on its gimmick, and is downright mean in tone for most of the movie.<br/><br/>And plotpoint: the only good part about the whole remote control thing (using it for sex), and Sandler's character uses it to SHORTEN the amount of time it takes to have sex with Kate Beckinsale??? If this gobbler wasn't bad for all the other reasons, this alone would have ruined it for me.<br/><br/>I've read some of the positive reviews about this turkey, and most agree that it reminded them to stop and take a look around before life passes them by.

I love the IMDb website, and by some weird mistake, I trusted the seven stars this film somehow received as a reason to go see it. I left after 60 minutes and got a refund. In 30 years I have walked out of two films, this film and Dirty Work. This film is uncomfortably not funny, disjointed and pointless. As I read the numerous reviews of people who love this film I am blown away by the emotional and touching comments - ""I cried"" ""I really cried"" The single theme in all of these comments is the reviewer's statement that the film taught them about life and how they need to slow down and appreciate their family. I honestly have to feel sorry for someone who needs a horrible Adam Sandler film to teach them this. The US government should give Adam Sandler a license to print money. If this film can do over 100 million dollars I can understand how George Bush is a two term president.<br/><br/>Sandler's secretary is played by an average looking middle aged woman who is very uptight about her job. The movie does not take a second to explain anything about this woman, or why I might want to get to know her. When Sandler, a laid back guy arrives at work, she gives him his messages and says ""can I go to the bathroom now."" Sandler sighs and says, Mary, you don't need my permission to go to the bathroom. Is this supposed to be funny? Why doesn't she just go the bathroom? What is she afraid of missing? Later in the movie, Sandler is in a meeting with some new clients, and his secretary interrupts this very important meeting saying she has an emergency. She hands Adam a note as every in in the room turns and focuses on Sandler and his assistant. The note says, ""can I go to the bathroom?"" Wow, I am laughing just typing this. To me, this is not even a bad joke -- it is just some unexplainable BS. Something that some moron wrote on a piece of paper and some bigger moron paid money for. Completely unexplainable."

I love sophomoric humor, but the writers tried WAY too hard to be hip, smart and sarcastic, and just came off as embarrassingly stupid, mean and just plain not-funny. The dog humping the stuffed animal was about as amusing as well.. a dog humping a stuffed animal. And by the fifth time, I began to wonder if the writers just stopped trying all together and let 3rd-graders finish the movie. I never saw the main character do anything really impressive with the time that he supposedly deprived his family of. In addition, the problem seemed to be that when he fast forwarded, he behaved like a zombie and missed everything. All of a sudden he was magically some sort of ""Super Architect"", for no apparent reason. The whole point of this type of story is to tell the viewer to wake up, change your life and be a better person (Scrooge, Ground Hog Day, Wizard of OZ, etc), but his whole problem stemmed not from his hard-working personality, but from the magic remote control. So what's the message here, don't use magic remote controls or you'll be sorry? Well, I don't have a magic remote, but I am am sorry...sorry I watched this movie!"

"Okonh0wp","1","15","38","18 July 2006"," moves a bit too quickly to care, a step backwards for Sander
","I have to confess at the start of this review that I'm not really an Adam Sandler fan. In fact, I might have been the only person in my 6th grade class who didn't see what was so great about Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. It's not that I like appreciation for crude low-brow humor from SNL alumni. I happen to like Will Ferrell, Norm McDonald, and the David Spade/Chris Farley buddy comedies, but Adam Sandler is just a guy who I don't get. There might be times where I laugh during his movies but I see that as a result of so many random bizarre jokes being thrown out at me, that by sheer luck a couple of them actually work. What I think we like about Sandler, isn't necessarily the comedy but it's the warmth behind his movies. I think it's because he's such a lovable character that we love to cheer for Billy Madison to win his high school diploma or for Bobby Bouche to save the day for his coach in The Waterboy.<br/><br/>For me, Sandler movies have gotten better as he's seemed to refine his humor and grounded it more in those uplifting story elements with 50 First Dates, Mr. Deeds, and Big Daddy. Unfortunately, Click is a giant step backwards for Sandler. It's disjointed and feels like it's moving too quickly for us to care much, despite a touching scene near the end. By detaching us from any sense of caring what happens to the characters, the film hits rocky ground, because that leaves us with nothing but Sandler's sense of humor to entice us. What's even odder, the laughs are noticeably fewer and farther in between than most Adam Sandler movies. Then again, that might have been a good thing, considering how bizarre Sandler's jokes can be. And don't think ""bizarre"" is funny because anyone can access the most random corners of their mind and come up with bizarre stuff. The most random corner of Adam Sandler's mind is filled with things like a dog repeatedly humping a stuffed animal and parents who mock the size of their son's ""schmiekel"" (don't ask). The funny moments that actually worked well in the movie are things you can catch in the 30-second trailer anyway."

","The idea of the movie was good; the message (that we all waste our life at meaningless jobs rather than doing something we'd really like) made a lot of sense to me. However, the movie ruined it on so many levels. First of all, Adam Sandler can't act at all. And the part when he becomes fat is not believable at all.<br/><br/>Second, most of the jokes in the movie are obvious and are not that funny. Why did they have to include that stupid fart joke? The jokes about Sandler's sex life did not add anything to the plot either.<br/><br/>I give it 3, and not 1, just for the jokes with the neighborhood boy, which were really funny. Too bad all but one of them were in the very beginning of the movie."

","I ticked the ""spoiler"" box because of the dire warning about future reviews being discarded. And also out of a sense of irony - I can't see how one could possibly spoil this movie.<br/><br/>It is truly dire. It is not *remotely* funny (oh ho ho, see what I did there? That's quality joke-writing, that, compared with the dreck you'd have to put up with if you were incautious enough to sit through ""Click"".) <br/><br/>I watch a lot of films, and my tolerance for utter rubbish is very high indeed. I sat through ""Zombie Strippers"" without particular pain. I watched more than one of the ""Starship Troopers"" movies (at least, I think I did, it's sort of hard to tell).<br/><br/>But I walked out of this one, and demanded a refund. I have *NEVER* done that before, or since.<br/><br/>It is impossible to overstate how utterly dismal, how *embarrassing* this movie is.<br/><br/>Every ""joke"" manages to be banal, insulting, tedious. There are some real actors in this, people who've been in decent films, and the fundamental premise (a magical remote control to skip reality around, and how this might end badly) isn't an impossible thing to base a watchable film on, but Click is just a terrible, depressing, steaming pile of a movie."
"jpschapira","5","6","12","18 August 2006"," I would have liked that remote to turn the screen off...
","""Click"" is Adam Sandler's latest attempt at making us laugh. Last year I saw ""Spanglish"" and said that Sandler's true acting talent emerges when someone else but him has written a screenplay, and when someone other than his usual directors has taken a project. Frank Coraci directed Sandler in ""The Wedding Singer"": good; he directed Sandler in ""The Waterboy"": regular; he has just directed ""Click"": awful. Maybe it's not Coraci's fault, but ""Spanglish"" had inspired me to watch Sandler in a different wayThat illusion has vanished.<br/><br/>""Click"" plays with different genres and it aims at different targets, but it ultimately gets confusing and it ends up playing the audienceBadly. I saw this film with a friend of mine who had already seen it: ""It made me cry"", he told me; and I got excited because of the ""Spanglish"" situation. I couldn't cry because it isn't a drama; and I couldn't even laugh because it is not a good comedy (although pay attention at a commentary of Colin Farrell: the best).<br/><br/>The story is very similar to things everyone has seen before: it's about a guy who is able to go forth and back in time as he pleases, and his present life changes because of it. This time, the element is a remote control given to Sandler by a very classy Christopher Walken; and I don't know I f the movie could have been bearable without Walken.<br/><br/>So Sandler's character has his wife and beautiful kids but doesn't pay much attention to them because of his job and because he wants to become partner of the company he works in. Soon, he meets Morty (Walken) who gives him this remote control; and Sandler starts playing with it, not without Morty telling him that it could be dangerousAnd it is.<br/><br/>At first, things go bad for Sandler and we worry about his situation. But you know those films where the screenplay plays so much with the viewer that you just can't believe any more of it? It could have been like that during ""The Butterfly Effect"", but Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber handled it well. Here Steve Koren and Mark O' Keefe take it too far; they wrote ""Bruce Almighty"": what happened to them? <br/><br/>The reason why I said Sandler so many times above and didn't say his character's name is because he is playing himself: he's playing Adam Sandler. Where did the nice guy of ""50 first Dates"" get lost? What ever occurred to the quarterback of ""The Longest Yard"" or the charming cook of ""Spanglish"", which I dared to say had been his best portrayal? I don't have the answer.<br/><br/>His female lead, Kate Beckinsale, looks so beautiful but appears completely underused as his wife. On the children's side, Joseph Castanon (whom I met in ""Ghost Whisperer"") is always likable to watch; and the adults are a Sean Astin who is prepared for better things than this; and two solid comedic supporting roles in the flesh of David Hasselhoff and Jennifer Coolidge.<br/><br/>And how can I forget about Christopher Walken; who without doing much saves the rainiest of days: ""Man on Fire"", ""The Rundown"", ""Gigli"" and most notably ""Joe Dirt"""
"Desertman84","10","4","7","31 October 2011"," Adam Sandler's Click Surprises
","Click is a sci-fi dramedy that stars Adam Sandler as an overworked architect that neglects his family and misses most of his life when he receives a remote-control device that enables him to skip over unpleasant events. It also stars Kate Beckinsale as his wife and Christopher Walken as the man who gives him the device. This film is loosely based on R.L. Stine short story and the screenplay is written by Mark O'Keefe and Steve Koren.It was directed by Frank Coraci.<br/><br/>A workaholic architect, frustrated in his job but determined to make a better life for his family, is bestowed with a powerful universal remote that allows him more control over his life than he ever knew possible. On the surface, Michael Newman seems to have it all, yet with all the demands forced upon him by his ungrateful boss, Michael finds that setting aside time to spend with his loving wife,Donna and two picture- perfect children, Ben and Samantha,has grown increasingly difficult. When a frustrating bout with the television remote leads the overworked husband and father to a nearby Bed, Bath & Beyond in search of a universal remote with the power to control all of his electronic devices, a curious peek into the back room leads Michael into the company of eccentric employee and talented inventor Morty. It seems that Morty has created a device that will not only allow him complete control over his television and stereo, but his entire life as well. <br/><br/>As he discovers that the remarkable device has the power to muffle the barks of the family dog, zoom himself past an irritating quarrel with his wife, and even allow him to travel back and forth through time to different points in his life, the rush of being able to skip straight to the good parts in life soon leaves him feeling as if he's missing out on the total experience. Only when Michael begins to realize that the he has lost control of his life and the remote is now programming him does he finally learn that life is as much about the moments he'd rather forget as it is the moments he will always remember.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler's Click surprises as it is more than just a dramedy with a few slapstick scenes in it.The movie presents some very real problems about adult life but it answers them with Hollywood platitudes like it's about having fun not trying to find solutions to the problems of modern existence that it still seems a bit disingenuous.Although a lot of critics would find this film not good due to the fact that it presents that most adults haven't reached the maturity required and makes fun of the situation,the movie provides the lessons needed but not in a preachy manner.In summary,the new Adam Sandler film may not ""click"" especially for grown-ups who believe that it makes fun but of immaturity but nevertheless,it still manages to give a few laughs as well as entertain."
"RResende","Null","4","7","2 January 2009"," contrast
","Another simple and highly used formula for Hollywood comedy: a simple, supposedly deep, honest sincere, moral issue: you have to seize the journey, living is the most important thing, don't choose work and success over your family.<br/><br/>Than you add a device that allows you to move further and explain the morals, in this case a remote which controls time development, and which allows you to move forward and back in time, and eventually making you loose control (he uses preferences). <br/><br/>Than, Sandler, who is supposed to make it work. Well, i don't give much for his comedy skills, with few exceptions. But even for those who enjoy his best performances, i think this may stay a couple meters below what he can deliver.<br/><br/>Comedy and Drama can be a very powerful mixture in the right hands. Chaplin may have invented the notion, and is probably the absolute master of the genre to these days. It's something that is based in high contrasts, therefore enhancing the drama bits. If it is well driven, it can tear you a part: the filmmaker makes you laugh out loud, enjoy yourself with the ""frivolities"" of life, and than, suddenly, or gradually, you're pushed into a narrow abyss of sadness, which is enhanced by your previous state of joy. Contrast. Well, these guys didn't do it, they weren't close to it.<br/><br/>My opinion: 1/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"DonFishies","2","7","15","22 August 2007"," One of the worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen
","I used to genuinely enjoy watching Adam Sandler films. He was a funny guy, and his movies showcased this talent of his off rather well. But I would imagine, after hitting a high with Big Daddy, either the quality of the films started to wear off, or Sandler just got too big for his britches. With the exception of Punch Drunk Love (an entirely different kind of role altogether) and to a lesser extent, Spanglish, I have yet to see Sandler actually pull off a massively hilarious or worthwhile comedy ever since. And Click sadly, is not exception.<br/><br/>Sandler plays Michael Newman, a family man obsessed with work to the point that he has next to no time to spend with his family. Not quite understanding the remotes in his house, Michael sets out one evening to get a universal remote to help him better function with the electronics in his house. But upon meeting Morty (Christopher Walken) in the 'Way Beyond' section of Bed, Bath and Beyond (that would have been clever about ten years ago), he receives much more than just a universal remote. With just a click of a button, Michael can rewind, fast-forward or skip out on certain moments in his life. But things can only go so good for so long.<br/><br/>Simply put, Click is one of the worst excuses for a comedy/drama that I have ever seen. Not once does the film even remotely attempt to bring anything new to the tired and overused idea at work within the film, and never once does it even attempt to revel in the genre that it belongs in. The movie just plays out at break-neck speed, beginning and ending without much in-between. And when moments of comedy come up, they speed by and either hit the mark or miss it entirely (the latter happens a whole lot more often than the former). And when moments of drama come up, they are either eluded to as still being subtly funny, or just come off as plainly amateur. The actors within the film are clearly better trained than the material, but despite this, it still acts as a barrier limiting their every move.<br/><br/>And no one is held back more than Sandler himself. He just does not seem to know what he is doing here, or how he should be doing it. Should he be acting like a goof, and just creating laughs for the audience at every turn? Or should he actually be a genuinely affected individual, who is slowly seeing the dramatic consequences of his every action, and is ultimately being destroyed by it? He just does not seem to understand at any point during the film, and of the mere moments where he shows a brief glimpse of the actor that was born in Punch Drunk Love, they still do not seem to cut it. He just comes off as being annoying for the most part, and when he is acting with his puppy dog-style ""Woe is me!"" look, he just comes off as being useless. It is almost as if he does not even bother trying anymore to create something that will genuinely affect people. If he thinks the adolescent attempt at tear-inducing drama that takes place in final act of the film was actually something worthwhile, I think he needs to start getting some better career advice.<br/><br/>What is even more sad is the staple of actors the film has at its disposal, who are all criminally underused. Kate Beckinsale plays Sandler's wife, and all she basically gets to do is get naughty with him, or argue with him. She may be credited second only to Sandler, but she gets such a tiny amount of screen time that you wonder why the filmmakers even bothered getting a name actor, and not just some random good looking extra. Henry Winkler and David Hasselhoff, both wonderful character actors (even if a lot of their best stuff is mere parodies of their most famous roles), are basically used as stepping stones for Sandler jokes that do nothing for the movie. The entire scene where he pauses his life and beats up Hasselhoff is not funny. It borders on being delusionally ridiculous. They do get a few funny lines, but are nothing but mere cardboard cut-outs for the most part.<br/><br/>Walken is the one who fares the greatest of anyone, but only by mere chance. He plays Morty as the usual kooky/crazy Walken stereotype, and it only works because it is funnier than almost anything Sandler can throw at the audience. I found myself pining for more Walken, just because everything else was so ridiculously unfunny. Even at his worst, Walken still succeeds in being better than everything in the entirety of the movie.<br/><br/>The only thing that can even match him is some of the interesting make-up that appears in the last half of the movie. Not so much Sandler dressed up as a fat guy (especially not during the horrendously CGI-friendly ""wake-up"" scene), but the aging done to the likes of Winkler, Beckinsale, Sean Astin and Julie Kavner. I thought it would look silly, but it was actually well done, and clearly was well thought out and applied in its creation. It actually makes these moments seem better than they actually are, just because of how professionally done they look. It was a treat to see the wonders of some of these scenes, and really begged the question of whether the movie could have actually been better if it was as well thought out as the make-up.<br/><br/>It pains me to know Sandler actually made people genuinely cry with some of the material in this film. I felt like crying yes, but only because of how atrocious the things going on on-screen were. I can only hope that there are a few more Punch Drunk Loves coming from Sandler, and no more disasters like this.<br/><br/>2/10."

And it was clear he was carried by the other crew members.<br/><br/>This movie started out OK. Despite the simple plot it was more interesting than I expected, initially. I have no doubt that the word used most when both filming an editing this flick was 'Stretch'. They could have cut a full hour off of this movie and still have conveyed its full message. Each subplot after he is fast forwarded left me thinking ""OK, I got it.. That's enough.. Move on"" But no, it never moved on until after it mercilessly beat each topic to death. My wife and I had rented the DVD and neither of us recall ever before having to fast forward through parts again and again just to get to the elusive ending which, as it turns out, was not worth the effort of finding.<br/><br/>What had started out having some good potential ended up being the same cheap Hollywood money making garbage."

","This easy concept of a movie will keep casual movie fans engaged with it's silly exploitation of Sandler's newfound abilities to manipulate the space time continuum. The initial concept gets a full workout and technical buffs can gawk at the simple yet effective editing that goes along with showing how this character sees his world, through his control. Obviously the moral ramifications of such unnatural bastardization's comes at a price, which slowly paints the arc of this story with more serious, dramatic colors. To say that this movie is a unique idea however would be a joke, as derivations linking up to just about every other time traveling morality tale are abound but in the end, whether you enjoyed the goofy site gags or the melodramatic buildup more, the overall message this movie wishes to convey (which could be argued far outweighs the actual material) should stick. This philosophy that the main character came to speak of was a perfect way at translating through more zen-like nods to the ""moment"" then most mainstream American films have the patience of realizing. Kudos to Click for making the case for this frame of mind without having for one minute to act it out pretentiously on screen, this is how you do NOT just preach to the choir."

","If there's one thing about movies that I cannot stand, it's when a movie rips off other ideas, movies, or stories. If there's another thing about movies I cannot stand, it's Adam Sandler. This movie is what I like to call a ""Double Whammy."" Now, to be fair, I feel like Adam Sandler himself was not as bad here as I have seen him in the past. Is he good? Well, I can't go that far. But, he does put in an inkling of effort, which really shows in the last few scenes of the movie. Throughout the rest of the movie, though, he is egregiously unfunny. He tries at the jokes, but he fails, miserably. This movie is basically the plot of It's a Wonderful Life, mixed with a little Christmas Carol, and topped off with a little Back to the Future for good luck. It insults me that so much unoriginality could go into what starts off as a halfway decent premise. Not a great premise, but halfway decent. It's a fairly good idea—a remote that can control every part of your life, like brightness or languages. Except, wouldn't it have been nice for someone to turn this baby into a universal translator instead of playing to Adam Sandler's needs? Other than that, the characters aren't all that interesting. We've seen all of these characters before, and even most of these lines before. The only part of this film that was any good was at the very end. I won't give it away, but it wasn't played out all that badly. As for the rest of the film...

It's not that i don't appreciate Adam Sandler. He can be hilarious and he is what he is. He showed his range in Punch Drunk Love, and he was hilarious in The Wedding Singer, imo. Plus, generally, he's a likable guy playing fairly likable characters. Click is not what i consider to be even, an average film. It's not good. It's not a comedy and it's not a credible drama. In fact, the closest i came to laughing is at the end, when Adam is moaning and groaning on the road, more from his short-sighted decisions and shallow screen play than any physical damage. It's one big cliché with meaningless dialogue and predictable turns at every corner. When this airs on the networks, i wont be watching it. Once was enough. This is quite a shame, when you look at the cast and even the director. I was disinterested, and even more disappointed than i was afraid i was going to be. This movie didn't really need to be made. We've seen it before, many many times; and done much better as well. I suppose it may appeal to some demographic; i wasn't on that list. And the trailers? A bit misleading, but all you really need to see. i don't blame Sandler for this; it's the simply indescribable ""screen play"", written on toilet paper by someone who may not be able to vote yet, not meaning any disrespect to children, of course. the TWILIGHT ZONE's by Rod Serling in the fifties, who took at look at this premise, were better and more creative than this film."

","I think we all know that every movie, whether it's comedy, drama or otherwise puts our main character through some challenges and awkward messes. It's basic storytelling. So it's no spoiler to note that this film does just that. My problem is, it just goes to far with it and spends waaay to much time there, over a third of the film, about 40 minutes and then cleans it all up in less than 10. Maybe it wasn't so much the length of ACT2 to place the blame as it is the fact that it has zero elements of comedy. It is way to serious, uncomfortable, scary and sad. This film should have never been made with this script. Act 2 needed serious work and any college kid would have certainly received a poor grade with it in a scriptwriting class. It really annoys me when big stars get away with making junk just because of the weight their name carries."

","An angel called me on my mobile as I was tying the noose after watching this and I felt obliged to agree with it this was a load of rubbish. This cheered me up and I decided to give it all another go.<br/><br/>Why did I pay money to watch this drivel. Tracking through a well worn 'its a wonderful life' formula this movie just reminded me why America will never recover any real human sensitivity. Lost in its restrospective gee shucks morality and its it will always work out in the end mythology This film just simply bombed for me. Filling a movie with recognisable 80's TV and film stars doesn't boost production values.<br/><br/>What interests me mostly about this film is why Kate Beckinsale played the unempowered housewife forced to suffer this man after such wonderful empowering roles she has played in the past. When my wife pointed out it was her I was firstly astounded then had to nod my head in shame. Then Sean Astin turns up and plays another SAP. Is Adam Sandler boosting there careers or are they desperate for limelight?. His draw and Hollywood 'star' gravity seems to be sucking a planetary plethora of willing actors to circle round his errant brilliance but unfortunately this time the lame material makes me wish a black hole was nearby. Don't get me wrong his name got me to the cinema, if only the material was better."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","3","9","21","1 October 2006"," A dumbed-down Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
","Imagine you are a family-father trying to juggle a demanding career as an architect, a vile boss and your needy wife and kids at the same time. Then imagine a brainy scientist presents you with a universal remote control that can not only control all the apparatus in your home, but in your life. When the chance is given to be able to fast-forward, skip chapters, pause and alter the volume of passages of your life  would you take it? Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is faced with this choice, and he takes it.<br/><br/>While the concept is highly intriguing  and the reason I set out to see ""Click""  its execution makes me want to weep. Happy Madison Production has not carved out a good comedy since Happy Gilmore (1996) and this film cements the down-spiral of Adam Sandler's career. It seems as though it purposely fast-forwards and skips all moments with comedic potential and then tips over into an endless charade of fart-jokes and misplaced slap-stick to make up for it. Most of the jokes only managed a raised eyebrow from me, like the dog humping the stuffed animal (ha ha, 0/10 for originality). With performers such as the Hoff, Henry Winkler and Christopher Walken gracing the film's cast list in quirky supporting roles you'd think it would be difficult to disappoint on a comic level. But they do, because their characters are all one-dimensional  it is apparent that ""Click"" expects us to find their mere presence funny, which is plain lazy.<br/><br/>Less than halfway through, the film realizes how unfunny it is. It then shifts onto a drama path, navigating family values, morals and endless clichés. As Michael's life is spinning out of his control, he recognizes that happiness is in the moment  right here, right now with his family  and not in fast-forwarded promotions. Man, that's a smart movie. At this point it is so marred by formulaic elements that it becomes a Hallmark movie, desperately pulling at the collective heartstrings of the audience. But Michael is an unlikable hero and we do no sympathize with him, not even when he has fast-forwarded his life to when he is all grey-haired, lonely and broken.<br/><br/>Click's fatal flaw is that it cannot decide what it is. Is it a drama, is it a comedy? It melts both these genres together, but not in a believable way because it is neither touching nor funny  just a mish-mash of a a great concept, unfunny jokes and sentimentality. Had it put its heart into one of the genres and stuck with one approach, it would probably have been a good film. What's more is that its clumsy flat and shaky story does not hold up for two hours. The only highlights are its soundtrack and a hilarious small character by Sean Astin. <br/><br/>3 out of 10"

","Isn't it so nice when a product that you expect to be mediocre turns out to be just that much better than expected? This is the case with click. After seeing trailers and most of Sandler's other characters, I had a pretty good picture of what was going to happen, but that picture turned out to be an incomplete one.<br/><br/>Sandler plays Michael Newman, a bright young architect struggling to impress his boss (David Hasselhoff) and get the promotion that he has always dreamed about so he can live the life he has always wanted to live with his wife, Donna (Kate Beckinsale) and two young children, Ben and Samantha. The first forty-five minutes or so was pretty much what I expected. It was entertaining. Funny, but not hysterical and not particularly memorable or thought provoking. A lot of time was spent on Newman learning to use his new toy, a remote, given to him by a mysterious man, Morty (Christopher Walken) working out of a lab in the back of Bed, Bath and Beyond, that controlled everything in his life. There was cheap physical humor such as the family dog humping a large stuffed duck. Then, suddenly, a little past the halfway point, things took a turn for the better. A film that could have continued down the path traveled by countless doofus comedies before it took a sincere, unexpected and heartfelt bend away from the stereotype. As his remote adapts to Newman's mannerisms, it begins fast-forwarding through events automatically. The ending of the movie, without giving away too much more of the plot, showcases a more serious side of Sandler. Think 'Punch-Drunk Love' and you'll get the idea. He manages to grab you by the heart and pull you deeper into this already interesting film.<br/><br/>All throughout, 'Click' is wonderfully entertaining, and it managed to pull me into it like few films this year have. It manages to blend both sides of Adam Sandler well. It isn't just a good Adam Sandler movie, it is a good movie. Period."

"RVBUILDER","5","5","10","26 November 2006"," A bit disappointing
","I was somewhat disappointed by this movie. After looking at the trailer I expected more of a Jim Carey-esquire romp, a'la ""Bruce Almighty"". Adam Sandler is given a ""universal remote"" that allows him to fast-forward his life, skip chapters, view past history...everything but REWIND. Using the device, he totally screws up his life, fast-forwarding through much of it. I found myself not liking his character too much.<br/><br/>After a series of fast-forwards, he realizes he is old, his kids are grown, his wife has divorced him, and his father is dead, but he is running his own architecture firm. Typical trade-off for work-minded people, I guess. How many movies have exercised THAT theme? At that point, he wants to fix things but for some reason, the remote doesn't allow him to go back and have a do-over. Good thing my TiVo remote can do that!"

"GoldTurkey","4","5","10","1 August 2006"," A genuinely funny movie drowned out by a loud moral.
","A good movie is like a good song: all the parts have to harmonize. No matter how good one instrument is, if another one clashes with it, that's all you'll notice.<br/><br/>Such is the case with ""Click"". Yes, ""Click"" is funny. Yes, there were points where I was laughing out loud. But sadly, this movie is a victim of a loud, discordant moral that doesn't really...click.<br/><br/>Michael Newman (Sandler) is a workaholic architect who has no time for his family. A slave to his dumb boss (David Hasselhoff), most of his free time is spent doing work, much to the chagrin of his wife (Kate Beckinsale) and kids.<br/><br/>One day, while traveling to Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Michael wanders into the ""Way Beyond"" section, which is maintained by Morty (Christopher Walken), a wacky inventor. He gives Michael a sleek new universal remote which, interestingly enough, controls his universe.<br/><br/>Michael couldn't be more thrilled with this, and uses it to skip over parts of life he views trivial (family time, sex, time leading up to promotions, sickness). Of course, a problem soon manifests: the self-programming remote automatically begins skipping over these things without his input.<br/><br/>This movie does have a lot going for it: a strong cast (Hasselhoff scores as the boss, and Henry Winkler is good as Michael's dad), genuinely funny scenes (the sexual harassment scene had me in stitches), and some good lines from Sandler.<br/><br/>However, throughout the movie, we're introduced to the moral of the story. Actually, we're not so much introduced to it as it is forced upon us. The moral in question is ""live in the moment"". Were this billed as a drama, I would have expected and even welcomed a moral. However, this is a comedy. Its one and only goal is to make people laugh. And during the third act, I almost forgot I was watching a comedy.<br/><br/>That, of course, is not to say comedies can't include morals. ""Bruce Almighty"" was a laugh riot and included a good moral. Of course, that's because that movie knew not to shove the moral down our throats every three minutes. I'm just saying that morals are more welcome when they're more...subtly presented.<br/><br/>Going back to my comment at the top, the orchestration that is ""Click"" is perfectly in tune, except for that nagging, discordant moral."
"n66","2","6","13","25 June 2006"," Learn from my mistake
","I was unlucky enough to go see Click this weekend. I'd heard the premise and thought, hey, that could be a really fun film. There have been some excellent films with similar themes before, such as Groundhog Day and Being There, and Sandler and Beckinsale and Walken are all good actors, so why not?<br/><br/>Because, this is the movie-length equivalent of a really bad episode of a really dumb sitcom, like Married With Children. It's completely predictable from the first few scenes, the plot and the characters are all utterly contrived, and the jokes are childish, insulting and lame, unless your idea of good humor is watching a fat woman with hairy pits acting like she's having sex and then having someone comment, ""What is this, Animal Planet?"" There was exactly one line in the film that was actually funny (alert... minor spoiler follows): Sandler finds himself suddenly a few years in the future, and the first thing he hears on a radio broadcast is ""Michael Jackson, the first person to clone himself, is suing himself for molesting himself."" There. You've heard the good line, so you can skip the film.<br/><br/>I'm giving it two stars instead of one because it has two slightly redeeming features. First, the ""moral of the story"", despite being really obvious and being presented really heavy-handedly, is actually really good. In a way, that made it even worse, though, because after sitting through this emotionally wrenching story about a man totally screwing everything he cares about, I just ended up feeling manipulated. And second, on a purely visual level, the film is well-done. There were a lot of beautiful and imaginative sets, and frankly, although she's been much sexier in other films, spending a little time watching Beckinsale is never unpleasant.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you can't resist seeing this piece of crap, wait for the DVD."

","For this reviewer ""Click"" is Adam Sandler's best movie. That is not to say I don't like his other work like ""Happy Gilmore"", But love this move. I find it so touching.<br/><br/>Plt In A Paragraph: Michael Newman (Sandler) is a family man, but also a workaholic who must please his boss (David Hasselhoff), in order to get promoted. Problem is he gets less and less time with his family. When he meets Morty (the brilliant Christopher Walken), a crazy sales clerk, at Bed, Bath And Beyond who has the ultimate remote. A remote in which he can do anything, including muting, skipping and dubbing his life. He finds this to be the opportunity in which he can not only skip every argument, every illness, every shower or traffic jam but also skip forward to his big promotion. He sees this as a good idea, until the remote goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>This s a surprisingly touching movie and this reviewer is not ashamed to admit that he shed a tear on more than one occasion.

","I am not saying here that Click is a terrible movie, because it is not. But I couldn't help feeling minutely disappointed. I am not a huge Adam Sandler fan, though he has done some good work in some surprisingly good films.<br/><br/>While Sandler was just about bearable here, even if his character wasn't particularly likable, the film didn't quite work for my tastes. Granted, it does have a very interesting concept. A work-aholic architect who acquires a remote control that allows him to fast forward through things that peeve him? Hmm, I like that idea, really I do.<br/><br/>Some of the things that do happen: <br/><br/>1. What do you do if your wife starts bitching? Zip past her.<br/><br/>2. What do you do if a dog barks at you? Put him on mute.<br/><br/>3. What do you do if your boss starts irritating you? Hit pause, and fart in his face many times.<br/><br/>The concept of the story as I have said is a good one and is put to a decent amount of use. There were parts where I laughed, not many though, and there is an emotional core that does leave a lump in your throat at the end. The film is nice to look at and has a good soundtrack. Out of the supporting performances, David Hasselhoff looks as though he is having a lot of fun as the self-absorbed boss, and Christopher Walken does what he can with an underwritten role.<br/><br/>However, while she looked stunning, Kate Beckinsale is wasted as the long-suffering wife. The script has its weak spots too as there are parts where the humour is overdone, leaving certain characters(especially Walken's) underdeveloped and card board. Also the direction was disappointingly lacking, and some parts did get quite silly or heavy-handed such as how the dogs behave. I also felt the film was a little too long, some scenes in the middle half didn't have to be as dragged out as they were.<br/><br/>Overall, it has its moments, but doesn't quite work. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"jbartelone","5","3","5","19 December 2008"," Some Good Moments Hurt By Slapstick and Confusion
","Click has a very interesting premise. Adam Sandler plays an overworked architect, who wants to devote time to his wife and family, but his work constantly stresses him out. While shopping at a store one night for a ""Universal Remote"" that will simplify his life, he meets a very strange salesmen who shows him the ultimate in high-tech gadgets, a universal remote that controls his world. He can pause, rewind, and fast-forward events in his life and observe how he reacts to them. Adam's character thinks this is great. At first the remote gives him rewarding information. For example, he can skip bad events in his life and fast-forward to good things. However, it is not long before the remote is giving him information that he does not want to see or hear, leading to some very unpleasant and uncomfortable situations that involve his wife, kids, friends, co-workers, and supervisors.<br/><br/>Click sort of plays like a George Orwell ""Big Brother is Watching You"" novel, raising unique moral and ethical issues concerning not only how dependent our society has become accustomed to universal technology, but how that technology can be used where too much conveyance can hurt our relationships with family, the environment, and affect our health.<br/><br/>Many scenes in the movie demonstrate the above issues. The problem is that they don't do so in a very sequential or logical manner. A big downside of the film is the interjecting of Adam Sandler's slapstick humor. One gross scene has him farting in a manager's face. There are on-going Junior-High School mentality jokes and comments about his wives' and his sex-obsessed dog. These scenes were stupid and totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>Click also tries to bit off more than it can chew. It can not decide if it wants to be taken as a serious drama, sensitive comedy, or ludicrous slapstick. Adam's character, ""Michael's"" work, life, and family events with the remote, is so disjointed and disarrayed that while the viewer is left with some good ideas about how a character might react to advanced technology, the execution of events is weak in too many scenes. So much continuity is lost. What could have been a good film, is reduced to average.<br/><br/>Even on an emotional level, Adam Sandler is too much of a screwball for the viewer to care about what happens to him. The slapstick comedy, seemingly inserted into the movie solely because of him, is annoying and disgusting. The serious tones of the film are forced and unnatural because Adam does not do serious drama well at all.<br/><br/>Click should have had a more dramatic actor in its lead role, an easier to follow script, and taken the slapstick out completely. Had these elements been followed by the writers and producers, this movie would have been so much better!"

He tried (and failed) in ""Spanglish,"" before retreating to what he knows best ""The Longest Yard,"" which, in my mind, just made it all the worse. If Sandler would pick a line of comedy and STICK to it, he would be on the track, but he's all over the place.<br/><br/>Sandler plays an architect with a family that is expecting just as much time from him as his boss is, who is holding a promotion to partner over his head. In the course of his daily life, even the little things seem to get to him, like all the remotes sitting on the coffee table and opening the garage door and turning on the ceiling fan when all he does is turn on the television to find some cartoons for his kids to watch.<br/><br/>Out to blow off some steam, he turns to a department store to find a universal remote, where he meets Walken, who supplies him with a remote that can control everything around his life, including people, places, and things, not just the television, ceiling fan, and garage door.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 is what I gave this film, because I really did enjoy it.

Is he an angel of misery too? Why doesn't he say that? Also, the entire movie being a dream of the main character is just plain dumb. Are you seriously telling me that an architect can think up of a story about a remote controlling the universe and every little feature of it and a story that spans years in the matter of a few seconds like a writer can? Bullsh*t. After it's revealed it a dream, the angel comes back and pardons him? What? So it wasn't a dream? And why would the angel of death want to pardon a dead guy? He is the angel of death, why would he want to bring a guy back from the dead? Why would the hell the angel even have a remote that controls the universe? If everything happened, evidenced by the angel's pardon, why does he say that the remote is brand new? Shouldn't someone else have gone into the beyond section, find the remote, then also go crazy, therefore meaning it's not brand new? Plus why does Adam not tell anyone about the remote? It won't fast forward him because the only thing that does is arguments, dinner, injuries, traffic, promotion, sex, and shower. There won't be an argument if he writes everything down and shows the remote. It's SO STUPID! If I saw the film a second time, I probably could list more. <br/><br/>Nominated for best makeup at the Oscars? Are you kidding me! Is it because of the belly flap? ANYONE CAN MAKE THAT! AND ITS ONLY SHOWN FOR ONE SCENE, WHERE ADAM IS LYING DOWN SO It'S EASY TO DO! Editing its awful in this movie. When the universe is paused and Adam is moving around, it's so obvious its a green screen. Some transitions are so bad, like when Adam goes into a menu. Directing in this movie is so bland and boring. Nothing is shot interesting. JUST LOOK AT THE POSTER FOR CLICK<br/><br/>I don't remember any music played in the film. It was probably stock music. Same thing for SFX, its stock. When Adam Sandler farts into guys face FOR 15 SECONDS, its sounds like a YouTube poop edit.

If you like this film and think it's artsy, good for you. It probably means, however, you're a goddam moron and never seen a good comedy (did i mention the comedy in this film sucks?)

","15 October 2006. This movie can't decide whether it's a comedy or a drama or both. The commendable ambitions of Adam Sandler to continue to expand his acting roles can't escape the director's pull back into the dumb comedy that Sandler has been relegated to many times. The ending portion of the film is representative of how good the movie could have been only to be vacuumed back into the predictable stereotypical ""It's a Wonderful Life"" fantasy. With a better writer and more careful direction, the premise of this movie along with Adam Sandler could have been one of the breakthrough movies of the year. Yet, unfortunately, while the creative spark and special effects are fun and entertaining, this movie was stuck in the summer fun category instead of Oscar award quality.

","Click was one of the more popular of Adam Sandler's films which was a hit among the general public and that's because this is not a typical Sandler comedy. There are gags and jokes but the tone is serious and by the end of the film it turns into a tear-jerker. Click accomplishes what it sets out to do: tell an occasionally amusing, occasionally affecting drama about how adults often lose sight of what matters. Click works because Sandler doesn't throw out the drama in a quest for laughs. There are times when the comedian falls back on his typical shtick, but the film doesn't shy away from the darkness inherent in this kind of story, and it has a heart. Sandler is Scrooge in the last act of A Christmas Carol and George Bailey in the last act of It's a Wonderful Life, and he does justice to those who have preceded him down this path by using the template and reapplying it."

","So, I saw this movie when it came out in 2006. I was 13 years old. I thought the movie was pretty decent back then.<br/><br/>However, as time went on, and I began looking at films from a more critical perspective and yeah, there is a lot to say about this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, this story is anything but original. The man who was seduced by power? Yeah, I'm pretty sure every variation of that story has been done at this point.<br/><br/>Basically, Adam Sandler's character is an overworked architect trying to satisfy both his family and his work colleagues. His boss, David Hasselhoff puts a certain amount of undue pressure on him to get his work done, putting Sandler's family plans to a screeching halt.<br/><br/>Trying to make his life a bit easier, he meets Christopher Walken who is a retail salesman, who gives him a universal remote control that ""remote-controls your universe."" Sandler tries to accomplish his work goals thanks to the remote but it starts becoming self aware, skipping through chapters of his life quite literally and it suddenly turns all tragic.<br/><br/>This is the main issue with the film: the tone. The first hour of the film is spent establishing the situation of Sandler's character and the humorous occurrences that take place once he receives the remote. Once it is discovered what the negative repercussions of the remote are, the film proceeds to skip ahead a number of years in the last few scenes, where the situation is explained with throwaway lines of expository dialogue, breaking the first rule of filmmaking: SHOW, DON'T TELL!!!! It's also quite jarring that it suddenly shifts in tone from goofy misadventures with a remote control to tragic heartbreak skipping decades of Sandler's life. No natural flow whatsoever and it takes away from the enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>The concept is intriguing, the only problem is that the material was not used to its full potential."

Henry Winkler who playing the father gives an excellent performance very strong and emotional."
"HeroOfTheDay666","9","1","1","5 June 2013"," It's Humorous, It's Somber, It's Click.
","I must admit, I'm not usually fond of Adam Sandler. His movies seem to involve the same character over and over with similar jokes, and for these reasons are why I was so surprised by Click.<br/><br/>The premise is that a workaholic, Michael Newman,(Sandler) is constantly doing projects for his boss and neglecting his family in the process. His actions are leaving him feeling dissatisfied with his life, but everything changes when he meets Morty (Walken), a mysterious employee of Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Morty bestows upon Michael a universal remote which can literally control the universe, whether it be speeding things up, slowing them down, skipping ""chapters"" through life, you name it. Michael begins to use this remote to get through life's ""little"" troubles, be it traffic, showers, sickness, unwanted sex, etc. It backfires on him later down the line when the remote programs itself to skip all these things automatically, forcing Michael to reevaluate just what is important in life.<br/><br/>The first thing that must be addressed about this movie is it is NOT a comedy all the way through. The first half is where most of the jokes are, but the film takes a serious turn towards the middle. If you're expecting a laugh riot, look elsewhere, or turn off the movie at the halfway mark. If I had known Sandler was doing drama, I probably would have skipped the movie entirely, but he surprisingly pulls it off quite well. <br/><br/>The humor is definitely typical Sandler stuff, and this might be enough to dissuade those that don't like his other movies. However, I would implore you to sit through the humor and see how you like the more dramatic parts. I actually teared up a few times, and that says a lot for me considering I didn't let loose a single tear for a lot of other famous ""cry your eyes out"" movies like Titanic. <br/><br/>There are many themes and morals being addressed here, the main one being ""don't let the little things in life fly by"" and ""family comes first."" By the films conclusion, I was looking at my own life through a critical lens, trying to figure out if I was guilty of similar crimes. It's a bit reminiscent of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in many ways. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd say if you want a different kind of Sandler movie, this might be it. You could appreciate the dramatic parts in hand with the funny ones too. 9/10"

","Click is horrible alright, more than most of Adam Sandler films. It is one of the most uneven atrocities I have ever seen. Borrowing elements from Frank Capra and Robert Zemeckis, but combined with Sandler's usual irreverence, it is honestly quite forgettable. A laugh here and there is enough to keep you watching, but Sandler has little cleverness. The film ultimately comes up empty-handed as a yarn of its own. Anyone could have thought of this screenplay and the ending is ridiculous. do yourself a favor and see a comedy with a script, not a comedy that requires a superb actor like Christopher Walken to stand behind a table and show up. Pure tasteless, like most of the Sandler collection of films."
"hall895","7","1","1","17 August 2011"," Adam can act
","It's not the typical Adam Sandler movie and thank goodness for that. This movie has some actual drama, some real heart to it. It's not all lowbrow toilet humor. Has Adam Sandler grown up? Even in this more grownup venture he apparently just couldn't help himself, tossing in the obligatory disgusting fart joke. But we'll give him a a pass on that one because pretty much everything else in the movie shows a refreshing maturity. Well, OK maybe not the humping dogs. But what do you want? Sandler's never going to go full-blown serious dramatist and who'd want him to? This movie maintains the humor Sandler is known for but also gives you a story you actually care about and moments of great emotion and poignancy. Along the way Sandler gets to show that he does have some actual serious acting chops. One scene with him and his father, played by Henry Winkler, particularly stands out. Here Sandler's character has so much emotion coursing through him. And Sandler performs the scene so well you feel the emotion right along with him. Very well done, and more than a little surprising from an actor who is not known for this sort of thing.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Sandler's character of Michael, an overworked architect whose family takes a backseat in his quest for career advancement. He loves his family, he just doesn't have the time for them. Then he meets Morty, a mysterious man who bestows upon Michael a gift which will make things so much simpler. It's a universal remote which actually control's Michael's universe. Now he's got all the time he needs. He can pause, rewind, fast forward. But inevitably there will be complications. Michael ends up fast forwarding through his whole life. He misses everything. And he gets really, really fat. It seems in order to really appreciate life Michael had to miss it. Can he get it back? According to Morty that's not part of the deal.<br/><br/>Those expecting a straight comedy are going to be very surprised with Click, but probably pleasantly so. There are plenty of laughs but nothing that's really uproariously funny. And most of the comedy is shoehorned into the first half of the film. The second half takes on a more serious, at times even somber, tone. A somber Adam Sandler movie? Who wants to watch that? You should. Sandler breaks out of the little box that is his admittedly wildly successful career to try something a little bit different and it pays off. Sandler is really terrific in this. And he's got great support from the rest of the cast, most notably the always reliably brilliant Christopher Walken playing the eccentric Morty. Not everything in the movie works perfectly. Some jokes fall flat, some dramatic moments don't grab you quite as much as they should. But most of it works, and works very well at that. Adam Sandler can make you laugh. Turns out he can tug on your heartstrings too. Who knew?"

Complications arise and hilarity ensues as the remote gradually starts overruling Michael's choices.<br/><br/>The previews for ""Click"", at least from the previews I've seen, make it out to look like a comedy and nothing but. So naturally, I went into the film expecting to see Adam Sandler make an idiot out of himself.<br/><br/>What I got was something entirely not what I was expecting.<br/><br/>Sure, there are a few elements of standard Sandler fare, like the farting and the dog humping. But when it took a turn for the serious, that's when the film's message is hammered home, and Sandler's skills as an actor really shine. It was hard fighting back the tears at some parts.<br/><br/>Of course, Sandler couldn't have done it without an exceptional supporting cast. Kate Beckinsale was excellent in her role as Michael's wife, Donna. And Christopher Walken was great as always as the eccentric Bed Bath & Beyond sales clerk.<br/><br/>""Click"" is funny. Maybe not as funny as Sandler's other movies, but funny nonetheless. It's also a very powerful, emotional, and moving film. Definitely one of Adam Sandler's best, if not the best.

"Quinoa1984","4","6","15","23 June 2006"," A Sandler Carol; some laughs, but way too much 'message' to recommend
","Now here's something rather paradoxical. I saw the trailer for the new Adam Sandler vehicle, Click, and it was by and large pretty funny, while obvious, and giving the impression that it would be a straight-out comedy. The set-up to the film isn't bad at all, and is sort of promising. But there's something troubling about what is even more obvious as the film goes along. It may be a matter of minutes depending on how soon it might click, no pun intended, what is going on with Sandler's character Michael. And Christopher Walken's ominous, crazy character as the kind of guide for him also brings ahead some clues. It's typical, of course, but it might have been able to bring some more creativity than ended up happening. As it is, I found myself feeling uneasy throughout the third act as Sandler's character has his remote fast-forward through many years and events leaving him in a perpetual sadness until you-know-what with a formula like this finally kicks in. That a lot of this is really overly sentimental and very movie-message like is disappointing, as the filmmakers try to turn around a usual Sandler comedy on its side for the 'Carol' side of it. That it's all wrapped up in this schematic of the film's structure really brings the film down in a way I haven't seen since Sandler's worst film 8 Crazy Nights.<br/><br/>Luckily, when the film IS funny and Sandler and his hit or miss screenwriters get some jokes that work, they do almost as well as those of his (compared to this) classic 90s movie work. True, there are only so many times one can watch a dog have his way with a cushion, but the gag works once or twice. And there are some unexpected bits in a kind of unspoken way in Sandler's films that do spark up some laughs from the practical one-gimmick. Sometimes, too, I even found myself having big laughs when no one else in the theater had them, which I took as a good sign. Plus, the cast is, albeit a little 'uh-huh', not too bad at all for what they're required for (which includes, yes, Sean Astin in a speedo). In fact, if the entire film was just from the first turning point of figuring out the remote to when it 'turns' on him, so to speak, it would be a very good (though short) movie, with at least one or two memorable bits. But in its total running time, my patience wore thin far too many a time, leaving me at the end remembering too much what didn't work than what did. In short, it's one of Sandler and company's lesser works."

","After reading some of the reviews here, I actually registered on IMDb just so I could address some of the crap people are saying bout this movie.<br/><br/>Some people are saying it's not funny and they're not American. Not living in our culture every day, my guess is that a lot of the jokes went right over their heads. This is obviously not the movie's fault! <br/><br/>Those offended by the unnecessary ""raunchy"" humor need to wake the f--- up. If you were ignorant enough to go see an Adam Sandler movie and expect a wholesome family movie, you deserved to see a stuffed duck's butt-hole get ripped open. To the parents who took their young children to a PG-13 movie with Adam Sandler, you deserve to explain why that duck's butt-hole was ripped open! There are plenty of wholesome family movies already out there...this movie was made for the younger adult crowd and being a younger adult (29) I'm glad they made it exactly the way they did.<br/><br/>I think it's ridiculous how anyone could bag on the acting. For one, it's supposed to be a ""cute comedy"", not Oscar material. Secondly, I think the acting was actually quite good for a movie of this genre. For example, it was almost creepy how much the guy playing the grown-up version of Sandler's son reminded me of Sandler...the way he talked, facial expressions, etc. For a second, I almost thought it might be Sandler in makeup.<br/><br/>The people saying it's a dumb story or too serious/not realistic are either not human or they're simply not mature enough to get the point, period. <br/><br/>In addition to there being tons of humor for everyone, there are lots of little ""inside jokes"" for long-time Sandler fans, which I think is a nice bonus.<br/><br/>Bottom line......<br/><br/>For the 25 and older crowd who've been out of college long enough to understand what a rat race that life can be, this movie WILL make you think. However, if you're also driven to be successful and have a family you care about, this story hits especially hard...hard enough that it will make you cry and maybe even change the way you live your life.<br/><br/>That said, if you also happen to like Adam Sandler and his brand of humor, this movie could be one of your favorite movies of all time."

Kate Beckinsale was amazing, I doubted that she could pull off the part of a stay at home mom, but she was great, her and Adam were perfect for this movie. Adam Sandler showed a side which I had never seen, caring, yes, he has shown the side, but not with such compassion. Henry Winkler portrayed the role of the grandfather who still wants his little boy, perfectly. The children brought so much chemistry to the movie, the little girls connection to her father, and the boy's ""I want to be like Dad"" attitude were played well. The only people I would have recasted were Jennifer Cooligde, because she did not seem to have anthing in common with Kate, and David Hasslehoff, because after his part in Spongebob, it's hard to take him as an intimidating superior. Secondly, awesome script. The comedy mixed with the drama perfectly, . Lastly, this movie lets you feel the pain he feels. Although the commercials showed its comical side, this movie goes so deep in it's emotions, I can only say that it was amazing. Adam Sandler was the father figure that I am use to.

","I walked out of this movie when Adam Sandler jumped up on his boss' desk and farted into his face while he was ""frozen"" with the pause button on the universal remote. This is the type of ""humor"" you will find in this lifeless film (at least the part I was able to sit through.) I don't know how it ends and, quite frankly, don't care. The movie is filled with enough foul language and off color depictions (imagine the family dog ""boinking"" a stuffed yellow duck several times, and you get the feel of the film). I don't know why the director could not make a simple G rated film with the same material, but had to lower the event to something I would never take a child to see. There is not enough verve in the story line to entertain adults, and too much gutter humor for the kids."

","Michael (Adam Sandler) has a gorgeous wife and the proverbial two kids. He is an architect employed by a tedious boss and Micheal must work extra hours to bring home enough bacon. One day when his own children tease him for mixing up the remote controls, he decides to take action. He will run out and get a universal remote, like the snotty rich neighbors. However, it is rather late at night and the only store open is Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Nevertheless, in the Beyond section of the store, an unusual clerk sells him the ultimate universal remote, one that is free and non-returnable, too. Michael happily returns home. But, wait. Michael soon finds out THIS remote can also stop the dog from barking loudly and fast forward him through a shower or an argument with his wife. Great, is it not? All too soon, Michael learns that the remote has a down side, including missing important moments in his life. And, although he tries, the remote can not be discarded. Help! This is movie that has some funny moments and some good ideas but it's not enough. Sandler has never tried harder to make things work and to keep laughs coming but he ultimately fails. Perhaps this is because of some very tasteless humor when things go awry. Beckingsale is quite wonderful, however, as the much put-upon wife. Walken is always topnotch and it is wonderful to see Winkler and Kavner. With such a cast, one would guess the movie can't miss, but is does. The culprits are probably the so-so script and the uneven direction. In any case, even if you are a Sandler die-hard, you will be left out in the cold by this film. You may even want to click your own remote and fast forward to the end of the film long before the movie's ending."

","Once I saw countless previews of a movie about a man who can control his life with a remote control, I thought, oh cool finally someone decided to make a movie out of the famous secret fantasy we've all had before. I wondered how they...(i.e. Hollywood)...would attempt to keep such a plot going with it not seeming ridiculously unrealistic. I should've known ass soon as the ""Happy Madison"" logo panned across the screen, that this would be another Hollywood wash movie. When, Michel's first experienced the power of the remote his response was too plain and lame. If that had happened to any of us we would've reacted as if we were caught in the middle of a terrible LSD trip. Sencondly, when Morty presented Michael with the main menu screen, that's when I had to go ""Here we go again"" another great premise turn cheesy plot turn bad movie. The fact that Adam Sandler couldn't rewind and live in the moment, Auto-pilot, and a plethora of other conditions, just seemed like bad rules for a Dungeons and Dragons game. Of course the climax of the movie is when the remote goes out of control, which was corny. It's automatically programmed blah blah blah...Morty's and Angel of death...boo...corny. The movie was overall stupid. Great Premise though, which is the only reason I gave it a 4."

","I have to start out by saying that I've never seen an Adam Sandler movie that I thought was funny. Even when there is a script that will extend him a bit (and I think he has the potential to be funny), it's all overused, sophomoric stuff. The premise is so interesting here; yet the whole thing falls apart. Why can't he act like a real person thrust into this new world? Instead there are cheap laughs, farts in faces, Christopher Walken looking like he doesn't know what to do. The remote that brings about all the problems and the joys, is unpredictable and often makes no sense. Of course, there's ""And then I woke up."" I will continue to give the man a chance, but I really don't think I could sit through this again."
"joeydean61869","4","3","6","28 November 2006"," Sandler plays Sandler in Click...a comedy?
","** out of **** stars<br/><br/>Click continuously reminded me of the Charles Dickens tale Scrooge: A man magically gets the chance to view his life in the past, present and future, and in the end, doesn't like what he discovers. The difference is, Click won't survive the test of time. It'll just get filed away with most of the other typical Sandler comedies. Or was this a comedy?<br/><br/>Adam Sandler plays architect Michael Newman, but he actually plays Adam Sandler, or his alter ego. All the Sandler mannerisms are present: sudden outbursts of yelling, a bashful, cuddly voice (especially when in dialouge with his wife), jokes that border on raunchy yet are not quite brave enough to cross the line. His wife Donna, played by Kate Beckinsale, nags him for working too much and for not spending enough time with her or their two children. The thing is, he does spend a lot of time with them, or seems to. Michael's argument with Donna is he wants to provide luxury for his family, which is why he works so hard. <br/><br/>This is the conflict of the story. No, there's not much else.<br/><br/>Michael's life seems rather pleasant, actually. His children admire and love him. His parents adore him. He lives in a big house with all the amenities. Yet, he suffers. Welcome to the world of another egocentric American.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken, with his idiosyncratic vocal cadence and a hairdo that rivals Einstein's rat's nest, is cast as Morty, the inventor of the ""universal"" remote control that changes Michaels life. Michael first meets Morty on a late night excursion to Bed, Bath and Beyond to buy a remote for his television. Morty, in his words, gives Michael his amazing device because ""he seems like a good guy."" A bad guy with some moral lessons to learn would have worked better, or at least a good guy with problems that were much more serious.<br/><br/>Michael quickly discovers how to manipulate his life with the remote. He can mute his nagging wife or his barking dog. He can fast forward through the ""superfluous"" experiences in his life and get to the good stuff, like job promotions and sex. He can change the color and tint of his face. Michael initially enjoys the remote so much he seems like a teenage boy who just lost his virginity. At the height of Michael's remote control ecstasy, I guessed that the invention would soon teach him some hard lessons about treating his life as if it were a game, and I guessed right. As Michael fast forwards further and further away from the present and deep into the future, the movie becomes less like a playful comedy and more like a heartfelt tragedy. The film makers seemed to let the story mutate into a different genre without much regard for it's silly roots.<br/><br/>I'm not blind to the fact that there are legions of adoring Adam Sandler fans in movie watching land who love to see Adam play Adam. They gladly expect it. When he plays himself he's likable, funny, charismatic and charming. He obviously knows his audience and has a fantastic grasp of popular culture from the 1970s to today. My fear is the more films he makes where he plays it safe, the harder it will be for him to explore character roles that are more than one-dimensional - as he did in Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish - and escape crucifixion. Sandler's craft has proved to be far-reaching, yet many mistake his talent and ingenuity as a journey outside the box they'd like to keep him in.<br/><br/>Click isn't a horrible film, but we've seen much better versions of it. It will elicit a few laughs, perhaps even a few tears. Fans of Sandler being Sandler will probably like it well enough. I myself look forward to another film that helps me almost forget that I'm watching him."
"cha8193","4","3","6","16 October 2006"," Not impressed
","I was not impressed with this film. It seemed like a bad attempt to replicate the life changing transformations found in films like ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" and ""Groundhog Day,"" but failed. The setup was good but the film failed to capitalize fully on the use of the remote control device and went directly into tragedy. The story was missing a middle where the character gets an opportunity to learn rather than just hanging around on autopilot and watching life just pass him by. I wanted to see more comedy and there was certainly the possibility for it with all the capabilities of that remote the movie could have gone in ten different directions. Not understanding one rule changes everything? Why couldn't he reprogram and start over?"
"Superunknovvn","6","3","6","8 October 2006"," Adam Sandler will be Adam Sandler
","I really should give up hoping that this man will ever make a movie as good and different from his usual work as ""Punch Drunk Love"" again. Of course, I wasn't expecting anything like this when I went into ""Click"". I just hoped that Sandler's style of comedy may have changed a bit over the years. Unfortunately, it didn't. Sandler is still painfully underacting and mostly unfunny.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie is a good one for 90 minutes of light fun. It could have been another fantasy/comedy classic about a guy who needs to be refined in the vein of ""Groundhog Day"", ""Scrooged"" or even the sub-standard ""Family Man"". Sandler just happened to step in and re-defines ""light"" as ""undemanding"" and ""vulgar"". People get farted in the face, kicked in the balls and the ever so horrible Rob Schneider makes his obligatory cameo appearance. That's not the way it should have gone down.<br/><br/>To be fair, though, it isn't just Sandler's fault that this movie is so disappointing. The script is a huddle. It starts of too quickly, the characters don't really work together - starting from Sandler's way too beautiful wife to his way too idiotic boss - and finally the movie gets inappropriately dramatic in the end.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Christopher Walken delivers once again as the funniest thing in an otherwise horrible comedy. (When will he finally treat his career with some respect again?) It's always good to have David Hasslehoff in a movie, too, but just having him alone isn't funny per se. However, that's apparently what the makers of ""Click"" thought, since Hasslehoff's character is extremely uninteresting.<br/><br/>As gooey as it may be, I do like the main message of the movie. The metaphor with the pot of gold was nice and the way Christopher Walken's character told it throughout the movie was really haunting.<br/><br/>""Click"" doesn't quite deliver, but there are different scales on which Adam Sandler movies suck and at least this one was on the upper half."

","This is one of those films you watch with the feeling you could have lost your money when you bought the ticket. No, it's not bad, bad you keep the opinion you could have done something better than sitting there and seeing it. ""click"" tries to be more than a comedy sometimes, and these are the most boring moments of the film. It's good when it is just an uncommitted comedy and it sucks when it tries to become a tiring drama. I don't know why some producers and directors try to make their movies bigger than they could really be and make a simple job become a collection of genres that, in the end, don't tell us much. ""Click"" is not that bad, but I still think it could have been lighter and less worried about giving so much messages and values. It simply doesn't belong to (good) comedies."
"Jay_Exiomo","5","3","6","9 August 2006"," Could have used a lot less sugar and cheese
","I'm not exactly a fan of Adam Sandler. I've first seen him in ""Waterboy"" more than eight years ago when I was in high school, and he just weirded me out so much, although I must admit his nonsensical low-brow movies do elicit chuckles here and there when I'm caught off-guard. ""Click"" is no exception, as it has several funny moments involving a remote control that controls EVERYTHING that has to do with him.<br/><br/>Michael Newman (Sandler) is an architect who is so concerned about getting a promotion from his boss (David Hasselhoff) that he has taken his family for granted (yep, it takes a lot of swallowing how one can take for granted a wife that looks like Kate Beckinsale). After a stressful day that was capped by a trouble finding the remote for the TV, he heads to Bed Bath & Beyond to find a universal remote control that he thinks would simplify his already complicated life. He meets Morty (Christopher Walken) who gives him a literal universal remote control that can rewind, fast-forward, pause, skip a chapter of his life, change his skin's hue, modify an aspect ratio of his boss, change the audio language... whatever.<br/><br/>And for the first hour or so, it is indeed a wonderful life with a heavy dose of trademark Sandler humor. It's here where the movie is the most fun, with Micahel making a punching bag out of his boss, impressing his wife by vividly recalling the details of their first kiss, and going back to the time he was born (even literally going in his mother's womb... ugh). Sandler's dopey-faced and self-depreciating humor work very well when the script lets it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it all comes undone when the inevitable comes to pass with Michael realizing that having total control with one's life isn't as appealing as it might sound. This is the part where it seems unsure of itself. Director Frank Coraci and screenwriters Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe concocts a saccharine second act that's all too cloying and hokey. The resolution has Michael undergo a character transformation that lets him realize how much he's missing his family, which - while maybe a noble intention - disentangles all the credits out of the proceedings. Suddenly it feels as if we are seeing an Ashton Kutcher cautionary sci-fi rather than an Adam Sandler comedy, and the film runs off-course.<br/><br/>Particularly I didn't like the final act that employs a deus ex machina, which obviously seems to make the ending more acceptable and that the main character has still all the time in the world to make up to his parents, his wife and his kids. But what it really suggests is that the writers didn't believe the audience would get the story's morals and instead spoon-feeds us with the basic lessons. At one point, I hoped the film would tackle the deeper implications of its premise but that probably wouldn't appeal to its target crowd. Then at least they could've gone for all-out fun.<br/><br/>As for Walken, he has some appearances as the weird guy who gave Michael the remote, but most are unimpressive. Beckinsale is heavily underused but Morty's right: she sure does look hot.<br/><br/>""Click"" often seems unaware of whether it's an Adam Sandler comedy or a morality play. The comedy works out fine but the moral angle just doesn't. A large part of it is derived from simplistic problems with simplistic solutions and when the film gets down to it, that's where it's least successful."
"JimD73","4","3","6","22 July 2006"," Click part tragedy, part Sandler comedy, and the mix just doesn't work
","Adam Sandler movies aren't quite as funny as they used to be. Billy Madison was by far the funniest, and it's been downhill since then, with The Longest Yard being his worst comedy yet. At the same time, Sandler has been involving himself in many more serious projects, such as Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish. Click could be said to be a combination of the two, half a tragedy and half an immature fantasy comedy. It is this dual personality that is the main fault of Click, because it simply exists at two opposite poles.<br/><br/>The main premise of Click is something that everyone has probably thought of at one time or another. What if you could have a remote control that controlled events around you? Would you use to help others or to exercise all of your guilty pleasures in your darkest dreams? Would you give yourself a clean slate and start from page one? Would you use it for trial-and-error, trying something and if it doesn't work feeling free to rewind? <br/><br/>Click never delves too deeply into the psychology behind being your own God, because it is more obsessed with making it a personal tale rather than make the main character a metaphor for the audience to relate to. The movie follows Michael Newman (Sandler), a man with a beautiful wife (Beckinsale), two young children and the hope of soon making partner in an architectural firm, which has caused him to work insane hours and ignore his family. He doesn't have time for the regular things, such as taking his kids camping or making love to his wife.<br/><br/>As the straw that breaks the camel's back, he is having problems with the excessive number of remotes in his home which apparently control everything from light fixtures to the refrigerator. He goes out searching for a universal remote, finding only Bed, Bath and Beyond to be open. He ventures into the Beyond section and finds Morty (Walken), who gives him a top-of-the-line non-returnable remote for free, citing that sometimes good guys need a break. He leaves it up to Michael to find out that the remote controls his entire universe, allowing him to pause, fast-forward, chapter select, hear commentary, etc.<br/><br/>As you would expect from any Sandler movie, it starts out with him abusing his powers for personal benefit or for fun. He gives himself a tan using the tint, he revisits old childhood memories and he torments the child next door. He also uses it to skip past hard work periods or dinner with his parents (Winkler & Kavner), which leaves him as a near-zombie in autopilot. Some of what happens is fairly funny, just because we all know we'd love to do the same thing if given the chance, or because we manage to revel in Michael's joy with his new toy as he makes everyone speak Spanish or has James Earl Jones narrate his life. More often than not, it is about as crude as you'd expect from a Sandler movie, which bodes pretty bad, hitting lows such as dogs (yes, plural) humping a stuffed toy duck or Sandler farting into the face of his boss (Hasselhoff).<br/><br/>The movie does a quick 180 halfway through, turning into a tragedy as the remote automatically skips years at a time based on what he previously skipped. Basically, this means that he has spent most of his life on auto-pilot, and we see his life fall apart basically. As a tragedy, it works well, having a couple strong emotional moments near the end as he tries to stop his life from self-destructing.<br/><br/>The problem that exists is that Click is possibly the most bipolar movie I have ever seen. The first half is the Sandler brand of immature fart jokes, while the second half is a tragedy that seems perfect for date movies. To find an audience who would appreciate both the tear-jerking drama and the dog-humping humour would be quite a task. The fact that Click could have worked going in either direction adds insult to injury, as we potentially could have had two good movies with distinctly different moods, but the same subject matter. Instead, we have an amalgamation of the two approaches, and it is far too jumbled to be effective.<br/><br/>From an acting perspective, Sandler is surprisingly strong, though nothing that would gain him much more respect after turning in good performances in Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish. The rest of the cast is mostly forgettable, aside from a terrifically sleazy David Hasselhoff. Beckinsale is definitely strong, though it is far from career defining work. Even Christopher Walken, one of my personal favourite actors, is wasted, having a couple good lines here and there but more or less floating through the movie.<br/><br/>On a side note, the aging is done incredibly well on all characters, considering the movie spans more than twenty years. It isn't hard to mistake Sandler for a sixty year old near the end of the cycle, though the same effect isn't as noticeable on Beckinsale or Astin. Seeing an eighty-year old Henry Winkler proves to be one of the movie's more heartbreaking visuals.<br/><br/>There may be some gold hidden deep with Click, a movie that could have easily been much more. As it stands, it is likely to repulse just as much as it attracts. There is no way that a movie can be both a tragedy and have someone fart in David Hasselhoff's face. There was definitely potential for a movie about one of the most common fantasies in life, but few of the possibilities were realized. Maybe in a few years, the concept can be revisited with either a fully comic or fully dramatic attitude, or at least a more subtle blend of the two. The bipolarity of the movie essentially cancels out the audiences, making Click a movie for almost no one.<br/><br/>46%"
"rgardner-6","4","3","6","10 July 2006"," Comedy-drama that doesn't hold together
","In ""Click,"" Adam Sandler plays a put-upon architect too busy trying to become partner in his firm to pay attention to his wife (Kate Beckinsdale) and two adorable kids. <br/><br/>Already stretched to the breaking point by the demands of work and family, Sandler is set off by his inability to find, among the many that litter his house, the remote control that turns on his TV.<br/><br/>In one of the more blatant corporate tie-ins in recent movie history, Sandler, in a huff, heads to Bed, Bath, & Beyond to buy a universal remote to control all the functions of his TV, DVD, etc. (Nevermind the question of why he would go to to a store that so obviously sells sheets, towels, and housewares for an electronic device. He goes to B,B, & Beyond because Best Buy probably wouldn't pony up the cash for a movie tie-in)<br/><br/>At the store, he meets Christopher Walken, playing the one-note goofy-creepy character he's been doing in these kinds of movies for a decade now, who gives him a shiny ""universal"" remote. Sandler gets the remote control home and soon learns the pause, fast forward, mute, and other buttons work on his dog, wife, children, and life.<br/><br/>The movie has some fun and gets genuine laughs as Sandler uses the fast forward feature to get through foreplay with his wife, the mute button on his dog, and the pause button to get revenge on his smarmy boss (David Hasselhoff).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Sandler runs out of clever things to do with the remote control, and the movie lurches into its second, darker half. The laughs disappear, and the movie, in its ""A Christmas Carol"" phase, becomes somber and heavy-handed.<br/><br/>There is one scene that is actually unsettling and proves Christopher Walken's creepiness hasn't been completely filed down.<br/><br/>Still, this is an Adam Sandler movie and the darkness drops like a hammer onto a movie that had Sandler mount his boss's desk and fart in his face for a solid 5 seconds. The funny stuff is mediocre-Adam Sandler and the serious stuff doesn't jell with it. The movie meanders in the second half until finally coming to a weak ending.<br/><br/>The actors give the material a go and everybody plays their part. Sandler reprises his jerk-who-has-forgotten-what's-truly-important role, Walken does his schtick, and some of the actors that appear in all of Sandler's films appear to play their one-note roles.<br/><br/>In the formula that undergirds nearly all of Sandler's movies, the female love interest plays an important and often under-appreciated role. Though Sandler is front and center and the butt or teller of all jokes, his movies need a strong female presence to provide ballast. Sandler's long past the days of ""The Waterboy"" and ""Happy Gilmore,"" when he could create and inhabit a character so goofy and watchable and walk him through a cliché-ridden story that you could throw any pretty woman next to him. (Julie Bowen, anybody?) <br/><br/>There's a reason why ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""50 First Dates"" work and ""Little Nicky"" and ""Mr Deeds"" don't. It's the girl, stupid. (In particular, Drew Barrymore. Why aren't these two married?) <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Kate Beckinsdale has no chemistry with Sandler. She seems to have wondered in from another, more glamorous movie. You see her making sandwiches in the kitchen, but you don't believe that she's ever made a sandwich in her life. You learn that she's a stay at home mom with two kids. You see the home and the two kids, but Beckinsdale acts like she can't wait for the director to yell ""Cut!"" so she can get these rugrats away from her.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the movie has her gaze at the camera with lingerie-catalogue eyes and show off her rail-thin body in microscopic tee-shirt-and-boxer combinations. She sports a shag hairdo that's straight out of $1,000-a-hairstyle salon and, in all her scenes, is lit with a heavenly light. No housewife looks this good, no actual woman looks this good, no-body looks this good-- Without an army of wardrobe and makeup people. Such a phony character is out of place alongside the believably slobby Sandler and the everyday-people-looking actors playing the two kids.<br/><br/>You can't fault Beckinsdale for the way she looks. But you can for what she does with the material. She plays the role with an earnestness that it doesn't deserve. She's trying to sell the audience the domestic complications that it knows are all part of the formula. She also misplays the few quirks her character is given and is at her most believable when fighting with Sandler.<br/><br/>Though Beckinsdale is the most glaring problem, she is not the only one. We never know what to make of Hasselhoff as Sandler's boss. Is he demanding and insensitive? Sometimes. Is he a good-natured schlub like Sandler? Sometimes. In another movie this might be called complexity. In a movie like ""Click,"" populated with types instead of characters, it's uncertainty.<br/><br/>Sandler, too, isn't entirely believable as an architect. His character must have gone to the Mike Brady school of architecture. In this age in which computer-aided drafting has become standard, Sandler is shown using ruler and pencil. Maybe 20 years ago. The movie doesn't know enough about architects to portray one. Architect like advertising executive or magazine editor, has become(or maybe always was) one of those all-purpose movie-jobs.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Click"" is like the similarly high-concept, hi-jincks-ensue movie as ""50 First Dates"" with fewer laughs and lacking an actress game enough for the material."

Nobody in the theater was really laughing at any of the jokes either, I laughed three times throughout the movie, thats it, i counted. I would have laughed at other things, but the only other funny parts were all in the trailers for the movie, so it was all expected, and I thought those parts were absolutely hilarious and laughed hard when I saw them as a preview, thats the reason that i really wanted to see this movie, i had no idea that the story line was so dramatic.<br/><br/>That was the point that i started to love the movie, when the story line became dramatic and stopped with the washed up humor. I REALLY loved this part of the movie. Everything from this point on was good, I adored the acting by everyone, especially from Adam Sandler, he did very nicely the rest of the movie.

Oh yeah.<br/><br/>There are moments when the crudeness is overdone (seriously, how many times can you show a dog humping a stuffed animal before you realize it stopped being funny about 40 minutes ago?) and apparently I'm one of the few people left in the world who doesn't think little kids cussing is adorable (yeah, I'm sure you'd giggle if it were YOUR child dropping ""s"" bombs), but the film still managed to coerce a good number of out-loud laughs from me.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna sit here and wax poetic about what I would do if I came across a remote that could control my life. That'd be a waste of my time and yours. However, I found it interesting to watch Sandler as he made his decisions in regard to this little technical wonder. I especially liked the menu and its special features - including a commentary track with James Earl Jones. Funny stuff.<br/><br/>Sandler movies, by their very nature, are quite easy to review. Do you hate the guy? Then skip it. If you love the majority of his work then you'll have a good time. However, I feel it's my duty to warn you that Click is a little different than what you might expect.<br/><br/>In an effort to show it ain't just a one-trick pony (and probably to appeal to a broader audience), Click takes a strange dramatic turn about 2/3rds of the way through, and it stays pretty serious for a good 20 minutes or so. Fan base be warned. The teenagers in the crowd started to get restless as they were obviously desperate for Sandler to hurry up and say something like, ""Gippity bop simmidy doo."" <br/><br/>References to It's a Wonderful Life are accurate, though I feel it taps more into A Christmas Carol complete with Christopher Walken as the Ghost of Really Bad Hairdos. Some of the dramatic aspects are handled well, albeit with little originality, but things got a little too solemn for my taste, especially since I was in the mood for something purely comedic. Much like the majority of people who give speeches at wedding receptions, it tries just a little too hard to wrestle out the tears. Sandler's attempt at crying is particularly unconvincing.<br/><br/>I'm sure there's a section of you who will ignore the predictability of it all and appreciate the fact that Sandler is trying to show a little maturity these days, and that's fine. I'm just pointing out that the transition in tone is awkward, and the drama overstays its welcome. Take some lessons from Liar Liar on how to add dramatic elements and life-changing revelations while remaining consistently funny.<br/><br/>The bottom line, America, is Click will have quite the mixed reaction, even among Sandler's staunchest fanboys. Can you handle the dramatic shift? Will you buy into it? Can you tolerate the sometimes juvenile and sophomoric humor on display? I've equipped you with the necessary knowledge; it's now up to you to make your choice.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention that Kate Beckinsale isn't too harsh on the eyes? Can't remember if I did or not so I wanted to make sure I pointed that out.<br/><br/>THE GIST <br/><br/>If you can't stand Adam Sandler then I have no idea why you'd wonder if you should see Click or not. If you're a fan of the Sand Man then chances are you'll be entertained, but reactions to the dramatic tone shift will be very mixed. Don't expect Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore."

Right before the movie started, I said to myself, ""This movie is going to be awesome since Adam Sandler plays the lead"" but after the same joke was shown in, literally, every other scene, I realized that this movie is boring, depressing, and not funny at all. <br/><br/>I had high expectations for this movie, since I have found other Adam Sandler movies to be funny, but this movie was unwatchable.

I thought it would be a fun and forget about it later movie. Well, it was definitely fun and lots of laughs were had by all. At the same time it was a very moving comedy movie. and I was reminded of ""Punch Drunk Love"" where Sandler did more that just what we expect is his usual comedic acting, he did that here. Just like that, he can play a dramatic role. There was also another side to ""Click"" as I said. It had heart. ""Click"" had a really good moral and life lesson. I actually saw this movie at a preview session and didn't have to buy a ticket, most times I see movies at previews I think ""Cool, glad it was free.

For those who love classic Adam Sandler-- there's plenty in this movie for you with Sandler's quick wit and fun one-liners. But for those more partial to Spanglish-serious Sandler, then that's here too. This film is quite versatile and it goes from being down-right hysterical to heartbreakingly sad to adorably sweet and funny again. Sandler was great, adorable and hilarious. Kate Beckinsale was her usually hot self and so incredibly charming in her role. Christopher Walken was classic Walken and quite funny and off-the-wall. And there were so many other characters in the movie that make it enjoyable from Henry Winkler's father role to David Hasselhoff's boss role to Rachel Dratch's secretary.<br/><br/>I have long been giving personal critiques of movies, and long reading and critiquing the words of movie critics but have never actually posted my own critique on IMDb. But with this film, I feel I must. So many are hammering this film, but you have to remember one thing. This is a Happy Madison, Adam Sandler film.

If you want to see a movie with a so called righteous moral in the end, a guy with all the powers in the world who learns the lessons from it, go see 'Bruce Almighty'. This is a bad copy.<br/><br/>Seriously, this is not more than a shameless copy. It is very, very predictable. The humor is seriously .. bad, just bad. It even has repetitive storyline, so you'll end up watching the same things two or three times in the same movie. As for the remote-thingy-concept: this is very very forced. The whole way he gets it is forced. The way he uses it is forced. Come on, they could have at least done better script-writing if they would spend millions of dollars on this flawed movie anyhow. I mean: he could press rewind any time in the movie.

This movie shows that Adam Sandler can act, for real! Anyway Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is having some problem with finding the right remote.. So he goes to a store to get a ""Universal remote"", he ends up with having a remote that controls his life. He can skip chapters in his life and fast forward some parts, and pause etc.. The control knows the exact parts he skipped, so the control plugs that in, in the ""memory"". The director; Frank Coraci makes this movie perfectly, just how I like it. The first hour; Comedy, then it's a little more dramatic.. I can't say so much about the end without spoiling it, but I can say this: SEE THE MOVIE!"

Most of what you see in the trailers is only at the beginning, but as the story progresses, you see what your life can be like if you put it on autopilot. Interesting, funny, even a little sad in parts, its a great family movie. One character in the mix, is played by Sean Astin, who I didn't expect to see. As he steals Michael Newman's wife, the story turns yet again, making Michael's family dislike him even more. You see what is going on in the future, which is where half the story takes place. His life is turning in the wrong direction, and the remote has taken control of his life. When he is fast forwarding, he is still living, but he has no emotions, so he hurts everyone he loves. This is a great movie for the whole family."

","I know the point of this movie was to illustrate family is more important than work. I agree with this philosophy. However, this movie kept beating a dead horse long after its heart stopped. It was completely obnoxious in its pursuit. I wouldn't recommend it to an enemy and I am rarely negative. I feel this movie could have demonstrated the importance of family, and how workaholics can end up losing so much without going over and over and over the same points. It just made for monotonous viewing how repeated the points and lessons were. Even though everyone in the storyline was aging, the lessons didn't change and the way the lessons were being taught didn't change. It was a very unimaginative and painful movie to watch, in my opinion."
"eagle63","2","3","7","12 January 2007"," Too much tastelessness
","This had several aspects that were of great concern - in particular the exposure of minors to bad language and sexual matters.<br/><br/>The first half of the film where minors were involved in such 'funny' scenes as a dog who has intimate relations with a stuffed duck, is particularly bad in this respect. This 'gag' gets played to death. As for that scene where Sandler breaks wind in Hasselhoff's face, there were no minors involved in that scene but it was still utterly tasteless. No warning about this stuff (other than some generic ones about medium coarse language, etc) exists on the video and if anyone picks this off the video or DVD shelf expecting something gentler and more Disneyesque , these scenes will shock the most.<br/><br/>The second half gets better when the tastelessness goes away. These scenes will be fast-forwarded over in this review in the interests of avoiding spoilers but they do show what happens when the fast-forward mechanism in the universal remote gets out of control. They almost atone for the ugliness of the first half. Almost.<br/><br/>Recommended for anyone who thinks that the repetitive playing of scenes involving a , well, lonely dog and a toy duck is hilarious, and that films like these represent the very pinnacle of freedom."

","""Click"" is a be-careful-what-you-wish-for comedy about a driven and harried, up-and-coming architect (Adam Sandler) who finds a unique and ""Twilight Zone""-inspired way to balance both work and family. On a trip to find a ""universal remote,"" he stumbles into a Bed, Bath and Beyond (one would love to know how much money BBB shelled out for this product placement par excellence) where he meets a strange man (who else but Christopher Walken?) who gives him a state-of-the-art remote that can single-handedly control not only all his electronic devices but his life as well. For Michael Newman soon discovers that, just by clicking buttons, he can freeze moments or fast forward through all those little unpleasantries that can make daily life so burdensome and onerous. The trouble begins, however, when the remote little takes control and starts racing Michael through his life at warp speed.<br/><br/>This is the kind of thing they used to toss off in a typical half-hour long episode of ""Bewitched"" or ""I Dream of Jeannie"" - minus, of course, all the cusswords, flatulence gags and dog-humping jokes with which the writers have seen fit to pad out the extra hour or so of screen time they need to fill. (Anyone who goes into ""Click"" thinking that this will be a family-friendly film is in for a very rude awakening). Then, after about an hour of repetitive, sitcom-level silliness, the film takes an abrupt turn into Capra-esquire sentimentality, of the you-never-know-what-you-have-until-you've-lost-it variety. Yet, although the writing at this point has all the consistency of a melted marshmallow, this still turns out to be the best part of the movie - which tells you a great deal about the quality of the rest of the film. It's odd, too, because for all its we-are-the-world mushy-headedness, the movie can't resist taking the usual egregious swipes at Arabs, gays and overweight people.<br/><br/>Sandler has done this sort of shtick so often in the past that he goes through the film virtually on auto-pilot. In addition to Walken, of course, the gifted supporting cast - which includes Kate Beckinsale, David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Sean Astin, and SNL's talented Rachel Dratch do what they can with the material and provide shining moments that help us get through the whole ordeal. But ""Click,"" on the whole, is mass-market movie-making done on a very low scale."

I actually cried more than once and not just for the usual reasons. Additionally, Sandler and Beckinsale surprisingly have amazing chemistry together and with their on screen 'children'/Sandler's on screen parents. It wasn't hard to buy them as a modern family who cares very deeply for one another, but is faced with the everyday craziness of living in the 21st century.

Gold, Jerry, Gold! So much fun could be had with the idea - it's a veritable goal mine. But it squanders it. Instead, the movie tries to hammer home a painfully obvious message, and ultimately fails at both comedy and drama (yes, it was trying to go for drama).<br/><br/>From the opening scenes, nothing about this movie really works. The dialogue is corny and forced, the acting is terrible, the plot is utterly pointless, and the characters are completely unbelievable. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments, but they are few and far between - not really the comedy I was expecting. Instead of exploiting the idea for laughs, the movie decides to grow a heart, and tack on unneeded, cheezy scenes of emotion that just don't fit. The moral of the movie is painfully clear, but I just didn't care. Instead of making me laugh, this movie made me retch.<br/><br/>There are a few times that some comedic genius slips through and stands out, but as a whole, this movie was downright silly. The entire last 45 minutes was horribly done, and were not needed at all - it just stretched the movie on and on. If they had stuck to straight comedy, this would have been at least a decent attempt, but as it stands now, it's just a crappy movie."

It changed from a funny childish movie of a man controlling the universe, to a drama (which wasn't even that well done) about a man who didn't live his life.

The first two thirds of the movie are very funny and the pace is excellent. Beckinsale is great as his wife, as is Morty, the Bed, Bath and Beyond employee who gives him the universal remote control. Plenty of people are already talking about Hasselhoff's role as Sandler's boss, but the supporting role I found even better was played by Sean Astin, as the swim coach of Michael's son. There are plenty of great one-liners at his expense and he provides some good comic relief later on in the film. Another great supporting part is Monaghan as the snotty, spoiled kid next door. He torments Sandler constantly and Sandler fires right back, providing for some very funny scenes.<br/><br/>I was wondering how they planned on keeping it funny for two hours, and this was the only thing that didn't happen. The first half of the movie is very funny, but then it gets into the life lesson part of the movie as the remote control starts fast forwarding on its own, and Sandler is left with gaps in his life. Each time it fast forwards, another part of his life is gone, and he is sadder for it.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is essentially a modern retelling of either Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or Dicken's ""Scrooge"", as the main character learns a lesson on his priorities and how they affect his life.

","Adam Sandler like to have reoccurring themes of family and fathers in his movies. He also creates his own toilet-humour and acts very childish in much of his movies. Ergo, anybody that does not like Adam Sandler may not like this movie because his humour and immaturity does not change in this. However, it is decreased and not as bad as one of his previous films like Billy Madison. This is an Adam Sandler creation and he makes this movie with the only kind of humour and themes he knows.<br/><br/>In Big Daddy, the main theme was the importance of fatherhood. 50 First Dates was love no matter what. Click's is that life is too short. The theme of life being too short has not been done very much which makes it very fresh and original. It is also a very important life lesson that often goes ignored and is not talked about as much as money not buying everything. Even Sandler haters must give credit where credit is due and admit Click had a really good theme. Though there is just one major theme, it is still enough to handle.<br/><br/>Sandler plays architect, Michael Newman, who's wife (Beckinsale) and kids are happy, but he is not. He is a workaholic who can't stand up to his boss (Hasselhoff) and aspires to one day be head of the company so he can work less and his family can be filthy rich. He meets mysterious Morty (Walken) who gives him a universal remote control that can control his life. At first, Michael uses it in funny and helpful ways. After he abuses its powers, the remote programs itself automatically skipping various stages in his life. Just seeing how far the remote takes him by itself is heartrending and you really feel for Michael. The older Michael gets, the more of a huge and self-centred architect head he becomes, causing his family to push away from him. That shows the importance of family theme, which is done better than Sandler's other flicks because this is done a lot more serious. Michael eventually skips to the point where he is on his deathbed and asks Morty ""why did you make me waste my entire life?"" Although he is not that old and skipped about 20 years, it really does feel like he wasted his whole life. When it seems like it is the end for Michael, it is enough to literally make you cry. No other Sandler comedy features acting or filming, or anything like that this good. <br/><br/>Sandler does keep his humour, but adds a more serious and heartrending tone to it's lessons, making it his best movie."

","One of the worst films I have ever seen. I ask myself how I can still find myself actually watching one more Adam Sandler film. This film is one more in a long history of idiotic, empty, Hollywood-Churned-Out garbage that seems to let through the veracity of how the single purpose of making an Adam Sandler film is to encourage imbecility on the population that is dumb enough to still keep on paying to be reduced to no more than rubbish- consuming morons. Adam Sandler keeps his long tradition of pictorically promoting ignorance and stupidity as something worthy of remark and admiration by the already stupified masses. Simple plot, simple actor. Overall, too simple a film... Hope Hollywood made a good profit from this piece of excrement!"

","Although I have been disappointed by all Sandler movies I have seen until now - except maybe for Punch Drunk Love - and I have seen almost all of them, unfortunately, I made the mistake of wasting my time watching most of this horrible waste of film. I fast-forwarded the latter half of the picture, because it was unbearable. It is not funny, on the contrary, it is very disturbing (what's up with all the humping dogs and Kate Beckinsale being turned on by that? Or all the other sexual allures?) and, in fact, the script would not have been accepted even at a non-paying online magazine. It is a no-no to undo the plot by revealing that it was a dream. I really cannot understand how it was possible to make SUCH a bad movie. It is seriously a serious contender for worst motion picture of all time!"

"jgibbon08","7","2","4","13 February 2008"," A funny and touching crowd pleaser
","At this point in his career, Adam Sandler has proved to the American audience that he can star in films without his character being mentally challenged or handicapped in some way, as in Little Nicky or The Waterboy. Had this been realized earlier, we may not have been subjected to those flaming bags of trash.<br/><br/>But 'Click' is quite possibly the most pleasant surprise of 2006. The premise is not particularly inspiring. Sandler is Michael, a hard-working man who is trying to get promoted to a partner position in his architectural company. This is much to the dismay of his wife (Kate Beckinsale) and his two children, who believe Michael no longer have time for them. In search of a universal remote control for his TV, stereo, fan, etc., Michael wanders into the 'Beyond' section of a Bed, Bath, and Beyond store. He finds Morty, played by the always entertaining Christopher Walken, who gives him a universal remote control. After taking it home, Michael soon discovers that it is literally a 'universal' remote control. He can pause moments in his life, fast forward through the fights and work, and relive past memories.<br/><br/>With this premise in mind, most people would surely think this film will be funny occasionally, but in the end it will be predictable and sappy, and lessons will be forced on us that we've already heard a million times before. 'Click' is often very funny, even hilarious. But the last thing 'Click' should be referred to is predictable.<br/><br/>'Click' often bounces back and forth between funny and moving, which is not always a bad thing. In this case, it creates a very good balance that will keep you entertained for the duration of the film. It is sure to tickle your senses the way 'It's A Wonderful Life' did, the film 'Click' is loosely based off of. Being touched by an Adam Sandler film is a brand new experience, but nevertheless, it is more than welcome."

Sandler, of course,was fine, Beckinsale a nice addition, but adding in the grand old actor Henry Winkler, coupled with the comic visage of Hasselhoff.Walken provided the perfect eeriness and instability, as he has in many of his previous films (e.g. Stepford Wives). Finally, the talent of 'Marge Simpson', Julie Kavner and the insanity of Jennifer Coolidge, it proves and will prove to be one of Sandler's greatest films.

It's like watching a funny comedy, then it goes to a serious but nice drama, then it goes back to typical Sandler comedy. I liked it this way. This film is about a man who gets a remote from a wacko working in the Beyond section in Bed, Bath, Beyond store. He uses the remote for his pleasure, but deadly consequences soon begin to appear. The script was written well and it surprises me because the the script is based on a joke. Amazing! I was laughing through the movie. The ""dog-humping"" thing was really funny. The acting was great.

"saarvardi","10","2","4","6 July 2007"," When the usual Sandler light-weighted fare is mixed up with this brilliant premise, there's no boundary for the mere amount of possibilities that unfold
","I'll start out by stating the obvious (well, it will become obvious after you read my review): I am a die hard Adam Sandler fan. It's not that he's a versatile actor (he basically plays himself over and over again) or that he's the most charismatic fellow you'll meet on screen (in fact, you'll usually find him angry and/or upset, stuttering some foul language to himself). However, Sandler does portray the everyman persona in a convincing manner; and does so with a great sense of humor and own unique charm. If you read my Anger Management review, you'll probably put 1&1 together and realize that whatever this man does, I'll love it  and rightfully so.<br/><br/>Obviously, things got even easier to relate with when Sandler ventured into my own favorite sub-genre  witty fantasy-science fiction cinematic fair. Venturing even closer, Sandler re-invented the sub-sub genre of ""What if?"" sci-fi in Click, a comedy where he again plays the everyman who becomes frustrated with his life. Aha! But what if this working man, who also has two demanding kids and a neglected feeling wife, should find a universal remote control that remote controlled his life? What if he purchased this device from well to fast forward his argues with the Mrs., see ""behind the scenes"" from when his parents conceived him and put his irritating barking dog on ""mute""? And  what if all this fooling around with the present will have some unexpected and vast influences on the future? <br/><br/>When the usual Sandler light-weighted fare is mixed up with this brilliant premise, there's no boundary for the mere amount of possibilities that unfold as the movie moves on  leaving the audience (that's you, by the way) feeling happy, sad and extremely satisfied. Add in living legend Chris Walken as the sinister salesman who sells Sandler the remote, Kate Beckinsale as the Mrs., and Sean Astin as the wife's alternate love interest  and you're in for a riot."

","I knew it'd be good, but I didn't know it'd be this good. I loved the movie. It was excellent, one of my favorite movies. Click was a movie that taught you must respect your life and the people around you, and if you want something, you have to work up to it. It was a hilarious movie, but I was surprised by how much unhappiness there was too. The movie was about Michael Newman, who walks into ""Bath and Beyond,"" looking for a universal remote 'to make life simpler.' As he lays onto a bed, he notices a door leading to what is labeled ""Beyond."" He walks in and sees and asks the man who is alone in this dark room with all types of stuff in there, and asks for a remote. The man introduces him to the remote, letting him know that it is not returnable. Soon, Michael Newman realizes that the remote is able to pause, fast forward, and rewind the people and things in his life. Unfortunately, the remote sets itself to remember what he has fast forwarded, and every time something he fast forwarded for is done, for example his job promotion, it would once again be fast forwarded. And each time anything is fast forwarded, Michael does not know what happens, and he is in a plain boring mood to not pay attention. The problem brings depression, and he tries to find a way to fix it. I cried, I laughed. It was wonderful."

I can say the story is new and amazing and kept me following it up till the end. Wow excellent work from the whole cast specially Adam Sandler.

","Well, from the start this proved to be one of the best movies ever. It has class, a great story line and great actors. Adam Sandler for one has always been big and as soon as you hear he is acting the main part in this movie it gets you more interested. The story goes deep into a relationship (between the wife and Adam Sandler) and also outside the relationship stories. Adam Sandler starts to enjoy life when he gets this remote but as the movie continues it turns out bad things will happen. The movie is comedy and clearly states that but as the movie goes on the bad things happen. He starts to skip huge amounts of time meaning he can't control himself during this time. By the near end he has divorced from his wife and he is old, his children have grown up and finally he realises he has screwed up his life. Luckily some light appears though and the crazy guy that gave him the remote takes him back in time to just before he brought the remote and he continues his life remembering what wrecked it in the first place. A very happy ending. This movie is great for the whole family and is funny throughout, never has a dull moment. Overall perfect for a family film... or for anyone."
"postmanwhoalwaysringstwice","4","2","4","20 November 2006"," Capra must be spinning in his grave by now!
","With ""Click"" Adam Sandler taints the great name of classic film director Frank Capra once again. Sandler had previously done havoc upon the 1936 screwball comedy ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" with his 2002 release ""Mr. Deeds"", and now he's set his sights on that perennial Christmas favorite and all-around stellar 1946 film ""It's a Wonderful Life"".<br/><br/>Although Sandler portrays sad saps with aplomb, he hardly presents the Everyman in the fashion of a Gary Cooper or a James Stewart. His three degrees of facial changes and seven variations of gesticulating visible in this film, and much of his repertoire, prove that his stand-out work in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" was a false alarm, and solely due to fine writing.<br/><br/>""Click"" tells the all too familiar story of a workaholic dad who has become so wrapped up in his work that he has no time for his home life. This set-up is so prevalent that the first fifteen minutes are a major challenge to wade through. So Dad wishes for a cure-all to drop down from the heavens. Wasn't this storyline beaten to death ten years ago with ""Multiplicity""? Well, our hero soon finds himself in the Beyond Section of a Bed, Bath, & Beyond looking straight in the face of the solution to his woes.<br/><br/>It comes as no surprise that ""Click"" was written by the scribes behind ""Bruce Almighty"", when the answer comes in the form of a universal remote control that literally controls the universe. It was sort of fun watching traffic separate in ""Bruce"" and it's sort of neat to see our character's life on pause in this flick, but how many times do we see the same basic thing before the remote becomes the most interesting character in the film? How long before the movie's structure becomes little more than two hours of flipping channels?<br/><br/>""Click"" is sort of cute, and sort of clever, but it's getting tiresome to watch Adam Sandler continue to age within the midst of an endless slew of potty jokes and other juvenile humor, while the music cues of his films may suggest a more sentimental moment. When will audiences realize his irrelevance?<br/><br/>Nonetheless, in amongst the rubble that becomes of the good intentions behind ""Click"" are standout moments by the always dependable Christopher Walken, in a role one might suspect is merely Walken before his morning coffee, and Julie Kavner, taking some time from ""The Simpsons"", brings the goods with a limited but charming performance as the protagonist's mother.<br/><br/>These are the exceptions, though. Mostly our cardboard characters are more like the wife Kate Beckinsale plays. Didn't the ""Underworld"" series bring her beyond this crap yet?<br/><br/>C'Mon, change the channel."

The real disappointment for me was all the needless profanity, especially from the kids. The crude bathroom humor was unnecessary and only detracted from what could have been one of those deeply moving ""It's a Wonderful Life"" movies. If one can overlook all the stinking bits of garbage that are constantly flung at the audience throughout this film, then one can still appreciate the positive, ""do the right thing"" message.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken's character Morty was perfectly quirky, and was not comically over the top, as many of the supporting roles were played.

This follows the pattern of his movies, but I just wish he would take the high road and let us see what he can do. It's the difference between a quality George Carlin routine and Cheech and Chong. I mean come on, dogs humped stuffed animals all the way through the movie, and farting in someone's face when they can't do anything about it is 3rd grade.

","I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan, no matter his role, but this movie was not one of my favorites, strictly because of the unoriginal premise, borrowed from Back to the Future & It's a Wonderful Life. Unlike those notable titles, Click DRAGGED, from the first set, all the way up until the end of the second act. The second act picks up a little bit in pace, but it's over cluttered with hit and miss jokes, with terrible acting by the usual Sandler supportive cast. The need for someone like Christopher Walken was highly unnecessary, and somewhat insulting to someone of his stature. The third act for me, was the most enjoyable, and impactful of the whole film. It was still a little dragged out, but it packed a lot more emotion, and heart, rather than the aimless jokes, and stupidity, like the first two acts had. The acting somehow got a few steps better, to where I'd be lying if I said I didn't shed a tear.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie lacked a personality. With the crew behind the camera, that all worked on Bruce Almighty together, I would've expected something a little more impactful."

","The first thing that stood out was during the opening credits this film claimed to be a 'Happy Madison Original'. Honestly, no, it really wasn't an original. In fact, this film reminded me a lot of the Jim Carry movie Bruce Almighty. Come to think of it, there seems to be something similar between Jim Carry and Adam Sandler which sort of made me realise that this movie had very little difference between the two. Okay, as comedians they pretty much have their own style, and Carey certainly does seem to have a lot more diversity in his skills than does Sandler, but I guess since both of them have a sort of uniqueness about them, and that they are able to carry their own movies, is probably why I didn't consider this film to be all that original.<br/><br/>So, the film has Sandler as this high flying architect that is climbing the corporate ladder, but also is having a lot of difficulty juggling his aspirations for work with his family life. He is then given an opportunity to have a bit of a helper in the form of a universal remote control that allows him to have greater influence over the world. However, as one can expect, with great power comes great responsibility, and while at first it seems that this device gives him an edge, this edge ends ups being a rather nasty blade that pretty much ends up ruining his life.<br/><br/>Yeah, as I suggested, there is pretty much nothing original about this film, and in fact while the idea of a universal remote control for your life might be new, the concept of gaining some extraordinary power to make your life easier, only to discover that with the benefits comes some rather nasty consequences, isn't really all that new. As such, I have to say that I found this film to actually be rather boring.<br/><br/>The other thing that annoyed me about the film was that it was running on this theme of family verses career advancement, and the suggestion that one should not sacrifice family for career. Yeah, that's true, if it wasn't for the fact that it can be pretty hard for somebody to be able to hold down a good job, and have enough time to spend with their family. In fact, there are these stories of politicians retiring to spend more time with their family, but the reality is that for many people this really isn't an option. In fact, the need to keep paying bills, and mortgages, as well as having decent healthcare, and providing one's kids with a good education, is actually pretty costly, especially in the United States.<br/><br/>I guess this is what gets me with these films, in that they really don't understand the life of normal people, and we are talking about the middle class here, not the working classes, or even the service orientated classes. Honestly, it really gets me how Hollywood really seems to have this absolute disconnect with the lives of the ordinary working people in America, or even in other countries as well. Sure, there is the fact that this film was released in 2006, before the world drastically changed after the global financial crisis, but the middle class was still struggling back then, and it has only got worse. Yeah, it might be a good thing to say that one shouldn't sacrifice their family for their career, but unfortunately, in the real world, many simply just don't have that option."

","PROS:The premise of the film is very original and interesting. It's about a man who finds a remote control which can make all his anxieties and struggles to disappear. Michael Newman (Sandler) uses the remote control to avoid daily irritations such as the the morning bath and bottleneck, even the arguments with his wife. In the end, however, he understands that the most essential priority in his life is his family and he should take advantage every moment of happiness with them instead of being a workaholic maniac. The movie manages to set very clearly the rules of the remote and immerse you to a goofy but funny adventure. Adam Sadler is a comedic gold when he wants to be and David Hasselhoff and Christopher Walken give cool comedic vibes.
CONS:As the film progresses, it becomes more dramatic and depressing, something that doesn't match with its light nature. Many jokes are the stereotypical ones that are included in every Sadler's comedy (a dog ''playing'' with a duck toy?) and others are dated like the sexual harassment seminar and the sexual innuendos from Sadler's character towards his daughter. Furthermore, the CGI in Henry Winkler's face looks awful."

","Click is odd, you've got some really hard scenes to get through mixed in with moments that I thought were pretty good. The first half is awful, with comedy that made me cringe hard. After he starts fast forwarding through his life it gets more bearable. However, the moments where comedy was tried fell flat on its face. The ending was good, and I guess I never felt ""bored"".<br/><br/>Not the worst movie to sit through, but far more enjoyable movies."
"coasterdude44","7","0","0","13 December 2019"," Adam Sandler's most emotional movie
","I'll always remember this movie. This was a real shock to my senses when I saw Click for the first time. What i thought was just another Adam Sandler comedy film, I realised that this film wasn't going to be like his previous films, with that classic comedy that Adam Sandler fans love, this movie starts like most Sandler films start. Michael is a family man who feels like he's never there for them, he is a workaholic who becomes to caught up his job to realise that his family needs his support when it's needed most, he can't work the technology in his house, he hates his mother in law with a passion, and worst of all his kids think he's a bit of a pushover.<br/><br/>Things change when he meets a mysterious man played by Christopher Walken who gives Michael a universal remote which should be able to solve all his problems in his life. Things start out funny at first with gag after gag showing his folly as he is given control over the things that bother him the most. The film is very inventive with how the comedy is played in every situation where Michael's desicions become worse and worse. The comedy begins to die down however halfway through the movie when he realises his choices with the remote has caused his life to become so bad that the film now becomes a tragedy. His life now becomes a sad tale of regret, failing health and his life falling apart around him as he desperatley tries to undo all the mistakes he has made.<br/><br/>It becomes so sad at the end of the movie where Michael is lying in a hospital bed with music and cinematography choices and music so depressing that it makes you wish that you will never become like this character. I always cry at the end of this movie of just how much of a tragedy it really is about Michael's horrible life choices. But of course he is given a second chance in the end to live his life the way he wanted.<br/><br/>It really is a great acting acheivement for Adam Sandler and all the actors involved who put on good performances, the kids did a great job too. It was refreshing to see Adam Sandler put on a very different performance in this blend of comedy and tragedy and is always entertaining to watch. I highly reccomend it"
"edwardmenard-54334","Null","0","0","12 December 2019"," Funny, crude and tear-jerkingly emotional
","Click is funny, over the top in places and even cringy- all things expectant of an Adam Sandler film. It is also heartwarming, tear inducing and thought provoking. Click is flawed but, on balance, it works. It accomplishes what it sets out to do: tell an occasionally amusing, occasionally affecting drama about how adults often lose sight of what matters. There's no subtlety in the approach, but there wasn't any in either A Christmas Carol or It's a Wonderful Life, either. Click works because Sandler doesn't throw out the drama in a quest for laughs. There are times when the comedian falls back on his typical shtick, but the film doesn't shy away from the darkness inherent in this kind of story, and it has a heart. Sandler is Scrooge in the last act of A Christmas Carol and George Bailey in the last act of It's a Wonderful Life, and he does justice to those who have preceded him down this path. This is a great watch."

Jack and Jill. Click however is actually very funny. Here Adam plays Micheal a workaholic father who focuses more on work than his wife played by Kate Beckinsale. When he stumbles across a mysterious room where an eccentric scientist played by Christopher Walker gives him a magic remote control that controls Michael's life it soon takes a toll on his life.

"mohit_sinsniwal","7","0","0","26 May 2019"," Surprisingly good
","What a pleasant surprise ""Click"" turned out to be! Based on the trailer, one can assume that Adam Sandler, playing Michael Newman in his latest movie, has made a movie that is just like Adam Sandler's last movie... and Adam Sandler's movie before that... and the one before that... i.e., the comedy at which you groan, shake your head, say ""what the..."", and yet can't help from laughing out loud. That's what you get in the first hour of this film. That hour is also as much as the trailer shows, and for good reason.<br/><br/>Director Frank Coraci, who also worked with Adam Sandler in directing The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer, makes excellent use of a technique that should be taken advantage of more often by more directors. He sets us up in the aforementioned first hour of the movie for laughs, and manages to do this quite a few times, and not just with the moments seen in the trailer like other comedies. And, based on one's presupposed knowledge of the typical Adam Sandler movie, one expects there to be a spiral out of control for Michael, a realization of the ""right thing to do"" and everything to end happily with a monologue and one final punchline, all while remaining light-hearted and humorous. However, having this expectation makes the power and the drama of the movie's second hour so much more heartfelt and emotional. This drama never comes off as forced or unnecessary, because the pacing of the transition between the two utterly different tempos is perfect. Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe, the co-writers of this movie, used a similar technique in ""Bruce Almighty"", and it worked very effectively there, as well.<br/><br/>There's not much to be said about the ending without the possibility of spoiling it for someone, but suffice to say it accomplishes what it needs to accomplish without making you feel like you've just been cheated.<br/><br/>Far and away the best movie I've seen all year; likely one of the best I have or will seen for many, many years. There's so much more to see in this movie than what the trailer offers. See it... you won't regret it."

It's not an original premise but they handle it in a cool way. The first act is devoted to gags based on the numerous functions of the thing.<br/><br/>But later it becomes what my dad called a sort of reverse ""it's a wonderful life"" where he is shown the direction of where his life is going and how he doesn't have good prioritise.

And with a ridiculous premise that somehow manages to work itself out so realistically, it simply is a marvel. The jokes in this movie, though simplistic, kept me watching through the movie. With the family issues and the problematic mindset, the movie really makes you think about how you perceive life. After seeing this film I really changed my point of view and feel as though I am living to the fullest. You may think this to be an exaggeration, but nothing has changed my heart as Click has.

"DVR_Brale","9","0","0","7 July 2017"," Profound and entertaining
","Rarely do I see a comedy which becomes better and better towards the end. Click is one of those rare movie since it puts a lot of emphasis on the moral of the story. Somewhere halfway through the movie director decided to make a cut and alongside comedy elements include existential motives and he's done that pretty well. Rarely you see a movie which combines deep questions and pure comedy because you need an inspiring and original screenplay to achieve that.<br/><br/>Michael Newman, a workaholic architect, gets his hands on a remote which allows him to fast forward any part of his life he wishes to. He usually puts work over family and has to make certain compromises. Now he doesn't have to hustle anymore. As the movie proceeds we start to see how badly things turn out for him. Not because of circumstances which are out of his control but because of decisions he alone and only he had made. Placing emphasis on that dimension is what makes this movie surprisingly good. That approach is surely going to make you question, at least for a moment, what are your life's priorities and how is you life going to eventually end if you keep making the same decisions.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is everything you expect him to be. It's refreshing to see Kate Beckisnale playing a wife and a mother. It think she's the major reason for charm this movie has. Cristopher Walken plays Morty; I'd call him 'angel the scientist'. You can also see young Jonah Hill before he became this famous! This crew definitely managed to create charming and relaxed atmosphere. <br/><br/>Let me conclude: if you're only looking for a good laugh, you'll find it here. If you're looking for a motivation and a strong personal message, you'll find it here as well. Don't miss getting a good laugh and lesson at the same time!<br/><br/>P.S. I'd strongly recommend seeing The Family Man (2000) starring Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni if you want to see a similar movie. It's as good as it gets."

","First off, I know I'm very late in watching this movie, being 2014 and all, but I finally decided to give Click a chance, and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>Now, it wasn't the most perfect movie of all, not by a long shot, but being perfect isn't the reason I'd given this movie 9 stars. The comedy of this movie is lacking, and in all honesty I barely let out a chuckle. The originality of the movie wasn't as obvious as it could have been. After reading a lot of other reviews, I found that people didn't enjoy the movie so much due to it being a repeat of a number of movies from past years, but that's the day and age we live in. Original ideas are difficult to come by. Every can be compared to other movies. It's how the stories are portrayed, and that's where this movie shines for me.<br/><br/>So this story is the stereotypical workaholic neglects his family and bad things happen because of it. He addition of a remote control that affects his entire universe isn't the best of ideas, but worked with the whole idea of realising the error of his ways and his redemption afterward. The scenes in the move that demanded emotion from the actors really worked well, except for Katie Cassidy, she was far too cold for my liking. The scene in which he rewinds time to see the last time he interacted with his father turned me into an emotional wreck, as well as the scene when he's dying outside of the hospital. <br/><br/>This movie will not be for everyone, and most will probably feel let down. But if you can accept the crappy jokes and the ""rip off"" story lines, then you will find that this movie is full of emotional, heart breaking moments that most people will over look. Give this movie a chance, it could change how you see the people in your life."

","This movie isn't sure what it wants to be.

All the trailers painted this movie as a big ""What If"" scenario played up for laughs, so I didn't see it when it first came out. It looked a little too stupid and nonsensical. But, there comes a time when your so bored, and no one is around to witness it, that you will give the stupid and nonsensical a try.<br/><br/>So I walked in, I saw all the bits from the trailers, and then the movie suddenly became ""It's A Wonderful Life"", only protagonist Michael Newman (it's Adam Sandler; like, the same Adam Sandler we got with every early 2000s Happy Madison movie) is stuck in this brave new world that he sacrificed his entire life for with no hope of ever turning it back.<br/><br/>My one complaint about the movie is that the ending is a bit of a cop-out, but they patch it up pretty well thanks to a few heartfelt words from Christopher Walken.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, I was pretty surprised when this movie went from being an okay Adam Sandler comedy to a tearful message not to let your life go by; to live in every moment of it; that it's an expression of joy, and that if you take it seriously, you're gonna lose.

It was refreshing to watch.<br/><br/>The humour was a little darker than usual and some of the script felt like it was taken from Adam Sandler's real life. I could be reading into it too much but I wonder if he was feeling the pressures of work, wife and kids. It was entertaining nonetheless. <br/><br/>Overall not too bad.

"vornado11","3","0","0","24 September 2013"," Great Concept. Sadly, It's An Adam Sandler Movie...
","Think of this: A comedy about a workaholic father who's tired of his life and dealing with menial work who finds a time-bending remote that allows him to fast forward through the boring bits of life, but sadly gets out of hand quickly.<br/><br/>Are you kidding? That's a great idea! Get Jim Carrey, Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, or Tim Allen on the phone! We have a comedy that will be the best of the ye- Oh, you picked Adam Sandler... We're doomed.<br/><br/>For the three of you who don't know, Adam Sandler is a comedian from Saturday Night Live who has a number of talents, but has somehow managed to make hit after hit by using none of them. The Waterboy, Bedtime Stories, Jack & Jill, Grown-Ups 1&2, Just Go With It, etc., all horrendous pieces of crap that somehow make a killing at the box office... And yes, Click is one of them.<br/><br/>The story, like I said earlier, features Adam Sandler playing a workaholic father who's tired of routine and balancing work and a family(even though he's married to the hot Kate Beckinsale...) One night, Christopher Walken gives him a universal remote that controls not only his TV, but his life. He can focus on past events, slow down and pause time, change the color of his skin, and, most importantly in this movie, fast forward through the boring bits of life. This would have been a great movie, but, again, they had to choose Adam Sandler as producer and lead...<br/><br/>I hate Adam Sandler. He's a 47-year-old stuck in puberty. He's loud, he's perverted, he's obnoxious and in-your-face, and he thinks that saying ""boobies"" every other sentence is comedic gold. He's the guy responsible for keeping Rob Schneider in business and keeping other promising comedians(Dana Carvey anyone) out of business. And, of course, all his trademark ""hilarity"" shines in this movie.<br/><br/>The humor consists of a dog who has a fetish for a giant duck doll that's a prominent running gag, a potty-mouthed little kid who is constantly tortured by Adam Sandler(why do I see this as Adam Sandler trying to let off some childhood rage), and as much toilet humor, sexual content, swearing, and overall anti-jokes as a Friedberg & Seltzer movie. I cringed at every single attempt at a joke, which was about 30 a minute. Hey jackass! You need better humor than this!<br/><br/>However, the humor is probably there to poorly attempt to hide that fact that Adam Sandler CAN'T ACT! He's Jim Carrey if he only played Lloyd from Dumb and Dumber throughout his career. No flexibility, no attitude, no personality at all. His only two expressions seem to be rape-smile-with-your-mouth-open, or ""I just wandered on set and can't remember what I'm doing."" Oh, but sometimes he shouts like a guy with Tourettes Syndrome... because, yeah, that's funny, right?!<br/><br/>Now, with all that in mind, THIS MOVIE... does have some good stuff. The other actors(Beckinsale, Walken, Hasselhoff, even Winkler) do manage to put in a solid performance. The story, as I said before, is pretty good, as we can see Sandler's character's life as a kid and eventually as an old man, as well as the consequences for his actions. The movie has a great moral at the end that speaks to both adults and children, and you might even find some of the movie charming and heartwarming. ...Sadly, you have to sit through about 100 minutes of painful Sandler ""routine"" in order to see it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, and as I've stated repeatedly throughout this review, this movie is an interesting story that would have made a great, even landmark, comedy if in the right hands, but sadly had to be placed in the possession of Jerry Lewis' even less talented younger brother. Get a better lead and a better sense of humor and this movie would have been great. As it stands, I'd suggest skipping it unless you're a huge Sandler fan."

Cinematography: 2/2 how to bring a perfect blend of drama with fantasy not leaving the humor behind, this movie is a perfect example of it.<br/><br/>5.How much it satisfied its genre: 2/2 some will say comedy was less but to me asking for better than this would be demanding too much from the director.<br/><br/>So overall rating- 9<br/><br/>THANKS"

","I bought this movie form direct bargains, it was an elegant movie full of comedies form top to bottom. I have watched this movie with my wife and kids, it was such a moment full of laughter. My eldest daughter rosy enjoys adam's movie, so do i. I love to make collections of comedy movies and watch that often. I really enjoyed this movie many many thanks to Director Frank Coraci for directing such a great comedy.<br/><br/>Sandler was effective and really funny in his toned down approach to this more intelligent comedy than the usual Sandler fare. Kate Beckinsale is very lovable as the wife and mother of his children and Hasslehoff couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the cluelessly self-absorbed exec/ boss. I liked it a lot and i can proudly say that even the people who don't enjoy such movies had gone with craziest laughter all the time."
"iustinst","Null","0","0","6 January 2013"," Enjoyable movie with a good message
","I would like to start off by saying that, for me, ""Click"" was more than a comedy, it was a life lesson reminder. I am writing this review in order to put together what this movie has ""retaught"" me. Today's society keeps us busy, confronting us with all sorts of different things or problems. We tend to get too involved with them and it's a pity because, in the long run, they probably won't matter. In the meantime, we miss the important things in life.<br/><br/>The brain is the remote control's correspondent in real life. It can take you to the past, which you cannot change, it can stay with you in the present, which you must live, and it creates your future, with the help of your thoughts. What the movie tells us, is to stay focused on the present, more exactly, on the important things in the present. Be aware of what is happening around you. Try not to hurt the ones you love and all people in general, because if you do you'll regret it at one point and it might be too late. <br/><br/>Also, everything must be done at its time and things are not always what they seem to be. This fact was beautifully outlined with the help of the leprechaun ""who's always chasing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but when he gets there, it's just corn flakes"". Most of the time expectations exceed reality and we're left disappointed. Be careful when choosing the things after which you run in life. <br/><br/>I won't talk about the plot, because you probably know it and, if you don't, details can be easily found. In my opinion Adam Sandler and Christopher Walken were the main figures and they did a good job. The others had decent performances as well. ""Click"" has its share of funny scenes, but, for me, the best scene in the movie was the one near the end, where in a matter of seconds I went from shedding a few tears to smiling.<br/><br/>Conclusion: A good movie, definitely worth your time, especially if you agree with the points I've made above (7.5/10) <br/><br/>10/10 – for the message"

","Adam Sandler is one of those actors that people either really love or can't stand. His knack for playing surprisingly intelligent fools has won him a dedicated fan base. His movies were never meant to be high art, and so he did not take himself seriously, and made no apologies for it. In recent years, his characters have taken a subtle shift from likable, nitwit to everyman. This change signaled a shift in the type of movies he makes. His want for more substance results in a final product that is more mediocre than he perhaps intended. Which is not to say that this movie is bad. Sandler's Michael is likable. His love for his wife and children is apparent. He wants the absolute best for his family but he hates inconvenience, and so thinks that all of his problems would disappear if only he got promoted. Enter Morty, who gives him a special universal remote, which Michael uses to fast-forward through the difficult parts of his life. As a result,his marriage falls apart, his relationships with his son and daughter become tumultuous, and his health begins to deteriorate. Though he has money, nothing in his life is fulfilling. This culminates in an overdone climax wherein the melodrama factor is almost suffocating. Overall, the film is an average critique on the true way to happiness, hampered only by Sandler's overly clichéd execution."

","I've read many comments about the movie and I was shocked. I need someone for explanation of ""touching"", ""fun"" and ""original"". Scenerio is so cliché. Watch couple of Jim Carey movies and you will figure out what I am talking about. Actings are another issue to talk about. I don't remember I have watched these kind of bad acting in these days. I forgot to add. What's that drama thing? Guys I am so sorry but you can't have these bicycles anymore. What's that? These bicycles weren't even Mercedes. And how much money he could have spent on those bicycles? As I see they tried to make a comedy but when they felt something went wrong, they add some drama thing. I think this drama part is fun. Kids your dad didn't get promoted and we have to give these bicycles back to get the money. I'd like to talk to producer about these bicycles can transform like Transformers. And finally the plot. I'm not surprised. I watched this plot many times. And as I said in the movie of Jim Carey,Liar Liar, has the same situation. Dad got some work to do and kids have some expectation off him. But he is so busy that he can't watch even his kid's competition. Ughh! I don't know Ben Stiller watched this movie yet but he can make an absurd comedy from this Komady. Don't waste your time to watch this garbage!"
"ElMaruecan82","7","0","0","8 April 2012"," ""Eject"" your preconceived ideas about Sandler and ""Open"" your heart ...
","""Click"" is a film made with no other purpose than demonstrating the following statement: ""Family comes before work, before everything for that matter"" and whether the film features the typical raunchy jokes of Adam Sandler's movies or feels like a rip-off of ""Back to the Future"" and Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is almost secondary when you realize at the very end that you're almost convinced about the importance of Family, and not without a fair amount of good jokes, so as a nice little Family film, ""Click"" delivers its premise.<br/><br/>Now, did we need to be taught that lesson from a film? Did we need another example of a workaholic father who forgets to see his little guy playing his game (it could have as well been the cute little daughter playing the lobster/duck/singing flower in the school play) and jeopardize the harmony of his marriage and family life? Maybe not, but who ever said that all the movies had to bring something new on the screen? And who ever said that being new was a defining element of greatness? Yes, ""Click"" does feature so many archetypal situations in the beginning that it's hard to be appreciated, and I guess many Sandler haters would have already changed the channel. But once you give ""Click"" the benefit of the doubt and let the film evolve until the pivotal moment where Michael Newman (yeah, I forgot to name the protagonist) gets the magical remote control from Morty, then it takes off from the ground of stereotypes to build its own bits of originality.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken plays Morty, with the perfect mix of craziness from the kind of character who comes from nowhere and the geeky outfit that makes him look like the hidden nephew of 'Doc' Emmet Brown. Who is Morty? Where does he come from? It doesn't matter since the core of the story is Michael's family life and his ability to use this remote control. On that level, the film would still inspire some suspicion, you would think that with a remote control, he would click on the pause button, increase the size of his wife's boobs (although I wouldn't change nothing on Kate Beckinsale, absolutely sublime in the film) or use it to play in a casino and have some great time. But ""Click"" never falls in these obvious traps although it allows to have some insights about Michael's menu of life, and some priceless moments involving his parents, played by two TV icons, Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner, totally convincing as the Newmans' grandparents. Other characters provide the necessary reservoir for Sandler's typical jokes, it works, with his boss, played with the towering over-the-top authority of David Hasselhoff, and sometimes, it's just 'meh', like with his assistant/secretary. But all in all, the most crucial use of the magical object will be to 'skip time'.<br/><br/>This notion of 'skipping', so convenient when you want to jump some scenes during a movie, is the plot device that would lead to Michael's nightmare. By skipping all the illnesses, all the arguments with his wife, and all the boring moments spent with his Family, kids and parents, Michael created an accidental automatism that was kept in the remote's memory. The mechanism is very complex and the movie doesn't have the same subtlety that allowed the script of ""Back to the Future"" to explain what the 'Flux Capacitor' was about with clarity, but we rapidly get the point, thanks to a clever editing. In a nutshell, just because Michael fast- forwarded one moment of intimacy with his wife, if he used the remote to go his next promotion, the remote would 'assume' that all the other sex moments would be fast- forwarded, all the sicknesses skipped, all the traffic jams and arguments too. As the remote gets more out of control, the jump in times gets bigger, and Michael quickly finds himself obese with obese kids, then old with a brilliant architect as a son and a daughter he finds sexy.<br/><br/>Then, the third act of the film takes one strange emotional turn, which might have disoriented both the fans and non-fans of Adam Sandler. In fact, it's already hinted in one of the first big jumps, one year ahead, when he learned that his kids wants to watch police/cop series instead of Dragons cartoons, and that his dog is dead. This part saddens us because we got attached to the dog too, despite his crazy habit that provided a cheap but irresistible joke. The worst is to come when incidentally, Michael learns from his son, the death of his father. This leads to a particularly heart-breaking moment, where Michael goes back to the last time he saw his father alive and kiss him goodbye, saying 'I love you'. If some people find this part emotionally manipulative, I respect that but I'm sure many others who endured or fear to endure the loss of a beloved figure could respond to that scene. The film falls in a kind of melodramatic exaggeration when Michael leaves the hospital after a seizure to give his son a last lesson about Family coming first, before dying, but the scene only works because of this exaggeration.<br/><br/>Indeed, the over-the-top melodrama provides the perfect contrast with the following scene when Michael wakes up from his nightmare, and if all that preceded doesn't hold a candle to the almighty ""It's a Wonderful Life"", the joy of Michael was absolutely communicative and I would have felt like the store kid when he played with him. The scene with his parents is the greatest emotional pay-off because we can see his father again, and we know we would have reacted exactly the same if we woke up from a dream where our beloved ones are dead. ""Click"" is highlighted by the last 10 minutes, and whether the film had some flaws, at least it conveys a positive and sensitive message about life."
"theinaniloquent","9","0","0","3 February 2012"," ""What if you had the universal remote... that controlled your universe?""
","A workaholic architect finds a universal remote that allows him to fast- forward and rewind to different parts of his life. Complications arise when the remote starts to overrule his choices.<br/><br/>I honestly like Adam Sandler. He's an average comedian who devotes his time bringing us some pretty funny comedies. I of course don't mean his comedies like Grown Ups or Don't Mess With the Zohan but MOSTLY everything he does is great. With Click, I expected another great comedy with a quite intriguing plot. With the movie beginning, the comedy wasn't doing it for me. We're introduced to tons and tons of toilet humor, stupid attempts at making us laugh, and even some questionable lines. Beforehand, I expected Happy Madison's basic routine. Starts up funny, slows down the humor, and ends it off with a slight cheesy ending. With Click, they did the same... but more. I'm going to start with the last thirty minutes of the film. This is exactly what made it for me, and mostly not the comedy aspect. The film's message is so clear from the beginning, and we're sprung into it pretty fast. The humor toys around with it for some time, but after he is fast-forwarded to the future, this is where the movie makes it. It clears out all the stupid attempts at humor beforehand and sets us in a real, moody environment. It's actually pretty depressing once you see it, but the profound meaning counts above all. The last scene with his father, the scene where he collapses in the street, and the scene where he feels is quite amazing. The reason what makes it so amazing is how they projected it so real. You actually feel for Adam in this movie, and I give him two thumbs way up for his stunning performance. Everybody else did a great job, and if you look beyond the stupid humor, you'll love it. I recommend for people that can look through things without looking back and complaining of how bad things WERE. If you can look at the good things, see this as the whole POINT, this is your movie. Click... 9/10."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","5","0","0","12 December 2011"," Click (2006)
","Click starts off as just another Adam Sandler comedy. He's angry, he has sudden outbursts to varying degrees of comedic success, and he's inexplicably involved with a very beautiful lady. After getting tired of his life he comes across Walken, weirding it up as some kind of inventor. Sandler is given a remote that can control his life. It's all fun and games at first. Using slow motion to stare at breasts, pausing Hasselhoff so Sandler can fart in his face, muting Jennifer Coolidge, and attempting to fast forward through foreplay. Then suddenly he's catapulted into the future, where he has cancer, his wife has left him, his father is dead and so on. Basically this is a film of two halves, both very different in tone, and it never gels. Like I said, it starts as a Sandler comedy, but towards the end it has delusions of grandeur as it reaches to be on the level of fantastic Capra movies. I liked the issue of not skipping the hard parts of life, as without them not much is left. This is something they really could have explored. Instead they bitched out and went for the viewer friendly ""Family is everything"" motto. I just hate that. Sandler works hard in this movie, he gives his family everything, and still gets no respect. He is always seen as the villain. Perhaps they should make a movie where he does put family first, only for his wife to still leave him and his kids grow up without any kind of support. They sure weren't complaining when he paid for the wedding. It's a mixed bag, as I was in a silly mood I was laughing a lot at the beginning, but the dramatic elements were overdone. I kind of admire Sandler for reaching out into new territory, but it has to coincide with the previous 50 minutes."
"Robert_duder","10","5","16","23 June 2006"," Absolutely stunning...a comedic, dramatic, touching achievement. A MUST SEE!!
","Click looked good from the minute I saw the first trailer. I had no idea how good it would turn out to be. To say that Adam Sandler's acting choices and films have matured is the understatement of the decade. We have seen a gradual progression of stupid, idiotic comedy (ie: Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore) to much more mature, intelligent, laugh out loud comedies (ie: The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy, and even Mr. Deeds.) Click is the epitome of what he has to offer. The jokes are good fun...it even manages to throw in the stupid humor that audiences seem to love, fart jokes, dog-sex jokes, ridiculous things and still manages to crank out this desperately sincere message that will literally bring tears to your eyes it is so heartfelt. It is easily comparable to A Christmas Carol or It's A Wonderful Life with a moral message about treasuring each and every moment with those you love. It is the feel good film of the year hands down, you will leave the theater with such a smile on your face and really be thinking about the message. I might even go so far as to say that this is the best film I have seen all year, definitely this summer so far.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler delivers his best performance to date period. He plays brilliant architect and workaholic Michael Newman who also has the best home life and doesn't even realize it. Beautiful wife, two great kids, a nice home, nice parents...everything. Sandler plays the ""Scrooge"" half of his character to a ""T"" He's an all around ass. He yells at his kids, fights with his wife, does everything he can to avoid anything that doesn't further his work. The film progresses his character at a perfect pace until he finally realizes what he's missing out on. By the time he's aging and dying he's missed everything that is truly important. If you don't have tears in your eyes as he lays in the rain on the street dying in his son's arms...you're made of stone. Kate Beckinsale is a beauty in this film. She plays Sandler's wife Donna Newman and as he points out in the film she really is out of his league and yet they make a great couple, even when they are at each other's throat. And they have a beautiful, real romance that transcends time and even divorce. Beckinsale plays off of Sandler's brilliant performance and supports him in every way and she does a good job herself playing the mother and wife all at once. She's a little subtle in most scenes but she is there and makes an impression. Irrepresible Christopher Walken plays mysterious Morty, the man behind the remote. He has done some brilliant comedy as of late (Blast From The Past, Wedding Crashers) and this is no exception. He has a style so unique and he automatically ups the ante of any cast. Him and Sandler play well together and he's perfect for the role. David Hasselhoff really leaves his campy acting behind him to take on a role where I think he really gives up the ego to make fun of himself. He plays Sandler's overbearing obnoxious boss who always ends up getting made fun of and some of the best scenes are with him being made to look like a fool but still he does a terrific job. This might really open doors for him in the comedy bits. I laughed to tears during the ""sexual harassment"" speech. Henry Winkler, Sean Astin, and Jennifer Coolidge plays great smaller roles that really do add to the script. Winkler plays Sandler's Dad and does a great job as such. Also definitely worth mentioning is the young actors that plays Sandler's kids. Joseph Castanon plays his son Ben at 7 and gets the most screen time out of the Ben character. He really does a terrific job playing opposite Sandler. Adorable Tatum McCann plays his daughter Samantha and does just as good a job especially when they are feeling the absence of their father in their lives.<br/><br/>Director Frank Coraci who also directed one of my Sandler favorites The Wedding Singer but also did Sandler's The Waterboy probably is getting to know his style pretty good. He definitely has a way with subtle comedy, a little darker than your average laugh out loud knee-slapper but has a very real style to his films. It's so hard to explain a movie that is genuinely funny, you'll be laughing out loud and at the same time such a moving and powerful movie with such a nice message. I admit that a lot of the funny scenes are definitely used up in the trailer but still funny to see. I also think I would have liked to have seen more of a wrap up in the end...seen him go to his boss and quit or do something. Nonetheless I haven't felt this good leaving the theater in MONTHS!! It is absolutely THEE movie to see right now, take your special somebody, your family, your kids (although there is a fair bit of bad language and sexual innuendos) I will watch Click again and again. AMAZING!! Happy 21st to my girl Sarah who I took to see Click and we both loved it!! Happy Birthday baby!! 10/10"

","This is a first for me, as I have been to our local cinema to see this, usually I review a film that is in my collection. Right, now for the film, I really enjoyed it, Imagine you could control things in your lives, smart eh! not really when you start fast forwarding your life, you find things happen that you do not want to happen, I found the film funny, and serious at the same time, The remote control, does have other good uses, such as turning the volume down on screaming children and barking dogs, The pause we saw, can be used for hitting someone and then walking away, later on we release the pause control, and OWWW! That hurt. It is also handy if I had it to stop speeding car drivers and To lock doors downstairs while I am on the internet or trying to watch something on telly. I found the actor that Played Micheal a good actor, and the special effects where I found very clever indeed, But Micheal should of listened to the shop keeper who gave him the remote, Also this film shows us, that we rely on remote controls more than ever now, it was also a surprise to me to see David Hasslehoff, I thought that kit the car would not be far off! but not this time, I also think that i would be frightened if I dreamt that dream, why did Micheal not use the back or rewind button ? also what would of happened if the remote had been fitted with an eject button, you could use that to eject someone off your favourite seat in your lounge, or to put the dog or cat outside! Also do not forget the OFF Button. is fitted to remotes. What would of happened if Micheal used that? that I would of liked to have seen."

","Okay, so yes, I can be a little cynical and very critical of movies, especially on important details. But there is no denying that this movie was a mesh of two sandlers, the goofy one (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore) and the serious one (Punch Drunk Love, Spanglish). I'm so mad at myself for thinking that this would be good, I always get suckered into his movies. I thought they should've stuck to a genre. The comedic relief was stale and the drama was just painful to watch, it was too unrealistic, and just pretty much all around bad acting. They took a seemingly good idea for a film and twisted into so many different plot angles that I got confused. Don't get me wrong, I like Adam Sandler. I like Christopher Walken, Kate Beckinsale, etc. But, I just think they could've sprung for a rewrite. Just one opinion."

The experiences and ""lessons"" he goes through really captivated me and kept me interested throughout the entire movie.

The plot was very simple, a man uses a remote control to control his universe, but his life starts to change once the remote control uses its memory to program itself to what it thinks are Michael's (Adam Sandler's) preferences. We knew that this was going to be interesting, but newest Adam Sandler movies are not as glorious as everyone provoked them to be.<br/><br/>I was pretty surprised by this movie however. As decently funny as it was, there was a lot of drama thrown in there also (especially towards the end). The dramatic scenes really showed how this movie was unlike the previous line of Happy Madison movies, so it will tend to stick out. The comedy was good but not as much as I would have liked; a few key lines stick out.

What I got was something much more and a movie I'll remember for a while.<br/><br/>Obviously you know the story by now; Sandler is a workaholic who wants the best for his family and kids... Christopher Walken gives him a remote (at his local Bed, Bath, and Beyond) and now Sandler can control time itself. Much to my surprise the movie had so much more to offer than that. Sandler showed that he can be taken seriously as his character ages and also showed that he can evoke emotion in the audience (I noticed several people in the theater crying during some of the later scenes.) The cast was amazing and the fact that the Fonz (yes... THE FONZ!) played his father was great.

","Going into this film I was pretty sure I'm in for an epic adventure with laughs, tears, memorable characters and a deep story that is going to be remembered and cherished for generations to come... Turns out I was thinking about the time I saw the final of the Lord of the Rings films. Unlike them, ""Click"" does not have incredible adventures or memorable characters, but it does have a story filled with emotional, heartwarming scenes that the average movie-goer would not in any way expect from a Happy Madison Production or Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>To my surprise, this movie delivered and it did that from the opening scene to the second the last shot of the movie fades out to provide us with names of the people involved in the production of it. I could not believe this, a modern comedy with such a seemingly dumb premise as a universal remote control that, well, controls your universe? Even once I saw the trailer (which does not do justice to this movie) I was still widely unconvinced even though it did have the funny man Sanlder in the lead role.<br/><br/>But boy did Sandler prove me along with everybody in the theatre wrong. The laughs kept coming and were received very well by the audience who would burst out in an uncontrollable, maniacal laugh every 5 or so minutes throughout the duration of the film. Not to say that the jokes were original to any degree, but they were classics made modern, which is something most people appreciated.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film the jokes died down, and set way for some tear-jerking moments. Don't get me wrong, I like to cry during movies in front of my friends as much as the next guy, but this one really did it. I was forcing back tears and that is something that even to me was hard to do. It was a nice break from the typical ""oh snap here comes someone we saw a while back in the movie and totally forgot about to save the day"" movie endings, and once again even though it wasn't a fresh idea it was done nicely and subtly, with quite a bit foreshadowing leading up to it throughout the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, while this movie might not change your life, it will give you a chance and reason to rethink it, and to me, that is one of the best things a motion picture can do."

But I just find it amazing that for as talented as Sandler is, Click boils down to TGTGW&E. I'm not a huge Sandler fan, but he has made some funny stuff. Happy Gilmore usually gets me in front of the TV when it's re-run, for instance. And I am a big fan of Walken, great, talented actor. BUT, like this if you want, I'm not knocking ANYONE who wants to see or enjoys Click, I'm just pointing out that Hollywood is doing some bad bottom barrel scraping here.

Some funny stuff in the cruelty dept, Hasselhoff continues to be a funny Icon of weirdness, but nah, not my cup of tea. Better effects than TGTGW&W, though."

","Hands-down the worst movie I've seen in years. It apparently was written BY 12-year old dim-witted boys FOR 12-year old dim-witted boys. Sets a new benchmark for crudity and lack of originality. Unless you like dogs going to the bathroom and getting romantic with stuffed animals; then this is your movie. A scene making fun of Arab customers was moronic and tasteless. The workaholic dad is totally unbelievable and lacks any depth whatsoever. Who would go out late at night to buy a remote when you have a deadline to meet? This movie also contains some of the most in-your-face product placement in recent memory. The only redeeming feature is an appearance by Christopher Walken, but it's not enough to recommend the movie. Avoid it like the plague."

","Click 'directed by Frank Coraci' has been one of the best movies that Adam Sandler has done so far (Besides 'Reign over me') but I really enjoyed how throughout the movie there were emotional moments as well as comedic. The whole movie came together great and never got boring. Adam Sandler show's a lot of talent in his acting and has seemed to have evolved but still has that great sense of humor that we all seem to relate to. This movie really makes you reflect on your life and how you spend your time with your family. I would give this movie an 8/10 and I recommend buying this movie on DVD. It would be money well spent. This movie would have to be in the top 3 comedy movies of 2006 with 'Borat' Starring Sacha Baron Cohen and directed by Larry Charles and the funny 'Thank you for smoking' starring Aaron Eckhart and directed by Jason Reitman. In conclusion I think that Click is one of the best movies of 2006 or if not the best comedy of 2006 and if you haven't already see this movie go buy or rent this movie for a great night in."
"boz75","9","2","5","19 February 2007"," Excellent Film - A must see in my opinion!
","I initially decided to watch this film with the assumption that it would be another average comedy film with some funny scenes here and there. However that assumption proved to be incorrect after I had finished watching it, because not only does it provide humour in a number of cases (which I personally found very funny), but the story within the film was very powerful and compelling in that it gives a man a look at his life the way it is heading. The fact that even with the best intentions at heart, he is neglecting his family life so much in favour of his job - that in the end will ruin his personal life to a point where he has nothing but his work -hurting and losing all those around him. The ending is very dramatic, which ends up in giving Adam Sandler ""a break"", so he can go back and do things all over again in a manner which he chooses. I loved every moment of this film including the humour and the story that it told and would recommend this to anyone! On a personal note I found Kate Beckinsale to be incredibly sexy, which if anything must give it bonus points lol!<br/><br/>A Moral from me To forget who you are at heart and give in to the demands of our professional or working lives is a very powerful lesson. I know it can be hard and we all do it - but just every once in a while this film has reminded me that we need to give ourselves a break, if yet only brief, that we remember who we are, what we love in life, our fondest memories, because unlike this film it is extremely unlikely that we will be given a 2nd chance in life to re-live our personal interests."

","I wanted to see this movie when it came out in theaters, but never actually had the chance.<br/><br/>Now, after watching in it on DVD, I feel touched, and sensing some deep emotional waves. This is not an average comedy. I first thought of it -after the trailer- that this is going to be one of the best comedies of the year. It came out splendidly... although some of the humor is a bit under-the-belt, the source of most laughs are great lines and practical jokes.<br/><br/>Unnoticeable at first, the tension starts to build up. After the first hour of the film, we start to feel very very uncomfortable. We ask ourselves: are we still watching what was promised? What is happening, what's this surmounting uneasiness? Rarely do I feel like this after watching a movie. The message of the film is crystal-clear, yet not straightforward...the movie lets you dive deep into the message and perceive all its possibilities.<br/><br/>Really funny comedy, serious drama.

"cherold","3","2","5","25 December 2006"," When you start thinking, hey, this isn't funny anymore, TURN IT OFF
","For the first half hour or so, Click is a very funny and charming movie. My initial reaction was, hmmm, why did this get bad reviews, it's that rarity; an Adam Sandler movie that is more about charm and fun than lowbrow jokes.<br/><br/>Perhaps a third of the way through though, shortly after Sandler gets the remote that is the movie's central gimmick, it just sort of stopped being funny. Jokes became increasingly low brow and mean-spirited, although hints of what was to come came early on, most notably in the mean-spirited delight the movie takes in Sandler's petty cruelties to an obnoxious neighbor kid.<br/><br/>By the last third, the movie dropped humor altogether in favor of bathos and treacly sentimentality as it hammered home its moral. The movie clearly wants to be Capraesque, but it fails to have noticed that Capra's films, even at their most serious and sentimental, would always toss in a few light touches.<br/><br/>The problem is not the premise, which is pretty good, or even the moral, which is a fair one and which comes naturally out of the premise. The problem is the film is just badly done.<br/><br/>Since a third of it is actually pretty funny, it might seem harsh to only give it 3 stars out of ten, but if a movie is going to be this awful I feel it shouldn't fool you into thinking it's good and then falling apart so completely. If I only judged the first third I'd give this a 7, but the second third deserves a 4 and the last third deserves a 2 if I'm feeling generous."

I don't know why, but to me, it seemed that they didn't get on very well. Christopher Walken, as usual, delivers, but he should have know better than to be involved with this.

","I'm an Adam Sandler fan in general and I expected nothing but a quality production in the movie ""Click"". I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed. ""Click"" triggered a lot more than just laughter. Click was a thought provoking piece that any working family man or woman can relate to. Many of us would love to fast-forward, rewind, or pause certain things in life, but what if it happened automatically? What if you were automatically fast-forwarded through all of the nuisances and stresses in your life: just how much would you miss? ""Click"" deals with just that, and of course Adam Sandler does it in comedic fashion. This is a decent movie with a good message, a movie everyone can learn from."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Most of Adam Sandler's films are goofy with no emotional content. Click changes that. Click may seem like a goofy comedy at the beginning, but the last half hour is really sad for an Adam Sandler film. The last half hour is even really sadder than most newer movies. There are two huge sad scenes in this film. Adam Sandler's character Michael Newman saying goodbye to his dad in the future, and Michael dying in the future.<br/><br/>A man named Michael Newman has a lot of work at work to do. He has a really busy work schedule. He can't spend enough time with his family. One day he goes to Bed, Bath, and Beyond. He goes into the Beyond section. In the Beyond section he meets a man named Morty. Morty gives him a remote that can rewind, fast-forward, pause, and even has a main menu. He has fun with it. Then he fast-forwards until he gets his promotion at work. One year later he gets it. Then it fast-forwards again until his next promotion. The remote is one memory, so it fast-forwards everything that he fast-forwarded through before. <br/><br/>Ten years go by. He is a gigantic fat guy, his son is fat, his daughter is wears small outfits, his wife divorced him, and she has a new man. Michael is knocked unconscious and the remote fast-forwards again. He is in a hospital and cancer was removed from him. He also had liposuction. Then the remote fast-forwards again. In the future, his father had died. He rewinds to the last time he saw him. His son is now skinny and Michael was mean to his father. Michael then finds out that Morty is the Angel of Death. Michael asks to be taken to a happy place.<br/><br/>That happy place is his son's wedding. Then Michael has a heart attack after his daughter calls her new father dad. He wakes up in a hospital. His son cancelled his honeymoon. His son and daughter are next to him. Then Michael realizes that his son is becoming obsessed with work like him. Michael rips off his oxygen tube and goes out in the rain to see his son. Michael dies in the street.<br/><br/>Then Michael wakes up in a bed in Bed, Bath, and Beyond. It was all a dream. He life is normal again. He goes to his house and finds the remote. He throws it away. Was it a dream, or did Morty give him a second chance?<br/><br/>Overall, I was amazed how sad this was.

Being sick of all the remotes (the remote for the TV, the light, the garage door) he goes to the shop to find the ""universal"" remote that can stop/play/fast forward anything.

"MichaelMargetis","5","2","5","1 October 2006"," ""I taste sh*t! Did someone put sh*t in my lunch? Stacy!"" - Ammer
","Far and away, the strangest film to be released this summer is 'Click'. That sounds really weird considering by the previews it looks like your typical Adam Sandler poopie/pee-pee/toot-toot joke filled comedy. Personally, if that were the case I'd probably enjoy 'Click' a hell of a lot more than I did. 'Click' begins giving you a fun/crazy feeling but when it's all over it leaves you feeling like you just ate eight bags of chocolate. Yuck! <br/><br/>The story is actually not too bad considering it's an Adam Sandler picture. A man is all work and no play so he can provide a nice home for his family. His family bitches and moans about it, and one day at 'Bed, Bath and Beyond' a eccentric employee played by none other than The Continental himself (Christopher Walken) gives Adam Sandler a Universal Remote that can pause/play/rewind/fast-forward his life. Adam Sandler thinks this is cool at first then learns a valuable lesson at the end. Now, the movie would be all *****s and giggles if the fun was more emphasized and the valuable lesson part was at a 2-minute maximum, but that isn't the case. <br/><br/>It seems as though ever since Paul Thomas Anderson's incredible 'Punch-Drunk Love' in which Sandler played an emotionally disturbed individual trying to find solace with an equally bizarre woman while being tracked down by a brutal Mormon run scam phone sex line, Sandler has been trying to be more of an ""actor"" than ""comedian"" in his movies. Sandler is actually a pretty decent actor, it's just, 'Click' is the wrong movie to do this in. 'Click' is like watching two movies in that the first half is all fun and poop/Asian jokes. Now, personally, I like that. Movies that are just silly 8th-grade humor fun where you can just abandon your brain at the door and have a good time. That is fine, and every once in a while I enjoy that. I loved Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, The Waterboy and Big Daddy despite all the bull***** it took from the critics. If 'Click' would have followed that same formula as the other movies I might have given it a low 'B-', which for me would be a THUMBS UP. But, half-way through, 'Click' decides to take a more serious turn and become preachy about positive moral/family values. Now, that would be fine if 'Click' had the actors and writers, and hell, even director to do that successfully, BUT IT DOESN'T. Why? BECAUSE IT'S A *****ING ADAM SANDLER MOVIE!!! The second-half of 'Click' is just down-right sad, with warm fuzzy moments that are supposed to move you emotionally, but the only thing that moved was in my pants. My you know what, when Kate Beckinsale walked across the screen. Sorry for that raunchy comment, she is just too hot for me not to write about. <br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Click offers some HYSTERICAL, I repeat, hysterical, moments in the first half that were just priceless according to me (that Asian family had me dying), but the second half is just, well, stupid and clichÃ©. We've seen this same plot-set up where a guy is forced to realize his family comes before his work so many times it's not funny! I give it a thumbs down, and recommend waiting for DVD, watching the first half, then taking the DVD out, and returning it to Blockbuster. Please, Mr. Sandler, give us something better next time. Grade: C+ (screened at AMC Arizona Center 24, Phoenix, AZ, 6/23/06)<br/><br/>my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."
"yo-saff-brig","4","2","5","7 September 2006"," It didn't Click for me
","Let me get this out of the way first: I am NOT an Adam Sandler fan. I think his films are yawn worthy and often crass, though I did love The Wedding Singer and Punch Drunk Love. This film is no different. It takes a concept that is very entertaining and doesn't go anywhere with it. I felt that the concept was entirely misused. This could have made for a great drama but decided to go in the direction of humor, which itself took a misstep when it decided to delve into the realm of slapstick-y buizzle and going further down the realm of stupidity when it started making fun of the Islamic people, which I found borderline offensive. The film for those who don't know is about a family man, played by Sandler, who gets a remote that can control the world around him. He can pause, fast-forward, rewind, slow down, and listen to audio commentary on his life (from none other then James Earl Jones. I do have to hand it to 'em...that was funny). He starts abusing the power of the remote fast forwarding just in order to get to the next stage of his life. The film picked up leaps and bounds when the remote gets stuck on fast forward skipping through all the important points in his life. It was real moving when he learns of his father's death, played excellently by Henry Winkler. I did get a little misty-eyed during that. The film worked when it went for the drama. Adam Sandler is a very good dramatic actor. Just see Punch Drunk Love or Spanglish or even 50 First Dates. Here, too, it is his strong point. When the remote skips through his son's wedding I was moved. When it skips to his death I must admit I let a tear fall. But the unfortunate truth about the film is it spends far too much time with the comedy, which isn't that funny, and takes too long to get to the moral. I give the film ** out of four because they had the idea, and a good enough cast, they just missed the point."

Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) had problems in his life which he needed desperate help with. He comes across a crazy man (Christopher Walken) who gives Michael a free Universal remote. Using it to get him a promotion or skipping a fight with his wife soon gets him into more trouble then he expected.<br/><br/>This was such an original story with great actors and an amazing plot.

And it made me feel angry at myself for taking advantage of life's most precious moments. He fast forwards three minutes of his life and before he knows it he is fast forwarding thirty years. Life goes by so fast even without a universal remote control..and he just had to skip the parts that he didn't like. Well, buddy, life is all about mistakes and not happy moments.

","Yes the critics slammed it. It actually got to me eventually, after seeing enough of ""A surefire box office flop"" and ""Sandler's worst movie"", I was swayed, to put it lightly. It didn't help that Sandler's last few movies were about entertaining as watching paint dry (Not to mention as monotonous as Ben Stein reading you to bed). But most of all, they weren't funny, nor did they bring anything to the table. I swore never to see a Sandler movie again (at least until it came out on DVD. I couldn't take disappointment after disappointment). Click intrigued me, however, despite my promise, and despite the critics, I was interested. My friend suggested we go see it and I hesitantly said yes. I went to the movie expecting the worst, what I got was one of the better movies I have seen in a very long time. The movie will not make your sides split, but it did have moments, all a comedy needs is moments to make it successful, and these moments of hilarity were funny enough to keep the first half of the movie afloat. The second half was actually a touching story, it jerked a few tears from my eyes. The thing you must do is go into this movie not expecting a GREAT movie, because then you will be disappointed. Expect a decent movie and you will find a very good movie. I was charmed by click, I liked it a lot, I would see it again, and I am not a huge fan of Sandler anymore. So see Click and experience the wide array of emotions that it makes you feel in this insightful, if not completely compelling story."

","After watching this movie it is clear to me that Adam Sandler does have obvious talent past obnoxious comedy. I went into the theatre half expecting a more mild version of his last production ""Grandma's Boy"", but I came out almost enlightened by a well blended comedy/drama that made me think. The movie does begin as any classic Sandler flick- this includes stupid (yet amusing) jokes and allusions like dogs humping stuffed animals and Sandler's ever-so-vital freaking out over nothing (i.e. ""WILL SOMEBODY GET THIS KID A HAPPY MEAL"" from ""Big Daddy""). But after the first hour, the movie blossomed into a real think-piece. At its peak the movie almost had me in tears, let alone my excessively emotional girlfriend. As always, Cristopher Walken was great (although his weird character followed suit with many of his latest movies such as ""Envy"" ""The Stepford Wives"" and ""Catch Me If You Can""). And believe it or not, David Hasselhoff was pretty funny. I give this movie a 7 out of 10 because it doesn't compare to Casablanca or Lawrence of Arabia, but if I'm comparing it to the rest of Sandler's movies, a perfect 10."

We've seen 50 First Dates, WaterBoy, The Longest Yard, and Mr. Deeds. We've also seen Punch Drunk Love, which grew on us after watching it 3 times (had to see it that many times just to figure it out)! This movie doesn't really fit any of these movies. It is more along the lines of Anger Management.<br/><br/>We went into the theater expecting funny, because the trailer indicates that. However, Adam Sandler, although acting with a lot of his typical costars, isn't acting as his typical character. He acts as a normal guy who happens to gain control of a remote control that controls his life. The movie focuses on a life lesson and makes a point.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie is the child stars who overact their lines and scenes. Christopher Walken, who is always funny just being present, has some memorable scenes...and you won't soon forget Sean Astin either! Funny? Sometimes. It is worth the cost of the movie ticket, YES!"

","I really enjoyed this movie. Sometimes Adam Sandler's comedy is a little too low-brow for me, but he hit a good ""Happy (Madison) medium"" in ""Click."" The premise of the movie is that Adam Sandler's character (Michael) has, somehow in the course of his adult life, lost the realization that he is striving for something he has always had. He has a beautiful wife and two cute, loyal, lovable children, but this isn't enough - he thinks he also has to have the high prestige and high salary that comes with a promotion at his architectural firm. Throw in the acquisition of a truly ""universal"" remote (that comes with some humorous special effects), a kick-ass soundtrack, and you have ""Click."" The ensemble of actors in this film is really impressive: Henry Winkler, Christopher Walken, Rachel Dratch, Sean Astin, David Hasselhoff (who has a great comedic touch in his role). I was especially impressed with Jake Hoffman, who plays the 20-something version of Michael's son Ben. Not only does Hoffman look like Sandler, he also has some of his facial expressions and voice quirks down to a ""T."" I would recommend this film. It had me almost crying at times, but the majority of the time I was laughing out loud. Some of the funniest scenes in the film feature Michael's relationship with the neighbor kid, and pretty much every scene with Hasselhoff. I am surprised this film didn't receive better reviews by movie critics.<br/><br/>P.S. Walken's character's name (Morty) seems to be chosen for a reason. Those who know French may figure it out."

It is funny, don't get me wrong, I don't think that Adam could be in a movie and not be funny, but it also has a different, more serious side to it. I definitely recommend this movie! It makes you realize that in the middle of all of the hustle and bustle of our busy days, that our life is passing by, before our very eyes, and we're sometimes so consumed with that ""hustle and bustle,"" that we forget to stop and smell the roses, do what's really important in life.

When I first saw previews for this film, I thought it was going to be a wall in Sandlers career, but he pulled out yet another good one to get the audience. Christopher Walken makes a great appearance and put the power of the universe in Michaels hands. David Hasselhoff makes a great appearance as Michaels boss and Henry Winkler as Michaels father.

Overall it is one of the best Adam Sandler movies I have seen, i am a huge fan of Adam Sandler and I think even people who aren't great fans of him will enjoy this film! If you haven't seen it already, then go out and get yourself a copy! But, that's just one mans opinion, but nonetheless my opinion stands... see this movie."

"alexvoko0232","10","3","10","4 July 2006"," Really wonderful movie
","This is Sandlers best movie. I'm not a fan of his earlier movies like Billy Madison. This movie proved to me that he can act a little bit. The movie was also extremely funny. But it had a great message of not wasting your life and live life to the fullest. Walken was also great as Morty, it really shocked me that he was in fact the Angle of Death. The did pay homage to the old stories of Its A Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol. But with a new twist of using a magic remote control to literally control your life and make it easier. But when it starts to take over your life, then the remote controls you. It was a powerful movie when I saw it. It was so good, I saw it again. Great movie."

","the jokes that Adam Sandler made are so funny in the movie, for example: your so tight that if i shove coal up your ass it would come out as a diamond, the movie is top i i recommend it to all ages if you like comedy you love this. If ever want to have a remote to control you life and see what we happen you must see this the good that could happen and the bad that could happen. trie to see this with friend it will be more funny i did and it was GREAT.but Adam Sander get crazy crab happen to him so it on my wish list.

It was a movie that really delivers it's message well, live life to the fullest, don't take the little things for granted, and appreciate how special your time is with your loved ones is.<br/><br/>While the movie is extremely funny and enough to make you want to see it over and over, it also provides you with a softer side, a side that shows true love and chemistry and it's importance to each character, and the hurt feelings of when love is lost.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is great in this movie. It features his standard type of comedy which we all (or some) have grown to love. But as the film progresses there is an obvious maturity to him that hasn't been in previous films. This movie left me wanting to truly live life, and appreciate things more than I have been.<br/><br/>I recommend it very much."
"c_impakt","10","3","10","28 June 2006"," Great movie, recommended for kids, to grandparents....
","This movie, has got to be the most serious, as well as comedic movie Adam Sandler has ever done. I'm a huge fan of Adam Sandler, and have my own collection of things he has played in and yet, this is my favorite movie so far. My girlfriend and I actually sobbed at this movie...Never saw that coming. Go out and see the movie, you'll be amazed...I do love how names from the old movies he starred in as well as some familiar faces actually showed up as well. Even an appearance from MEATBALL! Gotta love that dog...The more Adam Sandler branches into Drama and still holds on to the humor value, shows what a well rounded actor and producer he really is. Thumbs up from us..."
"S-Reisner","10","3","10","24 June 2006"," By far the best comedy movie in years
","This movie was wonderful. It had drama and a lot of original jokes that don't get old. Everyone wishes they could mute someone or go back in time and fast forward through something, this movie let Michael Newman, an overly working architect do that. He even used the contrast button on the remote and turned himself into a green guy and a purple dude. It is true how kids grow up fast, he missed one year and his kids had moved from dragon tales to watching CSI. That scene was very funny, i was disappointed in seeing parents bring five year old kids to see a pg-13 movie on which the adds clearly showed sexual themes. But i suppose parents do that a lot nowadays, this movie had a very comic affect even when he didn't have the remote. Then it got very touching when he went to the future and his dad was dead, then he lost his wife and his father died and he missed him though he never thought he would. The neighbor Kevin O'Doyle, the annoying little brat who seems to try to make Newmans life suck and always brags about the cool things his family has. It was hilarious when Newman got his brief payback. This is the first movie since Fun with Dick and Jane and Big Momma's house 2 when i heard the whole theater laugh out loud. LArry the cable guy and date movie seemingly didn't have that effect. I almost cried watching this movie and i am hardly ever touched, the film was far more original than any other recent film without using the gross or mentally challenged humor. Don't pass this movie by, its an all around great movie."

","I went to a preview screening of the movie ""click"" and i was pleasantly surprised. Everyrthing about this film was great and it had an awesome balance of drama and comedy and romance that i haven't seen in a movie before. you seriously need to get to see this movie. Its definitely worth seeing it a cinemas!!!!!!! This has to be one of my favourite films this American summer. Also this is one of Adam Sanders finest movies to date and has a higher standard than his recent average films ( Spanaglish, Anger management ) The aging in this film is fantastic and you would never believe that Kate BEckinsal is only in her late 20's early 30's. The future part of the film ( second half ) was amazing and was very emotional and had most of the women in the cinemas crying their eyes out. I thought that all the actors were amazing and not one was bad, and the gags that were in the movie were fantastic. David Hasselhoff was extremely good and i was happy to see Australia's own Sophie Monk in a big film even if she had little to do with it (lets just forget Date Movie :P ) But yea all up awesome movie and i was surprised many times in the film. Everyone came out of the cinema with smiles on their faces."
"jat1995","9","4","16","5 July 2006"," The Best Movie of the Year!
","I saw this movie not too long ago. My son is seven and got a bit freaked out at one part so bring kids that are used to PG-13 movies (10 and up). I saw the trailer and thought... Well the kids will love this movie! It's a great movie but it's not really a kids movie. Also the beginning when the main character first has it, it's funny but then it gets out of control and everything goes wrong and it's so dramatic. I cried a couple of times but it's a great movie. When you see it you might be thinking about your family a little more. It's very realistic but their are maybe one or two freaky parts so kids might get nightmares so its more of a 13 and up movie (PG-13). Not as funny as you might think it is. Surprisingly depressing. One of the best I've ever seen."
"charles_bt","10","3","11","11 July 2006"," The Sad Part
","Wow OK wowow wooww. lol OK. this is by far the best movie this year. Well this movie touched me a lot. The father part where Micheal's(ADAM) father dies and you see him saying ""I love you son"" touched me a lot because he never got to see his dad's funeral. I've always had fights with my father, and this movie taught me a great lesson. Another part that actually made me shed a tear was the part where you see the dad(ADAM) just falls on the floor on his sons wedding night. That would actually brake my heart if my father died right on my wedding day. nobody doesn't want that. the ending part where you see Micheal die was very touching.<br/><br/>I recommend you people to see this movie. I'd watch this again. Ill bring my girlfriend next time. This movie will make you smile, laugh and cry. I've seen like a lot of girls shedding tears at the end of the movie. all these people cheered and clapped so loud. this is by far the best Adam Sanlder movie."

","Don't listen to what the critics are saying about CLICK! They don't have a clue. If you like Adam Sandler, then you will love this movie. I took my 11 year old daughter and her 11 year old friend to see it and we were all crying and laughing. I don't think there was a dry eye in the audience (men included). Ebert and Roeper gave it 2 thumbs down, but I have to disagree with them. I've noticed that they have given lousy ratings on other good movies too. Basically, don't always believe what you hear....experience it for yourself! It is a movie that definitely makes you realize that life is too short and to not let work and other outside influences interfere with spending time with your family. Time lost with family cannot be made up. Family should always come first!"

I want one! That's all I need to say about her. <br/><br/>The effects were great. I know how a lot of stuff is done, but if this was old technology, they found a new way to use it! I imagine that it must have taken a whole lot of takes to blend the live action with the stills and other live shots...I'm thinking Academy nomination on the effects. Chris Walkin...I never get tired of his weirdness.<br/><br/>Best movie I have seen in a couple years! Sandler has redeemed himself!!!"
"axopnk","3","2","6","1 January 2007"," Not one of the best sandler flicks
","As i wrote in other post (40 year old virgin) certain comedies are just not selling right now. Adam Sandler comedy right now is more miss than hit due to its lack of new comedic elements in his movies. This movie was hard to predict. It seemed like a comedy in the beginning but toward the end it left you with more of a drama than a comedy. Sure, sandler tried to throw some comedic elements throughout the movie, but as the movie progressed, it's pretty apparent that the comedy just ran dry. Another problem is the movie just was too serious towards the end. Sandler didn't learn from his previous experience of making the longest yard that the problem of having a tragic event happen or too much drama completely changes the mood of the movie. Even throughout the movie, not all the jokes left you on the floor laughing. Sandler's constant characters of being a jerk, loud mouth are getting pretty old. Kate Beckinsale was OK, she had somewhat of a role but not enough to really show her talent (why she signed on, i don't know). It's hard to believe that a all star cast (most of the characters were from his other films) could do a miss job like this. It was pretty predictable toward the end of the movie that he would ""wake up"" back at square 1 to get that classic Hollywood ending. If you want to really laugh and see something original, watch wedding crashers or the vince vaugn, ben stiller, owen Wilson comedy. Otherwise, check the reviews and other comments before watching anymore Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, Jack black movies."

","This film is about a Michael Newman, a father, who works too much and doesn't have too much time on his hands to spend time with his family. He wants his life to be easier so Morty gives him a universal remote that allows Michael to do almost anything with his life. Later though, the remote starts making decisions by itself.<br/><br/>This is probably one of the best films of the year and the best Adam Sandler movie ever. It's very funny and has some very sad moments. I think this is the movie that I ever cried so much at. Adam Sandler, Kate Beckinsale, and Christopher Walken give good performances. This isn't your usual Adam Sandler movie. It's fun for the whole family, yes, I said it.<br/><br/>The special effects are good and it has some touching moments. The supporting cast role also are funny in this film. This film gives out a really powerful message and everyone should not hear the critics on this. Give it a chance.<br/><br/>The best Adam Sandler flick should be watched by everyone. It's both sad and funny. Go see it."
"l_n_e_d","3","2","6","21 October 2006"," Disappointing and corny
","I was expecting a fairly funny and interesting movie as the score of this movie was quite good: 7.7 out of thousands of votes. When I was watching it, boredom got the best of me in the second half of the movie. The story was kind of dumb if you ask me, not very well developed at all and more so, I thought the way Adam Sandler did the part of Michael Newman was downright silly. I honestly can't imagine why this would be suck a good movie, but if I see the score obviously many people disagree. Anyway, in my opinion a silly, shallow and not very well developed story and not worth your time at all. I'd give this one nothing more than a 3/10 for the couple of laughs I had... I can't even remember what they were for, but I know I did laugh once or twice."
"ZacAttackFeelsGood","Null","2","6","10 July 2006"," Mr. Sandler, if you're reading this - I'll See You at the next Golden Globes!!!
","First, let me state the negatives: It wasn't long enough!!! That's my only negative. Here's why: Adam Sandler has done it again in this summer box-office hit.<br/><br/>Sandler, since he did 50 First Dates, has continued to surprise me by taking more serious, dramatic roles. His acting was phenomenal.<br/><br/>Mr. Sandler, I'm expecting to see you with a Golden Globe in your hands this year. Good luck to you.<br/><br/>Next- Kate Beckinsale plays his wife, naturally beautiful, her acting was superb as well, making her a great mother-model, next to Sandler, a great father-figure.<br/><br/>Supporting Cast- David Hasselhoff, as always, takes on the role of a jerk who causes many conflicts, and boy does he play it well.<br/><br/>I'm always used to seeing Christopher Walken play a character so weird, it will keep you up at nights. His character as Morty (the distributer of the remote) is the weirdest of all. There's a big twist with Morty, and I'll leave it up to you to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Now, I will tell you that this is NOT the movie you're seeing previews for. The movie you're seeing previews for seems like one of Adam Sandler's normal slap-stick, stupid humor films. This is a role that Sandler has taken on that proves he is more than that, he is beyond that, and, maybe there's still a few more good, stupid movies left in him, but Click shows it's viewers that Sandler, not only has proved himself as a serious actor, but it also shows nearly 20 years of hard work, and definitely over 20 more years to come.<br/><br/>Thank you, Adam, thank you, Kate, and thank you to Frank Coraci and Happy Madison Productions for making such a brilliant movie.<br/><br/>**Warning: You WILL cry during this movie. It's not a matter of being an emotional person or not, it is a guarantee that you WILL CRY YOUR EYES OUT!!!!! That is all I have to say. Enjoy the movie."
"jimgleeson-1","7","2","6","4 July 2006"," Sandler's most meaningful movie?
","Although I enjoyed ""Click"" I thought that Sandler's movie Spanglish, was arguably the most meaningful as it didn't really contain many comedic elements to it at all. I imagine though some people could argue that ""Punch Drunk Love"" was perhaps his most dramatic, if not eccentric movie to date. Click is very Capra-esquire in it's ""Look at this wonderful life you are missing"" type of side effect the remote control has, but the movie retains a bit of the fantasy to it. The supporting cast for this movie though was probably one of the best he has had in his recent movies. The teaming up with the same director that was with him on a couple of his other movies, the Wedding Singer, as well as the Waterboy was not bad for the movie either. Coraci and Sandler work well together. Much better, I think, than when Coraci works without him like in ""Around The World in Eighty Days"""
"FreshOne10","6","2","6","3 July 2006"," It was an OK movie people, get a grip. And it was my LAST adam Sandler movie
","The film was OK, but it could have been an even more powerful film without Adam Sandler and without all the crude puerile jokes. The dog, Adam on the desk...<br/><br/>Firstly, the story is engaging throughout and fairly original. But 25% through the movie you know exactly where it is going.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale as Adam's wife is excellent and absolutely nails the part.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler... will he ever grow up? He just does not fit this role. Not Adam as a person as such, but his acting is just too juvenile and takes away from the type of behaviour of these kinds of people. He doesn't even look like a good match for his wife. So if not him, then who? This movie has Charlie Sheen written all over it (except for the bathroom jokes), or even Ben Stiller who can come across as an adult working male striving for the top.<br/><br/>The story is good, and the supporting cast and cameos are quite good.<br/><br/>I really like the realism and authenticity displayed when they go into the future.<br/><br/>By no means a waste of your viewing money, but could easily have been a better movie."
"LemonyShepard","9","2","6","27 June 2006"," An Amazingly Touching Suprize
","I walked into this movie expecting to see Adam Sandler in a zany comedy that would hardly be remembered. I couldn't have been more wrong! Sandler's newer movies (50 First Dates, for example) are fantastic! Funny when they need to be, yet touching at just the right moments. Click takes Sandler into a character that's so powerful, you will actually grow attached to him by the end (a comedy rarity).<br/><br/>Click tells the story of a workaholic who rarely finds time to do things with his family. He stumbles into Bed, Bath, and Beyond to find a universal remote to make his life less hectic. Upon entering a room marked ""Beyond"", he meets up with a rather-crazy looking man named Morty, who gives him a universal remote to...well...the Universe!! The first hour is the typical comedy that you would expect from a Sandler movie, including dogs humping and farting in peoples faces. However, after that first hour, things really start to go downhill for Sandler's character, and you feel his pain as he journeys through his painstaking life.<br/><br/>The last 45 minutes of the film almost had my crying. Yes, I nearly cried during an Adam Sandler movie. The whole situation that his character is in is just very heavy and depressing. The best part about this, though, is that Sandler plays the part so well that you feel horribly sorry for him during all of this, something I doubt Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, or many other comedy actors could pull off.<br/><br/>The commercials for this movie gives it no justice, focusing clearly on the comedic aspects instead of the ""It's A Wonderful Life""-like lessons it teaches.<br/><br/>By far the best movie I've seen all year, and I've seen Cars and X-Men 3. Seriously, whether you're a Sandler fan or not, give this movie a shot. You won't be disappointed. 9.5 overall"

And I'm not saying I don't like other Sandler movies, but this one seemed more thought out and I think adults will enjoy this one more since it doesn't contain as much childish jokes.

I like this man a lot and I always enjoy it.

The cast is very good: Adam Sandler, Kate Beckinsale, Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Sean Astin, Joseph Castanon, Jonah Hill, Jake Hoffman ... I stand above Sandler, final, in addition to Beckinsale and Walken. The makeup is amazing in every scene .. it is very well done, in addition to the songs ... that are very well and fit fabulously with the scenes and are enjoyed.

"luke-a-mcgowan","9","1","2","29 December 2015"," Profound experience
","Adam Sandler is the last person you'd go to for a profound message about wasting one's life. His film Click is incorrectly stuffed in the same category as his rubbish films like You Don't Mess With the Zohan. Don't get me wrong, all the flaws are still there - Rob Schneider cast as another race, lots of dog humping jokes, Sandler's character being married to a woman way out of his league and his everyday struggles with his perfect life. But all of those things can be forgiven because Click's screenplay is almost perfect.<br/><br/>Sandler's character is an architect on the verge of being made partner. He has to keep sacrificing moments of his life to grease his promotion and impress his boss (perfectly portrayed by David Hassellhoff as a handsome buffoon). In his frustration at one of life's little hassles, he discovers the ""Beyond"" section of Bed, Bath and Beyond and a wacky salesman named Marty who gives him a prototype universal remote. At first its just a bit of fun, but its when Sandler discovers the fast-forward feature - and later, that the remote learns his habits and does things automatically - where the movie starts its message. Its neither subtle nor in your face, making it accessible for adults and children (as I was when I first saw this film). Sandler starts skipping through big chunks of his life in order to get to the next promotion, costing him his wife, kids, health and everything that actually made life special.<br/><br/>Sandler is just playing Adam Sandler in the film, but when we get the final act and he must climb out of bed to stop his son from cancelling his honeymoon for work, its probably closest to the best I've ever seen from him. Christopher Walken has a lot of fun as the kooky Marty, although the film would have worked completely fine without the stupid scene at the graveyard where Marty is revealed to be the Angel of Death. See how they took out the Rowan Atkinson angel plot in Love, Actually and how it still worked perfectly. Sean Astin is funny in a small role as the swim teacher who takes over Sandler's family, and Kate Beckinsdale, Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner all have their sweet moments as Sandler's wife and parents. The death of Michael's father late in the film is close to heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Got to take a moment to talk about the hair and make up in this film - wow. Beckinsdale, Astin, Winkler and Kavner are most convincingly transformed between ages and it looks completely natural, which is rare these days (looking at you Jersey Boys). Sandler's fat suit looks CGI and terrible, but his fat flap is an easy laugh and looks hilariously real.<br/><br/>There might be more meaningful movies out there from more accomplished talents, but Click is a movie that's stayed with me my whole life because of how easily and well it conveys its moral."

","This is one of our very fave Adam Sandler movies. First of all, he is an over-worked man who desperately needs a pay increase and some time off to enjoy time with his family! (Who can't relate to that these days?) Secondly, Adam Sandler proves he is an amazing actor, experiencing all the highs and lows of life. Adam makes acting look easy (like Jackie Gleason, Adam West, Jack Klugman) so his talents are taken for granted by some people in society and he is very underrated. Adam belongs in the group of truly great actors who can make you laugh one second and cry the following second (like Jackie G., Adam W., Jack K.). We cannot say enough good about this film. ""Click"" is truly an excellent, amazing, entertaining, fantastic film! A lot of deep, profound thought went into writing and directing this film. This film belongs in the same category as ""It's A Wonderful Life."" We love it!"

","Obviously, this movie is so bad. Yet it is absolutely amazing. One of my favourite movies of all time.<br/><br/>It's a typical Adam Sandler movie (comedy wise) but the characters and the overall way it's written makes it feel different. Not sure if it's because there's a slightly different cast compared to his other movies, but it definitely makes it nicer. Something you would expect, regarding comedy, but the way the movie is set up and executed makes it great.<br/><br/>The story, characters, problems, all make this movie amazing.<br/><br/>10/10 really makes you feel and think, definitely one of those movies everyone has to see, even if it is an Adam Sandler movie, this is one is special"

And, based on one's presupposed knowledge of the typical Adam Sandler movie, one expects there to be a spiral out of control for Michael, a<br/><br/>realization of the ""right thing to do"" and everything to end happily with a monologue and one final punchline , all while remaining light-hearted and humorous.

","Yes, that's not saying much. Adam Sadler hardly deals in 'high-brow' comedies. And, basically, this isn't one either. However, it does easily kill an hour and a half.<br/><br/>It's a 'one-joke' movie. Sadly is given a magical remote control which can pause, rewind and fast-forward time (and much, much more). This, therefore, leads him into all sorts of trouble.<br/><br/>Luckily, Sadly is surrounded by a talented cast which frequently take the pressure off him to be the film's sole attraction. Christopher Walken is - as you might expect - excellent as the man who gives him the remote (and frequently pops up throughout the movie).<br/><br/>There's not a lot of 'meat' to this movie - it's just one to munch popcorn to. Personally, I would have preferred if the film ended about ten minutes before it did - but that's just me being cynical - you'll have to judge for yourself.<br/><br/>It's nothing perfect, but then it has Adam Sadler in, so what are you expecting? If it's watchable, it's definitely one of his best (I'm still reeling from forcing myself to sit through twenty minutes of 'Jack and Jill.')"
"ItsTheMovieGoEr","4","1","2","26 October 2014"," A film to forget.
","If you are going to go see an Adam Sandler film you have got to expect the childish humor, and wackiness that shines through in his acting. You will get your fill of the goofy humor in the first half of this movie, then it takes a more serious tone and almost changes genres,becoming much more dramatic. <br/><br/>There is one scene in particular where Adam Sandler's character, Micheal has a moment with his father that is warm and heartfelt. Unfortunately other than that one scene this movie is far from spectacular. A cliché, predictable ending, minimal character development and dry humor make this movie one to forget. Frank Coraci definitely had good intentions with the message of this film, but between a loud, obnoxious, unlikable protagonist, to the never ending pausing and fast forwarding, the film just didn't flow and was hard to enjoy. Although, if you do find dog humping funny you will certainly be entertained, as for the rest of us it just seems like another failed attempt at dumb laughs."

","I was expecting Adam Sandler's answer to Bruce Almighty, but with more fart and sex jokes, à la Sandler. It was sort of what I got, but in an unexpected package.<br/><br/>As a comedy the film is only semi-decent. It has good jokes here and there, okay characters and fine enough actors. It's no laugh-fest though. You really see where the moral of the story is taking you, and you hope for as many good jokes as possible along the ride. <br/><br/>But the moral of the story suddenly becomes the story. Suddenly the moral takes over, and the comedy takes the back seat. Suddenly, at least I got emotional. Suddenly I felt a clearer vision of what's important in my life. <br/><br/>Maybe you have to be at the right point in your life to appreciate what the movie actually teaches. To teenagers it might be wasted, and to elderlies it might just be lessons already learned. But all of us in the middle, balancing life and work, love and career – it might just be the wakeup call we need.<br/><br/>If you are in the middle and don't mind Adam Sandler – give this one a chance!"

"gregeichelberger","5","1","2","30 July 2012"," Not the best Sandler vehicle, but somewhat enjoyable
","Originally published on June 20, 2006:<br/><br/>In a nod to Jim Carrey's ""Bruce Almighty"" – in which a regular Schmoe becomes almost omnipotent – Adam Sandler stars as a loser who is offered a ""universal remote"" control device, which gives him power over time and space – among other things.<br/><br/>The remote is given to him by the otherworldly Morty (Christopher Walken), who is tinkering in the bowels of a Bed, Bath & Beyond store. Actually, the plot is taken from the ""Twilight Zone"" episode, ""A Kind Of Stopwatch,"" which originally aired on Oct. 18, 1963, but this contraption also allows Michael Newman (Sandler) to mute, pause, review his past and (especially) fast-forward things around him.<br/><br/>It's that latter feature, though, that causes the most havoc in his life, because as soon as he zips through one crisis (getting a cold, arguing with his wife, wishing for a promotion, having sex, etc.) after another, the machine programs itself, automatically forwarding through similar situations, and causing his existence to pass all too quickly before his eyes.<br/><br/>While he strives to climb the company ladder at his architect firm, he begins to use the thing to avoid the months and years of hard work it would take for him to succeed; soon, however, as in most films of this fantasy ilk, the bad side is revealed. <br/><br/>While his brain is fast-forwarding through bits of unpleasantness, his body remains - with little or no reaction to the things actually going on around him in his family's reality. <br/><br/>Before he realizes it, his wife, Donna (Kate Beckinsale), is drifting away from him, and the relationship with his kids, Ben and Samantha (Joseph Castanon and Tatum McCann) is going to pot. <br/><br/>Donna eventually divorces Michael and marries swim instructor, Bill (Sean Astin, ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""50 First Dates""), while the kids grow up estranged from their father. He's a big man at his company, sure, but no amount of success on the job can compensate for failure in the home.<br/><br/>The lesson here is to spend as much quality time with your loved ones (""Family comes first"") and there are no quick fixes in life. A bit maudlin and sappy, at times (although there are some pretty funny moments), plus about 10 minutes too long for my taste; but nice supporting work from Walken (who steals the picture), Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner (as Michael's meshugana parents), as well as David Hasselhoff, as his weirded-out boss, make this one of Sandler's better vehicles.<br/><br/>Despite the obligatory flatulence sequences and the sometimes lowbrow Sandler humor, the message comes through without being too preachy and heavy-handed, and although his kids are horribly non-descript and uninteresting, there is enough decent chemistry between him and Beckinsale to make their relationship believable - to a point.<br/><br/>Not Adam Sadler's best - that was ""The Wedding Singer"" (so far) - but good enough to enjoy."
"pqt","10","1","2","29 April 2012"," A very good movie - for parents
","It's well understandable that the younger people commenting here might dislike the movie. Expecting a full-fledged Sandler-Comedy but getting something that turns out to be more of a drama than a comedy - yet even things you might laugh about earlier in the movie, might turn out completely different when thought about again. E.g. Hasselhoff who appears so hilarious when exiting the business-world, was actually doing the only right thing (although a bit drastic).<br/><br/>As a father in my 40ies with two kids, the curve of my career slowly flattening out and a minor burn-out behind me, I'm almost exactly in the same position as Michael (Sandler) at the beginning of the movie: trying to please everybody (job + private life) except myself and over-stretching myself by trying to be a good employee as well as a good husband and father. So statements like ""It's just every choice I make, every thing I do, I disappoint somebody"" or ""I'm not out drinking, gambling or hitting on chicks! I'm working my ass of so my family can have a better live than I ever dreamed of when I was a kid"" are more than familiar - resignation hovering in the air.<br/><br/>As others already stated, I'm usually offended too by the dumbed-down comedy which Sandler represents all to well. And yes, some of these so called jokes would have better been left out (the humping dog, the farting). But if you manage to ignore these 2-3 glitches, the movie so clearly shows you the two possibilities you have to choose between all your life: either your career or your life. It doesn't need to be family. It's important that you make the choice consciously without being pushed by what's conceived ""normal"" in our modern world. The movie does it in a simple but effective way - it's not going very deep in the philosophical aspects, that's true. But for me it was a very efficient mix to shake me up and make me think about how I want to proceed with my life.<br/><br/>Talking about slapstick comedy in this movie: Although there are 2-3 bad ones, there are also very well used ones. E.g. at the beginning when Michael explains to his wife that the camping weekend won't take place and he tries to watch a documentary about Asian architecture, he uses the wrong remote and makes a helicopter fly into his face. What appears silly and dumb is exactly what happens in reality and what makes you nearly flip in such situations. So already there the drama begins and a very well used slapstick emphasizes the tragedy.<br/><br/>So, although we had seen this theme being covered in other movies (btw: which topic was not covered yet in some other movie?) and some minor parts should better be cut, I'd highly recommend this movie to all (parents) who are torn between the work and private life - and especially those who don't realize it yet ;) I think it's because of its weightlessness that the movie gets through. At first you might sympathize with the idea of having such a remote control to skip all the noise, the stress and painful duties that come along with family life. But the movie also makes you realize how much you would be or are already are missing."

","Like all other people, i was expecting a total comedy movie and i was predicting myself laughing. But the things didn't go that way.I gave my tears instead of laughs. The story goes into a sad situation moment to moment. It can make cry the people who have never cried for a movie before like me! It also gives many lessons about choices and life, reminds you your contacts between your loved ones. Some scenes like Michael Newman's last sight his father were strongly sad than can make you cry. However there are funny scenes too especially in the early ones, but not the absurd humors. Shortly, a significant and spectacular movie which is the best of Adam Sandler. Kate Beckinsale was also tremendous and showed that she is really capable of acting."

","Ever wondered what ""It's A Wonderful Life"" would have been like if it contained large amounts of obvious gross-out comedy? Wonder no more, just go rent this one. ""Click"" can be extremely touching and heart-warming at times, but then David Hasselhoff gets farted on and you're back to square one. Sandler's character feels how his life has slipped away, remorsefully thinks about all the things he missed but then screw it, let's randomly throw in three dozen liposuction jokes. The movie's often just way too Hollywood for its own good, it has a lot of potential but the makers never have the guts to be truly unpredictable. I guess the fact that's it's such an uneven film wouldn't bother me if the humor was actually funny, but as I said even that's somewhat of a letdown. The material is all just so uninspired and stale: humping pets, fat jokes, kids getting hit in the face with something, old people talking dirty, some of it even seems like rejected material from Rob Schneider movies (if that even exists). Thank God Christopher Walken drops by for a few scenes, pretty much every laugh I remember came from him. The ending is pretty much the final nail in the coffin, but thankfully it also pretty much sums up the entire movie for me: good story with lots of potential, but Hollywood turns it into a boring, predictable, risk-less snoozefest. What a waste."

"D_Burke","4","1","2","6 June 2011"," ""Click"" Is A Clunker, & Adam Sandler's Most Disappointing Movie
","Every time I think about the movie ""Click"", I can't help but get angry, as if I had been cheated into watching it in the first place. I don't know if it's Adam Sandler's worst movie, but it is by far his most disappointing.<br/><br/>Basically, when I first went to see the film in June of 2006, I went in expecting a comedy, which is what I got for the first half of the film. The second half, however, was when the film not only became unfunny, but it ventured into such sad, dark, and depressing territory. By the end, I felt as though I had been tricked into seeing a better film.<br/><br/>In this movie, Sandler plays Michael Newman, a happily-married architect whose main problem is his boss (David Hasselhoff), who repeatedly puts him on time-sensitive assignments to the point where he doesn't spend the time with his wife and kids that he would like to. His family, particularly his wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale), doesn't seem to be the least sympathetic to the fact that he has to work to support the family, which is a theme also prevalent in other forgettable comedies of yesteryear like ""Multiplicity"" and ""Jingle All The Way"" (both 1996).<br/><br/>Late one night, Michael goes out the the nearest available store to find a universal remote. In an admittedly creative way to incorporate product placement into a film, he drives by various outlet stores until venturing into Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Finding a door marked ""Beyond"" in the store, he walks through and meets an eccentric electrician named Morty (Christopher Walken, probably the best thing about the film). Morty gives Michael a blue remote control without a box or any instructions, and just tells him to ""Point, and Click"" to make it work.<br/><br/>As these movies go, Michael finds that he can control time and other things with this remote. It's pretty creative how the remote works, especially when he can see aspects of his life through DVD special features. I though the ""Making Of"" section of Michael's life was funny particularly. There are also some funny parts where he adjusts the color of himself using the remote.<br/><br/>However, the movie really loses its common sense, and its humor, when Sandler's character uses the Fast Forward button for various situations. Admittedly, the movie had a good way of covering up what could be a major plot hole. If you fast forward through time, what would you be doing in the eyes of everyone else around you? Would you just be standing there, moving slowly?<br/><br/>So goes the concept of being on ""auto pilot"", where Michael goes through the motions of what he's supposed to be doing in a given place and time, but without any kind of emotion. Being in auto pilot allows him to complete his architectural work, but gradually he loses touch with his wife and kids.<br/><br/>With that plot hole covered up, many other holes emerge when Morty reveals that the remote programs itself to automatically fast forward time according to Michael's previous commands. So when Michael fast forwarded through his cold, the remote fast forwards through other times he was sick. When his wife argues with him, ditto.<br/><br/>Eventually, in a scene that really made me want to cry out loud, Sandler finds himself accidentally in the year 2017, where he is morbidly obese (in a fat suit that resembles Fat Bastard in the ""Austin Powers"" movies), divorced, living alone, and estranged from his family.<br/><br/>From this point, you can tell the film is blatantly ripping off ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"", although you may be too depressed to notice. There are funny parts thrown into these later scenes, but they are blatantly crushed by the weight of the all too heavy drama in which the film finds itself.<br/><br/>All I could do was get angry at Sandler, or at least his character, and wonder how you can screw up this royally if you have all the power in the world in one hand. Plus, if I had a magic remote in this situation, you know what I would do: USE THE PAUSE BUTTON. Why it never occurs to this character to pause time and do his architectural work is beyond me.<br/><br/>If you're going to make a goofy comedy where David Hasselhoff is your boss, it's best to keep it funny throughout. When you throw in an exhausting cautionary tale about the meaning of life and the importance of family, you just lose credibility. Seeing this movie made me want to use a magic remote to rewind time and stop my past self from paying to see this movie. I would not mind seeing a movie solely about Morty, however, provided Christopher Walken doesn't play Russian Roulette with audience's expectations."
"Operton","3","1","2","17 December 2010"," Not that good
","I think this movie has two parts. The first half hour this movie is a comedy and it is actually pretty funny. However, the next hour of the movie is more like a Lifetime TV propaganda drama emphasizing that husbands should spend less time at work and more time with their wives & family or the wife will find somebody else. Its somewhat hypocrisy considering the US media emphasizes that wives should spend more time at work and less time with their husbands & family. And if her husband finds somebody else ... well... he's considered a jerk. (And these Hollywood types can't figure out why so many men avoid marriage today. Are they really this dumb?). If you like Lifetime TV then you will like this movie. If you are looking for a lighthearted comedy movie, this isn't it."
"elshikh4","6","1","2","26 September 2010"," The reasons why I wasn't satisfied after its end !
","It seemed like a movie from the 1960s and the 1970s, especially Disney's (The Absent-Minded Professor - 1961) or (The Million Dollar Duck - 1971) where a middle-class guy has something miraculous in his life, that meets the third act of Frank Capra's (It's a Wonderful Life - 1946). Misusing the miraculous power through a ""What I!f"" movie can create a good fantasy with a message. But while (Click) has an interesting idea for sure, the treatment wasn't as interesting.<br/><br/>After spending nearly the half of it, with sketches that showcased the remote control's abilities and (Sandler)'s delightful joking, the script immersed in loud melodrama, that called for Indian remake!, and got caught in the trap of being dryly forthrightly preachy; where the whole meaning was said easily ""Family comes first""! In fact, the entire second part lacked the humor and the imagination of the first one.<br/><br/>Then, slight matters bothered me. For instance: Who was that mad inventor?! I hate it when they finish writing a movie, then get too sloppy to answer questions of that sort, even though it would have been more solid fantasy if they ever did! He simply looked like the direct voice of the writer intervening himself in, without any efforts to make it ""really"" magical. A considerable point like ""You were accelerating your life before I give you the remote"" wasn't portrayed at all. The rude comedy; concerning excrement, farts, butts jokes,.. etc, went forever. This time, I deemed it an insult from the writers to themselves; because according to what I have seen of some smartness along the way, they could have done better and classier. I thought that the futuristic details - while being not too many - weren't that necessary, since the movie isn't designed to be a dazzling sci-fi blockbuster, it was close to block the movie's main text. And finally, the matter of the kids' bicycles was SO WEAK, no way that architect couldn't afford their cost!<br/><br/>Director (Frank Coraci) handled it nice and simple. But I don't think that it deserved being nominated for the Oscar of the best makeup; it wasn't that special. For me, the makeup of (Henry Winkler) as a young man was so-freaky-it's-comic. Apparently, that year, the academy didn't find more significant efforts to honor!<br/><br/>On the other hand, (Sandler) delivers in his second phase as a suburb father, after his well known first phase as nothing but A-one idiot! (Christopher Walken) was so perfectly cast, I though that he - at some points - was spoofing his own persona, as same as (James Earl Jones); who would redo it, right in the same year, in (Scary Movie 4). Moreover, it's my first time ever to call (David Hasselhoff) great in anything; he nailed that funny character so much to the extent that I was waiting for his scenes. True that (Kate Beckinsale) was kind of cold in the first half, but she improved in the second. And the soundtrack was nostalgic; in these days, it is a recipe for success to guys like me!<br/><br/>At any rate, it's still one different idea among the American cinema's flood of remakes, sequels, prequels lately, a good movie for (Sandler).. finally, and a well meaning comedy with an advice to say. Too bad that that very advice was said a bit poorly unlike the basic, very rich, idea."

","I have always known Adam Sandler to be the funny, goofy character that he usually is. In the case of this movie, he is only half funny. The other half is more dramatic.<br/><br/>In Click, he plays Michael Newman, a workaholic architect who wants to spend time with his family, but says he can't because he is given too much to do. When he takes a break to watch TV and can't find the right remote, he decides he needs to find a universal remote. However, Michael gets more than what he bargained for.<br/><br/>Then he meets Morty, played excellently by Christopher Walken. At first, Walken shows us that Morty is a nice guy. Morty works in the ""Beyond"" section of Bed, Bath, and Beyond. He helps out Michael by giving him a universal remote. However, instead of it controlling a TV, DVD player, stereo, and other electronics, the remote controls Michael's life. It starts out being a good thing helping him out. Michael wants to enjoy the good parts of his life, but he manages to have programmed the remote to skip parts of his life that are good and bad. Michael misses many parts of his life because of the remote skipping. Later near Michael's death, Morty turns out to be the Angel of Death.<br/><br/>Michael learns his lesson and is given another chance at his life when he is back at the point of his life before he gets the remote.<br/><br/>It is a good movie that shows that Adam Sandler can be a good actor and still be funny.<br/><br/>Director Frank Coraci shows that he can mix the elements of an Adam Sandler comedy and have some good drama, and it works.<br/><br/>The makeup effects of Adam Sandler's character are some brilliant work by the best makeup artist in the movie business, Rick Baker."

Firstly it isn't really violent, at least not as much as Sandler's other films, Happy Gilmore, Anger Management. Secondly, it isn't silly. It's funny when it needs to be, but it knows when to stop. Lastly, it isn't relaxing. Whether that's a good thing or not, this film is a Sandler film that's actually about something. It has a story to it, an emotional story. It's even quite scary in one or two places. Either way, I really enjoyed Click. Sandler shows he can act in a semi-serious role, switching between funny and serious depending on what's needed for that particular scene. There is also a really good performance by Christopher Walken who, as always, steals the show. I laughed and cried my way through this film, which demonstrates perfectly that comedy doesn't have to be stupid or violent. All's it takes is a good story."

","If there's one thing that's a little tough to sit through, then it's an Adam Sandler film in which the majority of the comedy is born out of daft, moronic, frat-boy humour linked to bodily functions; but if there's something that's, arguably, a little tougher to sit through, then it's an Adam Sandler film in which the majority of the comedy is born out of daft, moronic, frat-boy humour linked to bodily functions which doubles up as a life lecture. Many have been fooled, it would seem; many have fallen to the spell of Frank Coraci, the directorial Svengali for Click, the American film from 2006 which panders to two sorts of crowds but cons nobody with any sort of real sense. On the surface, an important 'message movie' about life and how to deal with life and that you should find time for those you love and find time to be patient for those you don't but at the core, a hate-filled; sexist and racist piece that aims pretty low and hits there or there-abouts.<br/><br/>Sandler is indeed the lead in Click, an architect named Michael Newman who spends his days wallowing in his basement attempting to work on a particular project which will see him garner a sort of ""mother"" of all promotions. He has a family that includes kids whom appear to be interested in a variety of different things; a wife with whom there is a definite connection; a dwelling that is one of 'those' gorgeous, American neighbourhoods and generally seems to be doing pretty well for himself. Despite all this, our Michael is wavering into some sort of depressive state, stating that he really wouldn't mind if his life got a little shorter. One day, sick with all the remote controls in and around the house, systematically getting across a sense of real inability to deal with modernity and those little things that try to make your life a tiny bit easier, he journeys to the local mall in order to find a universal remote; something that can control everything at once. Upon arriving, he meets eccentric technician Morty (Christpher Walken channelling a familiar sort of mad professor act) who gives him a remote that it's eventually revealed can control a lot more than just household electronics.<br/><br/>It's a simple enough premise, and it's delivered with a simple enough aplomb in the early stages as sequences that exist purely to fill up the trailers and TV spots are played out to do with colour saturation; volume; freeze framing and language control. You might be forgiven for thinking that Michael didn't, at some point, merely direct the remote up into the air and push 'channel up', thus shifting everything into an alternate universe-come-network-come-broadcast; the reason for this being that the people inhabiting the universe of Click are odd, strange, scary individuals and all of whose problems are exploited for cheap laughs. Examples of these people arrive in the form of Michael's infantilised secretary persistently asking whether she can take toilet breaks; his parents appearing somewhat verbally abusive; his boss, a certain Mr. Ammer (Hasselhoff), a disgusting concoction of nymphomania blended with resentment and Michael himself carries an odd, sadistic streak in which the infliction of pain on others is a release.<br/><br/>Click sets its stall out pretty early on when it resorts to dog-humping jokes and, for sake of similar laughs, brings on an eight year old boy and has him say a few dirty words. It's mostly unforgivable and unfolds within a world in which most of the women are jaw-droppingly stunning, as well as Arabic businessmen from the Far East whom exist to be mocked, imitated and have their names pronounced incorrectly for easy laughs. It is very much the sort of film attempting to deal with very real and somewhat necessary ideas under this banner of adolescent, 'kick-back and enjoy', narrow-minded entertainment. When Michael shouts at Morty, upon hearing the universal remote is free of charge, ""why (he would) want to return something (that was) free of charge"", you half expect a little green light to appear in the top corner of the screen exclaiming, for the benefit of those not paying attention, that the film's hypothesis has appeared and everything after this will be a test of the preceding statement.<br/><br/>The message, screaming at the audience loud and clear; a drumming into the audience's heads on what's right and what's not, is that one needs to appreciate the finer things in life and we learn this by way of Michael's fast-forwarding through hard work for promotions; through time spent with the family, no matter how much they might annoy you; through 'quality time' with your spouse and through the little things such as traffic jams, which demand patience as you see something through, in spite of how much of a nuisance it is. After all the schlock humour, Click tries to bail itself out by having its lead suffer a series of epiphanies, but it all rings false; the pseudo-philosophical turn it decides to take when Morty arrives on screen and lays out the entire lesson is cringe-inducing, whilst the overall shift in tact is too disruptive and doesn't work. Click is very much the sort of film people such as Jonah Hill or Katie Cassidy, as well as those kids whom played Michael's children at various stages, if indeed they even have acting careers, may very well look back on in years to come and exclaim: ""Yep, the things you've gotta do when you're at the bottom of the chain(!)"". Well, maybe someone like Jonah Hill wont. Meanwhile, for attuned acting veterans such as Walken; there's that sense of 'what else is there that's left to achieve in my long and honourable array of credits?' For all the crass humour and sense of hate towards humankind, Click's message of acceptance and tolerance really ought to fall on deaf ears."

","The movie Click gives good message to the parent's. The message is, that family comes first, and Adam Sandler playing Michael Newman, has done a good job giving the point of the movie, with humor involved.<br/><br/>But I've been reading other comments, and one that strikes me, was when a person writes a review, he usually has a pretty good sense of the movie, but copy's, or puts in a well known ed sentence. I'm not saying how someone should write a review, but what I'm saying is that you need to interest the reader, and don't say, ""the movie was like a trailer, the whole hour"", or some other time.<br/><br/>I know that you might give the reader of how the movie was, and put in that sentence, but you could also, write your own style of the movie. But let me say my portion of the movie. This was made in 2006, and I had say it, did well on special effects. Truly, the movie had many laughing scenes. But the effects took its place first.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this as a family movie, there isn't anything that will offend your family.

","This was a okay film, just not Adam Sandler's best. It just felt like they could have done more with the power to rewind, stop and fast forward time, cause it was mostly used for cheap gags which aren't even that funny and at the end it finishes off with sentimental stuff that sort of drags. The movie has a moral about how time is important and should not be put to waste and that there is value in the good times and the bad times of our lives, which was fine. So it was a nice comedy, just not a great one, cause when the credits start to roll it's not that satisfying and mediocre at best, it just wasn't that creative or engaging. Every other cast members did a good job, just wasn't noteworthy or anything. The thought that Adam Sandler's character is married to Kate Beckinsale's character wasn't believable either, he just didn't have a good personality and just came off as obnoxious and childish. Despite some flaws it's a okay comedy with a mix of emotions and a bit of cheap laughs, not a great one but isn't completely a waste of time, I give it a 6.8 and that is being very generous.<br/><br/>6.8/10"

Very funny, enjoyable for family and suitable for all ages. Love this movie so much and after like 3 years after I still laugh and laugh, it never gets old because it's like the jokes are still new.

","Click may not be a horrible movie, but degenerates and is pretty bad by the ending. It's schizophrenic in that it doesn't know whether it's a comedy or a drama, and pretty much flops on both. Some of the gags are funny, but the seriousness feels misplaced after so many antics early on. Towards the end fast-forward button started getting used a whole lot as the movie has gone into downright preachy territory replete with Sandler miserably trying to act as an old man. Of course the whole idea has done before minus the remote as the one novelty which after the first 45 min doesn't have any new ideas besides a really poorly contrived auto-fast forward ridiculously explained as the remote keying in on the Sandler character's tastes. Acting is pretty bleh too. Check this out at the library for free; barely worth a rental."

","I watched Click after putting one of my dogs down, one I had since I was 3, and after we came back from the vet, my family and I watched this.<br/><br/>To say the least, Click's comedy is present, however, the tone of the film shifts so awkwardly, that the production is a zig-zag of nonsensical drama.<br/><br/>The acting is okay, though not one performance is worth highlighting -- Sean Astin is good, though his role is horribly written.<br/><br/>The comedy tends to rely a lot on slapstick, which only goes so far. The functions of the remote get boring after a while.<br/><br/>The first act is full of comedy, yet the second descends into mindfreak zone, as the viewer's perception of what the film is about, has been altered sufficiently enough to warrant someone to turn the TV off. The third act is all over the place, trying too hard to gain any heartwarming scenes, and just going insane with Death as a character.<br/><br/>All in all, unless you read the description of the entire film on Wikipedia, then watch Click, you'll probably like it more.

I'm only three years in, but anyone who is married and doesn't appreciate this film is missing out on life.

","""Click"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Frank Coraci <br/><br/>Starring: Adam Sandler, Kate Beckinsale, Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, & Henry Winkler <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for language, crude and sex-related humor, and some drug references) <br/><br/>I have such mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, I detest its marketing ploy: making it out to be a comedy, when it is anything but and showing any funny moment the movie may have in the previews. But, on the other hand, the dramatic element of ""Click"" works like a charm. And herein lies the problem, should I judge the movie based on how it was marketed or how the movie actually was? This is not your typical Adam Sandler comedyand thank God for that. I am not what most people would call a big Sandler fan. I have always thought that he has talent, but often wastes it on mediocre comedies like ""Little Nicky"" and ""Mr. Deeds"". So, I was not very interested in seeing ""Click"" because, from everything that I had seen, it looked exactly like a typical Sandler movie. You know the ones, I am sure. They have lots of bland jokes throughout and then try to form some sort of genuine heart and emotion right near the end. However, ""Click"" has two huge differences: it actually has a heart and its jokes, even though you have already seen them in previews, work quite well and had me laughing almost constantly.<br/><br/>Michael Newman (Sandler) is a workaholic architect, who is sick of working late away from his family and, of course, having to try to figure out which remote control controls what (?). So, he goes to ""Bed, Bath, And Beyond"" to buy a universal remote control. At the store, he meets Monty (Walken), an eccentric man who resides in the very back room. Monty gives him a universal remote for free under one condition: Michael can never return it. ""Why would I return something that was free?"" Michael asksthough we all know that, by the end, he'll know. Soon, Michael discovers that the remote can control anything. He can fast-forward through arguments, mute the dog, and so much more. At first, everything is just peachy, until Michael begins to fast-forward too much and the remote begins to act on itselfforwarding Michael through huge gaps of his life. Soon, Michael finds himself divorced, miserable, and with a son who is making the same mistakes he made. Now, Michael must fight to correct the wrongs he made and to try to achieve the life he accidentally gave up.<br/><br/>Do you get what I mean? ""Click"" is not really a comedy, but it isn't really a drama. It's an awkward mesh of the two that made me feel as though I was watching two separate movies blended togetheralmost as if Doctor Frankenstein had gotten his hands on the final cut. The two parts of the film, if judged separately, are both equally effective in what they are trying to do. However, when you have two effective parts of one movie, it leads to an almost completely ineffectual movie. Had ""Click"" stuck to one path, this would have probably been a great movie, but, instead, it was just okay. ""Click"" is an uneven viewing experience. When it was over, I didn't know whether to smile or to cry or to whatever. I didn't know what effect the movie was supposed to have on me. I knew I was meant to learn a lesson from the movie, but how could I learn a lesson from a movie that has numerous crude jokes and too much physical humor in the first half? How could I take it seriously? <br/><br/>""Click"" is one of Sandler's better movies, but it could have been so much more. Had the humor in the first half been toned down to more serious laughs, the last half may have made more of an impact. ""Click"" works best as a drama, but, unfortunately, this drama is tainted by an hour of comedy that, once the movie ends, seems horribly out of place. Adam Sandler is actually great here. He gave an emotional, moving performance that proves that, when he is given good material to work with, he is a fine actor. Kate Beckinsale also does a wonderful job. Is it just me or is she becoming more and more beautiful with every passing movie? When ""Click"" ended, I felt conflicted about writing my review. I knew that I could not recommend it for how it was marketed, but I also knew that I simply had to recommend it for what it actually was. This is not your conventional comedy, because this isn't a comedy at all. It's an emotional journey that will show you that you should treasure what you have while you have it.<br/><br/>Final Thought: If you want to see a typical Adam Sandler comedy, then skip this completely. It is far more than that.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 6/10 (B)"
"Corky1984","Null","1","2","12 October 2006"," An interesting plot and a few good laughs
","Click has a pretty interesting central plot, although it also exhibits plenty of American film clichés. A workaholic husband and father (Adam Sandler) just can't manage to spend that crucial 'quality time' with his 'wonderful' family. Pressure from the egomaniac boss (the Hoff) forces him to devote most of his time to corporate brown nosing. Living on a diet of fast food and with little chance to unwind, Sandler's character is headed for disaster it seems. He then meets a kooky professor type (Christopher Walken) who gives him a 'universal remote' which promises to make life easier. As Sandler begins to explore the capabilities of this device, he finds that he can pause life, fast forward and even go back in time to revisit his 'greatest hits' so to speak. Initially, it all seems to work so well: he can spend more time at home, whilst easily managing his work. Yet things begin to unravel: the remote memorises his commands, so when one night he can't be bothered to put the effort in to making love to his stunning wife (amazingly!) he fast forwards!!! From that moment on, he never gets to experience sex, its always fast forwarded. The device takes over his life as he misses more and more of its experiences. Things spiral out of control, as he skips divorce, an enormous weight gain and even the death of his father (the Fonze). This film has a fairly serious message about making the most of life and not passing things by, no matter how annoying they are etc. Its all back-of-a-cigarette-pack level philosophy, but its OK for a film like this. The ending was suitably contrived, but that was to be expected in such an American mainstream comedy. It was surprisingly short of laughs by the end as it took on a much more serious tone than expected. Walken was good as the crazy professor, but you have to ask yourself, should such a renowned actor really be plying his trade in such a throwaway flick? I guess the pay was too tempting! Career resuscitation was offered to the Hoff and the Fonze, making this something of an old-timer comeback. On the whole, I enjoyed Click, but what would have pleased me would have been a nasty ending to shock the audience from their cosy expectations."

(Christopher Walken) It's Morty that ends up changing Michael's life with the gift of a remote that not only controls the TV and other household appliances, but his own universe. Upon discovering the abilities the remote has Michael begins to use it to fast-forward through what he considers unpleasant and annoying. Such as fights with his wife and foreplay. As he does this the remote begins creating it's own memory and eventually starts to automatically choose what to fast-forward through. Michael unremittingly goes further and further through his life as the remote continues to fast-forward. In turn, he realizes the importance of spending time with his family.<br/><br/>'Click' seemingly starts out will with it's cutesy family wisecracks. And the first couple instances where Michael uses the remote for his own personal kicks is somewhat funny. After that, there really are no laughs to be had. It's just the same joke exhibited over and over again with different alterations. Even the dog Sundance's incessant humping of a stuffed duck gets old real quick as the film advances. This is tragic because 'Click' is being passed off as a comedy but unmistakably isn't funny.<br/><br/>Another fault the film bears is the main character Micheal is nowhere as entertaining as Morty. Not only did Walken do a better job of acting, he is overall more enjoyable to watch. Truth be told, Morty is actually the only thing that holds this mess together. And only slightly better than average direction by Frank Caraci who also did two of Sandler's other films ('The Waterboy' and 'The Wedding Singer') only contributes dullness to this already colorless movie.<br/><br/>There are however a few heartfelt moments displayed throughout the extent of the film. But in the final scenes there's supposed to be a big profound moment when Michael desperately tries to tell his son how family comes first with his last breaths but Sandler just doesn't deliver. Who honestly expected splendid acting from him though? But despite all the downsides 'Click' presents, many people will still enjoy it. What can I say, fart and sex jokes sell."

"bobnmag","2","3","12","25 June 2006"," A tired formula: Sandler could do so much better
","""Click"" is yet another case of Adam Sandler settling for the cheap gag instead of reaching for any depth of emotion or genuinely clever humor. But while he's often good at making the cheap gags very funny, he misses the target almost every time here. Unlike ""Spanglish"" or ""50 First Dates"" there is little substance here, and unlike ""Happy Gilmore"" the jokes range from recycled to stupid to just plain wrong. (Two different segments using bad stereotypes of Japanese people were very offensive.) The cast, the humor, and the plot resolution are all borrowed from either earlier Sandler flicks or other movies.<br/><br/>The only saving grace here is the cast, which collectively made a valiant effort to make something from nothing. Christopher Walken and David Hasslehoff were effective, but were utilized in completely predictable ways, missing opportunities to play off-type for greater effect. Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner provided solidly professional comedic support as Sandler's parents. And Kate Beckinsale was good as the straight foil to Sandler's typically over-the-top characterization.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an unoriginal and mostly unfunny effort in which Sandler and his production company have simply dredged up the same formula which has worked for them in the past. It doesn't work this time. A few people walked out of the theater during the matinée I saw: I wish I had joined them."
"chubbiecubbie07","4","3","12","23 June 2006"," ""Not ""Click""ing"" Chicago Tribune
","Rating- 2/5 (C) Category- Comedy/Drama Click is a comedy starring David Hasselholf, being the crude and evil boss, and Adam Sandler who is a devoted husband and father of two kids. Sadly his job is separating him from his family. So as you could see his life is really hard so he searches for a universal remote that does more than expected. It can control the whole universe. The problem being is after you use the remote for a while it keeps storing what happens into its memory. For ex. Mr. Newman, Adam Sandler, accidentally fast forwards through sex and from then on sex would be fast forwarded and so on and so forth. So as the movie goes on, passing by some funny jokes and hearing some little chuckles, he ends up missing a lot of stuff that he didn't want to miss. Eventually, he is 16 years into the future having no idea what is going on.<br/><br/>Now before I saw this movie I saw the trailer for it and I found it funny and quite amusing. Then I read the reviews. The Chicago Tribune gave the movie 1 and half stars, the Sun Times gave the movie 2 stars, and everyone else gave it a rating somewhat close to that.<br/><br/>OK, now my point of view. Just to shorten your read I thought the movie was decent until a little more than half way through the movie. That is when Click became a Drama. I mean for Christ sake, since when does a movie change genres from comedy to drama and back to comedy again. It is ridiculous. Yeah the drama scenes were quite intense. More than half the audience was sobbing. Still, what they did ruined the movie. I still left the movie theater with a happy feeling but what movie doesn't besides Flight 93? All in all, the movie made me laugh every 20 minutes, but it also made me look at my watch. Do I recommend it? Yes if you are completely bored and aren't satisfied with doing anything else, but otherwise just rent the movie when it comes out, watch the first 45 minutes where the parts are funny, and then return it."

","What was this movie? A comedy? A drama? A fantasy film gone awry? I watched it and still don't know. This movie was both cliché and silly at the same time, and never really went anywhere. The entire concept of the film was as outlandish as the worst children's cartoon, with a sprinkling of terrible outrageous tragedy. At the end of the film the writers then attempted to bring it all to a happy end with an ending reminiscent of ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Just silly, boring, dreadful, etc, etc. I've never felt so cheated out of 2 hours of my life before watching this film. I love Adam Sandler and have enjoyed several of his films (Wedding Singer, Water Boy, Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore, etc.) , but he should stick to real comedies where he belongs. He is not believable or very talented in the area of serious acting (if that's even what he was attempting to do here). Save your time and money, and ""click"" this one off......."
"surfchic-4","1","2","7","8 March 2007"," worst movie i ever saw
","This was no doubt, hands down, the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I went into the movie with the expectations of an Adam Sandler movie. Now I understand about his demise from incredibly funny, amazingly caustic comedian to a boring, boring, 'regular actor.' I wasn't expecting a Billy Madison or even a Happy Gilmore but I was at least expecting to laugh once or twice a-la 'Big Daddy' or '50 First Dates.' But sorely disappointed would be the understatement of the century. I laughed once and that was only at the part that was over-played on the previews and commercials. It was predictable and painfully so. Every scene was exactly what you thought it would be, every phrase as 'cliché' as the one before. The entire movie was premised on a giant cliché: you shouldn't work so hard. Well, gee, thats genuine and novel...oh wait! It wasn't even funny. The kids were bad acting, the mother was terrible and Adam Sandler was at his absolute worst. He wasn't funny. He was angry and not in a tolerable manner. It was pretty much terrible. You should see this movie if you have 3 hours to waste and don't have a wall in which you can smash your head against in close range."

","The film is really horrible. The plot is very stupid and the gags are mostly disgusting. Only two reasons to give one point to this film: Kate Beckinsale and IMDb's policy (minimmum=1). The film could have been a better one just reducing the budget to nearly nothing, firing the two boys (Sandler and Hasselhoff) and moving the project to Troma. The Tromaville people can use the silly plot for a new Toxic Avenger episode (the over-sized Sandler was not too far from Toxie) and they probably exploit the most bizarre details (like the planet of the duck-f*cker dogs...). I usually dodge this kind of films, in this case I was framed (expected a romantic comedy). My recommendation is... Please don't go and don't rent it."

","There weren't enough click gags to keep this going, and the stupid sentimental stuff at the end seemed to drag on forever. Too bad, because the idea was quite good, and Sandler is good at what he does, although he's doing like the old Jerry Lewis comedies which always ended up towards the end moving into sentimental sloppy sorry stuff. Walkien was terrific, the family was cute, and it was nice to see a movie which sent the message that family life is what's best for us (to the extent we identify with Sandler, which isn't to many.) Anyway, we only watched it because the other movie possible we'd already seen, the Lake House, which also was on a love theme, that it's good to wait a couple of years for the one you love, but was also predictable, but in fact more believable than this one. Well, it's not about believability, but just about being able to show more creativity."

Any movie that makes you laugh until it hurts and..makes you cry is really awesome. Adam Sandler continues to be very entertaining in very entertaining films.GO SEE IT!!! The movie makes you think about your own life and problems.The supporting actors are fantastic in their roles as well. Kate Beckingsale is perfect as the understanding wife.

","Honestly, I had no desire to watch this movie at all. So you can imagine the look on my face when I unwrapped my Christmas present and saw this DVD. At the beginning of the movie, it seemed like it would be the ""Typical Adam Sandler Movie"" Corny, blue-collar, Low-brow comedy that pains my ears and burns my eyes! But, as the story evolved I started to get into it. It became a drama about an ""Everyday Man"" with the prospect to make his life better and ultimately makes it worse(And after all, hasn't that happened to many of us at one point or another). It also teaches that sometimes you have got to get your priorities in order and you have to put your family first! Love the movie, Love the acting, Love the sappy melodrama!"

","I liked this movie a lot, but I don't think most people realize that this movie is based entirely on Adam Sandler having a ""Robotrip"". Many people complain that the movie should have kept the funny theme going that it had during the first half of the movie, but that would change the director's intent of creating the movie. Remember when he chugs the bottle of medicine after coming home from work near the beginning of the movie? He has a life-changing event during his ""trip"", which is said to occur in many of people's trips off DXM, the active ingredient in cough syrup. If the movie didn't turn sad half way through, the robotrip wouldn't have been complete. I think this is their way of promoting abuse of OTC drugs without directly stating this. I have searched online through all sorts of forums and no one has really talked about the fact that what this is based on is very inapropriate. I'm quite surprised honestly most movies get hammered for things like this, but this movie sort of kept a low profile, hell most people don't even realize he's having a hallucination/dream."

That's why I went to see it.<br/><br/>Did I expect intelligent comedy? No. Drama? No. I knew Adam Sandler was in it, so I expected either ""The Wedding Singer"", ""Water Boy"" or ""Happy Gilmore"".<br/><br/>It is NOT like Bruce Almighty. Sure, we'd all like a remote control that controls the universe, right? But this one starts screwing up way too early in the movie, turning it much too quickly from ""wish fulfillment"" to slightly depressing nightmare.<br/><br/>I once saw a short film on The Comedy Channel (in Australia) which was much better (but much more difficult to find) A girlfriend is yelling at her lazy boyfriend for doing nothing all day, and he defends himself by saying he did do one thing all day; he fixed the remote. By accident, he quickly discovers he can control her with it. He mutes her, makes her get him a beer and then almost makes her, how shall I put it? he makes her head go very close to him, but then just turns her around and uses her as a footstool. Then he drops the remote and she grabs it, and uses it."

","This movie had no good points. I won't comment on the acting (apart from leads), since its unfair to judge them by horrible writing and directing. The script is mundane and watery-a very processed looking, you've seen it all before, ho hum affair. Family man who has everything, wants to fast forward through his perfect life (explain that!) He has a gorgeous wife, money, family, health, home, everything in the American dream, and he whines about it! That's Adam Sandler of course. He's not a likable character. Granted, a better actor may have made him somewhat more likable. We do have modern day Cary Grants, but Sandler is unable to take that part. He just comes across as too ""I'm a superior creature to the viewer"". The laughs are struggled for, and quite predicable. Courteous viewers will give some scenes the benefit of the doubt, but they'll be straining hard to actually smile."

Anyway, this story is about an overworking architect named Micheal Newman who goes to bed bath and beyond to get an universal remote for his house. While looking for this remote he meets Morty who gives him an universal remote that does much more than control his T.V. Micheal soon finds out that with the remote he can go to any part of his life and skip all the boring parts.

","I can't believe that a comedy actor like Sandler can make you cry, I mean in the good way; to think that you will see an usual comedy with boring remarks and average dialogs, was a terrible mistake from me, I almost missed this movie, tired of comedies with easy scripts based on the qualities of a comedy actor in the main character. I knew Sandler could do more than average movies. Though the movie seemed boring to me at the first look, it captivated me immediately. Walken rules, also, and Beckinsale was a bit too beautiful for a frustrated housewife... Anyway, a big surprise ! I liked this movie. Incredible acting for someone who's done 'easy' comedies since now.... The movie gets better by the minutes that pass,...THE MOVIE ROCKS (no s**t, I'm telling ya) at the end.

"nkfilms","3","2","8","2 July 2006"," Unlikable male lead, bad jokes, and undeveloped characters make ""Click"" a misclick.
","I saw this with some friends of mine not expecting much... I knew this wasn't going to be Chinatown or anything... but this was really bad.<br/><br/>For the most part, I blame Adam Sandler. Sandler has become periodically less funny every movie starting with Happy Gilmore. He's lost his boyish charm, he looks older, but his personality is essentially the same, so watching him becomes a real chore.<br/><br/>They have all the Sandler classics in this - nut kicking, fart jokes, sex jokes, the whole shabang. It falls short because the context is just... weak. His wife (Beckinsale) is one of the hottest women I've ever seen on screen. Which is what made little sense, she was such a lovable soul, his kids were very sweet and cute, he had a good job... What was the problem? His character was such a jerk. There was no REASON for this guy to be such a tightwad, or become one as was suggested in the film. One scene had his wife basically throwing herself at him for sex, but wanted a back rub first... he insisted he go back to his paperwork, so he used the remote to speed up the process. This is what I'm talking about - I don't care how much of a tightwad I am, my lovely loving wife who isn't in the wrong throughout the whole movie asks me for sex, I gladly accept and spend time with her... I mean - not even his unlikable character can be the excuse for this...<br/><br/>The other problem is like most comedies, you need that low point to build up the the happy ending... this was trying so hard to be depressing (which I must admit was at some points) that you almost forget you are watching a comedy... Sandler trying to act is a little embarrassing, he's not the worst out there... but he is really unnatural throughout a lot of the teary moments.<br/><br/>All that considered, the soundtrack isn't bad, a lot of the time I was happy to hear a tune I hadn't heard in a while, or one that I really love.<br/><br/>My advice - seriously, rent Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison for the 100th time and fire up the DVD player, you'll thank me for it."

","A movie with a lot of potential and some very funny moments is totally negated by the typical Adam Sandler bathroom humor. Take away all of the unnecessary crudeness and there would be a nice reasonable length movie instead of 2+ hours of sophomoric humor. Gags that were semi-funny the first time lost the humor every time it was repeated. This movie has been hyped as Sandler being a grown-up; unfortunately, I found very little evidence of a more mature Sandler. The make-up and special effects in the movie are done very well and the rest of the cast did a decent job. The little brat next door did a great job with his part."

I think Sandler captures moments when we'd all like to have a universal remote, creating some laugh out loud scenes (I'll grant you the farting scene is over the top, but short). The fact that the universal remote drives home the consequences of life choices, so much the better. I really liked every one's performance in this movie and I wasn't the only one in the theater to shed a tear near the end.

Parts of this for those who can relate, can be tear-jerking (as in my case).

This movie is about family, and the importance of putting it first above anything else in your life. In this movie, Sandler goes into a store looking for an all purpose remote that eventually ends up controlling his life. Christopher Walken ends up being the one giving him this magical remote *Spoiler* -(who later ends up being the Angel of Death.)But warns Sandler that this remote remembers your every move, so you should use it with caution. To make a story short, Sandler finds himself always choosing work over his family life, and *spoler* eventually the remote goes on auto-pilot and skips over everything that he chose to fast-forward though (like showering, sickness, arguments, driving. etc.) This movie is VERY EMOTIONAL (I found myself breaking down crying more than once) and is for kids of all ages (although rated PG in Canada, one f-word does get slipped it, but it's very appropriate, so parents be warned.) This movie is chucked full of morals of the heart and is definitely a winner if you are a fan of not only Adam, but just great movies in general!!! 9 stars!!!!!"

"sthapns247","5","2","8","24 June 2006"," Half comedy, half not...
","Adam Sandler usually makes me laugh. The way he acts/over acts; he seems to act more like a real person than a character.. Most of the time. In Click he is a normal man who works too much and doesn't spend enough time with his family, someone many people can relate too. The first half of this movie is a comedy with some new jokes, some old jokes, and some good timing. The other half is this summer's science fiction thriller with twists, turns, and lessons.<br/><br/>Being promoted with the super bowl as an Adam Sandler comedy makes the second half of this movie rather confusing. It's not that it is complicated, it is just that it is misplaced. The comedy portions are unrealistically funny in a good way, then you are expected to take the movie's premise seriously and really care about the main character. It doesn't fail completely, but the sudden switch make this a mediocre movie at best.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is funny and has his moments. Christopher Walken, is well, Christopher Walken.. He's the reason we watch these movies again; all he has to do is be in screen or have his voice heard and we smile. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful and that is really all she is for most of the movie and you can tell they try to focus on this, but I'm a guy so I really don't mind. David Hasselhoff is actually pretty good for David Hasselhoff. He has some good lines and is fairly funny when he's on screen. Finally, I'll mention Henry Winkler who always brings a certain bizarre humor feel, which is good and is another one who makes you smile just being there. Oh, and Sean Astin is in it and he doesn't really have a big enough part to make you really laugh, but then again he will always be ""Sam"" in my mind.<br/><br/>To wrap it up, the movie isn't trash. The actors do their thing well and the jokes are mostly there, but the focus isn't. If you were to start this movie, leave part way through and come back in the last half and hour you would think you were seeing a completely different Adam Sandler movie. This would be okay if you didn't think that while actually sitting through the whole movie. Had a good start, but ultimately lost it's way.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 stars."

","This movie is an excellent one. I've loved this movie, touched me so much... It's not only a movie with the comedian Sandler. It's a great movie more dramatic than comedian, and gets dramatic with the comedy. Adam have remember me the kind of guy who only cares with the family when he have lost the family... An that's why you have a good movie here. Because, a good movie makes you live the personage life, makes you stay like him...anger, sad, happy, ""'smile'st"" guy in the world, but a great movie make you smile when you're arriving home for the cinema and you still smile...<br/><br/>Congratulations to the producers and the writers, you have a good movie here, is not a blockbuster in my country, because people don't want to see the good American cinema, but it's OK! Keep going!"
"daniel_mayhew","10","2","9","6 December 2006"," Excellent Movie, combining Comedy and Drama with ease....
","Watched this film just the other night, and was blown away with not only how funny it was, and there are some damn funny scenes in this which made me laugh out loud, but also the dramatic side of the story, which really hits home, and makes you realise just how good this cast is, especially Sandler, who's acting skills seem to be very underrated in my opinion. I think the way the film blends the comedy and the drama together is fluent, and never breaks the pacing of the story. Overall a kick ass film in my book, and highly recommended to anyone who likes to laugh, and likes to be taken on a cool journey through the good and bad that life has to offer."

","This movie made me very proud of Sandler. You walk into the Movie theater, or your local video store, expecting a typical lighthearted ""haha"" Sandler flick, but you may just walk out with a tear in your eye. I absolutely loved this movie. Sure it had it's funny scenes & elements, but ultimately, I was extremely touched by it. I haven't seen many of Sandler's movies, but I'd bet money that this is the farthest anyone has seen him stretch as an actor. He was amazing in this!! I loved it 100%. Five thumbs way the heck up for Click :) I think it to be important to get more than just a laugh from a movie. Like in the movie Big Daddy for instance. I'd watched that movie a couple of days before renting Click, and that movie too helped me appreciate Sandler's compelling energy. As an audience member, in both movies I found myself rooting for him, empathizing with him, and even crying with him. Sure the guys hilarious, but he's also a brilliant actor as well. And I can surely appreciate that."
"trigahappy","10","2","9","24 October 2006"," Mixed emotions. Overall hilarious
","i had heard mixed reports before going to see this, so I was a little apprehensive, although I do like Adam Sandler movies in general. There was a mixed audience of 12 years+ our group from 15 - 35 and a very hard group to please. We all roared with laughter along with the rest of the house. The majority of crying was from laugther although there was a tear jerking fairly grim moment when I thought it was going to crash with an abrupt end, but it still squeezed plenty of laughter out of us by the finish with a nice good guy wins ending. It was good to see the Hoff get it which was one of the funniest moments. This was backed by a great soundtrack making an all round great viewing experience."
"clements1991","10","2","9","7 October 2006"," Far more than just fart jokes
","I'm a big Adam Sandler fan and went in to this film to see funny jokes, a big of slapstick and of coarse, yelling. But this film gave me so much more than that, and not just the amazing special effects! It was riotously funny from the start but it didn't compromise the story. You got to understand all of the characters and when Christopher Walken's character Morty gives Adam Sandler's character Michael Newman the Universal remote he slowly learns it's power with the audience. I also want to mention how great an actor Henry Winkler is (which may surprise the casual 'Happy Days' Viewer). He's very funny and brilliantly portrays the poignant dramatic scenes. Yes, this is a comedy drama that actually has real emotion, so much so that I actually cried a little near the end. It's very powerful and gives this film a great moral overtone. There is still of coarse the farting and sex jokes which are funnier than you might think. Also, all the supporting cast perform excellently adding to the comedy and the drama perfectly when need. Most importantly, there are some scorching hot babes in the film as well.<br/><br/>So there's riotous comedy, special effects, poignant drama, wonderful acting and sexy babes including Kate Beckinsale, I give it 10 stars because they won't let me have any more starts so please, go and see this film, I can't make it any clearer how great it is!"

","From the beginning I thought the movie only was going to be an amusing comedy, but when the movie was over I got angry because it was so incredibly nice and I wanted it to continue. It was very amusing, Yes but also did it make me emotional and fascinated, in a good way. It touched me, and hopefully it will touch you. Adam Sandler does a great job and as usual he's entertaining. As for Kate Beckinsale you can say the same thing, playing the lovable wife of Sandler that takes care of the family. This movie is worth every single minute and I will sure watch it again, and again and again. I'm sure that not only do almost everyone like all Sandler movies, but they will also like all his future movies because of the greatness they all share, comedy, love, action, drama, they're all great."
"david-1678","7","2","9","4 September 2006"," What a masterpiece!
","When I saw the trailer for the first time I said to myself ""Well, this will be fun but nothing else"". Oh boy was I wrong, this movie is by far one of the best movies Adam Sandler has done. I want to compare this movie with Happy Gilmore and Wedding Singer because this was equally as good, if not better. You can expect the same hilarious screaming from Adam and as usual some kind of emotional experience. The best part was when the remote fast forwarded his whole life and he realized that maybe you shouldn't put your work before your family? What a touching scene and what a performance by Adam when he realized on his death bed that he had to tell his son that family was much more important.<br/><br/>A truly wonderful Adam Sandler movie. Adam has something for example Jim Carry doesn't have, the ability to be a serious actor and create a more emotional performance.<br/><br/>If you loved this one you have to see Wedding Singer and Happy Gilmore.<br/><br/>10/10 from me in the ""Adam Sandler movie category"""

Adam Sander is moving towards movie with massages and he is doing a good job for lots of teenager who watch him and he teach their parents to, so instead of complaining watch it with open mind and don't judge it learn from it.

"malikroberts16","10","2","9","8 July 2006"," '07 Oscars-sure
","This is probably by far one of the best movies I've seen this summer. If I actually had the prop remote from the movie, I'd fast forward to the 2007 Academy Awards to see what movies are nominated for what category. I think this movie is so good, that it will, or should, be nominated for at least 5 Oscars. Here is a list of the 5 nominations:<br/><br/><ul><li>Best Actor In A Leading Role: Adam Sandler </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Best Actor In A Supporting Role: Christopher Walken </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Best Actress In A Supporting Role: Kate Beckinsale</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Best Art Direction-Set Decoration: Alan Au, Jeffrey Mossa, Gary Fettis </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Best Effects, Special Visual Effects: John C. Hartigan, Patrick Clancey, Robert Antonini, Jim Rygiel, David Taritiero</li></ul><br/><br/>I saw this movie twice in its national theatrical run: the first by myself, and the last with a few friends after we all went out to dinner. I thought that, in the future sequences of the movie, the settings and effects were just totally, visually stunning, so I think that this should AT LEAST win 2 Oscars out of the 5 nominations, if not more.<br/><br/>Proof that this will win something at the Academy Awards next year, is the part when Kevin O'Doyle (Cameron Monaghan) and Adam Sandler's son (Joseph Castanon) are playing what O'Doyle calls ""drop"" instead of catch because Adam Sandler's son hasn't caught a single ball. So what he does is he pauses right as Joseph Castanon is throwing the ball. Sandler goes up to O'Doyle to lower his arm, presses play on his remote, and the ball hits O'Doyle's head and he ends up on the ground.<br/><br/>I also loved the script for the movie because it was a fusion of every movie genre that I love: comedy, drama, and fantasy. <br/><br/>Some parts, mostly towards the end of the movie where a young Michael Newman (Sandler) sees his future self just totally annoying his dad (Henry Winkler) just as he is mainly dropping by to look at his son. Also, when Michael's wife, Donna (Kate Beckinsale) sees her ex-husband in rehab after collapsing at his son Ben's wedding. After a few minutes, when Ben and Michael's daughter, Samantha, drop in to look at their dying father who has cancer, a guard forces them out of the room only because he said they've spent enough time there. Soon afterward, Michael manages to escape the whole building altogether, running after his offspring. Then, he falls on the floor, as Ben hears his father screaming his name. Next, Ben, Sam, and Donna all race to Michael to, unsuccessfully, comfort him. Before Michael dies, he weakly says to his grief-stricken wife, ""will...you...still.....love...me....tomorrow?"" Donna starts sobbing and says, ""Forever and ever, babe"". And then, he dies.<br/><br/>I think that Revolution Studios just might turn over a new leaf as they discover that they have a huge-hit movie after all."
"roxysurfing22","10","2","9","8 July 2006"," Best movie I EVER saw in my entire 14 years of life!!!!
","This movie was so STUPENDOUS that I had to go back to the theatre and see it again! It was amazing!!!! I couldn't keep my tears from coming out! It began as a funny, family movie that kept you smiling with the lines, but yet it wasn't overdone where it made you want the serious side to come out. It kept you on the edge of your seat when Michael, an average hard working man, receives a ""universal remote"" from a man located in the ""way way beyond"" section of a Bed Bath and Beyond. Turns out, the universal remote is literally a universal remote that remote controls ones universe.<br/><br/>Its funny as you sit through watching Michael turn from an average guy, to an overly unique man with such a device that can stop all the work, all the sicknesses, and most of all, all the fights with his wife! Life is pretty good for Michael, until he makes a drastic decision by fast forwarding through a whole year...the dragon tales era in his two kid's lives is over, his wife is on the verge of divorcing, and his childhood dog, is passed away. Michael's life as he knew it, is coming to an end.<br/><br/>You just about think things cannot get any worse but then suddenly, the remote takes control and starts fast forwarding things without Michaels consent. Michael begins to miss all the fights, work, and sicknesses, and most of all, Michael misses his wife and children!! Suddenly, Michael finds himself 600 pounds, no wife, and bloody rich with no one to share it with. Michael is devastated and attempts to gain his life back. But to his dismay, he winds up hurting himself, and finds himself 10 years later in a hospital recovering from a coma.<br/><br/>More occurs and Michael is regretting his entire life, he pretty much feels its the end of the world. Now i'm not going to give away the ending, but this move leaves you in tears and a smile on your face! In the end, it really made me appreciate the good things in life and it taught me to not take things for granted. It had a phenomenal beginning, a hilarious and tear shedding middle, and a remarkable ending!!!!!! this is my favorite movie ever! its amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"jts0405","10","2","9","7 July 2006"," Family First
","Adam Sandler gives a touching,tear jerking,heart warming performance. Different from his other films Click stands out one of his best. He screws up with the remote and skips the good part sex and work projects which take him a year to finish so this means his misses his wife and him going to a marriage counselor. He ends up losing his wife to his son's swim coach and he can't get a dog that won't hump the duck. This movie warms your heart and fills your eyes with warm and sad tears. The saddest part is in the end when he runs out of the hospital and is caught in the rain yelling to his son saying family is first. Then also when he relives the last time he saw his father. I recommend this to any tear jerking movie fan and to all Adam Sandler fan. You will definitely love this tale of love and it teaches us all a lesson that is true.<br/><br/>''FAMILY FIRST'' Grade: A"

And by far, this is Adam Sandler's best film to date. Some may disagree with me on that one, but i did just see it, so i have a little theater buzz still. If you like comedy, this film is for you. If you like a little drama, this film is for you. And if you like both, this movie will leave you satisfied and wanting more. I didn't want it to end, but all good things must.

Because people say they don't have enough time to do anything or they can waist it. Also people waist most of there precious time in work and doing unnecessary things, then taking time to spend with there family or friends. It's sad but true.

","This movie was very, very good. It shows the value of family and that you can't waste a moment of life on things that don't matter. This is also the first Adam Sandler tearjerker. Adam Sandler plays a workaholic father who needed a break from his stressful complicated life. So after a complicated episode at his home he goes to the Beyond section of Bed, Bath and, Beyond store. He finds a eccentric, but friendly inventor Morty (Walken)who gives him a very suspicious ""universal"" remote that controls his universe. It's very fun and handy. Until it adapts to his preferences that catapult him from an overweight divorcÃ©e, to a senile old business man. After finding out Morty is the angel of death. He become terribley depressed.

","Everyone should see this movie. While it's still got its light humor and funny moments, overall its goal is to teach its viewer a very important lesson. And it has a powerful way of doing so. <br/><br/>Adam Sandler does a great job of playing a serious character, but not TOO serious. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful and does an incredible job of playing his infinitely supportive and loving wife. Christopher Walken does, as always, an incredible job. What a great actor. His character is extremely important and, at times, quite comical and quirky. Henry Winkler (""The Fonz"") does an incredible job as a serious character who rarely falters in his morality.<br/><br/>Go see this movie. It will not let you down."

A perfect film, no - but an uplifting film that my family and I are still discussing, surprisingly yes! <br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the very spot on portrayal of the relationships in an average middle class family, and the pressure our current society places on achieving material success. I also enjoyed how humor was used to both develop the relationships, and to temper the drama without losing the message. This film really spoke to folks from our generation (Adam's & mine), and I think a lot of us saw a bit of ourselves and maybe didn't like that bit so much.

","I know that movies rated PG-13 are not guaranteed family friendly, but with much of the emphasis in the trailer placed on the family, I saw many families deceived into believing this was a family friendly movie. When did small children cursing become funny? A dog that continuously humps a stuffed duck - is this all that filmmakers think that Americans find humorous? While the concept and ultimate message is clever and good, the way it was gone about was an absolute disappointment. This movie falls in line with Sandler's typical movie and does not shine through like The Wedding Singer or The Waterboy.<br/><br/>If you like Adam Sandler and crude humor, watch this movie.

There is a menu, which when pressed, will display every event in you life, as if you are there right now. Once you take control of this remote, it changes it settings to fit your needs. When Newman needs time to do things, he can Fast Forward, rewind, and pause his life so that he has time to complete his work, and soon, he grows attached to the device. This movie is wonderful.

The movie is a comedy, tragedy, drama, and a fantasy all rolled into one great plot. Being that this movie is a comedy, all of the Sandler fans will go and see it. After the movie is over they will know like I know that he is an amazing all-around actor. This will make his movies such as Punch Drunk Love, Spanglish, and Empty City ,which is coming soon, more popular which is well deserved. I think that Click is Sandlers second best movie behind Billy Madison, but it is his best acting job yet. With every movie that he makes he gets better and better acting wise.

","Just got done watching the movie with my girl and my little sister and I have to say I count it as being one of the best damn movies I've seen all year... and thats sayen a lot considering I'm on a first name basis with the employees at the local suncoast video. I read the initial comment here on IMDb where it says Adam is all over the place with his comedy, I beg to differ... I think Adam is growing and evolving as an actor. To quote a phrase from a Kevin Smith movie, ""the real moneys in the dick and fart jokes."" maybe thats so for some and at one time it may have been for Adam, but lets face it, in the acting industry, if you don't evolve then you become as stagnent as an old Bevis and Butt-head episode and we all know where that show ended up. No, I think he's grown better and matured with each movie. Not only that, but this movie has heart. I'd rather walk out of a movie and actually feel effected by it then just go and see yet another mindless comedy. So on this one, hats off to Adam, Kate, Christopher as well as the rest of the cast for bringing to life a story that not only makes you laugh, but warms the heart and really makes ya take a good hard look at whats really important in life: Family."

","Not just another Adam Sandler movie. In ""Click"", Adam Sandler delivers what is ostensibly another bonehead comedy on the lines of Waterboy or The Longest Yard Remake. But it is much much more than that.<br/><br/>I couldn't understand the turn Christopher Walken's character makes halfway through the movie until the day after I had seen it. Why the ""Angel of Death""? Why not just the devil or even a Guardian Angel character like in ""It's a Wonderful LIfe."" The answer can be found in the book of Exodus in the Bible. In this book, God commands the Jewish people to cover their doorways with lambs blood in order to make the ""Angel of Death"" pass over their houses, thus forming the basis for the Jewish holiday of Passover. The fact that Sandler's character is skipping through his life creates a pun on this Jewish tradition as he literally ""passes-over"" sections of his life. The Angel of Death character then makes perfect sense in this context."

","This should have been the best movie ever right? I mean, a remote that controls the universe is something anyone would want to see but that didn't change the fact that this movie lacked all sense of quality humor. It is very irritating to me these days to see a lot of movies with potential go up in smoke because American settle for the casual lame pathetic humor.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler, given, is a pretty funny guy in his movies, sucked here. Personally, i hate all Happy Madison movies, except for ""Anger Management"", which was awesome. This movie had all this potential but the director, writer, whoever is mainly responsible, failed because they wanted to appeal to the average Joe's slapstick and loser genre of humor. So you can see why this gets so annoying. The same thing happened with ""40 year old virgin"". To appeal to American stereotype humor, the movie sucked.<br/><br/>Getting back to ""Click"". People who say that it is very sad (there are a few sappy scenes, but they are corny and cheesy, not sad)are pathetic and ridiculous. This movie is not sad at all nor is it honestly funny.<br/><br/>I give it a four because there were some parts that resembled Simpson/family guy humor that made me laugh.

","Click is not a typical comedy film, with two different parts to it. Apart from the predictable (but very funny) gags, there was an important moral to the film which was put across very effectively in the film.<br/><br/>The acting was very good, all the cast performed very well - throughout the funny and serious parts. The moral of the story was that you shouldn't neglect your family and take for granted the important things in life, this was put across very emotively, i'm sure it could make the toughest of people cry.<br/><br/>The film has a typical end; Sandler woke up and everything was a dream. However, despite the typical ending it was the most suited to the story - because it allowed him to relive his life as a reformed character, who will not make the same mistakes again.<br/><br/>In conclusion, an excellent film!

","Here in my town this movie has been released a thousand years ago, but since I'm in a rush, I had little time to see it. When I got aware of the fact that the movie was going to be displayed at my TV, I make an hour for it. People always told me that the movie was sad, but I didn't get it, I mean, isn't it a comedy? I didn't see it being sad, like ever. But then, I set my self to see. The movie starts like a normal movie does, showing the main problems that will be discussed along it, and the solution the main character found for it. When you realize, you are already in the middle of the movie, and yet, has seen little drama, plenty comedy stuff. You develop somehow a connection with the characters, feel bad sometimes, and laugh anothers. But it comes a time in the movie, where it shows how your mistakes can kill you, how you regret every bad move you did it, how what you wanted so badly back then, seems so useless by now. When it showed Michael learning by its mistakes, he realized that the fights, and the shower, and watching your kids grow, and being with your wife, were things that he didn't want, but now all he seemed to think was how badly he want that. His son's wedding, where his daughter called Bill her father, and he had a heart attack, was really beautiful, he regretted everything. And the cliffhanger couldn't have been no different, when he goes after his son, and he knows he will die, but still tries to talk to him, tell him to not make the sames mistakes that he did, hand his wife the paper, talk to her daughter and everything else made me crie, because I realized, how great was my life for me to be complaining for. I'm not a huge fan of happy endings, mostly because people never get to have one, but this one was truly beautiful, I wish some of us had the time to fiz their mistakes, to tell their daddies how much they love him, to be happy. The movie was truly great, it was like a fresh breath of hope."
"FilmFanInTheHouse","7","1","3","14 December 2007"," A Very Touching and Emotional Comedy
","Click (2006, Dir. Frank Coraci) <br/><br/>Michael Newman is a hard working family man, who must please his boss, in order to get promoted. Problem is he gets less time with his family, and wishes for a remote in which he can control his life. This soon comes true for Newman, when he meets Morty, a crazy sales clerk, who has the ultimate remote. A remote in which he can do anything, including muting, skipping and dubbing his life. He finds this to be the opportunity in which he can not only skip every argument, but also skip to his promotion. He sees this as a good idea, until the remote goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>The trailer for 'Click' doesn't really show you what the film really is. You might think it's just a normal 'soon to be forgotten' comedy with some moments now and then. It's much different. There are some good moments featured in the film which does make you chuckle, but there are also some moments which fills odd in a comedy. All the actors are a joy to watch, especially stars like Henry Winkler and Christopher Walken, and the make up effects are incredible in it. But the true joy of the story is the emotional tale it brings. It can become really upsetting, and i really did feel full of emotion during the final scenes. I really did feel like crying, as you could feel what he felt. I definitely recommend you watch this.<br/><br/>""You're not supposed to lay in the beds, but i do sometimes."" - Bed, Bath & Beyond Guy (Nick Swardson)"

I did find it surprising that the same group of actors that usually play a part sandler's films are not in this one, though I don't know who plays the character of Habiboo, it seemed like he had some prosthetics on his face.

The entire cast works perfectly together. Even the little kids are likable! Jake Hoffman is fantastic! I'm going to watch for more of his work. I was laughing and crying, sometimes at the same time. Makeup on the characters to show them younger (Winkler and Kavner) and older (Sandler, et. al.) is terrific. SO...

"MLDinTN","7","1","3","3 May 2007"," a man's dream- a remote for everything
","The whole concept of this movie is sometimes you don't always want what you wish for. Adam Sandler plays Michael, a guy who has a great family, but seems to be too preoccupied with his job. He's more concerned about pay raises then spending quality family time. One night he goes to a bed, bath, beyond, which is quite funny while he's in the store. He finds a door that says beyond above it and discovers this wacky guy who has a remote he's been looking for. But this is a special remote. It does what ever you want. Mutes sound, distorts images, fast forwards through what ever you want it too. So Michael uses it skip cold showers, traffic and he can't wait,so uses it to skip to his promotion. Only problem is months go by and he doesn't know what happened in the past. His wife just sees him as a barely conscious work alcoholic and of course this cause marriage problems. He gets fat and so does his son, and his daughter begins to dress like a hooker. And after one fast forward he learns he is divorced and his wife is remarried, but he is a very successful architect.<br/><br/>And the wacky guy turns out to be a dark angle. It's like other movies with showing what your life will be like if you don't make changes and put family first. Michael wakes up to find it a dream.<br/><br/>This movie is first part comedy, second part drama. David Hasselhoff is funny as the boss as well as the bratty neighbor kid. And Jennifer Coolidge is her usual greatness.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: One of Sandlers better films. I thought the first part had a lot of laughs and the film does teach a lesson in the end. I recommend it."
"aimless-46","5","1","3","1 May 2007"," Apparently Some People Liked It
","They keep letting this guy (Adam Sandler) make movies; most likely because audiences flock to see most of his stuff, as was the case with ""Click"" (2006). I'm not going to go into a rant about the sophistication level of those who patronize their local multi-plexus. Suffice it to say that ""Click"" is as good as at least half the big-budget ($70 Million) stuff that is being released to the mainstream public. It raked in some serious cash last July.<br/><br/>Apparently Sadler has a thing for Frank Capra, as this is his second attempt to remake a Capra classic (insert ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town""). ""Click"" is Sandler's take on ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946). At least I assume the Jimmy Stewart classic was what they were aiming at because the end result seems more of a blend of ""Scrooged"" and ""Being There"". ""Click"" is probably Sandler's all-time best performance; in the style of and equal in quality to a good Tim Allen performance. He is assisted by a supporting cast of recognizable actors; Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, and Sean Astin. There is also a brief appearance by Jack Nicholson's daughter Lorraine, who looks amazingly like Jack back in his ""Easy Rider"" days; this is actually kind of scary.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale has the same role that Winona Ryder had in Mr. Deeds. While neither of them rank up there with Jean Arthur (the heroine in both Capra classics) they are still two of the best actresses out there today. I'm assuming both were very well paid because the scripts offer little opportunity for either to showcase their considerable acting skills. In fact the mismatch between talent and opportunity produces a strange discordance in both films. This might be one of those cases where a less talented performer would have been a better fit. <br/><br/>George Bailey (and Scrooge) had an attitude adjustment after being granted visions of the past and the future by his guardian angel. Michael Newman's (Sandler) angel (Walken), who works in the local Bed, Bath and Beyond store, gives him a television remote control that he can click whenever he wants to fast-forward his life past the parts that are annoying distractions to his workaholic aspirations. At first this seems like a wonderful device as he can dispense with the family interactions that complicate his life. But Michael soon discovers that the device programs itself and shifts him further and further into the future. The remote can also freeze a scene, mute the sound, and select past scenes from his life; but the film mostly concentrates on its fast-forwarding function.<br/><br/>""Click"" is technically a comedy and apparently some find a lot to laugh about. There are some funny moments early in the production but I found the humor to be in short supply for most of the story; relying on humping dogs for its only running gag. <br/><br/>Ultimately ""Click"" has a ""Groundhog Day"" sort of theme. That in tuning out much of what life has to offer we miss life itself. Since this cold detached way of living is what most of us do (at least to some degree) it tends to undermine any comic quality the film might have. Of course unless your taste in comedy runs to Sandler's usual focus on bodily functions it doesn't take much to do this anyway. <br/><br/>Inexplicably, even at his most detached, patient and accepting people surround Michael. His wife (Beckinsale), his parents (Winkler and Kavner), and his children continue to love him despite the absence of any lovable qualities. Similar to those who love this film.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

Then you get to the second half of the movie which doesn't stop entirely from being funny but deiffinetly does show the more dramatic side of Adam Sandler(which he does very well at might I say)and delivers with an awesome dramatic portion which indeed made me tear up the first 6 times I watched this movie.

Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken are also good in this movie, Walken is always good but Beckinsale has kind of outdone herself here. I also have to say that Jake Hoffman does his minor role perfectly.<br/><br/>""Click"" shines with a nice script (i think we all have thought about stopping time, but how many films have really been made about it)and really good acting, except from the neighbor kid who just seems unrealistic and melodramatic.<br/><br/>As I said, th movie starts off bad and isn't very entertaining, but don't stop watching; it'll get so much better.

I like Kate Beckinsale but she has a habit of letting that British accent slipping in when she is suppose to be playing an American although she did keep in pretty much in check in this film. Christopher Walken carried all the true comedy in this film. He made it funny. The story line was tired. Guy works too hard, ignores his family, find a cheap way to fast forward through life. The only thing I think could have saved this film is if he had died in the end after chasing his son down to teach him the lesson he had learned. Life does not give us a do-over but predictably he got to go back and do it all over. No surprise. Maybe Sandler will one day come of his own but he is in the Stiller and Carey group and has not done it this time."

I didn't want to see this.<br/><br/>I know not to judge a book by its cover, now I've learned not to judge a movie by its previews.<br/><br/>I just caught this against my will on the StarZ/Encore network, and it is extraordinary, but not in the ways one might expect. The story is not unique, but it IS innovative. The finished product only rates around a 7/10. But Sandler's performance drives this work, although it is geared to be story-driven.<br/><br/>The work is reminiscent of A Christmas Carol by Dickens in that the main character has the opportunity to leap forward in time to see where his life is headed. Much like the Tarot, the remote he is given by the archangel Michael, only shows him what will happen if Sandler's character stays on the same path. It does not cause things to happen, but merely shows what will happen if changes are not made. This has nothing to do with Yule-time sentimentality's, yet it carries the same feeling of hope and love.<br/><br/>I won't underestimate Sandler again.

A universal remote, that allowed him to fast-forward and rewind to any part of his life. A big problem come when it start to take control over his life choices.<br/><br/>What I really like about this movie is total unexpected story, though quite predictable but the sad story was totally surprising. This film is quite meaningful but almost every movie of his do have hidden message like Water Boy - to stand and believe in one self, Billy Madison - to grow up and take responsible. So it is not surprise that this movie also has one - don't take family for granted. Nice.<br/><br/>The cast of this movie quite awesome especially David Hasselhoff and his ultra ego womanizer is funny. One thing I don't really buy that much was Kate Beckinsale as an Adam Sandler wife, lol. And though in real life she is a mother I don't really feel mother wives from her on screen. And Christopher was great as creepy looking scientist.<br/><br/>This movie has been Oscar nominated for best make up for fat suit that Adams Sandler wear and it is one of the best fat suit I have ever seen, specially that movement of his fat and stomach.<br/><br/>This movie consists of many time changes that I find it quite surprisingly interesting. I did quite expect to see the 80s' but not the long future ahead. The change of the set and location make the make more exciting. Though as the film gone by everything seem so abrupt but consider the pace it was all right. If you gone for 2 min bathroom break you'll be missing quite a lot.<br/><br/>I feel they should added more humor and I feel the movie was a bit too long but overall it is a very satisfying experience and worth every penny.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Do Expected Sad Movie.

","This is one of those movies where if you have seen the previews, you've already seen every funny moment in the film. I can't really figure out why a movie that starts out in such a promising manner takes a U turn in the middle to become so depressing.<br/><br/>It seems as though someone once told Adam Sandler that you can't make a movie a comedy from start to finish, so he is always looking to inject some ""drama"" or ""moral"" to his work. Unfortunately in this movie the drama is so over the top, you almost forget this was supposed to be funny in the first place. The premise for ""Click"" was clever, but after the first half hour it is no longer entertaining."

","Michael is an average day guy that finds life unfair but then asks someone at a store for a universal remote control. Morty then gives Michael a average looking control. Michael, obvously thinking this is just a remote for the television goes back home and then discovers it can change colour of people, turn their volume up or down, fast forward/rewind, pause, make them speak different languages, etc.. Not long into the story he begins to fast forward things he doesn't like such as work, traffic, fights with his wife, backrub (but he discovers backrubs always lead to sex with his wife which causes him to miss sex). Then every time one of those things comes up it automatically fastfowards through that event, leading Michael through years and years of his life and he is doomed unless he does something about it...<br/><br/>First of all let me say this film was brilliant. What I liked about the start was it got straight into the control. About five minutes into the film Michael gets the control. You get some great laughs and some of the scenes are very emotional.<br/><br/>I defiantely recommend this film to all!"

It is written with so much imagination. Comedy, Drama, Fantasy/whatever you will call it... all in all, Click is is strong and one of a kind. Being an actor, myself, I am very choosy when it comes to criticizing a film. But the acting was top notch, and the characters were very nicely developed.

","Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is a workaholic architect who lately, has been putting his career before his family. While at a Bed Bath & Beyond one night shopping for a universal remote he meets a man by the name of Morty. (Christopher Walken) It's Morty that ends up changing Michael's life with the gift of a remote that not only controls the TV and other household appliances, but his own universe. Upon discovering the abilities the remote has Michael begins to use it to fast-forward through what he considers unpleasant and annoying. Such as fights with his wife and foreplay. As he does this the remote begins creating its own memory and eventually starts to automatically choose what to fast-forward through. Michael unremittingly goes further and further through his life as the remote continues to fast-forward. In turn, he realizes the importance of spending time with his family.<br/><br/>'Click' seemingly starts out will with its cutesy family wisecracks. And the first couple instances where Michael uses the remote for his own personal kicks is somewhat funny. After that, there really are no laughs to be had. It's just the same joke exhibited over and over again with different alterations. Even the dog Sundance's incessant humping of a stuffed duck gets old real quick as the film advances. This is tragic because 'Click' is being passed off as a comedy but unmistakably isn't funny.<br/><br/>Another fault the film bears is the main character Micheal is nowhere as entertaining as Morty. Not only did Walken do a better job of acting, he is overall more enjoyable to watch. Truth be told, Morty is actually the only thing that holds this mess together. And only slightly better than average direction by Frank Caraci who also did two of Sandler's other films ('The Waterboy' and 'The Wedding Singer') only contributes dullness to this already colorless movie.<br/><br/>There are however a few heartfelt moments displayed throughout the extent of the film. But in the final scenes there's supposed to be a big profound moment when Michael desperately tries to tell his son how family comes first with his last breaths but Sandler just doesn't deliver. Who honestly expected splendid acting from him though? But despite all the downsides 'Click' presents, many people will still enjoy it. What can I say, fart and sex jokes sell."

","This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.<br/><br/>It was like the movie had schizophrenia. If you are going to make a movie with toilet humor you should stick with that. If you are going to make a ""life-changing"" drama, first of all don't use Adam Sandler, and second of all just stick with it then. You can't cater to both ends of the spectrum, well not like this anyway. I mean there are jokes in there for little kids, but it is not a little kid's movie. The humor was for children but the drama was for adults (I guess) and the theme or moral of it was something you will find in every children's book but the also had ""adult jokes"" that were quite plentiful, I would not let children in the room for. It just didn't fit anybody. Like stretched out jeans in a thrift store.<br/><br/>Maybe the 9th and 10th grade Adam Sandler fans liked it because they thought it was ""sweet"" or ""deep"". But I mean really, whom are you kidding. BASIC STORYLINE: First Adam Sandler hates remotes because his children are smarter than him, he watches his dog hump a stuffed duck for a bit, He talks with the Hoff and Rob Schneider making racist jokes, he talks with Christopher Walken (who would have saved the movie if he had like 2 more lines), some things go by really fast, Adam Sandler is fat, Adam Sandler goes back to being skinny but is old, then he sort of dies, then he comes back to life (I think the writers were on crack cocaine by this point, ""Hey! Wouldn't this be a great idea...?"" ""YEAH YEAH YEAH! WRITE IT IN THERE! NOW!"") and then everything is good... except for the somewhat homosexual Bed, Bath, and Beyond employee which I found very distasteful to put something like that in. Way to enforce negative stereotypes that have been enforced in every Hollywood movie since the whole gay liberation movement started, but that's another story. Poor Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Wow, that really changed the way I look at life and I respect my family now. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>Although there was some good things like the camera movement and special effects/makeup, but that doesn't cover for the terrible writing and not the best directing either. The movie made me think of a dying man trying to tell a joke, to put it simply.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if you liked it. It's just me being opinionated; you don't have to agree with me. You're still a great person!<br/><br/>P.S. I gave one star for Christopher Walken and one star for the special effects, especially when Adam Sandler is fat, if you were wondering what the deal is with the 3 stars."

Justifiably, and most memorably, Adam sends her into slow motion with a deft flick of his wrist. This may be the most memorable slow motion scene since Raging Bull... or maybe 10.<br/><br/>I'm calling upon all IMDb readers and posters to answer this call to action.

","Michael is an architect who works way too hard and can't seem to find time for his family. With too many remotes around the house he decides to pick up a universal remote to try and make his life a little easier. This is where he meets Morty, who works in the way beyond department. He gives Michael a remote that is ""beyond"" it's time from a technical stand-point. Michael soon finds out that not only can it control the television, but the universe around him.<br/><br/>Frank Coraci and Adam Sandler have worked together before; the results being The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer. Both films were quite funny and let Sandler do his usual yelling at everyone routine. Now they have hooked up for a third time and the result is ""Click"", a not so overly funny film that tried to jump emotional gears left, right, and centre.<br/><br/>While watching ""Click"" all I could recall was how everyone cried in the final moments. I'm sitting here asking myself, why? Sure the scenes do tug at your tear ducts, but in this type of film you know exactly what the ending is going to be and guess what, that ending happens. If you know in the end everything is going to be okay, where is the emotional value in that? Sure I felt sad that he couldn't say good-bye to his father and sure I felt sad when he was lying there on the ground dying, but I didn't cry. I don't see where all these tears are coming from. Either I'm missing something, or the audience is just more emotional these days.<br/><br/>In a film that has dogs humping ducks, an obese sandler groping his ""tits"", and flatulence jokes you can't really have the sappy ending this film does. I don't buy it. ""Click"" needed to stay in one frame of mind and not waver back and forth and teach us a lesson at the end of it. Numerous times I was reminded of Bruce Almighty here, it's basically the same film but one features a remote control. Both films showcase a dog with problems, a hot wife and a comedic actor being able to control everything around him. The difference is Bruce Almighty had so much more fun with what it had. Ask yourself what is funnier, Jim Carrey making Steve Carell look like an idiot on television, or Adam Sandler farting in David Hasselhoff's face? For the record, a dog humping a duck is only funny once, not a dozen times.<br/><br/>It takes a special guy to save a film like this, and luckily for the filmmakers Walken is that man. Christopher Walken steals the show as Morty, the guy who gives Sandler the remote. In every scene that he's in, he has this comedic tone to him that just gets to you, and you can't explain it. As for Kate Beckinsale, sure she is hot and sure she can play the wife role, but did she really do that much? Nope, instead she decides to run off with Sean Astin...speaking of which, is he going to be the next Adam Sandler Cameo Buddy?<br/><br/>I can only recommend this as a rainy day viewing. It's not the best, or the worst Sandler film. It does have some funny moments, Henry Winkler is perfect in the dad role and of course my main man Walken steals every scene he is in. You may even cry at the end, apparently, that's what I've been hearing. In the end, you most likely will end up disappointed with the fact that they didn't really do much with what they had. So much potential in the concept of a universal remote and it's wasted on Sandler's selfish doings. Instead of going outside the box and making a crazy flick, it plays it safe and does exactly what was shown in the trailers. On a side note, if you've seen the trailers, you've seen most of, if not all, of the comedic parts. So enjoy the film as much as you can. My final grade is a 6...and that's being generous."

These guys are regular staples of Adam's movies and were great in ""Little Nicky"" as ""fans of his father's work"". And even though another ""regular"", Blake Clark(6 movies), was ""in the movie"", his scenes were deleted. These guys have all done so many movies with Adam and it is always fun to see them again. (For more of Allen Covert and Peter Dante, I highly recommend ""Grandma's Boy"") It was good to see other Sandler film alumni such as Henry Winkler, Rob Schneider(uncredited), Tim Herlihy, Frank Coraci and Sean(50 First Dates)Astin in the movie.

"yourbigpalal83","6","1","3","26 November 2006"," A good film that looses its way..
","Click is one of those films the ads promote as one thing, and you end up getting another. Not that there is anything wrong with that, and in some cases, can be quite refreshing, but in this case it works agents it.<br/><br/>Click was promoted as a comedy about a man who gets a universal remote control that controls his own universe, and it begins to go out of control. This indeed does happen within the film, but, it leaps beyond comedy and turns into a sud sci fie drama before reverting to a Christmas carol like ending, which is to much of a leap for the film to take at its pace.<br/><br/>Thats not to say it ruins the film. Far from it, you do end up feeling lost in the life of Michael Newman (Adam Sander), but, it so quick, so random, and changing pace from Sanders style comedy to a drama, its to much of a quick transaction. We aren't given enough time to adjust and except the change, and when the drama begins to take place, we're zipped right back into comedy mode.<br/><br/>That said, the film works best as a comedy, only to loose its flow during the heavy drama scenes, almost as if the film itself is trying to be one, then changing its mind to another. When we are in comedy mode, it works so well with a lot of laughs. Even the fat jokes, to which i, being heavyset myself, took some offense to, managed to laugh it off because they were funny, only to have my laughter turn into sadness too quickly.<br/><br/>I guess i could say the old promo tag line of ""I laughed, i cried..."" but, to quickly. Also, there were some resolutions i felt were a bit rushed and left unsolved, like, who was Morty? Was he really who he calmed he was towards the end of the film? Also, were and why does this remote exist? Its minor details, but important ones, that gives a film a bit more texture and insight, but, sadly, the solutions given by the film didn't feel all that well thought out and very rush, as if to say 'dont worry about it.."" Overall, its a good, yet flawed film. Its has elements of your classical Adam Sander movie with the wacky jokes, the sometimes crude humor, and of course, his shouting, but, compared to some of his other films, like 50 first dates, anger management, water boy, billy Madison and happy Gilmore, and yes, even little Nicky, it seems to try a bit to much to mix it up, and doesn't quite manage to pull it off.<br/><br/>But, its worth a rental at least."

","Wouldn't it be great if you had a universal remote that you could use to pause, rewind and fast forward your life as you see fit? Skip past all the boring stuff, pause and rewind all the fun stuff. It would be a blast right? Then again, it does kind of sound like the typical ""be careful what you wish for?"" Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman. He is your typical ""Hollywood"" middle class, white collar husband and father. Impossibly cute kids, impossibly gorgeous wife, seemingly great job as an architect... not many problems to be found on the surface. Of course, as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that our protagonist needs more time in each day to play the roles of father, husband and successful business man. Through some goofy circumstances Sandler bumps into mad-scientist Morty (played for a paycheck by Christopher Walken) and obtains the ""universal remote"". This remote seemingly answers all of Michael's problems. It gives him all the time he needs to become a bigshot at the office, after which he'll have all the time he wants to spend with his family. Of course, comic and dramatic hijinks ensue, eventually leading Sandler's character to realize what the true meaning of life is all about.<br/><br/>Click is highly formulaic and as such, highly predictable. If you don't see every major plot point coming way before it's delivered, then either you weren't paying much attention or you haven't seen that many movies. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with formulaic and nothing wrong with predictable. Movies succeed or fail far more on execution than originality. Hollywood rarely reinvents the wheel, it just churns out different variations. The only real problem with Click is that it gets lost in it's own message and is eventually drowned by the weight of it's dramatic second half.<br/><br/>Everything starts out great. The comedy is delivered at a pretty consistent pace without ever diving too far into low-brow areas that Sandler's early movies were known for. There are some great supporting performances from Nick Swardson, Jennifer Coolidge, Henry Winkler and especially David Hasselhoff. This is easily the best performance I ever recall seeing from ol' Dave. He comes so close to going over the top without ever getting there and steals just about every scene he's in. The plot is enjoyable and the characters are funny, but you just know the other foot is going to fall. Things just can't keep going smooth for Michael.<br/><br/>Once things turn south for our protagonist, so does the move itself. Michael realizes that the remote is not the silver bullet fix he thought it was and the script does everything it can to make sure we understand that. We end up with a plodding second act that meanders and quickly loses steam. Sandler is allowed to stretch some dramatic muscles and does an admirable job, it's just unfortunate that he is allowed to indulge. The plot is lost with far more views into the future than need be. Eventually the point of the story is beaten into the ground and everything devolves into little more than Rick Baker's makeup effects. By the time the inevitable ""Tug at the heartstrings"" moment arrives, it's impact is dulled by the ponderous journey it took to get there.<br/><br/>Overall, I admire Click for what it tried to accomplish. Sandler is really a better talent then he's ever been given credit for and his performance here is really solid. The problem is that Click should have left some of the second act on the cutting room floor instead of going out of it's way to play up Sandler's dramatic side. What could have been a truly enjoyable 90 minutes clocked in at a somewhat lumbering 107.<br/><br/>Click won't make you want to change the channel, but it probably won't make you rewind and watch again either.<br/><br/>5/10"

My wife and I were hesitant to rent it because we are older than the typical audience that enjoys Sandler's movies. But, since we found ""Punch Drunk Love"" somewhat entertaining, we took a chance on ""Click"".<br/><br/>We were turned off by the typical crude humor Sandler is known for delivering. However, we felt that the other main actors (Beckinsale and Walken) did a nice job. Walken, in particular, reminded us of the eccentric, wacky scientist played by Christopher Lloyd in ""Back to the Future"", which we really loved. Winkler and Kavner were just so-so - a bit over the top, especially for ""old folks"" scenes.<br/><br/>If the plot had been focused more on the serious rather than the comedic elements, the film would have come across as being less scattered. From our perspective, the serious messages were worth the time and cost of renting this movie. But Sandler is just not a good actor. It was hard to feel real empathy for him - not because the situations he was in weren't tragic, but because he uses very little facial or voice modulation to convince us he is in pain or rueful about mistaken actions he has made in his life. Now, if Robin Williams had taken this role when he was younger (e.g., when he did ""Bicentennial Man""), the film would have been both funnier and sadder.<br/><br/>It was interesting to note that Sandler was one of the producers of this film. Too bad he couldn't rein in his ego and look for another lead actor instead of taking the role himself. The film would have been better had he done so."

","What starts out as a basic, yet toned down, goofy, predictable comedy evolves into a nice and touching story about family and life. Adam Sandler earns himself some more plus points to make up for movies like ""The Longest Yard"" and the distressingly un-funny movies of his acting dawn.<br/><br/>With a nice supporting cast, Kate Beckinsale, Sean Astin, David Hasselhoff, it's easy to predict the movie will be friendly and cheery and a bit funny. Thanks to adding Christopher Walken to the mix, things get funnier and at the same time a bit darker, like adding contrast to a digital photo.<br/><br/>Walken's role is cool, he talks and walks cool, and he squeezes in a little dance scene(check!). He's a nice counterweight for all the cheery, wholesome characters. Thanks to the script, the story never get's too sentimental and never to cutesy. It keeps it at a good level over-all.<br/><br/>So when the movie is over, you feel good. That's the point, it's a feel-good movie. And of all the feel-good movies out there, this one doesn't patronize it's audience. Thumbs up for that. There are still some bits with childish and low humour, but one gets the feeling Sandler is getting too old for it and that he's in a transitional state. Most of it is funny anyway so why complain.<br/><br/>DON'T believe the trailer. This movie is much better than that.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I've seen this movie. The plot is great. I like it, because everyone wants to control his life. In this film, the actor uses the remote control to control anything he doesn't like or he does like. He always busy at work and ignored his family. He uses this remote control any time ~ any where happily. But in the end, his wife divorced with him and has relation with other man. He is very regret. In the end of this story, he was dead. When he wakes up, he found that he lay down the bed in the store. He was happy that he still alive. When I see that, the plot touches me so deep. I was crying, because he can change his family life. I learn that people shouldn't do a thing that makes U regret entire of life. This movie is worth to watch!! I recommend it"

","Adam Sandler is an established comedy superstar who is a four-leaf clover for producers & directors who cast him in their films. Most of the films Sandler stars in are box office hits including his latest remote- control nutty narrative ""Click"". Sandler stars as Michael Newman, a yuppie architect who is dissatisfied with some aspects of his life. Newman becomes a ""newman"" when he meets Morty. He is the quirky Bed Bath & Beyond technician, played by Christopher Walken, who hands Michael a special remote control that gives Michael the enchanted power to control his life. The concept is alluring & witty, but unfortunately ""Click"" did not entirely click with me. I will let the remote control features elaborate: ""Play""- I did want to ""play"" with the luscious Kate Beckinsale who plays Newman's wife Donna. Not her supreme acting effort but who cares. Hey! You can't have your Kate and act it good too.<br/><br/>""Pause""- The sequence when Michael first discovers the miraculous workings of the control were amusing and worthy of a ""pause"" to digest the laughs.<br/><br/>""Rewind""- I was hoping the theatre projectionist would ""rewind"" the film to its first half when I encountered countless unnecessary moral plot elements during the second half of the film.

","This film is was a nice surprise for me. It was very far from perfect, but not as bad as other Adam Sandler films. I hate dumb American comedies without intelligent humor.<br/><br/>Please do not read the rest, if you did not yet watch the film.<br/><br/>Let's suppose that films start from 10.0 and this point is affected by each greater weakness, or mistake. The boring of the guy was disgusting (I have been eating my lunch while watching the film), thus, 9.0 point remains. Not much later Michael has fart in the room of his boss -> 8.5 point. The dog(s) with the duck was relatively humorous, but it had got too much focus on it (8.0). And then the film got better and better. I was surprised, because finally the story got a meaning. This is unusual in American comedies (nice surprise -> 8.5). Then Michael died. I think this is where the story should have ended. But... I do not really know why, the writers have continued the story. This was a really BIG mistake. ""Everything was a dream"" like ending has ruined the whole story (5.0). Why should Michael obtain a new chance? Oh... what a same! I was hoping not to have an ending like this. Still.. it is a good film, I think, one footstep in the right way, just do not stop here. Move along."

","There comes a time in every comedian's career, where they say to themself, ""Self, how will I be remembered? Have I made a difference? Am I just a big, life long fart joke?"" This film is Adam Sandler's atonement, for a career filled with body gags and yelling sprees, temper tantrums and booby jokes.<br/><br/>""Click"" is Sandler's attempt at ""It's a Wonderful Life"", a Scrooge tale of life's past, present and future. He has created a story meant to make movie goers feel like they must live their lives in the present, enjoy their kids, take care of their health and relationships, and not let work run/ruin your life. And if you don't mind the telegraphed plot line, you might enjoy watching it unfold.<br/><br/>i've always been a passive Sandler fan. i enjoy his two second sight gags and cameo appearances by friends Rob Schneider and John Turtorro. i also enjoy his angry rants and screaming insults. This film, though definitely trying to be more grown up and appeal to a wider audience, still offers those tidbits of Sandler past. (i especially liked the young Asian boy at the start of the film--talk about getting comedic mileage from such an insignificant role).<br/><br/>However, as the film progresses, Sandler does what cinematic history has seen from the likes of Robin Williams and Jim Carrey, and tries to put some dramatic weight into the film. Unfortunately, the plot is so predictable and obvious, that it would have been nice if he had put an ironic spin on the age old morality tale.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. i have complete trust and faith in Sandler's ability to take an everyman role and run with it. His brilliant turn in ""Punch Drunk Love"" is proof of that. Yet, as Sandler's star slowly turns towards the funny drama, as opposed to a dramatic comedy, his off-beat schtick loses its lustre.<br/><br/>What normally makes a film like this work, is a supporting cast that is just as willing to provide an impact in glimpses of the lead's past, present and future, and unfortunately Kate Beckinsale, Sean Astin, and Henry Winkler are mere charactatures for Sandler to act upon. Only Christopher Walken manages to steal scenes, though this should surprise no one.<br/><br/>I applaud Sandler for not resting on his past formula, while still giving fans a little of what they've come to appreciate from him. It's too bad that he wasn't able to give us a glimpse as to the future of the Scrooge fairy tale, settling instead for another rehash of the present story arc of second chances. This film is, in the end, easily forgettable, and like all things in the present, they quickly become history. Enjoy it while it lasts.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"
"moviemonster92","7","1","3","30 July 2006"," Movie Schitzo's Review of ""Click""
","Adam Sandler has made a career out of doing dumb heroes that eventually reach their goal at the end of the movie. For Example, take The Wedding Singer, funny tasteless and clocked about 90 minutes long (actully, it's 95 minutes long) and made good comedy out of it. But, he can also make heartbreaking stories. Take Spanglish for example, he was having wife problems but he got them resolved and made a heartbreaking story out of them. In Click, he combine his hilarity and his heart to create a character named Michael Newman, a family man who has a gorgeous wife named Donna (Kate Beckinsale, stunning as ever) and is a struggling architect trying to get up in the ranks. One night he gets so upset that he goes to BED, BATH AND BEYOND to find a Universal Remote Control to control his universe and through a door labeled BEYOND and meets Morty (Christopher Walken), a man who takes him through a door labeled WAY BEYOND and finds him a Universal Remote that is hot off the market and he gives it to Michael free. But once Michael starts skipping around his universe to make his business life his top priority and in the essence, losing sight of his family, the remote creates a mind of it's own and Michael can't stop it with very heartbreaking results. The cast works very well together in their roles and their were some side characters that were hilarious in their roles: David Hasslehouf as Michael's Boss, Sean Astin as their Son's swimming instructor, Julie Kavner and Henry Winkler as Michael's parents all make for satisfying cameos and the story is amazing and heartbreakingly real. So go and see this amazing and funny film and feel good about your life.<br/><br/>3 out of 4 stars"

One minute you're laughing and the next you've got tears welled up in your eyes.<br/><br/>I initially thought Click may have been a little silly, what with the whole concept of a universal remote control, however it is something I'm sure many people would want - to fast-forward through the bad, boring, mundane times in life and just be there for the good times - however there was a hefty price to pay. And so we should see it for what it is; that life is about good and bad times, happy and sad, exciting and boring etc.<br/><br/>I recommend it as a entertaining comedy/drama."

","I think that this movie was a real complex comedy. Of course it was very fictional, but Adam Sandler has that comedic swagger that makes him stand out every time as one of the funniest guys in film. Just to add complement to his role in Click was Kate Beckinsale. I love this beautiful woman's look, and acting. She has become a well known face in Hollywood I see. A very different role for her from the Underworld thrillers, but she really played her part well. I only wish that the ""super universal remote"" could have been used for more cheating than it was used for. Overall I enjoyed the movies comedy, and little bit of emotion it displayed. It really readjusted my expectations through."

A ""fairy"" (I think) gives him a shiny silver orb with a string in it. The farmer is told that when something happens that he dosn't want to experience, pull on the string. Small pull, a few hours. Big pull, days or more. Of course, he pulls too much. In the end of the fable, the fairy admonishes the farmer after the farmer cries ""where has my life gone?"" The Moral of the fable is that we should endure life's problems and experience life fully. I am not crazy. Can someone pleeeeze tell me the title of the fable and the author?

"iicool11","6","1","3","20 July 2006"," An average addition to the Happy Madison list
","Adam Sandler and his crew have been known over the years as the masters of the toilet humour genre. Whilst most of the films have been quite original (except for Mr. Deeds, which is based on Frank Capra's 1936 film Mr. Deeds Goes to Town), they have always been filled with ""fart jokes"" and visual gags. Whilst most films who go down this path end up looking stupid, there is a hidden intelligence in some of the jokes that allow these films to become successful. Recently, however, Happy Madison films like 50 First Dates and The Benchwarmers have not been able to recreate the successful formula of their past films. This newest film by Happy Madison Productions continues with the disappointing trend. Click is about Michael Newman (Sandler), an architect who spends more time on his career than his family. An important partnership is in the air and if he can do well on the project, he'll be in for the promotion he's been waiting for. This means that he spends even less time with his perfect wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale), his children and his parents (Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner). When a frustrating bout with the television remote leads Michael to a Bed, Bath & Beyond in search of a universal remote, his curiosity takes him into the Beyond section of the store. This is where he meets a crazy and eccentric inventor named Morty (Christopher Walken). It seems that Morty has created a device that will not only allow Michael complete control over his television and stereo, but his entire life as well. Michael discovers that the remote has the power to fast forward past a quarrel with his wife, and even allow him to travel back and forth through time to different points in his life. This ability to skip straight to the good parts in life soon leaves him feeling as if he's missing out on the total experience. Michael begins to realise that he has lost control of his life, especially when the remote is now programming him. Now Michael must find a way to stop the remote before it skips his entire life. It's amusing to see that Click's themes and its structure echo the ever-wonderful film It's a Wonderful Life (anyone who has seen the 1947 film will realise that there's an exact point in Click which mirrors a scene from the James Stewart classic). The themes of family values and friendship are always apparent in Click. The problem is that the film never truly kicks off and spends too much time focusing on the remote so that it is easy to stop being entertained. Too many fart jokes also don't help. One stand-out part of this film is the acting. Adam Sandler is still incredibly funny and he does a credible job in the dramatic moments of the film. Every character in this film was believable, with Christopher Walken just being in stand-out form. He was incredibly funny. Henry Winkler also isn't just a cameo and there is a heart-felt scene between him and Adam Sandler which is a real tear-jerker. Whilst this film is funny at times, it really never engages the audience to the level it should. The formulaic plot and structure also detracts from the film. Despite the over-abundance of fart gags, this film is funny, with serious tones; and the acting is very credible. Click is not one of the better Happy Madison films, yet not the worst."

But if this were a true Universal Remote, would it not have an ""Edit"" button and RWD would have some extra punch? <br/><br/>If a project could take months, then freeze your surroundings and complete the task and let time resume its regular pace?

","After reading all the comments and seeing many of the great critics blow off this movie, I was a bit skeptical. I decided it looked like a fun movie and went to go see it. I am glad that I did!<br/><br/>Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman who is a workaholic and finds out what dangers lie ahead for those who spend more time with their work than their family. This movie projects both comedy and a message that hits home for an over-worked generation of people.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Michael Newman wishing he had more time to spend with his family, but has a manipulative boss (played by David Hasselhoff) who makes Michael decide between him and his family. Michael, thinking that providing for his family is what is most important always seems to go with his work over spending time with his family.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the boy next door is always bragging about all the nice things his family has and all the wonderful things his parents buy him. Hearing this and knowing that he wants to do the same for his family makes Michael all the more determined to provide for his family.<br/><br/>One day, needled by his kids that the family next door has a universal remote that controls the TV, Stereo, VCR, DVD, etc. (and Michael being tired of always picking up the wrong remote to do what he wants) decides to treat himself and go out looking for a universal remote control. He then meets a mysterious man named Morty (played by Christopher Walken) who gives him a brand new, not-yet-on-the-market, universal remote that will control everything.<br/><br/>When he gets home he later discovers that this is more than just a remote control for things around the house. It it is a remote control for his entire life. What starts out as fun soon turns into a nightmare for poor Michael and in it is a lesson to be learned for all of us. The remote control takes over Michael's life and what happens next is both funny and sad at the same time.<br/><br/>I highly recommend everyone take a workaholic friend or significant other to see this movie. There is a lot of humor and a great message for every one of us in it!"

","I am an Adam Sandler fan, but what this movie made me realize is there are two categories of Adam Sandler fans. Those that loved Billy Madison and those that loved Big Daddy. Both are funny, but Big Daddy is a more mature comedy with a dramatic, sad twist. I love all Adam's movies, so I was eager to see Click. Click was not at all what I had expected! The film is so emotionally moving, I actually teared up at the end, which I also did during Big Daddy. I also busted out laughing several times which I've done at all of Sandler's flicks. The comedic dialog in this movie is quick and very witty, not silly and deliberate like Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. There are some one-liners that are absolutely hysterical but if you don't catch them you won't fully appreciate the sarcastic undertone of the movie.<br/><br/>Click shows how Sandler has matured as not only an actor, but as a man in general and how he's been capable of making movies that have matured along with his audience. This is not a chick flick, or a date movie, although it makes good for both. You could see this with anyone or all by yourself and still appreciate it. Yes, the ending is a little predictable and clichÃ©, but it gets the point across and the movie is still really enjoyable. I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>**Check out the red-headed neighbor kid!!!

"mercuryix2003","Null","1","3","10 July 2006"," ""Click"" Clicks, and the Critics are Idiots
","Any movie that disturbs Roger Ebert into saying ""this isn't funny"" and gives it a low rating based not on how bad it is but on how much it disturbs him, is a success. <br/><br/>I was expecting low-grade disgusting humor all through this movie, and there is some (especially an unnecessary fart joke that is not funny, but then are fart jokes ever necessary?) that should have been left out, but this movie surprised me. It's funny in some ways, very tragic in others. In other words it's (yes, you heard right) a multidimensional movie, which is not just odd for Adam Sandler, but odd for most American movies these days. <br/><br/>Sandler's performance is better than usual, which means for me I could actually stand watching him, Christopher Walken is Christopher Walken, except intensified (which means you must see this film if just for him), and the supporting characters are all solid, not just cartoon props. <br/><br/>This movie is not really a comedy; it's mostly a tragedy masquerading as a comedy that slowly reveals itself. <br/><br/>Without giving anything away, Adam Sandler gets hold of a ""Universal remote"" that really is Universal; at least in controlling his own life. Stupid critics have compared it to Bruce Allmighty, but it's the opposite. Jim Carey controlled everything around him within a limited sphere; the Universal Remote only allows Sandler to control (or so he thinks) certain aspects of his own life, but without the ability to really change anything. <br/><br/>Yes, it's a combo of Scrooge and It's a Wonderful Life at the end, but if every movie plot ever made had to be avoided, there would be no new movies (and maybe there haven't been for the past 20 years). <br/><br/>The movie works, it will affect you, disturb you and stay with you after you leave the theater; what other movie can you say that about lately? <br/><br/>By the way, most critics hate this movie, for the same reason Ebert hated it; it disturbs them (poor guys), and is ""overly-sentimental"". Considering the warm, fuzzy personality of most critics, this is an endorsement to see it you can't ignore. Seven Stars. It would have been eight without the fart jokes and other crude humor."

I taste *bleep*, I mean its really in there *gags* HEY! DID YOU PUT *Bleep* IN MY SALAD!"" Weirdest scene ever.

The path the story followed was funny when it wanted to be but it was not constantly swinging for the zany fences like Waterboy or Happy Gilmore.

Sandler proves that he is more than just a poop joke actor and can act with some sentiment and emotion. Kate Beckinsale did a good job as the wife and Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff and Jennifer Coolidge played their ridiculous parts very well.<br/><br/>The movie has a brilliant storyline and I was engrossed as Sandler lost control of his life and reached his tearjerker epiphany late in the movie. This is not to say however that if you are a fan of Sandler's typical movies that you wont like this one. This movie is hysterical at parts and it has oozes with Sandler's sense of humor.

He plays a character completely different yet still very hilarious...sure he has a couple references and gags from his movies that he always uses but you'll still love it. Sandler plays a father and husband..a ""trophy"" wife played by Beckinsdale and 2 adorable children who provide great humor. The storyline is one we've seen before...slightly different from Bruce Almighty.........he doesn't have the power to change everyones lives.....he can just change his own. This movie is not a comedy all the way through. All though you'll enjoy Hasselhoff (though I didn't), Dratch, Sandler, and Winkler........... this movie has a some touching parts that may leave you tearing up or crying on the inside.

Michael Newman(Sander) is a workaholic and he gets stuck between making choices with his family or making choices for work. he goes to some store and a guy name Morty (Christopher Walken)gives him a universal remote. the remote lets him fast forward rewind his life. the remote has an adimated feature that makes it work on its own depending on the reference. such as if Michael fast forwarded his shower multiple times it would eventually do it on its own. this leads up to some trouble later in the film. Click will no doubt will make you laugh and get emotional. this is one of Adam Sandlers greatest films."
"white_legend_69","8","1","3","30 June 2006"," Really Surprised Me
","I am a big Adam Sandler fan, and because of that I know what kind of movies he is in. They are normally comedies about a dumb guy trying to get a girl and playing a sport. And I have to admit I had doubts about Click after I saw the trailer, but having just watched it I am positively surprised.<br/><br/>The film starts how I had expected and having seen the trailer I knew where it was going. It is funny to a certain extent but you start to wonder whats going to go wrong, and how. After the playful parts of the film it does start to get interesting. It takes a more serious role and becomes less of a comedy and more emotional. It has to be the first Adam Sandler film I have ever seen that made me genuinely sad. But it does retain some very funny moments throughout. Although the end could have been better it lets the audience walk away with smiles on their faces but still really thinking about the message the film had to offer.<br/><br/>Overall this could be classed as one of Adam Sandlers best films. With some of his trademark jokes and actors from other films like Henry Winkler, Sean Astin and of course Rob Schneider. The film really comes through."
"pyrocitor","7","1","3","30 June 2006"," A bit of profundity mixed in with the typical Sandler formula
","I must confess - right from the get go, I expected ""Click"" to be a terrible, poorly conceived mess, barely worth seeing at all. The premise (a man receives a universal remote control to control all aspects of his life) sounded ridiculous and not even possibly coherent. Nonetheless, I went to see Click anyway, in the hopes that the always dependable Christopher Walken and star Adam Sandler might be able to raise the odd laugh. <br/><br/>Needless to say, Click is far better than initial impressions might allude to, and while for the most part it is a comedy and a very successful one, there is a surprising amount of profundity mixed in, touching on themes such as lifestyles and priorities; what is really important for us. While the movie does follow the typical Sandler comedy formula of comedic beginning, sad climax and emotional, life lesson bearing happy ending, it is surprising how well director Frank Coraci manages to handle the differing tones of the movie. Unlike last year's excellent summer comedy Wedding Crashers, the more dramatic upsetting ""life lesson"" segment of the story in Click does not contrast quite as evidently, it blends more seamlessly with the rest of the picture rather than an abrupt change in tone. <br/><br/>That being said, there are complaints which come to mind, the most evident being that the more profound themes explored in the movie are only scratched upon, when they could have been developed a bit deeper to make for a more compelling story. It's also true that the movie relies on typical goofball comedy schticks such as fart and dog humping jokes, or Sandler in a fat suit perhaps more than was quite necessary, the child actors get quite annoying at times (though unbelievably cute at others) and the main premise for comedy being Sandler's continuous dumbfounded reactions to his world changing around him as his life is fast forwarded (""Whoa mom, you're REALLY old!"") get quite tiresome and very repetitive after a while, but again, the material is handled much better than would be expected. <br/><br/>It's true that in different hands the movie might have crumbled, but with Adam Sandler in the lead, Click becomes a roaring success. Sandler is the pinnacle of both moods of the story, the light comedy and more serious drama, and manages to pull off both with typical aplomb, showing depth and skill rarely demonstrated before. Christopher Walken of course steals the movie with his increasingly unexpected and hilariously oddball appearances as Morty, the mad scientist style proprietor of the universal remote. There are also welcome supporting performances from Kate Beckinsale as Sandler's character's wife, managing to give a strong performance despite a horribly written character with next to no depth whatsoever. It's also wonderful to see former Fonzi actor Henry Winkler, giving a charming performance as Sandler's father, and the voice of TV's Marge Simpson, Julie Kavner as Sandler's mother. Sean Astin also has a small supporting role, being mainly the brunt of jokes directed towards his character wearing a speedo, but a noticeable presence nonetheless.<br/><br/>All in all, be prepared to be taken by surprise by Click - it boasts far superior storytelling than one might be lead to expect, and particularly impressive dramatic acting from star Adam Sandler near the end. Click may not be the most entirely mature and insightful film you've ever seen, but it sure manages to do so far better than one would expect. All in all, an ideal summer movie - worth seeing!<br/><br/>-7/10"
"three_am","8","1","3","28 June 2006"," Funny with a message
","I enjoyed this movie cause I enjoy lots of movies I watch in the theater. I expected, what everyone is calling, classic Adam Sandler movie machine - Waterboy, Wedding Singer - style of comedy. But it was actually a thought provoking movie. I did like the funny parts. I thought it was great seeing David Hasselhoff in a major movie being poked fun at (the fart joke was hilarious) and there were some very funny predictions of the future (Britney Spears having 23 children).<br/><br/>Adam Sandler has matured as an actor by taking these kind of roles. I was even surprised at the twist (Christopher Walken being the Angel of Death). But I knew that he never left that bed in Bed, Bath & Beyond.<br/><br/>Message heard, slowing down now and smelling the flowers."
"Andrewjc009","7","1","3","27 June 2006"," Another inane Adam Sandler comedy? Maybe not..
","I will admit this  I Don't like Adam Sandler. I Just do not find him funny, maybe it is the style of comedy that he does but the only comedy of his that I have enjoyed is Happy Gilmore. The only other exception being Punch Drunk Love, an indie drama that he was great in.<br/><br/>So it was with a wee bit of trepidation that I went into the film. I can happily say that Click far exceeded my (low) expectations and I was actually rather taken by it. I certainly doubted I would be enjoying another Adam Sandler comedy that's for sure.<br/><br/>The basic premise behind the movie is an interesting, if unoriginal one. Tired of having too little time and never getting a lucky break, Michael Newman (Sandler) cracks and goes in search for a universal remote to just make life that little bit easier. Up pops Christopher Walken in a nice bit part and answers his prayers. Little does Michael know that this remote literally is universal. Imagine the possibilities, its almost like playing God.<br/><br/>This is where we hit a problem haven't we seen this all before only a few years ago in the form of Bruce Almighty? Granted, there may be a few differences but the premise, character arc and moral of the story are the same. Michael at first abuses this wonder gadget and on the surface it makes all his dreams come true. But at what cost? What do we lose by fast forwarding through life, missing all of its eccentricities and peculiarities? I don't need to tell you how the film ends, we already know what will happen as we watch the movie  it is a Hollywood film after all. Nevertheless, even though I knew where it was going I was still moved by it.<br/><br/>Click has a surprisingly tender core and is actually more of a drama than a comedy, perhaps one of the reasons it appealed to me. It is by no means an out and out comedy, which is my impression of Sandler's standard fare. The dramatic elements of the story are a bit hit and miss but when I found myself getting emotional towards the final act  in an Adam Sandler movie of all things  well I have to concede it must be working on at least some level.<br/><br/>Other plus points come in the form of the beautiful, gorgeous, ravishing Kate Beckinsale. It's amazing, she actually looks hotter the more the make-up crew aged her. Seriously, those Grey tints are smoking hot! Don't believe me? Try argue against it after having seen the film. Seriously, hot. I was also very surprised and very happy when James Earl Jones (voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars films) popped up with a voice over cameo, excellently integrated into the 'commentary' function of the universal remote  absolute quality.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it? Grudgingly, yes. It's by no means perfect but you could do a lot worse with your money.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 7/10 Fans of Bruce Almighty, Adam Sandler movies, Kate Beckinsale, Christopher Walken and playing god should really enjoy it. People like me, who despise everything the Adam Sandler comedy represents, might do well to check it out also. I am not saying you will love it, but you might be surprised."
"samuelthemovieman","8","1","3","26 June 2006"," Terrific
","Yes, the plot isn't very original and this film does include the stupid humor that involves the fart joke, and the sex joke(involving a dog), but there are laughs in the beginning and the performances are alright, but towards the end is when shockers happen. I came in expecting a dumb Adam Sandler comedy that would keep me entertained for an hour or so. I got that but I also got something that deeply moved me, connected with me, and left me in a very emotional state. I practically had tears in my eyes at one point and that rarely ever happens. The film has morals that I strongly agree with, and makes for a nice blend of idiot comedy and strong drama. I do think that films plots aren't very original nowadays, and that's not different with this film but it's always nice when a film can surprise you and speak to you."
"Telescope-HF","8","1","3","26 June 2006"," ""Click"" Surprisingly Hilarious but also touching
","I was not expecting much out of Click-after all, the previews made it sounds like an air-head comedy about a guy who gets what any guy would want and uses it like any guy would (e.g. slowing down a running girl with bouncing breasts, or skipping fights with the wife). Well, the first half genuinely surprised me with hilarious but basic writing, such as Sandler telling his kids after seeing their dog hump a toy duck ""It's not dancing....it's something you shouldn't learn about for 10 or 30 years..."" The second half surprised me even more by being touching without being sappy. Without giving anything away, I will just say the lesson is ""Family comes first"". And one point my eyes were tearing up, and it's been quite a while since that happened (I believe the last time was watching E.T. when I was 9)<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is well worth your money-I paid $10 and I would pay the same to see it again.<br/><br/>As for taking your family-I would say 10 and up. Though there is some language and crude humor, the message is quite sweet.<br/><br/>4/5 stars"

","This has become my favorite Adam Sandler movie of all time. The movie has some very funny original scenes and some very deep and poignant moments that I wasn't expecting.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken's performance is great. I can't see anyone else pulling off this type of character while Adam Sandler has proved once again his ability as a believable dramatic actor.<br/><br/>One thing that I wasn't expecting, however, was to be crying like a baby during some scenes. The best way to describe this film is a combination of ""It's A Wonderful Life"", ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""The Family Man."" The movie has a more powerful message than you might expect wrapped in genuinely funny moments.<br/><br/>I have read some critic reviews (R.E. to be specific) and think that some of them should lighten up. This movie is pure entertainment. Don't focus too much on the types of jokes ... you'll end up missing the whole point of the movie."
"RCWjr","7","1","3","26 June 2006"," The usual Sandler.....just like we love him
","This is not for the serious thespians out there. It is for the summertime crowd looking for a break from work and the mundane.<br/><br/>Loved the concept of your life basically being turned into a DVD, with commentaries and special features. Sandler is putting work before family (the ""lesson"" of the film). To get past all the fights and uncomfortable things, he procures this universal remote from Walken so that he can fast forward, pause or slow down his life as he chooses to. The remote allows him to access ""special features"" of his life such as a commentary track by James Earl Jones, as well as deleted scenes and such.<br/><br/>Walken again puts in a supporting character performance that steals every scene that he is in. The guy has perfected being Walken and it was great to see him in action. The other supporting actors also help to pull this film up. David Hasselof(sp) does his best, well, Hasselof. He is as self indulgent as one would imagine the real guy is. All of his staff is filled out by Bay Watch beauties.<br/><br/>It is the supporting characters that help this film rise above the 6 I would normally give a film like this and made it a solid 7.<br/><br/>Sandler is Sandler. He isn't stretching the acting muscles here. But that is OK. Those who enjoy Sandler will get his full arsenal.<br/><br/>I thought Kate Beckensale was great. She is one of the hottest stay at home moms in recent cinema history. What I thought was smart of the script was to acknowledge the fact that she was/is hot and that Sandler is a lucky schmuck to have her.<br/><br/>All in all, a good way to get out of the heat and have some fun."
"jordan2240","8","1","3","26 June 2006"," It's not ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" but it is a wonderful movie
","I saw this with my 10-year-old and his friend. The premise was a little confusing to them, but they enjoyed the comic moments. I, on the other hand, was quite pleasantly surprised, though I must admit I've enjoyed most of Adam Sandler's movies. While nothing here had me splitting my sides, there were plenty of laughs, and as many have already noted, plenty of tears as well. Any movie that elicits this much emotion is a good movie as far as I'm concerned. While the basic message may be similar to that of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" the conventions for stating it are much different. One thing this movie has confirmed for me is that ""professional"" critics are basically pompous a**es who have no idea what the general public will enjoy in a film. I was obviously not the only person in the theater enjoying this one. Chances are, you'll like it too."

","This movie was great period. Well it just dosen't end there. This movie is great for everybody and especially people over the age of 13. Well i'm 16 and found it really funny. People nowadays are losing their sense of humors. For example, i watched airplane! and i thought it was the best movie in the world but my friends are hated it. I think that if you enjoy humor you will enjoy it. Also when watching click, make sure you watch with your friends. Adam Sandler plays a great role in this movie and so does the other characters. This movie is very effective and funny. It's also for people that like sad movies so please give Click! a chance to watch.<br/><br/>WATCH IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS"
"DocIndy","8","1","3","25 June 2006"," An Adam Sandler movie that will make you think
","A typical Adam Sandler movie will make you laugh but it does not really have much of a purpose past an escape out of reality into Adam's land of goofy escapades. This movie has that component too but it also has a message. The message is best left unsaid so that you can go see the movie. Adam plays his role well and does show some depth that he also showed in Spanglish. His control and lack of over the top persona throughout the film may turn off some of his core audience, but it might reflect the fact that Adam has grown up a bit. His personal life has probably influenced his choice in movies and he directly credits his parents at the end of the credits. I would advise waiting to see these few lines, but then again I always like to stay until the end of the credits. <br/><br/>The film is well paced and has a good script that has all the supporting actors doing there parts very well. Christopher Walken is again playing a character that is a bit off and he does the role with his usual flair. Kate Beckinsale plays Adam's wife and does a good job with the little screen time and the character she is given to play. Henry Winkler is great as Adam's father and it was quite nice to see Julie Kavner playing Adam's mother. I would guess she was happy to do a live action role and to play a mother of someone other than Bart, Lisa and Maggie. David Hasslehoff is great at playing a character that is a comic foil for Adam at work although I am not sure that all his fans of Baywatch and his singing in Europe will like this character. Even Sean Astin gets to play a nice little role. The music and special effects compliment the film without having the film be dependent on them.<br/><br/>Others will compare it to previous works and it does use a central character who is allowed to use introspection, but it is presented in a new way that made it fresh and entertaining. All in all a very good film and one that I would say is a good choice to see with your family members of age 10 and older."
"faking_lines","8","1","3","25 June 2006"," Wow!
","Maybe it was because I went in with such low expectations, or the fact that I can completely relate to the family in this movie, but in my opinion, this movie was fantastic.<br/><br/>Sure, it might have a lame plot. A remote that can control the universe? Okay, I agree, not exactly realistic. But the moral of this movie and the message they try to send across to the audience is evident and clear and I can assure you that all the workaholics out there who see this movie will definitely be inspired and will definitely think secondly and differently about their lifestyles.<br/><br/>There is a certain depth to this movie that I wasn't expecting. If I could give you any example, I'd say this movie is very similar to ""Big Daddy"". It's funny basically the whole way through, but what you don't expect is the depth of the father and son's relationship. This movie is not only intelligently humorous, it's a very emotional and powerful movie that won't be forgotten as soon as you leave the cinema.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler is great in this movie and has made his character a real character. He is a fantastic actor in general, who has the capability to make you laugh and cry and really feel compassion for his character. The family members are no different, and I know coming from a family who's father I only got to see once every three months because of work. I couldn't have said the message any more clearly--family comes first.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for more than just a good laugh, but something that moves you and can really make you question your paths."
"mshea2","8","1","3","25 June 2006"," Great but......
","I normally read these reviews before I take my children, ages 13,10 and 8 to the movies. I must admit I skipped it this time since it was an Adam Sandler movie. We were prepared for some crude humor but an overall acceptable movie. But my 10 yr old is saying that she thought it inappropriate. Luckily most of the adult humor passed over my 8 yr old head. I would recommend all parents screening it first and then deciding if it was appropriate for their children. As an adult movie, it was wonderful. I will have to think twice about taking my children to another Adam Sandler PG13 without seeing the movie first.<br/><br/>The cornflakes at the end of the rainbow was a little confusing for the children. The adults in the theater found this movie quite funny as it was mostly adults laughing. My 13 said he thought it would be funnier. I actually think it was quite funny for adults and sad at the same time."

","I know this will probably come off as sappy, but why not! Adam Sandler has definitely migrated from a pretty funny comedian to an actor with much depth in both comedy and drama. This story touched me and points out the importance of people who are so caught up in their career, getting ahead that the family suffers emotionally. Yes, the family may get the ""things"" they want, but missed all that precious time in bonding.<br/><br/>That's why I used the old title from a very famous Twilight Zone, where ""time"" was the issue.<br/><br/>Again, ""Click"" addresses this too.<br/><br/>We waste so much time on stuff which will never be as important as family.

"dpoll390","7","2","10","26 June 2006"," Fantastic in so many ways...
","This is a movie that is unlike any other Adam Sandler movie you will ever see. Not only is it funny, but it is something to learn from. This movie, unlike many of Sandler's, delivers a powerful message about loving the simpler things in life. The movie starts off a bit slow, but quickly picks up once you get into it. The movie is very funny, most of the situations and jokes you can very easily laugh at. Towards the end you start to see what skipping the bad things in life can really make you miss. The movie will make people realize that the bad times are worth living through because good times lie ahead. If you don't pay attention to the little things you love in life, like a daughter, or a son, or a beautiful wife, things some people take for granted, you may lose them. It makes you understand that so many people don't realize what they have until it's gone and ""Click"" drove this message into your head with it's almost tragic ending.<br/><br/>As for performances, as always, Beckensale is stunning, and delivers a good performance for the given character. Every age of son/daughter of Sandler's character Newman gives a good performance (especially his son at an older age). Walken is a little bit creepy, I've never found him to be too good of an actor, but I suppose he plays the part well. As for Sandler, surprisingly, his performance was the best in the movie, along with the Fonz...This is Sandler's best performance (along with Punch Drunk Love). He comes at the audience surprisingly, delivering the goods in his comedic, and stunningly heart-wrenching performance in ""Click"".<br/><br/>See this movie, you will be changed.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

This is one of those films that will make you think about your life after watching it, and will remind us how we take things for granted all the time. Christopher Walken plays another one of his crazy characters, but gives you a sense of warmth throughout the movie. You will laugh, cry, and applaud during this film...guaranteed.

"boralzino","1","1","4","6 November 2019"," Click (2006)
","People who copy their political opinion from stand-up comedians are fucking idiots.
But by God, did George Carlin have a point when he said America is one big shopping mall.
Click embraces this statement with open arms.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman, an architect who is too busy with his work to spend time with his family.
After some scenes with the typical Happy Madison (the by Sandler founded production company that produces all his films) spiel, Michael goes to a shop where he comes across Christopher Walken, who gives him an universal remote.
The gimmick is that the remote controls the universe instead of his TV.
So Adam Sandler goes on with his life, fast forwards whenever he's bored and changes the brightness on himself so he can get a tan.
The remote is programmed to recognise his personal preferences and fast forwards after a while through his life where Michael has no control over whether it fast forwards or not.<br/><br/>The humor is like a lukewarm beer.
People who fall down, get kicked in the crotch, or get ridiculed by their appearance.
It's funny because Adam Sandler has a fat ex.
It's funny because he has a funny name.
It's funny because he is a she.
All in all, humor who mouthbreathers find hilarious.<br/><br/>It all culminates with Sandler who has eventually fast forwarded too far in his life.
He dies in the rain while sad violin music plays.
This isn't rare for a Happy Madison film: tricking the audience into thinking the film has a heart.
But no, it appears the entire endeavor was a dream and Sandler does his best ""It's a Wonderful Life"" impersonation.
Or not, because he gets a new remote which he immediately throws away.
Calling it corny and clichematic is an understatement.<br/><br/>One of the reasons that I decided to review Click instead of such Adam Sandler classics like ""That's My Boy"", ""Jack & Jill"" or ""Eight Crazy Nights"" is that the public opinion for ""Click"" is relatively high, for a Sandler flick at least.
I have to admit, there are good Sandler films.
""Funny People"" was good, although it's almost a critique of Sandler's work.
""Punch-Drunk Love"" is also worth a watch.
Probably because the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, writer-director of ""Boogie Nights"" and ""There Will Be Blood"", had a vision.
I don't know why, but especially Americans fall for the typical Sandler film.
Click alone won back 230 million dollars.<br/><br/>The film itself betrays its message, spending more time with family and less with work, by focusing more on work by stuffing the film with ridiculous ""surreptitious"" advertising.
If the film doesn't follow its own message, what's the point?
The true message behind the film is searching for answers.
Always finding meaning behind everything.
In a scene Sandler doesn't remember what the song was when he and his wife first met for each other.
What he then does is winding back to the exact moment and back to the present to tell his wife what song was playing, and what she wore.
Is there something more American than finding meaning behind everything?
What if Pulp Fiction just told you what was in the briefcase?
What if Das weiße Band just told you who commit the crimes?
What if The Shining had a voice-over at the end which explained to you what happened to Jack?
Click would sell its own message in clean, small packages in stores for $3,99.<br/><br/>In George Carlin's vision of America ""Click"" would be constantly played in malls.
That is the only thing it's good for.
No impact on culture, only box office success, to eventually end up in a 2 for 1 DVD sale at a mall."

","Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is an angry family man. He has to deal with idiotic clients at his work as an architect. His family led by his wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale) wants more of his attention. One night, he goes out to buy an universal remote. Only 'Bed, Bath and Beyond' is open, and Morty (Christopher Walken) goes Way Beyond to get him a special remote.<br/><br/>Sandler ruins this movie at every turn with his anger and hatefulness. He doesn't like people and the audience can feel that. It doesn't take long before Rob Schneider plays a racially insensitive character. It's got Sandler's brand of childish humor. All of it is salvageable if Sandler's character is played nicer. It would be better for him to be a lovable loser. The story of a man finding his way to reconnect with his family is a compelling and heart-warming one. It's just that Sandler's character keeps annoying me and stops me from liking this movie."

","I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler, yet it's not why I hated this movie. First of all it was very predictable. The moment her jumped on bed in that Bed and Bath, I knew he was going to wake up 10 minutes before the end of the movie and save it all. And as the movie dragged on and he never woke up I was getting worried.. when is this movie going to end. I think I had the same feeling Adam had when he had to wait for a couple of month to get promoted and just had to press >> on his blue universal remote control. Lots of bad jokes and I don't remember laughing once. I knew I was going to watch some stupid easy-watching American happy-ending comedy, still this was very disappointing. Comedies can be much much more intelligent and entertaining. Adam doesn't know how to act. sometimes it felt like he was reading his lines from behind the camera. no expression on his face. The silly jokes are endless.. the ""can I go to the bathroom"".. or the dog 'wrestling' with that yellow thing. the arab prince habeeboo.. hmm.. i can keep going. and now I'm thinking of one good joke and I cant remember one. (and what's with the assistance changing sex??) The only thing I guess was enjoyable in this 'movie' was watching Kate Beckinsale and her 'rockin body'. I think I won't give Mr. Adam any more chances. I'm done with him! In brief: -Too predictable -Too long -Too stupid -Bad acting -Bad jokes -Tries to be a drama -Tries to be a comedy -Adam is in it -Kate is hot -Only Adam can fastforward, you can't!"

The movies definitely makes you evaluate your own outlook on life. Every time I see it, I hold my husband just a little tighter at night. I was surprised to see Adam Sandler take such a roll. I'm not used to seeing him take on ""family man"" rolls. But he did do a great job. I like how Adam Sandler manages to cast at least one of his friends in all of his movies.

I was also glad to see Christopher Walken and Henry Winkler rounding of the edges with simple but entertaining comedy. David Hasselhoff, who I have only seen on baywatch twice, was splendid as Sandlers boss. Pretty much excellent casting throughout this movie. Besides, its pretty clever that the writers made a good movie about a remote control. Hats off to Adam Sandler and its good to see a movie can still bring tears to my eyes.

Sure, at the beginning there are the usual crude jokes, and innuendo, but by the end of the film I was in tears. It certainly makes you look at your own life with a different perspective. Our 10 year old made me watch it, after he had seen it at the movies.

","Great movie that I had to fast forward through some parts because it was so painful. The great moral is how we lose so much of those precious things in life. Things such as our children, marriages, parents, friends, health, and TIME that are lost because we learn of their value only after it is too late. So it is a great movie that can make your life better and fuller if you simply take it to heart. It is also entertaining and funny, but the value is not in the comedy but the lessons in life that is so desperately needed. On a final note, the IMDb requirement to write 10 lines does not make any sense to me and I think that it should be reduced to 7 (seven). Thank you."

","Click is about an architect that almost wastes his life at work rather than with his family. A modification of the film A Christmas Carol, Sandler meets the angel of death and visits various points in his life to see the good and the bad in the choices he made. The moral is, live your life as if every day was your last day and keep close the people that mean a lot to you. You never know when they will be gone and every minute gone is one you will never get back. A very well made film with a classic plot and a chance for a do over. Sandler has gone from completely annoying comedy for the sake of a cheap laugh to good solid comedy with a soul. Bravo for this relatively clean, but slightly suggestive comedy for those over their mid teens."

So I assumed maybe it was going to be on the DVD. Nope. It sucked. The alternate ending was better than this one.

","I have to say that as a fan of Sandler since his movies like Billy Madison and Bulletproof (Ok, so maybe not that one) he has always took an idea for his movies since The Wedding Singer and shown he has more than a knack for being silly but can actually act! Click is the story of Sandler's character Mike Newman who, because of his job, has found he has almost ZERO time for his family and is constantly ungrateful for having them. Enter Morty, played wonderfully by the always welcome to see Christopher Walken. Morty offers Mike a chance to finally control his life through the use of a Universal Remote that can actually control the universe itself! Mike learns however, that control of his life and everything around him has consequences which he never realized or thought through as the device begins to leap forward through his life, making him miss a lot of times with his family.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something raunchy and standard with Sandler's past movies, this isn't what you'd expect.

Great acting from the whole cast, as well as Sandler's old buddies hidden throughout the film, can you spot them all?

At first I thought this was going to be a stupid comedy because I mean what could you show on screen about a remote that controls your life. It really surprised me.

"jessicalevy-1","5","1","4","19 August 2006"," Nothing new
","I was pleasantly surprised by Adam Sandler's performance, which proves him to be an excellent actor as well as comic, and was executed with taste- unlike the storyline. I think that the message was communicated well, however I found it unpleasant to watch. In films tackling devastating experiences, they are made great by the writer's and director's ability to uplift their audiences, and make their experience richer by seeing experiencing any unpleasantness. Yet I felt there was no relief from the depressing spiral into which Sandler's Michael was falling. I felt uncomfortable and awkward at points. And the last ditch attempt at comic relief- the unnecessary jab at obesity was its low. Walken was a pleasure to watch, as ever, and Beckinsale acted well- yet her character was unrealistically coiffed without any flaws whatsoever. The beginning was nonsensically drawn out, but I was really impressed by the section of the film that covered the future- it was done very skillfully. Despite this, it was an interesting watch. I don't consider it an awful film and Sandler was engaging. What I felt were faults could well be better appreciated by others. Though I'm not sure who would appreciate the 'it was all a dream' shebang- please no"
"apukhayev","5","1","4","10 August 2006"," Somewhat deeper than required
","Clearly the movie about the remote control for anything can not be considered a world cinematography heritage in the first place. This was clear from the beginning, but it is an entertaining idea as is any idea with magical wands and movies such as Bruce Almighty. So, we thought it was going to be fun and it was, until the problems such as father-son relationships and whatever else started to materialise. Now, I wanted to cry instead of laughing in the end. Under any other circumstances I would consider this a good outcome as the movie touched me deep inside, but in this case I left the cinema confused, which should not have been the outcome for a comedy about magical clicking device. It was entertaining, but I would not strongly recommend it to friends. Just if they need advice for how to kill some time."

","*Forewarning: This is possibly a bit of a spoiler, touching on the direction that the film takes, but does not give away any real details.* <br/><br/>Overall, Click is an excellent movie. Naturally, one would go to an Adam Sandler movie expecting it to be all comedic throughout. I saw this movie on a particularly hard day, where I was extremely depressed and nearing rock bottom, thinking about dying and how my life was just passing me by. At first, Click helped me to forget about these feeling and I cheered up a bit watching Adam Sandler's amusing antics and the overall lighthearted, funny feel of the movie. But as the movie progressed, and surprisingly became more serious and dramatic, I found myself trying to hold back tears, because the movie was touching on some very tough issues I was dealing with. I am not trying to give anything away about this movie but for those who have seen it, you will understand. As the end of the movie drew closer, I was in tears. Yes, I am a man, and it was very surprising to me that I was crying during any movie, let alone an Adam Sandler movie. This was all new to me, but having a good cry in the dark movie theater was something I needed, and it made me feel quite a bit better physically, despite my emotional state upon exiting the theater and for a little while afterward.<br/><br/>I would recommend Click to anyone. It is a very good movie, and it is so much deeper than the previews would lead you to believe. I do not, on the other hand, recommend watching this when feeling down, because it will get to you at some point."
"MovieAddict2016","6","1","4","16 July 2006"," Not great comedy - but a fun, lightweight movie that serves its purpose and is thoroughly entertaining
","Instantly reminiscent of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Bruce Almighty,"" ""Click"" is a simplistic and lightweight comedy that serves its purpose as distracting entertainment. It's a typical summer comedy - nothing very deep or meaningful, but humorous with an obvious (yet admirable) message behind it. It's another Adam Sandler movie but not quite as crude as some of his others. It reminded me most of ""The Wedding Singer"" in terms of its humor - it's not as slapstick as some of Sandler's other works - but I actually preferred it to ""Wedding Singer."" Sandler plays an average Joe who has trouble balancing time between work and family. He's a rising architect working at a firm for David Hasselhoff (his casting was a pure stroke of comedic genius - well, it was a good choice, anyway) and has been assigned to a new Japanese building, which ends up consuming all his time at home and makes him neglect his family.<br/><br/>When he ventures to Bed, Bath & Beyond to purchase a universal remote control, he enters the Beyond Department and meets Morty (Christopher Walken), who gives him a true universal remote - a remote control that can control his world. He can pause, fast-forward and rewind his life.<br/><br/>With his newfound power Sandler finds time for work and family, but soon the device causes him to skip over too much of his life and before he knows it his kids are teenagers and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty obvious and so is the message - some critics have complained that the film's alternating between basic comedy and meaningful drama (especially towards the end) is annoying and off-balance - but I didn't mind it.<br/><br/>Sandler is better than usual although not entirely believable as a married man or the husband of Kate Beckinsale (who is stunning as usual). It's really Walken and The Hoff who steal the show - I loved Hoff's sexual harassment speech. (Hoff: ""Now, homosexual harassment. This is, like, when a dude touches another dude at work."") Overall, if you think you won't like this you probably won't. It's one of those movies where it meets your expectations - you can tell exactly what it's going to be like from the commercials, and if you think watching a lightweight Adam Sandler comedy for 90 minutes is a waste of time, I wouldn't recommend this to you.<br/><br/>However, if you can appreciate the occasional brainless comedy then you'll probably find something worthwhile here. If you liked ""Bruce Almighty"" this will appeal to you."
"Knoxvicious","5","1","4","8 July 2006"," The good and the bad
","I feel the need to give this movie a five just because of the brilliant ending. <br/><br/>First, let's start with the beginning. <br/><br/>The first hour or more is pretty bad.....poor joke after poor joke. Of course there were some moments but manly you could hear embarrassed chuckles around you throughout the movie. It's somewhat interesting but to me, comedy is the hardest to make. You don't only need to entertain people, you have to also make them laugh and if they don't then not only will not like this movie but they will feel embarrassed for it. Before even seeing Click I had the idea that it was going to flop. And it did. <br/><br/>At first. <br/><br/>You see, the ending had a much, much more serious tone. While you watch maybe 30 minutes of the ending not only are there emotional scenes but it also really makes you laugh for real at the funny parts. For people who have even experienced anything emotional in their life they seriously might cry. The ending also made you leave with a happy and warm feeling for Adam Sandlers character and, you know, just made you smile. <br/><br/>If you watch this movie try watching, just try, watching all of it. The ending is the best part. It's the only reason why I felt the movie wasn't a total and complete flop."

Anyway back to the movie - it is a very nice comedy, has great jokes and yet a very good plot, makes you think about what really matters in life and although the end is somewhat expected, hey it is a comedy and what is a comedy without a happyend. Last, but not least I want to comment on Adam Sandler's acting - I am not sure if it is just the good script, but I think this is the first ever movie that I see that guy actually acting!

Unfortunately, there are a few too many sexual references and too much cursing & swearing here and there. It's not like they use the F* bomb all the time or anything, but there are just a few too many curses in general for an audience under 10 (in my opinion).<br/><br/>For the older audience (over 45), I expect fewer will like it a lot, but some will. Again, that juevenile characteristic comes out and will drive some of the audience away.<br/><br/>By and large, I liked it ... quite a bit. I give it an 8, but it could have been higher if they had cut the curses a little (I mean, the word ""crap"" does get the idea across just as well as ""Sh!t"", but it's less offensive), and it could have benefited from a clearer distinction about the target demographic. (less or more childish, depending on who they are targeting). 14A is too vague.<br/><br/>Just my 2 Cents :D"

","OK I have never been the biggest Adam Sandler fan, I'll admit it but this is just crazy. I now have to admit that he can act (darn, drat et cetera). The proof is in this movie. He plays an junior architect at a firm who is just trying to make a better life for his family and works too hard and too many hours (just like lots of us out there). He goes looking for a universal remote to make his life simpler and that's where the fun begins as his new remote takes over his life. From that point on he learns life lessons about family work and what should be really important in any adults life. Yes it does come off like a Frank Capra movie but it's heart is in the right place and it does sell the ""money isn't everything"" storyline effectively. Cast is effective, especially Adam Sandler as the main man as far as the storyline goes and Kate Beckinsale as the wife and mother of his children.

Toilet humor is something that I am a fan of,and there is a major moment of this between Sandler and co star David Hasselhoff.Also,the idea of a dog getting frisky with a stuffed animal is not something I find humorous.Thirdly,I find something disturbing about the tormenting of the kid next door,despite the fact that some feel it was justified.These three elements could have been eliminated,and you still would have had a good film.All of that aside,I found the story to be very funny and touching,not to mention well executed.The special effects are also worthy of note,here.In short,this will take it's place in the number two slot among my Sandler favs,just under The Wedding Singer.Thumbs up to Chris Walken and Kate Beckinsale in their supporting roles.I like it!"
"ivko","6","1","4","1 July 2006"," Billy Madison grows up
","Like Jim Carrey and Robin Williams before him, Adam Sandler is inching away from the broad physical schtick that made him famous into a more mature phase of his career. While he hasn't quite reached the level Carrey hit with ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind"" or even ""The Truman Show"", it's hard to miss the more reserved nature of his performance in ""Click"". And while Sandler may not have the gift for the darker dramedy that Carrey has, Sandler still manages to pull off some touching moments, especially towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>Sandler plays a man in his early thirties who is struggling with the trade-off choices we all have to make during the hectic years as we forge a career and a family at the same time. As the day to day frustrations build, Sandler shakes his fist in the air in a 'give me a break' gesture. Shortly after he has an encounter with god and is given power over the universe. At first it seems like a blessing, and Sandler revels in eliminating some of the petty day to day hassles like traffic and obnoxious coworkers. His career begins to take off and he is overjoyed at the prospect of getting everything he has wanted. Unfortunately, his relationship with his girlfriend begins to fall apart and he soon realizes that he has undervalued the most important parts of his life. He tries to fix things, but can't seem to repair the damage. He begs god to take away his now unwanted powers and fix the damage, but his request is denied. At long last he realizes that his fate is sealed, and decides to ask god for once last boon. Not for himself, but for his girlfriend. And in that selfless gesture he proves that he has learned an important lesson and so is given another chance. Oh, wait. That's ""Bruce Almighty"". Ah well, just replace 'girlfriend' with 'wife and kids' and 'god' with 'angel' and it's basically the same.<br/><br/>All in all ""Click"" is a decent film, although ""Bruce Almighty"" worked better due to a more talented cast. But it does have it's moments, particularly an ongoing bit about the family pet. There is also a very touching scene with Sandler and his father (played by Henry Winkler). I would call this film a renter; not quite good enough to spend full fare at a theater but good enough for a movie night at home."

In the end the hero learns a valuable life lesson and is a better person for it. Surprise surprise that is what the movie was. The idea of the universal remote was a decent one, but it seemed to be just another gimmick for an overdone concept. Sandler does a good job as usual playing the funny goof, but I found his comedy was unnecessary for the overall concept of the movie. Basically you could have used any actor to fill the hero roll and the movie would have still felt the same.<br/><br/>Overall some funny parts with a predictable ending, 6 out of 10"
"lee_eisenberg","7","1","4","30 June 2006"," the perfect universe to control
","On one level, ""Click"" is the typical Adam Sandler movie, with him as a nervous every-man who explodes when it befits the situation. However, there is more here. Some reviews have said that this is basically the same sort of thing as ""Bruce Almighty"", how he gets an unusual power but discovers that it isn't exactly what he expected. I guess that it's true - right down to his relationships with everyone - but if it was just 98 minutes of complete silliness, wouldn't that just be a total repeat of most such movies? As for what specifically happens in the movie, the way that Michael Newman (Sandler) gets to control his surroundings is done sort of like a DVD, what with start, stop, rewind, forward, commentary (by James Earl Jones) and even different languages. Christopher Walken is especially neat as the guy who gives him the remote control, but when does Christopher Walken not bring an interesting presence to a movie? And overall, the movie is a good lesson about the importance of family over career...even if they use some goofy things to show it (e.g., the part about Michael Jackson).<br/><br/>So, overall, director Frank Coraci - who previously directed Adam Sandler in ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""The Waterboy"" - created a really perceptive look at life in general. I recommend it. Also starring Kate Beckinsale, Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner and David Hasselhoff."
"guyfromjerzee","6","1","4","30 June 2006"," Mixed feelings
","The problem with ""Click"" is it doesn't quite work as a comedy. Most of the comedy is composed of cheap gags of either a crude or sexual nature. I chuckled a few times, but I don't think I ever laughed during the course of the film. I enjoy most of Sandler's work and have grown accustomed to his low-brow brand of humor, but this time the jokes were way too lame and predictable for me. Now, onto what I did like about the movie. I enjoyed the second half of the film, when it takes a serious turn and many touching moments occur. One of those moments involves Sandler's relationship with his father, played by Henry Winkler. I didn't find myself laughing during ""Click,"" but I definitely found myself crying during certain parts. So altogether, I found it to be a surprisingly moving film. Sandler may not be ""completely"" suited for the more adult roles yet, but he's getting there. For example, he expresses sadness pretty well, but whenever he gets angry, his voice always raises to that same goofy comic pitch. But if you compare his performance in this movie to his horrible excuse for a performance in the forgettable action-comedy ""Bulletproof,"" you can notice significant improvements in his acting. ""Click"" is not a movie I'd list as a must-see, but is worthy of a rental."

In the movie, Micheal Newman (Adam Sandler) wants a universal remote control so he can make his life better (plus the O Doyle's have one)The remote takes him farther and farther into his life. Over the years he gets a promotion,misses the ''Dragon Tales era'', has a heart attack, his father dies, and then later he ''dies'' (he just wakes up from Bed Bath and Beyond)It has some funny parts in it. (there was a guy singing in his car when he's stuck in traffic I laughed so hard!) but it was sad at some parts too. I suggest you go see it. F**k Rogert Ebert! But that's all I have to say since yet again my comment is not long enough for IMDb. When will you people be happy?"
"ksenaydin","5","1","4","25 June 2006"," Made us laugh and made my mother cry
","Adam Sandler in ""Click"" happily finds himself with Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day"" and Jim Carry in ""Bruce Almighty"" when his character stumbles upon a universal remote, or a remote that controls his universe, (kind of like being God, eh Bruce?), which allows him to fast- forward to what he thinks will be the good times in his life and provides the movie with a good metaphor to describe the way life sometimes feels, much like in ""Groundhog Day"" when Bill Murray's character wakes up to the same day, everyday. And just as Bill Murray's character realizes he must use every day to become his best self, Sandler's character realizes the consequences of ignoring life. And like ""Almighty"" (actually, both ""Click"" and ""Bruce Almighty"" have a scene where either Sandler or Carry rush through their rush hour traffic with their respective powers--maybe because both screenplays were written by steve koren) and ""Groundhog"", ""Click"" is successful in getting its simple but affecting point across, hitting the audience on an emotional level--my mother cried! and despite the fact that Hollywood's violin and rain moments of sadness are a dime a dozen, it's nice to see it tried when a story actually allows. not really that profound or tight a script, ""Click"" nevertheless tells those idiot workoholics to wake up before their family and health pass them by.<br/><br/>Now if some of you miss the Happy Madison glory days, Sandler, while he doesn't exactly set fire to poo on people's doorsteps in ""Click,' he does hint the audience at the inner jackass with a good and funny subplot of torturing the neighbor's jackass kid. So no worries."
"Rodhansennh","Null","1","4","25 June 2006"," Derivative and repetitive
","In CLICK, The Newman family dog likes to hump the children's stuffed animal.<br/><br/>Knowing this one comic device, you are now aware of at least 10 percent of the gags in Adam Sandler's latest vehicle - I can recall from memory at least five times in which this dog-on-stuffed-duck intimacy is played for laughs.<br/><br/>Sadly, this is all too typical of Sandler's repertoire: He finds one thing that's funny, and then utterly runs it into the ground until it's lost all comic value. You'd think a film comic with a $20 million asking price would understand that jokes aren't funny once you've seen them a dozen times.<br/><br/>The plot of CLICK, in a nutshell: Sandler plays Michael Newman, an overworked architect with conflicted loyalties between work and family. After a late-night trip to Bed Bath & Beyond (which enjoys repeated brand placement throughout the movie), Michael is given a ""universal"" remote that allows him to pause, stop, mute, rewind and fast-forward through events. Meaningful life lessons ensue.<br/><br/>CLICK is not a bad movie, but neither is it a good one. It's an Adam Sandler movie. If you've seen any other of his films, you've essentially seen this one: Sandler plays a good guy who is nice to women, children and the elderly. As always, his love interest is unspeakably gorgeous (British beauty Kate Beckinsale, who lets her American accent slip noticeably in a couple of scenes).<br/><br/>Regarding the ending: We won't give it away because we don't HAVE to. If you don't see the conclusion coming a good half hour away, then you're probably the type of viewer who will find the dog's love life funny (along with the movie's endless jokes about flatulence, 8-year-olds swearing, and other Sandler boilerplate).<br/><br/>So, if you like Sandler, you'll like this movie. If you haven't seen an Adam Sandler movie, rent THE WEDDING SINGER or HAPPY GILMORE. <br/><br/>5/10 stars."

Although I would not call this movie a crowning achievement, It was quite enjoyable for the most part. I do admire Adam Sandler for trying to give a descent performance, and playing Michael not just as a great big silly head. It had incredible effects also.

"rlnutt","8","1","4","24 June 2006"," In the spirit of Frank Capra!!!
","Adam Sandler seems to like the movies that have a happy ending and feel good throughout the flick... here it's no different.<br/><br/>Sandler's character is a bogged down architect that has a snake of a boss (Hasselhoff) that pushes and pushes while waving a carrot in front of Sandler for promotion to get more and more from him. This works to get Adam Sandler's character to miss out on family events and avoid the process of work.<br/><br/>As the 'Universal Remote' starts programming itself so he can avoid the things he dislikes the most, he finds himself fast forwarding through life and all it brings.<br/><br/>The concept is simple and the meaning is not lost and you'll get an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" feel at the ending! The cast is superb and you'll see many of the stock players from other Adam Sandler movies. Not a little kid movie, but definitely a teenager movie on up! Worth the price of admission... go and enjoy this movie, then buy it in time for the holidays!"
"Metallicfire","8","1","4","24 June 2006"," A Diamond in the Rough
","This movie's message will stay with you when you leave the theater. I'm more of an American Beauty girl than a mainstream comedy; however, this movie had me in tears and hysterics. The only reason I saw this movie is because of my faith in Adam Sandler to come out with an amazing film. I went in expecting big laughs on a Saturday night, but I was slightly disappointed. Everyone else in the movie theater seemed to be laughing hard enough, but something was missing for me. It wasn't the typical Adam Sandler humor of recent movies- the laughs were more found in slapstick, anything more subtle was usually awkwardly delivered and seemed to fall lamely upon the crowd, and me. At one point in the VERY beginning I was thinking about walking out. <br/><br/>BAD IDEA. <br/><br/>Anything that the film was lacking in the beginning was made up for by the slightly predictable, but nevertheless entertaining and fresh, plot. The humor gets better, and Sandler's ability to present a character that captures his audiences' hearts pulls the viewers along an emotional roller coaster of a film. Covering huge, complex ideas and nuances of human relationships in a way that is so simple and so genuine and so heartbreaking and so funny all at once, it's quite incredible. Even the ever-so-slightly predictable ending works and even adds to the charm of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is an excellent example of Sandler's obvious ambition to bring out a movie with a real message behind it and mass appeal. Go see it, it's definitely worth the entrance and the five dollar packet of Raisinettes:)"
"idancelikethis","Null","1","4","24 June 2006"," Great
","Listen, I know movies these days put in a lot of nonsense things that make us say ""That's so fake"" or ""Why would that happen"", but in this movie, no matter what happened even if I thought ""it didn't make much sense"" or ""how easy was that"" or ""I knew that was going to happen next"", I did not think about those things because I let the movie just take over me, and let the suspension of disbelief live out because the movie was such a really great journey that took you with it. The movie took you in avenues and put you in situations that really confronts you the way it confronted Adam Sandler's part. And the movie was just a great film, that any family would enjoy going out to see together. It brings us to enjoy who we are, and not to hate ourselves for trying to be an image of something portrayed by society or an idea from the media. It made me find the joy in the sadness, and the pain in happiness."
"fifadude","5","2","13","5 July 2006"," Not the best Sandler, but still funny
","Maybe it's just me. I'm having a hard time adjusting to the paternal role Sandler has taken on in his last few movies. I'm more used to his slapstick immature humor which I soaked up in younger years, and still quote, but like I said, he's still funny.<br/><br/>The premise for Click, is the real reason I hold back for my vote. A remote control for life. The theme is putting your family before your job. Good theme, but it's such a strange way to exploit this. The movie touched a soft spot in me though. In its saddest moment, Sander goes from an aged dying old man, but then awakes from a dream, and POOF! It's a happy and Wonderful-Life-esquire, save Stewart, ending.<br/><br/>It was OK, funny, and the old school Sander shone through, in some spots."
"dhaufrect","3","2","13","24 June 2006"," ""Click"" is an Adolescent Flick
","""Click"" is truly an adolescent flick. It stars Adam Sandler as Michael Newman. Newman is an architect who is more closely tied up to his job than to his family. His wife, Donna Newman, is a very pretty sight and is aptly played by Kate Beckinsale. Christopher Walken plays Morty, a peculiar electronics salesman at Bed Bath & Beyond. He provides Newman with a universal remote which truly is universal. David Hasselhoff plays John Ammer, Michael's boss who is overbearing, and gives a comical performance. The bits are predictable, and there is much very adolescent language and gestures that appeals to the children in the house, but it is an ephemeral chuckle that one mostly hears in the theater. This film can be missed without much concern."
"charm_nultyz89","9","1","5","18 August 2006"," One of Sandler's best!
","I watched Click with my friends after a very stressful week. Adam Sandler was going to be in it so we thought it was a good idea to watch and laugh and just relax. I've seen movies starring Adam Sandler but maybe I haven't seen much because I had no idea he could make me cry! At first I thought I was the only one. My friend, who was beside me, suddenly asked for a tissue. After the movie, we heard so many people saying that they too were moved to tears. Click had a really big impact on me. I believe that it is one of Adam Sandler's best movies! It made me appreciate my family so much more. My friends and I-we remember what Sandler's character, Michael Newman said, ""Family first before work!"""
"DICK STEEL","9","1","5","2 August 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Click
","With comedies, I half expected the best bits to make it to the trailers. They always do these days, and leave the actual movie much to be desired in the laughs department. Click however, was a totally different ball game altogether, not that it was lacking in laughs, but never did I expect the 2nd half of the movie to go where it went. It might be formulaic, but the message it has for the audience, rings through so effectively through Adam Sandler's performance.<br/><br/>Sandler plays Michael Newman, an extremely busy architect trying to find his way to the next big promotion, to be the business partner of his company alongside his boss Ammer (hammed up by David Hasselhoff). To Michael, he is working his butt off in order to provide for his family, and places work priority always as number 1, at the expense of family and quality time. He's uber mean, and vents his frustrations at the neighbour's kid (not that he's any way likable to begin with). In an effort to get a remote control to universally control all the electrical appliances at home, he chances upon a quirky salesman Morty (Christopher Walken) who gives him for free, one such device.<br/><br/>Not before long, Michael learns of the power of the ""universal remote"", and his entire life becomes a DVD menu - where he can playback, fast forward, and even watch certain milestones in his life with a James Earl Jones' voiced commentary. And it is here that the movie constantly churned out comedic situations after comedic situations, with all kinds of humour flying around at every turn.<br/><br/>But in the second half, the movie takes on dramatic proportions as in Sandler's earlier movie Spanglish, which I also enjoyed. Beneath the laughter, comes a serious reminder about our priorities, and it made me think, hard. Sure we all strive to excel at what we do, in order to eke out a living. It's always easier said than done, but it served as a good reminder, to those with families and kids, not to neglect them. The importance of putting family first, and achieving some form of work-life balance, sometimes get overlooked as we run the rat race.<br/><br/>Time never looks back, and once you miss the boat, that's it, and there's no practical way to rewind to key moments in life, like a movie can. In living life, there are always bounds and bounds of challenges. After all, aren't those challenges supposed to make life interesting? Instead of sidestepping issues and sweeping them under the carpet, we must learn to face them with gusto instead of looking for the easy way out. At times, choosing the easy way out will mean the missing out on the experience, which to me is a whole lot more costly.<br/><br/>But no worries, perhaps I'm just looking too deeply into the message in the movie, but you get my drift. And the cast is picture perfect, with Michael's parents (Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner - she voices Marge Simpson) providing an extended family feel to Michael's wife (the beautiful Kate Beckinsale) and two kids (Joseph Castanon and Tatum McCann). Sean Astin has a bit role here as a swimming coach, and there are plenty of ""vase"" babes in this movie, like Sophie Monk (Date Movie)<br/><br/>Fans of The Cranberries will also be pleased when a beautiful ballad from the band is played, and Dolores O'Riordan actually made an appearance too performing Linger. And by the time that happens, some in the audience would already be standing by, or using tissues already.<br/><br/>Click managed to keep its entire second, more serious act under wraps in the trailers, but when revealed in the movie, provided a more layered, adult theme in this comedy which makes one wonder, have you told your family you love them today?"
"inthecrease1","9","1","5","30 July 2006"," Simply awesome.
","This is the best and my favorite movie that I have seen during the summer of 2006. I can't describe the feeling it gave me after seeing it. When I saw the previews, I was excited to see the movie, but I didn't expect for it to be amazing, and that is where I was surprised. The acting was great, Adam Sandler showing his abilities outside of comedy at parts, and the relationship between Adam Sandler and his wife in the movie was one of the best parts. The way the director put that together was one of the best movie relationships I have seen in a while. And then there are the special effects, which were also used very nicely, but not overused. Usually all of the funniest lines will be used up in the previews, and then the movie is weakened greatly. However, some of the funnier parts of the movie were left in the movie, where they should be. I agree with the comment on this movie on the movie's main page about it being great top to bottom. And I also agree that the ending was great. I could not have been happier with the way the movie ended. I highly recommend it and I can't wait until the DVD comes out."

This was supposed to be fun and full of laughs but it was supposed to touch a deeper level of you too. I thought the casting was great. I mean even though it got serious it was still funny. I thought the movie was sad in the end. It was still funny though when it got serious I thought this was a great movie. Adam Sandler really showed a different side to his acting which is great for his career. Kate Beckinsale was great in the role of a believable mom and wife. I suggest this movie if you want to see a comedy/drama."
"rockstar6448","9","1","5","22 July 2006"," Highly entertaining, surprisingly sad ending.
","When I went to see Click, I had expected it to be one of those typical Adam Sandler movie, hilarious, and that was about it. I'm not saying Click wasn't hilarious, it definitely was, but I was surprised to see that it was actually sad for about the last half of the movie, when the remote starts to program itself. I think the sadness really kicked off when Michael Newman (portrayed by Adam Sandler) was with Morty (Christopher Walken) at his father's grave, and Adam commands the remote to bring him to the last time he saw his father, and that part was sad as it was, and then of course the whole ordeal with Adam telling his father that he always knew the secret to the ""quarter trick"". Now I'm rarely affected by sad parts in any movie, but Click was one of the few that didn't make me cry, but was still pretty saddening. When Adam is in the hospital, and runs out chasing his son to tell him that family should come first, and collapses in the street and his son dashes to him, now that was certainly a sad part. When Adam died in the street, that could very well be the saddest scene of any movie I've ever seen. In the end, I was a little confused as to whether or not Adam was dreaming, or if Morty had taken him (because Morty is the Angel of Death) and brought him back in time to when he first got the remote, letting Adam's character go home after learning a significant lesson. This thought was stirred up because the remote sat on his kitchen table when he got home, with a note from Morty, so I am still puzzled as to whether it was all a dream, or if it was simply Morty bringing him back after he learned his lesson. All in all though, this was an excellent movie in my book"

"cultfilmfan","9","1","5","11 July 2006"," Click
","Click is about a man named Michael Newman who lives with his wife Donna and his kids Ben and Samantha. Michael is a workaholic and spends more time on work that he is on his family. One day while getting frustrated with all the remotes in the house he goes down to a department store and gets a mysterious universal remote control from an unique man named Morty. Michael finds that with this remote control he can turn down the volume of his dog's bark, fast forward through fights with his wife and many other unique things. But soon the remote is working on it's own and begins fast forwarding through Michael's life and all the big important things coming in the future. Michael now has to stop the remote before it fast forwards through his whole life and if he can ever get back to where he was he wants to seriously consider his life and how much time he is spending with his job rather than his family. Click has good direction, a good script, good performances by the cast and good film editing. After watching this film I was surprised at how different it was than the usual Adam Sandler films. Sure it has some crude humour and the typical kind of Adam Sandler jokes that you will find in almost all of his movies, but this film is also touching, sweet and has a lot of feeling and emotion. The film reminded me of a modern day version of the film It's A Wonderful Life only in an Adam Sandler kind of way. I really liked this film for it's original script and idea and there were some amusing moments in this movie and also a lot of tenderness and heartfelt moments. This film works as a comedy and it works as a drama as well. Proving he can also provide a great dramatic performance in films such as Punch Drunk Love, Adam Sandler does the same here and the result is a very entertaining, fun and touching film that should appeal not only to fans of Adam Sandler, but to a lot of the film going public as well. I really liked the original ideas and plot of this film and I liked the goofy parts and most of all I liked the last half of the film where Michael re-thinks his life and where us the audience are treated to a lot of well done drama scenes. Click works on a lot of levels and next to Punch Drunk Love is probably Adam Sandler's best film. I hope with the success of this film that Adam Sandler does more dramas seeing as he has proved on several occasions that he can and I hope he chooses more original films like this. Click gets a big recommendation from me and I was very pleasantly surprised how much I liked it."

"jon.h.ochiai","9","1","5","1 July 2006"," Family Comes First
","In ""Click"" Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman, who comes to possess a miraculous ""universal remote"" that literally controls his entire universe including fast forward and skip features. However, left unchecked Michael skips the unpleasant and fast forwards to the good parts of his life, and he misses years of his life and also years in the lives of those he loves. This clever story is a little unexpected coming from Adam Sandler, who gives one of his best performances. Frank Coraci's direction of the story by Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe seamlessly shifts from frivolous comedy to poignant sentimentality. I have read movie reviews that have slammed ""Click"" for being shamelessly sentimental. What else is it supposed to be? Granted Koren and O'Keefe's story is uneven with some distractingly stupid gags. However, their point is that for most of us, if we are not truly present in own lives will run in auto pilot or fast forward, and miss out on the things that are really important in life. So when Sandler's Michael comes to the realization that ""Family comes first."" that resonates with us. ""Click"" also gets points for being fun and funny. Coraci balances the message and the comedy, in the context of the love story of Michael and Donna (the amazing and beautiful Kate Beckinsale).<br/><br/>Michael Newman (Sandler) is an architect on the fast track with his firm. Michael works ridiculous hours and that places a tremendous strain on his family-- for his wife Donna and his kids Ben (Joseph Castanon) and Samantha (Tatum McCann). Michael's boss Amner (a very funny David Hasselhoff) is demanding and completely clueless. Michael's future as firm partner depends on making Amner look good. One night when Michael is working a deadline, the DVD remote goes out, and he must watch that client DVD. So Michael heads to his local Bed, Bath, and Beyond. In the ""Beyond"" section Michael meets apparent mad scientist Morty (awesome Christopher Walken). Morty gives Michael the ""state-of-the-art"" universal remote, under the condition that he can't return it. Morty tells Michael, ""Even nice guys need to catch a break"" Back home Michael realizes the actual power of his universal remote. There are the associated high jinx involved with the mute, slow motion, and fast forward features. Michael is a good guy, who thinks that by getting ahead and being successful in his career is the best way he can provide for his family. He loves his family dearly, and he soon realizes that he is responsible for how his life works out. Years go by in a flash and things don't always turn out as you intend. Michael learns, ""Be careful what you wish for."" <br/><br/>Adam Sandler plays his standard smart ass self balanced with amazing vulnerability and compassion. This is so refreshing. Sandler also demonstrates a depth of range as his Michael goes through the different character arcs. He is touching when he tells Donna (Beckinsale) the love of his life, ""Forever and ever."" He is heartbreaking in a scene with his father (excellent Henry Winkler), when he realizes that his father always loved him, but as his son he never told his Dad how much he loved him. Along with Sandler, Beckinsale's Donna also ages over the years. She is just rock solid and carries Michael and Donna's relationship as it evolves to catharsis. Beckinsale is light and funny and at the same time has a gentle strength. Christopher Walken is awesome as Morty. As Michael's guide he brings the right touch of whimsy and gravitas. Morty turns out to be more than just a guide. Sandler, Beckinsale, and Walken expertly navigate ""Click""'s journey from standard comedy to sentimental and reflective.<br/><br/>""Click"" is funny and ultimately touching and poignant. An unexpected surprise. In a departure from his standard fare, Adam Sandler is at his vulnerable best. Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken are great. This is Sandler's version of Frank Capra. It's different, and definitely worth watching."

What makes this such a good movie is that it combines the comedy of Adam Sandler with an emotional side of the story that we have never or rarely seen of Sandler. The acting is great, especially by Jake Hoffman. He sounds just like Sandler and was perfect for his role. Kate Beckinsale also did a great job. She sounded like she was American, even though she speaks normally with a British accent. As for the story part of this review, Sandler plays Michael Newman, a loving father whose work as an architect is starting to bear down on him and is creating a barrier between him and his family. In order to make things easier for him, Michael goes looking for a universal remote, but instead finds something much more than he ever wanted from a man named Morty (Christopher Walken). Sandler soon discovers the power of the remote control, including what it can do to someone if it is used improperly. Sandler digs himself into a hole with the remote, his life continuing to spiral downwards. Can Sandler find a way to save himself and get his life back to the way it was, or is it too late? Find out by seeing ""Click"", a movie that is much more than what you have seen from Adam Sandler in the past. I highly recommend it, but not for younger children; it might be out of their range. Otherwise, enjoy the show!"

","Excellent movie.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler employed most of his usual tricks, including the red-headed bullying family from Billy Madison. If you get Sandler's sense of humor + you enjoy movies that make a statement about life, you will appreciate this flick.<br/><br/>Personally, I left the theater wanting to be a better person, as did the other movie-goers. The movie reaches out to anyone with a belly button, and makes a bold statement that ""family comes first,"" something that all of us should remember each day. (And I'm including alternative lifestyles, adoptions, boys/girls club mentors, teachers, and anyone else in your life that is important to you as your definition of a Family!) On the negative, I don't ever think it's cute when little kids cuss (again, Billy Madison, Mrs. Doubtfire) but if the director wants to make a point that children imitate what they see and hear, WE GET IT.<br/><br/>All in all, Click is a great movie incorporating an unusual twist to A Christmas Carol with plenty of boobs, Hasselhoff, the Fonz, and lots of dogs."

","Now we are all use to the typical Adam Sander movies. ha ha laugh great comedy everyone goes away with a huge smile. But that is not exactly the case with this movie. There is actually emotion and amazing acting in this movie. The movie doesn't disappoint, what you see in the trailers is what you get, but thats not all. The first half has the typical humor but the second half is nothing to be disappointed about. It really does get the message across of this movie. It's heart felt and beautifully done. You don't feel like they cut part of the movie out and just had you transfer to this new part in the movie. It's beautifully done on the transition. Adam Sandler was most definitely the man to do this role. With his beautiful comedy and what now looks to be apparently great acting in general. He still has his comedy that he showed in ""Happy Gilmore"" and the ""Wedding Singer"". But you also get to see a new side of him. The serious side, the actor side. It's a beautifully done movie and I would recommend this movie to anyone."
"midnight_dreamer","9","1","5","28 June 2006"," One of Sandler's best dramatic roles
","A summary of Click, in my own words, is about a hard working man named Michael who suddenly finds a universal remote in a hidden room of a department store. Eventually he uses the remote so much to get out of the 'boring' parts in life that the remote starts to overrule his choices, leaving him without a clue what is going on. <br/><br/>Sandler portrayed one of the best dramatic roles than any other comedy/drama movie of his. It just goes to show that Sandler can play different roles and carry them out with great ease.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, it's worth every dollar. Oh, and definitely bring the tissues."
"aharmas","9","1","5","28 June 2006"," What If?
","Sandler's brand of humour is quite accessible and yet, it can be an acquired taste. What Sandler does very well is relating to its audience and not talking down to them. In ""Trick"" the protagonist represents us all of us, our wishes and frustrations, our dreams and nightmares, and that's what makes the movie so successful in meeting its goals.<br/><br/>The screenplay is deceptively simple, carrying us through the different stages in the lives of an average family. Here is lovely wife, two charming children, and an ambitious, driven father. With the assistance of a mysterious scientist, the father is able to skip through what he thinks are the worst times of his life, and eventually he unleashes a series of events that make him realize that his life is not so bad after all.<br/><br/>There are the usual touches of raunchy humour that one encounters in every Sandler movie, and those details keep it real. The performances are uniformly good, with Beckinsdale shining as the devoted wife, and some priceless cameos by Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner.<br/><br/>One wasn't ready to get hit with so much in depth in this type of movie. It was refreshing surprise to see that movies like this and ""The Weather Man"" last year can make one realize that as humans, we are capable of so much, and yet we keep wasting the potential to care for ourselves and others."

","Greetings again from the darkness. First of all, this movie is not as funny as it thinks it is, nor is it as dramatic as it pretends to be. The previews lead us to believe that this is a typical Adam Sandler adolescent comedy, but in fact, it is more in the vein of ""Family Man"" , ""Mr Destiny"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"". Of course, it is definitely not in the class of the latter, but it does share some common elements with all three.<br/><br/>Director Frank Coraci (seen briefly as a male nurse) should thank Mr. Sandler daily since his money makers as a director have been ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""The Waterboy"". Sandler doesn't seem to put much into his performance, but Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken at least seem to have a little fun. Then there is David Hasselhoff enjoying the spotlight again and Jennifer Coolidge is always a hoot.<br/><br/>The most interesting sidebar on this film is the decision to cast some kids of stars. Lorraine Nicholson (Jack's daughter) plays Samantha as a 14 yr old. Katie Cassidy (David's daughter) plays Samantha as a young adult. And best of all, Jake Hoffman (Dustin's son) plays Ben as a young architect running the business. An unusual casting stunt that adds a touch of interest where there is very little.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken will make you chuckle a couple of times and the heartstrings are pulled pretty hard on the whole issue of family vs. work, but for the most part, this movie struggles in both comedy and drama. Sandler fans will be disappointed in his performance, but the film should have a nice life on cable and DVD."
"metzgerd1","9","1","5","27 June 2006"," Great movie!
","This was one of Adam Sandler's best movies! When you watch the previews, you think that it is just a slapstick comedy, but it really isn't. It was actually quite moving. That took me by surprise. This isn't the typical Happy Madison movie. BTW, I can tell who on here has not seen the movie. Don't slam it until you see it! I think Sandler is taking the same road that Robin Williams has taken. He's normally a goof ball, but when you see this movie, you notice a different side of him. I also liked how Christopher Walken portrayed his character. This movie has something for everybody: comedy, drama, and a little adventure. I strongly recommend this movie!"
"lespaul-zim","6","1","5","26 June 2006"," A decent movie, but stick to one genre, instead of 10!
","Starting out, I have to say that the trailers for this movie are slightly misleading...sure, they point out the main plot, but they fail to notify the moviegoer of some things. The main point they leave out is this: Click is not quite a comedy or even dramedy...its a strange hodgepodge of humor, family values, morals, drama, and even The Twilight Zone starring Christopher Walken works its way into the film.<br/><br/>We start off as the preview would lead one to believe: a normal Adam Sandler movie about a guy with too much to do and not enough time. Enter Morty, the crazy-hair guy with the magic remote. Long story short, things seem good at first, and they are, but problems arise as the remote begins to program itself based on Sandler's actions in the movie, causing him to skip long intervals of his life. He becomes fat and divorced, a workaholic, misses his father's death, and lets his children grow up without him seeing it.<br/><br/>As previously stated, if this had been a straight-up comedy, or a be-careful-what-you-wish-for sci-fi, or just a good family flick, it would've been worth my Monday night and $10. But after a few good laughs, the movie flip-flops into sympathy-for-the-hero mode, then shocker mode (Christopher Walken turns out to be the Angel of Death!)...and all of a sudden, we're in St. Elsewhere and the whole movie was a dream! So yeah, this could've been a really great movie if it had stayed truer to itself in one way or another.<br/><br/>P.S. Clever sidenote-Walken's ""Death"" character is named Morty-as in mortal, mortuary, morbid...see a pattern/Latin root here?"
"pigletandowl","9","1","5","26 June 2006"," intense and hits the mark
","spoiler alert. I saw the movie last night at the drive in theatre and was surprised at the range of emotions it stirred up in me, from apathy, to outright guffaws, to tears, I mean, big gooey sobbing tears, especially towards the end when it packs that emotional wallop you really don't expect. Henry Winkler was adorable and so lovable as Adam Sandlers silly dad with the quarter trick, and Adam Sandler was very moving lying flat on his back on the wet pavement as he talked to his family and dispensed his worldly wisdom in the pouring down rain. Christopher Walken, from Blast from the Past, seemed to be an evil mad scientist who invented and gave away the cool remote, but he turned out to be the angel of death... The trailer has a lot of the corny stuff, and there is tons of that cornball humor, but the essential message of the movie is underneath it all, somewhere, and I suggest you bring Kleenex if planning on watching it, and maybe a nice shoulder to cry on, or a hunky guy to hug and squeeze during the most emotional parts. There I was, all alone in my car, my kids in their lawn chairs outside in the rainy drive in, with their umbrellas watching this movie on a huge screen, and I laughed and sobbed and sobbed, and laughed... Some of the best emotional release I've had in a long time."
"illbbax","9","1","5","26 June 2006"," Definitely a Serious Comedy
","After the first 15 minutes into this movie, I was concerned that I was once again going to be disappointed by a Hollywood comedy. It seemed to me that I was going to be shown all the funny moments that appeared in the trailer, and that's all I was going to get...with my consolation being that I was at a matinée.<br/><br/>However, I was pleasantly surprised with the way in which the movie transitioned from sketch-like comedy into something a bit more thought-provoking.<br/><br/>The question remains, are Americans ready for a dark, pensive ending? Vince Vaughan attempted to shock us with a dark one in ""Dodgeball"" and ensure that he and his on-screen and off-screen interest would never get back together in ""The Break-Up"", but the preview audiences would not allow them. Does this movie break the mold or is there a happy ending in a Happy-Madison film? I won't tell; but, I would have been satisfied either way; and would have been glad to pay Saturday night's prices. But, hey, it was raining, and I had nothing else to do.<br/><br/>If you're not a professional critic, you'll like it - go see the movie.<br/><br/>< c l i c k >"
"zdbnp6","6","1","5","25 June 2006"," Adam Sandler has done better
","It was entertaining. There were some clever funny parts mixed in with some stupid funny parts. Like the ones where only old people or kids would laugh. It was cool in a futuristic way- kind of like Minority Report(Obviously far less intense), but Adam Sandler has done better. If you are wanting to go see a family movie with the kids, then I would suggest that this one would have you leaving the movie theaters with that warm toasty feeling. David Hasselhoff should not ever be given a role in a movie again, unless it only pertains to children's humor. It is your typical Adam Sandler movie where he gets to do cool things, and has a beautiful girl along his side. He must be doing something right."
"jasonflum","9","1","5","24 June 2006"," Surprisingly effective
","I went into this movie expecting a Billy Madison/Happy Gilmore type laugh-fest. There are laughs here, a couple of big ones, but I was surprised at what the movie actually was: a modern day retelling of A Christmas Carol (or maybe It's a Wonderful Life - one of them). I wasn't expecting the turn to drama we get at the end of the film, and thought it was surprisingly well handled.<br/><br/>***********************SPOILER HERE************************ The only drawback I really found was that the basic formula of the movie was pretty trite. Without advertising the movie as being an update of one of those holiday movies, the device used to introduce the remote actually caused me to groan. It also set up for me the exact path of the rest of the movie. That's fine when you know it's coming, but springing it on us saying ""nope, you're not seeing the comedy you thought, but rather another type of movie"" was kind of a cheat. Still, once I gave into that, I really enjoyed the way the story unfolded, and though it was predictable, I thought it was entertaining, and ultimately, a very well done update of the above mentioned stories.<br/><br/>**********************END SPOILER****************** Sandler is very good in this movie, only resorting to Billy Madison shtick (which I admit I like) a couple of times, mostly taking the role head-on and running with it. Kate Beckinsale is absolutely gorgeous as his wife (she doesn't have much to do besides look great). Hasselhoff is very funny, and Walken, well, I wonder if the director just said to him ""Be Christopher Walken."" Knowing what the film is before you go in may alter the way you see it - it may cause you to enjoy it more rather than feeling cheated, but if you go in with an open mind, I think most people will find this a most satisfying story."

","This movie came out on my birthday, so my family and I went to see it as a sort of birthday present. I wasn't expecting much, as it was just something to do for my birthday and a way of entertainment, but we got a lot more than just that. On the whole I would say it was very good, though there are a few things that I think should have been done differently in order to make it better.<br/><br/>First of all, Click shouldn't have been made into a comedy. The jokes that were used were tasteless and crude, and the action got annoying and slow at some points. The whole thing should have been made into a drama, which is what roughly the second half of the movie is. With the drama part alone this movie had the ability to move viewers to tears. I know I cried, and I began to reflect on my own life and life's little moments. If the whole movie had been that way, I think it could have been much better rated and held in higher esteem. Take out the fart jokes, the duck humping, the sexual innuendos and all the other tasteless junk that was thrown in in an attempt to pull off some cheap laughs. Not everything hinting at comedic effect should be scrapped though. I liked the part with James Earl Jones and that one guy at the Bed, Bath, and Beyond, plus some other things. Just the crude stuff bugged me.<br/><br/>There were some other things that didn't really seem plausible. Like the fact that every woman in the office except the secretary was incredibly good looking and that they were all looking at Adam Sandler like he was the hottest man alive. Give me a break. He's not physically attractive, and there is no way that that many good looking women would be working in one place. But on the whole, the movie is very good and I believe is worth seeing at least once."
"giannasally","8","1","6","10 January 2007"," Great movie!
","This is a very good movie. When I first walked into the theater I thought I was seeing a comedy because that's what all the commercials advertised. But, this movie is definitely not a comedy; it's a drama. If you want to see a comedy, don't see this movie. All the comedy parts in the movie were pretty much in the commercials. I can't say I was disappointed though. The movie makes you want to cry your eyes out. It also teaches a great moral: Don't just rush through you're life, take it step by step. I do have some more constructive criticism, though. I think some scenes had worse acting than others, particularly the scene when Morty is getting the remote control for Michael. However, this is a good family scene & a good move for someone who's waiting for that promotion or who doesn't realize how good their life is."
"sanitysama","9","1","6","9 January 2007"," The real ending of the movie?
","I must not be the only one who thinks the real ending of the movie was before he was given another chance at life. When Michael is laying on the ground with his family all around and he hands his wife the note that says ""Forever and ever, babe"", his life at that point had completely passed him by and he's dying from his own destructive decisions. But instead of dying full of regret he's given another chance and wakes up in the same place he fell asleep at near the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Does anyone else think the movie should have ended right after he died? Or do you think giving him another chance was the ultimate lesson, and he went on to live a long, happy fulfilling life after finding out what could happen if does the wrong things?"
"faizankhan666","10","1","6","16 December 2006"," Best ever Hollywood movie
","CLICK is a flawed film, but better than I thought it would be. Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman, experiencing the pathos that come trying to meet the simultaneous and contrary demands of a family and a career. <br/><br/>The theme is a familiar one: a good-hearted schmo succeeds professionally (if only marginally) at the expense of his personal life. <br/><br/>Only the execution is new, albeit sometimes clumsy, which developed almost seamlessly from Newman's desire for a single remote unit to control the various electronic components and appliances in his home. Denoting just how detached he was from what went on under his own roof, he's unable to distinguish which remote control unit works what appliance, and he's turning the light on when he wants to change the channel on the TV. In a moment's frustration with his lack of control, he impulsively runs out late at night to find one of those universal remotes. In a store selling beds and bedding, he discovers a door in the far back that leads to a storage area. Here he meets Morty (Christopher Walken), a man sporting a lab coat and an eccentric hairdo that combined suggests he's some sort of inventor or scientist. He gives Michael the remote he wants, which turns out to be much, much more than a device for controlling appliances. Michael accidentally discovers it controls all aspects of his life, permitting him to jump backwards in time, with chapter marks, a fast forward, pause, and so on, and even including a commentary track by James Earl Jones. <br/><br/>This was basically a science fiction movie, sort of a comedic time-travel piece, with the remote control unit lending it a stamp of originality. The premise was cute enough to pique my curiosity as to where the filmmakers would go with it, but I remained peripherally aware at first that I was interested only in the novelty of the idea. Once he got comfortable with the power, he began to use it for intentionally comic effect. He used the color controller to give himself a tan, for instance; he changed the aspect ratio of his boss during a sexual harassment orientation. These were the parts that felt like filler to me, as they lent nothing to anything, so the film at that point seemed like it was lacking something, that the filmmakers knew it, and they were hoping to hide it. <br/><br/>You are lulled into thinking the rest of the movie will be more of the same shtick. However, once it got past these minor flaws, it got back to the question it hung its novelty on, of how to balance the demands of a career and the obligations to one's family, and when the former is meant to facilitate the latter but is having the opposite result. Sometime after the first hour, they get right down to the effect of the remote on his real issues. The remote has a feature that anticipates his use of the functions based on his previous uses, and it begins fastforwarding on its own, and the story becomes poignant. For me, this is where it succeeded, and I was reminded of a dozen other sci-fi-fantasy stories like it, which placed the novelty of some situation in the context of something you can identify with (like THE FAMILY MAN, with Nicholas Cage, for instance). I'm almost embarrassed to admit I was touched to the verge of tears. Yes, it's true. I was. <br/><br/>While this is not a movie that will rank highly on either kind of list for me (worst or best), half of me liked the movie while the snobby half enjoyed some haughtiness at my lower half's expense. And Kate Beckinsale is just gorgeous throughout, even as a comfortably 50-year-old woman. At bottom it's s a gimmicky film which tied up nicely with a very warm feel-good ending. At the beginning I had some misgivings that it would be JUST the gimmick in a situation comedy: I was alarmed by something that happened in the bedding store that make me sigh, ""Oh, no. Don't tell me they're going to stoop to THAT"

"boyinflares","9","1","6","1 August 2006"," A very surprising and thoughtful comedy
","When I first saw the trailer for ""Click"" I thought something along the lines of 'oh, just another dumb Adam Sandler flick' but after begrudgingly going to see it with a friend, I was quickly proved wrong. ""Click"" tells the tale of busy architect Michael Newman (Adam Sandler), and how his life dramatically changes when he is given a remote that lets him control time, so he can skip the arguments with his wife, get work projects finished quickly and basically spend time doing what he wants. But things take a turn for the worse when the remote, after becoming accustomed to what he likes to skip through, ends up skipping through whole periods of his life....<br/><br/>Adam Sandler was terrific as Newman, and although he has long ago proved he is a terrific comic actor, he really shines in the dramatic moments here. The rest of the main cast are just as good, and everyone has an important role to play, and nearly everyone gets to appear in the various time periods, it is interesting seeing them all age. Kate Beckinsale is excellent as Newman's long-suffering wife, Christopher Walken plays the enigmatic Marty (whom Neman got the remote from), and I think this is the first film I have seen him in where he doesn't annoy me! David Hasselhoff also proves that he is indeed a good actor with his performance as Ammer, Newman's demanding boss.<br/><br/>The terrific cast continues with Henry Winkler and the lovely Julie Kavner playing Ted and Trude respectively, the parents of Sandler's Michael Newman. Both are outrageously funny, and both will make you produce a tear or two - happy and sad. It's also very interesting to see Kavner on screen as opposed to simply hearing her unique voice on ""The Simpsons"". Sean Astin as Bill doesn't get much screen time at the beginning of the film, but he plays an important role later on, and is very good. Jennifer Coolidge is outrageous as ever playing Donna's friend Janine, she is a very, very funny woman - watch out for her in one of the flashback scenes as well, she's a scream! Australian pop-star Sophie Monk has a small role as Ammer's assistant, though she doesn't get to show off as much as she did in ""Date Movie"".<br/><br/>The children of Michael and Donna Newman also have important roles in the life of their father, both in the present and future. Joseph Castanon plays Ben at age 7 and Tatum McCann plays Samantha at age 5, and both are on their way to being fine actors if they so desire. Playing the 22-30 year old Ben is Jack Hoffman, and the 22-30 year old Samantha is the elegant Katie Cassidy, both fantastic.<br/><br/>What surprised me the most is obviously that ""Click"" is unlike other Sandler films, in that it is very ""grown-up"", and has deep meanings to it. Of course there is also plenty of humor thrown in, some of it rather crude (most scenes involving the Newman's pet dog), but nevertheless amusing, and no doubt appealing to any children that watch the film. Hopefully, the moral of the story is not lost on children either, the moral being something along the lines of life being precious and one should never wish that they could simply skip a part of their life, and also that we need to value our parents, family and loved ones - after all, death could only be a ""Click"" away. Highly recommended."

","I am not a big fan of Adam Sandler, at all. Most of the movies that I've seen with him in them, are terrible. But, I was dragged along to see Click with one of my friends that loves him. Well, it was better than I expected it to be. Though, if you saw all of the preview for it, you have already seen half the movie. All of the things that his character, Michael, does with the remote, is all in the previews. When he goes to get the remote, he sits on a bed because he is tired. As soon as he layed on that bed, I knew it was going to be a dream sequence. They made it so predictable. I have to give kudos to Jake Hoffman who plays Michael's son, Ben at the age of 22-30 years old. His acting was excellent! Adam Sandler... he is just a one dimensional actor. I mean, stick with comedy if your good at it. His serious parts in this, it did nothing for me! But Hoffman played serious, very well! It was better than I expected, and I am happy to say that."

Some of the things he uses the remote for are hilarious.<br/><br/>Then everything begins to go wrong. And everything about the movie takes an unexpected twist. It becomes serious. It becomes a movie with a message. Unlike another senseless Sandler comedy, it takes on a meaning.<br/><br/>The cast was great. Adam Sandler and Kate Beckinsale worked very well together, just like a married couple. Their kids were surprisingly good as well. Sandlers mother (played by the woman who voices Marge Simpson) and father are a great crack-up together.<br/><br/>The verdict is this: Click is surprisingly well done, and surprisingly better than any other Sandler movies.

Being put in a situation where I can humiliate an enemy without any consequences but with funny methods were the highlight of this comedy.<br/><br/>Most of the time I despise movies which are comedy which follow the last 30 minutes acting serious but this was a great exception and felt tears rolling down my face. I've laughed in the face of horror gore scenes and I've kept a straight face in sad movies but this really touched me.<br/><br/>This movie does make you think about your own life.

","This was a great movie that really lives up to the previews. Many times you see a preview for a movie and all the good parts are what you see there, you get to the movie and feel like you've already seen it. Click is not like that. You know from the previews that it is going to be funny, what Happy Madison production isn't, but there is always the fear that, as Adam Sandler gets older, his movies are going to get too heartfelt to really enjoy. This movie has the touching parts but tries very hard not to go overboard. I think they did a good job at having a movie with a message without being full of cheese. The film has tons of laughs and cringe worthy embarrassing moments that make it fun for everyone. The film is much like a modern version of It's a Wonderful Life without being a remake of such a magnificent film."
"petelato","3","1","6","26 June 2006"," Nice idea, but torn between being a juvenile comedy and drama.
","This movie seems geared towards families, in fact my 8 year old daughter was bugging me to see this movie. Fortunately I saw it without her and boy was I glad about that!! <br/><br/>Sandler goes for the least common denominator here, he peppers the dialog with enough profanity to fill a swimming pool. Even the child actors let the curses fly. For why? I always believed when a movie lacks some serious comedic content the makers decide to reach far into the desperation bag and pull out the ""everybody in this movie swears like a prisoner."" <br/><br/>Aside from that, Sandlers mom was distractingly annoying, Henry Winkler was great, and Sandlers wife was stunningly beautiful and believable.<br/><br/>The story was okay, but my niece and I called the ending almost from the beginning, the message is one that is probably very much needed to be heard by most of American parents-not just dads."
"dougp-1","9","1","6","26 June 2006"," Best movie I've seen in a while
","Adam Sandler is growing up. But not too much. I actually cried, during certain scenes -- and I don't do that during movies. If you're a parent, you will cry too. Although the movie doesn't feature the song ""Cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon..."" I heard that going on in the back of my head during certain scenes. The humor made everyone in the audience laugh out loud... sometimes while we all still had tears in our eyes! Hard to imagine a movie with fart humor that makes an important statement about life, but this one does. The acting is totally believable although Hasselhoff is a little over the top. Gorgeous women, cute kids, of course Christopher Walken is totally enjoyable. Best movie I've seen in a long time. Best movie Adam Sandler's made, ever."

","I really like this movie!!!!! It was really funny, but it was also surprising especially at the end. I think that the movie would have been better with more characters though because the only characters who get into the story much are Michael, his Wife, Ben, Samantha, Michael's boss and the remote guy (and maybe the neighbour kid). I think that this is Sandler's best movie since Big Daddy. Overall, an awesome movie. This is a must-watch for anybody who is by any degree into comedy-drama movie's or Adam Sandler movies in general. Great acting and directing but most of all, great effects on the futuristic scenes!!!!!"
"marmiec","5","1","6","24 June 2006"," Funny and heartwarming
","I have always enjoyed Adam Sandler movies. He has a certain quality about him that makes him funny no matter what he does. However, in ""Click"" he shows a serious side that many of us have never seen. Michael Newman (Sandler) is caught in a problem that nearly every family faces. Work or family? Of course, he also can never manage to turn his television on without setting off some other electronic device in his home. His wife is played by the talented Kate Beckinsale, who is not clad in leather nor defeating evil like in her previous movie. When Newman travels to Bed, Bath, and Beyond to find a universal remote his world is turned upside down. His remote controls everything, not just his television. With his new found device he toys around a little, skipping traffic, arguments, and family dinners. However, when the remote suddenly starts controlling him, Michael is thrown into even more problems than he began with. This is not your average Adam Sandler movie, and I will warn you, bring tissues! The touching moral to the story is likely to bring tears to even the toughest men and women."

","sometimes it surprises me how people forget how short life is! it can be over in a second or in hundred years time, but still..too short, maybe because the speed of the way life goes that you can't look around you, or worse behind you to see the people you loved once when you missed the chance to show them your gratitude and share passion with them, i watched that movie and its way of summarizes life and i burst into tears as i see how pity and trivial life IS, sometimes you can't see what you're missing and when you do, it might be too late, after watching this movie i found myself saying ""WAKE UP, time to reconsider your life"""
"ROCO148","7","1","7","3 January 2007"," Not bad, but not flawless....
","Upon hearing of a movie about a universal remote, one may expect something childish and stupid... and at first, this movie appears to be that. However, the director does a good job taking this movie to a higher level, as the main character is forced to question his priorities in his life. Like many of us, Adam Sandler's character just wants to skip certain ""unpleasant"" parts just to get to the ""good stuff"", without realising that what's being skipped is what life's all about. How often do we just want something to be over with... to get to the reward without actually doing the work that earns it? For that, I think the movie is original and striking. I would have given it 9 out of 10 (10/10 is reserved for a very few movies) if it were't for a few major flaws. Firstly, why doesn't he just rewind? Alternatively, why doesn't he just pause, do all his work during the pause, then resume so he can spend time with his family? Also, what's with the bloody dog??? Lastly, and most importantly, the end is almost a ver batum rip off of It's a Wonderful Life (which I think DOES deserve 10/10). Watch the last 20 or so minutes of it's a wonderful life and you'll understand. Hugging the employee vs hugging the cop; running joyously through the street/ running joyously through the parking lot; hugging the old car; and the kicker.... the note at the end! The ending should have been a LOT more original. All that aside, it's a decent movie. It'll definitely make you think... and these days, any movie that will make you think is worth watching!"

I am a 16 year old boy and i make dream on how i want my life to be that i want to become a successful person. When i took the movie, i was expecting to see a funny movie, that i would laugh with and i would enjoy my time. At the beginning i was enjoying it really. But after some minutes i started to wondering, wont this ability have any disadvantages (like Bruce Almighty) ? After some minute i figured that out. I cried after 3-4 years that i had cried for last time. This is a very good movie for young people to watch and learn that MOST OF ALL is our family, our people, our friends, our parents our sons our daughters. ALL PEOPLE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE.

","To be honest, I didn't go to the cinema with many expectations, I just wanted to kill an evening. But the film surprised me. It was both comical, and in the end sad. (in a good way though) Adam Sandler in the lead role did great job. He handled all the aspects of the film well - that was another thing that surprised me, I had him more for an ""American Pie"" style actor. On to the next actress. Kate Beckinsale. She was sexxxxy. Um, didn't really notice how she acts, were watching her body all the time. Sorry. David Hasselhoff was nice and slimy, though I don't like his ""songs"" he did his job well here. Christopher Walken. I don't want to write spoilers in here, so let me just tell you he was an... interesting character, and the revealing of what he really is was surprising. The film contained a nice moral lesson: Family first<br/><br/>Oh and thanks to my best friend who took me out to see the film. THX Lexic;)"
"little_digger","10","1","7","23 October 2006"," a tear provoking film with Adam Sandler funnily enough
","well i was surprised to have to hold back tears when watching this movie. The trailer does not do it justice; sure the gags were funny on most occasions and everyone loves a good Sandler comedy, but wow, what depth. There were some life lessons to be learnt and the messages can apply to any age. anyone thinking that this film is probably not for them, will be pleasantly surprised, not only was the acting superb; Adam Sandler and Kate Bekinsale, but the special effects were awesome. obviously there are many similarities between 'click' and 'bruce almighty', both have fun and antics however both main characters learn from the mistakes they have made. in comparison Sandler, in my opinion does a much better role as the remorseful character that realises he needs to change his life for the better, however of course Jim Carrey will always be the comedy king in my eyes. <br/><br/>it really is a must see movie."
"horsehead222000","10","1","7","17 October 2006"," One of my favorite movies!!
","I love this movie a lot!! Adam Sandler is a riot and he is the all-around-neatest actor ever. This movie was a great movie, because it was funny and it was sad. The acting was phenomenal. The young kids are great little actors/actresses and like I said Adam Sandler is just a fantastic actor. The lady who plays his wife (sorry I don't know her name) is also a really good actress. And combining Adam and her made one heck of a movie. Everyone has to see this movie, because I will guarantee that you will like it even if it's just little bits and pieces of the movie. There are some questionable parts in it, but other than that this movie is fantastic."

","A very cool movie, they really put the movie to the edge, from putting the romance, the comedy and the creativeness of the movie makers. I really like how Adam Sandler, acted he really proves his still a true comedian, but he can be a versatile character too. From scene being a comedian, to scenes being a serious type, He really acted it very well.. As far as the other Characters, they really were the perfect fit for the movie.=) I loved the idea of the movie, from a man holding a remote control that controls his life is what most people want now a days, some kids would want to grow up already and some adults would want to make their lives faster, through this movie. They have showed and teach people of how beautiful life is, how time passes by so quickly that sometimes it is unnoticed that they have already missed half of their life.. That is why I am giving this movie an excellent rating because of the actors, the plot and the story that really stood out and made an impact to the viewers"
"greenteaglace","10","1","7","16 October 2006"," Sweet movie! It's comedy - with substance!
","The movie starts off as your typical crazy funny Adam Sandler flick. Then out of no where, it transforms into a heartfelt inspirational story that is relate-able, unpredictable, and all the while entertaining! It's not only noble, but respectable that the moral of the story; ""family comes first (over work)"" endures throughout the film. These days, all movies are the same - superficial, boring, and seen before; they are either about ONLY hardcore violence and/or sex. It's refreshing to see a movie that focuses on the normal, average, guy - and the actual difficulties guys face in life. Click did an awesome job of incorporating comedy with actual substance (rare these days) - I loved it :)<br/><br/>Spoiler: The part where Sandler goes to the moment he last saw his Dad - made everyone come to tears! The little notes he and his wife exchange throughout the movie are very sweet and romantic; I'm impressed :) - (Doubt the guys would understand..!)"

Adam Sandler himself is one of my favorite actors, so it didn't hurt that he was the main character of this movie :] I've gone and seen this movie 3-4 times.. and I see more parts that I did each new time.

","I had to vote excellent on this movie , it actually made me realize that no matter how hard you work , and how much money you make FAMILY will always be first, and always be there for us. It's a super funny film ,i just had so much laughs and of course the more I saw it I got really involved in the film putting myself in the situation. Great film and I think that ADAM SANDLER did a great job , funny , and it's just a great pad on the back to remind us on what our priorities should be. If you are planning to watch a family film be ready to CLICK play on your remote and just sit , relax and laugh. Don't forget to get the message at the end , we could take this like i said before like a PAD on our back to remind us on what comes first. Before I forget this is one movie I am so SURE I will buy as soon as it comes out on DVD.I hope this DVD comes with many many features and full of surprises I am expecting more from this future purchase."

This movie just isn't another typical Adam Sandler comedy with nothing but crude, ridiculous, cussing like a sailor, drug referencing comedy, it has a lot more to it and all Adam Sandler fans will absolutely love this movie since it has a better plot than most of the movies he does. It has a hilarious comedy base mixed in with a strong emotional heart felt plot that makes you stop and think about the way you decide to live your life. If you've ever felt like you wish you could pause, rewind, fast forward time like I think we all have then this movie will teach you that things happen for a reason and whatever happens, happens for a reason. This movie really brought out a side in me that I haven't seen in a long, long time & at points had me in tears. Overall I give this movie a 10 out of 10. Keep up the good work Adam."

","I've always liked Adam Sandler. Been a huge fan of his movies like ""Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, Bulletproof"" etc. You would think that Sandler would continue to be doing all that for the rest of his life. Sandler takes a huge gap and moves into Drama. This movie is Comedy as well, but it was also Drama in the last 60 mins. The direction is well done. The Pacing is perfect. Never gets boring. The cast is perfect. Especially Kate Beckinsale. She's also made a huge step forward. teaming up with Adam Sandler. Christopher Walken is pure genius as well! He plays his part excellent. Especially after you know who he is. I wont spoil it for you. The script writing is perfect and great as well. The first half of Click is very hilarious and hysterical, but the second half is one of the most dramatic bits i've ever seen. A few jokes that I didn't agree with, but i wont spoil it for those who have'n't seen it. I recommend this to anyone who likes Adam Sandler, Kate beckinsale or Christopher Walken. 9/10"

I liked the way it reflected other classics like The Monkey's Paw and It's A Wonderful Life. Obviously, Click was not to the level of Jimmy Stewart's classic, but it was good overall. There are some laugh-out-loud moments in it, but what makes it so good is the last half hour or so. This is where the movie adds heart. I recommend Click for all.

","The film is a typical funny Adam Sander movie for the first hour. From friends who've already seen it, you'll hear from them about the sadness at the end, and at the start of the film you wonder what could turn out so sad? When Michael Newman starts fast forwarding his life, things are looking good, but then his universal remote goes onto autopilot and things start speeding out of control and things truly do take a turn for the worst at the end. <br/><br/>You are overcome by emotion at the end on two different occasions and it was more, for me, than just a tear, my face was wet and my eyes streamed uncontrollably. My friend next to me was the same and when i looked, so was the whole row of people at the cinema. and it's not sad in a depressing way, and it doesn't leave you, after it's finished, with a bad feeling or upset feeling.<br/><br/>When i came from the cinema at the end, we all felt touched by the movie and recommended it to everyone, it was a truly amazing film, i didn't know a film could have such an incredible effect on me.

Click is the most amazing movie of all time. Starting with the trailer, it is encouraging enough for you to actually go see the film (except in my case but I have seen loads of rotten movies) And its highlight is the humour. But as you sit down and eat your popcorn you are blown away by it all. At first its the humour as you watch Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) see his life turn as he plays humorously with his new remote that can rewind, stop pause or go back to life. But then it gets serious as he begins to miss things in life. And find out that he skips several years. I saw one or two people getting teary when Michael sees his Dad for the last time. And when he gets to his deathbed (the road in the pouring rain) There was no1 who didn't cry when he sent the note to his wife ""will you still love me in the morning?"" and she replied ""for ever and ever babe"" But then omg the laughter when he wakes up in The bed bath and beyond bed.

It would be a very emotional moment. The music, the lyrics I think that they conclude Sandler's life until that point. ""I'm not a perfect person/ There's many things I wish I didn't do/ But I continue learning/ I never meant to do those things to you/ And so I have to say before I go/ That I just want you to know"" I think that is just perfect for the scene mentioned."

Not too much Waterboy and not too much Spanglish.<br/><br/>There were a lot of laughs in this and even a cry or two. My only problem with the movie is the way they handled Morty but I won't give anything away. The storyline is very well rounded and the actors play their characters well. It's a rare to find a good blend of a good moral and life lesson with comedy. I think everybody can take something home from this one. It makes you appreciate the little things in life more.

","I did not have high expectations for this movie but I really enjoyed it and actually cried at the end... And more importantly, I have thought about the movie each day since I saw it. I have 4 kids and after watching this movie, I realized that you don't need a magic remote to 'fast forward' thru your life.<br/><br/>We do it each day - when we put off the kids to watch t.v. or dread the family reunion because we could be doing better things... when we choose to sit at the computer instead of playing that game of monopoly or we let the kids 'do their own thing' when, in fact, we are only letting them because they are leaving us alone :) I saw this from a totally ""parental"" perspective and that is how I interpreted it... it was sad and I can honestly say that this movie sort of changed me a bit. Yeah, we all need peace and quiet away from kids, spouse & family but life goes by amazingly fast and before you know it, the kids are driving, old friends are retiring and parents or family members are gone forever. And all you are left with are pictures and good memories, if you are lucky, or that dull ache in your gut if you're not. Pain because of all the time you could have spent or letters you could have written or games you could have played.<br/><br/>It's not often you find a movie that really makes you take a closer look at your life, let alone want to change it."

","I recommend you guys better watch this movie. The best movie I've watched lately. It's very touching. I can't help my self not to cry. Joseph Castanon and Tatum McCann were very good. I love the way Kate Beckinsale act as a wife. David Hasselhoff was so funny that I could ever imagine. Well I can say that he can really do comedy. Adam Sandler was very good acting the workaholic dad. It only shows his real lifestyle. It's one way of telling us that people we love are the one's we always take for granted because we know that they will be with us no matter what. Our family should be our first priority over everything else. Are you aware that if we die tomorrow, the company that we are working for could easily replace us in a matter of days? But the family we left behind will feel the loss for the rest of their lives. Better watch the movie with your loves ones!"

Adam Sandler has really grown up and if he keep playing in movies like this he is going to be huge, Cristopher Walken plays a good role but Adam Sandler does it all.

Also the Sandler's work was amazing, I hope that they continue doing movies as this one, I like the mixture of fantasy and comedy, also viewed in movies like ""The hot chick"" or ""The Animal"" great ones, I hope like that many people watch the movie, nobody cannot lose this cinematographic excellent delivery, indeed I'd like to invite you readers to watch it and find the message in it, not only the good comedy and the incredible fantasy in it, there is a lot more in that movie, there's a reflection topic that should be understood."
"jlmban","10","1","8","4 August 2006"," This was amazing! *possible spoiler*
","Click was definitely the best Adam Sandler movie yet. This movie had it all. It had comedy in the first half and than led up to be very dramatical and yes even heart-wrenching second-half. The acting was great, and all deserve applause. Yet, I'm surprised it had all the drama. The trailer says it's a fun movie, well it teaches you something in life. This is not a usual comedy just for fun like Scary Movie or Dodgeball, it gives you a lesson in life. I would see this movie at least 20 times again. The quality acting of Adam Sandler was truly amazing and this deserves the applause. I rank this movie a 10 out of 10."

","This movie was very good. It can teach everyone who works his ass of that the work is not on the first place. If you just ignore the little moments of life one day you will wake up big and fat, having missed all those moments you would have loved to recall once your life is almost gone. As it is said: ""Life is not measured by the breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away"". Everybody should ask him/herself if being so pushy in work is so damn crucial. We always say ""... OK, I can sacrifice that moment, that weekend, that party, a few hot dates, a go-out with the friends and so on, for working on something ""more important"". Well, if you are now 80, and you have missed all those great breath-takers, what was the point of living anyway???"

","Today is my fifteenth birthday and I got a present I'll never ever forget. My mom took me,a friend,and my brother to see this movie. When Click had first come out,people thought it was gonna be just a goofy comedy. But as the ending comes closer it turns into a provocative drama. I watched Ebert and Roeper review the movie before I saw it. Roger Ebert said ""The movie is being sold as a comedy,but you know what? This isn't funny."" Richard Roeper said ""I think if you're going to have a David Hasselhoff type of character and you're going to have the flatulence type of humor,then just go in that direction. Don't try to put in all this sappy stuff."" The comedy in the film was entertaining and the emotion was very powerful. How powerful? I cried after I saw the final conversation he had with his father and how he was mean to him. I also cried during the scene at the end when he himself was dying. I didn't cry when I saw Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith,but I cried when I saw Click. After seeing this movie, I wanted to hug Adam Sandler and praise him. This is by far, the best movie of this year so far and my favorite Adam Sandler movie."

While everyone expected the same old mediocre comedy, Click proved to be a really meaningful experience.<br/><br/>We never saw what's coming and I have to say that from now on, this movie is in my top 5 all time favorites.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler proved once again what a complete actor he is, by doing not only the usual comedy stuff, but also the more difficult dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>It may be Adam Sandler's best Movie ever - I really can't wait to see it again. <br/><br/>I give it a 10 out of 10 and urge you to go see it - it really got to me, and changed the way I see life."

","Adam Sandler's movies will keep getting better and better. He will be standing up with an Oscar clutched in both hands. One day. Because he has the kind of understanding that is required to make consistently great movies: he understands the person in the movie theater who plunks down $8-10, takes his seat, and cries out ENTERTAIN ME! That person will watch this movie, come back again with a friend, and will be one of the first to snatch it up when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>And I can imagine he goes over the script, no matter who wrote it, and makes it an Adam Sandler film. He has never been known as a good writer, but he takes what is written for him, and makes it his own. Few film comedians can compare. And they are all Saturday Night Live alumnus. Made fairly low budget, makes great profit. Audiences like. Studios like. <br/><br/>If he keeps his head on his shoulders, he will have a long successful career. If he lets it go to his head, he'll make a costly movie that will bomb, and then another, and he'll wind up hosting a late night talk show, or sitcom, and bye-bye. But I truly think that will never happen.<br/><br/>In this movie he celebrates classic films, with a Jewish point-of-view. Go see it. Laugh. Cry. Go out of the theater a better person."
"shadowarrior1","10","1","8","29 July 2006"," Amazing!!!!!! Simply Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","This movie has it all. Humor, emotion and all the others needed to make it one of THE BEST movies in the year 2006. Adam Sandler has proved himself to be one of the most nimble actor of our time. The movie was fabulous. In it Micheal (Adam) is in job as an architect with Hasselhoff as his egotistic and self promoting boss. One particular night when Adam is feeling extremely frustrated he goes out in the search of a universal remote, which he gets from Morty (Christopher Walkin). This remote proves to be truly 'universal' as it lets Micheal control aspects of his life and how he experiences them. What follows can only be described as an incredible story of humor and realization. But unlike other movies which got too caught up in trying to get their moral across to the audience or went with too much humor that they lost the path , this movie has it all and all of it is backed up by one of the most phenomenal acting i have seen in some time. Be sure to watch it in a big theater with plenty of snacks because this is on hell of a ride."

","It is undeniable the best movie of his year so far. Comedy, romance, action, drama, SF, all this in just one movie. So: Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is a career man, insensitive at first. He meets an angel of death who provides him with a remote that will change his life, making his beautiful wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale) the happiest woman. The remote has also an impact over his sun Ben, not allowing him to become like his workaholic father. I cried, I laughed. I laughed, I cried. This movie didn't just brought the tears in my eyes, but it made me think about life and what's important in it.

","The movie is framed in a very predictable frame. this frame, if concentrated on, may ruin the movie for some, but if you actually take time and think about and enjoy the content of the movie, you will find that the movie far surpasses any trailer or initial inclinations. as embarrassing as this may be, probably my favorite movie of the year so far. Also, probably the closest i've been to crying since ""Big Fish"" and nothing before that. I can't stress enough, don't get caught up on the format of the movie. Focus on the internal story. While some parts of Sandler's acting shows slight weaknesses, this role shows his diversity as did ""punch drunk love."" (Kate is pretty easy on the eyes too. :) )"

It becomes something real... It makes you see things around you better, there are lots of people who work whole life and you can see that in this movie... I really liked the movie, first I was thinking ""I'll just have fun watching it"", but it made me think of some things... This movie wakes up great emotions in you, happy and sad...

For example, valuing your time in this world, and that family always should go first. <br/><br/>The script is unbelievable and unpredicting! It will never let you just sit there wondering when is the movie going to end. It provides strong turning points and climaxes that will even make you weep at some point.

"CadsIntlPrograms","10","1","8","1 July 2006"," Adam Sandler's box-office movie, Click! I Love It!
","I saw the movie, Click, by Adam Sandler about a week ago. My two daughters and two sons were with me. They got me into entering the theater, which I did reluctantly. I am not a person who watches movies at theaters, (watch them at home) but I did that day. The movie showing was Click. Well, I am a fan of Adam Sandler, so I became interested to see the movie. Adam just made me to like him more. His performance was phenomenal. I started shedding tears thirty minutes into the movie. Adam was telling my life story. Yes, about my life -- a life constantly at work trying all kinds of ideas to be rich and famous. I spend more time with my laptop than I give my kids. I have more than three major projects I am working myself to death to develop. So the life of Adam, a very brilliant technical engineer, who could not promptly provide a bicycle for his daughter because his wages simply could not pay all the bills. But being that he was brilliant, much liked by management because he could deliver, he showed every potential to rise in leadership. Adam, however, was anxious about providing for his family. He wanted the best for his kids, but because he could not earn enough to buy them what they wanted, he was so stressed and so carried away by the passion to work to get a breakthrough that he failed to better socialize with his wife and kids. He had no time at all for the kids and would work through the night to get a project completed for his boss. So Adam had the opportunity to skip the tedious process of life to rise through the ranks and became CEO. What Adam failed to understand was that, with the position of CEO other anxieties about life set in. That was what happened with Adam. His CEO responsibilities still overwhelmed his family life. No time for the family, so he lost his wife and the kids did not grow up with him and he was not even there when his father died. Good, heavens this is my LIFE. Although I am not rich yet as Adam is now, but I am working on my Pan African University online university to grow to one of the best universities in the world. My family life is suffering because I must do the work that will help us succeed with our university. So if I do have the option to ""click"" my life to the ultimate success of our university, I will do that. Adam, your movie is an Oscar, Academy awards performance. I am going to see this movie a hundred times between now and July 2007. Carry on, Adam -- Carry On! Kenday"

","CLICK;; Sandler portrays Michael Newman, an over-worked architect who puts work before his kids, 7-year old Ben and 5-year old Samantha, and his wife Donna. But hi entire world is about to change when Michael goes out in search for a universal remote.<br/><br/>This is where he meets oddball Morty, after going through the WAY BEYOND doorway in Bed, Bath & Beyond. Here Morty gives him a device that allows him to revisit any part of his life, pause or fast forward. What seems to be a life-saver ends up fast-forwarding through large periods of time on it's own, and Michael realizes he's missing out on life itself.<br/><br/>You'd think Sandler & Co. couldn't pull off punchy drama. I mean, 'Click' is being advertised as a comedy. And yes, it has it's comedic moments. But for me, it excelled better as a life-lesson drama. The reason, I believe, is the funny part of the premise is a bit too gimmicky.<br/><br/>As previously stated, not everything gels in 'Click'. Both halves work. Whether they work together is a good question. But 'Click' is more cleverly done and heartfelt that anything Sandler's done in the past. 'Click' shows us there's much to be appreciated in your life, like family and friends. So let those people know you love them.<br/><br/>3 out of 4."

","I went into the theater expecting a typical Adam Sandler movie, such as a ""Billy Madison"" or ""Happy Gilmore"" type comedy. It seemed that way at the beginning of the movie. But after a while, it becomes a wonderful and inspiring film.<br/><br/>Basically, Sandler's character gets a remote that lets him control his life (pause it, rewind it, etc). At first he uses the remote as a scapegoat, fast-forwarding arguments and events which he did't care to sit around for. The character is portrayed as an arrogant man who is trying to gain a partnership at his work (an architectural business). But after realizing that he has skipped over key moments in his own and his two children's lives, including the death of his father, Sandler's character realizes he has made very dumb mistakes so that his life would be convenient for himself.<br/><br/>I recommend anyone to go watch this. If you are one who cries easily, you will absolutely bawl in the closing half hour or so of this movie.<br/><br/>WONDERFUL MOVIE, GO SEE IT NOW!!!!"

But I did, only because I had a couple of movie passes that expired that day. But wow, was I ever in for a shock. The jokes were average for me, and the first hour were pretty much light hearted comedy. But then, things took a spin. I have to admit, I did cry. You should have seen the look on my nine year old brother's face during that part of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, it's probably not out to win an Oscar, or to move the world in some dramatic way, but it does teach you a lesson for life you'd never forget. It's nothing like any other comedy I've ever watched, and my favourite movie this year.<br/><br/>To the cast, director, and crew, I applaud you for a wonderful movie.

It features Adam sandler as the main character and the problem is that the remote has a memory, and it remembers what he pressed the forward button for. Therefore, when he pressed it for like promotions, and fights, and sex, it automatically skips through that stuff. This is a problem because at one point, he doesn't get a promotion until ten years later.

","Click might not be the average Adam Sandler film most of his fans know about however, it is still really good. Click starts off as a normal Adam Sandler comedy and eventually drifts into a serious drama. The serious aspects of the film were one of the major features that made the film good. Other than the seriousness, it still is pretty funny. Even in some of the serious parts of the film Adam Sandler manages to express his humour in some way. Adam Sandler should continue to star in films rather than only produce them. Adam Sandler starring in his films are what make them good. I must say that Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken also did a great job in their roles as well. Adam Sandler you should continue to act in your films. You do a great job.

In the end, I guessed it right- half of it at least. The other half was so much more than I thought it would be. I don't know how to describe it without going into 'spoiler-mode', but this movie had the three elements that I always are looking for in film. 1) Humor. Don't get me wrong, I love a good tear jerker. But this film really had the whole audience- including myself, on their toes laughing like there was no tomorrow. 2) Deepness. If you pay attention to this film, there are really a lot of allegories. I thought it was fun in a sense to sit there and decode them. 3) Emotion. I flat out balled in this movie. And I'm not talking the classic 50's silent tear roll down the cheek. I'm talking about the whole kabob! All in all, this was really an amazing film.

I was sorely mistaken halfway through the movie when the film takes an emotional turn. Sandler introduces himself as a serious dramatic actor while still keeping the guilty pleasure comedy the world over knows and loves. This movie reminded me of a comedic version of Meet Joe Black, only with a very lessened serious overtone. The emotion is there, the comedy is there, and this movie has it all truly. I was still crying well into the night after watching this film, thinking about past regrets and missed opportunities.

","I like Adam Sandler. But why does he always have to be the centre of his movies? Sometimes I feel that he would be better off on an ensemble cast. He can be overpowering. The supporting cast here is excellent, when they're allowed to shine. Christopher Walken, Jennifer Coolidge, Henry Winkler and a surprisingly good David Hasselhoff. It's also annoying that women, once again, are sidekick 'babes' whose lives revolve around their men's needs. In this movie, like so many others in Hollywood, the middle aged white male is front and centre, and everyone else is incidental. This movie tries hard to be entertaining and witty, and it does have its moments. But there's too many self indulgent Adam Sandler moments for it to be totally enjoyable."

","First and foremost, I'm going to pretty hard on Click, so be warned. I'm going to shoot you straight as an arrow on this flick. Far from terrible, which is what you would expect with a Happy Madison production, but far from deserving of all the praise it got and still gets to this day. Click is just okay. If anyone gave this more then six stars, don't be misled. It's maxed out at 6 stars, given a fair shake of course. A young man who works more at his job more then spending time with his family gets a remote control that...well, controls the universe. Amazing what you can get at Bed Bath & Beyond. So go to the beyond part of the store, and there's your remote control. We could have made a million of these, sold them for ten bucks a piece, and made 10 million dollars off it, but we just built one, and its all for you, Michael Newman! Absolutely no strings attached. Batteries not included. Hit the power button, the movie itself will shut down. The movie then takes us on his guide through the world of the remote, we should see tutorials, etc, instead, were listening to the 25,000 Dollar Pyramid Game theme! Huh, what? He can rewind, fast forward, he can pause the kids playing in the background for whatever God busted reason, but just keep in mind....this is HIS remote. HE'S IN CONTROL. So we think. The plot is about to get thick. It seems easy, right. Hit the fast forward button, he can skip arguing with his loved one. So while he's skipping, what happens to him. Oh, he's on auto pilot, he eats cereal super slow motion, while time literally passes him by, and he's not only NOT spending time with his family, but he's fast forwarding through the lessons that life tries to teach him. I think. Am I overthinking the film? Because I'll tell you what, the film does NOT have any direction that it wants to stay on. It's a fantasy, it's a comedy, it's a drama, it's a wonderful life, then it suddenly wants you to take it seriously, then it wants to make you cry, then the viewers emotions are tricked into thinking that they watched something good, and then your slapped right across the face with such a generic ending, an ending that made me wonder if the filmmakers knew what they created to begin with. So this remote control was specially made to ruin someones life? Or are they suppose to learn from it. How about we all learn from life without the remote, that's what we all do, anyway. For entertainment purposes, we play along. However, trying to make sense of the entire film is mind numbing. Its amazing how many people just disregard the logic side of it all. What, for example, happens when he loses the remote? If someone else picks it up, and starts fooling with it, does it affect their lives, or his? I understand that I may be looking too deep into the film, but for a film that demands to be deep deserves to be criticized as such, and that's why I'm being so hard on it. If you wanted to go the comedy route, go that route, and stay on it! This film just gets away with swerving, U turning, and just going all over the place, and people are okay with it because...well, that's just Happy Madison. No. It's just an excuse. You can put food in an igloo, but don't call it an ice box! From the director of The Waterboy, Click is far from disappointing, but far from rational and exciting, either. It's fine until you can see through the smoking mirrors."

","I'm not always an Adam Sandler fan but this movie is pretty funny. Basically he's a middle-class schlub who isn't getting ahead in life so he gets a universal remote to control his life. Things go well originally, as he rises up the ranks of the architecture firm. But then the remote goes on autopilot, making him miss years upon years of his life.<br/><br/>In the time between the skips he becomes an absolute jerk, not caring about anyone around him. While those in the actual time see him as a jerk, when he comes out of the lapses he is responding perfectly rationally...but those in the actual time see it as weird or meaning he has mental problems. He goes through his whole life, his wife leaves him and re-marries, his kids get older, and he dies. It brings a tear to your eye even though there is a lot of laughs. Luckily ""Morty"" (a parody of Marty from Back to the Future?), an angel, gives him a second chance. He takes it, vowing to be better person, a more loving father, and the film closes.<br/><br/>There is more than what I have just mentioned. This movie sort of brings time travel up to the present, apart from being uncontrollable like in The Time Traveler's Wife (2009), from a car accident like in Turn Back the Clock (1933), or through self-hypnosis in Somewhere in Time (1980). At the same time, perhaps it is a bit too easy for it to be in a remote. Even so, I like this conception of time travel in the consumerist society of the U$, as his annoyances could be felt by many. I can't remember any people of color in this film, so I'd venture to say it is a white man's fantasy since time travel movies in general usually involve white men traveling forward or backward in time, just as it happens in Back to the Future (1985) and The Time Machine (2002).<br/><br/>By the end of the film, I guess the lesson is to live your life, not skip around, and put family before your job? Not sure what the takeaway is at the end but this movie was definitely enjoyable."

","Re-watching Click for the first time in perhaps a decade seemed a good idea on paper - how could a loveable film with an immensely fun concept at its core be anything but a dead ringer for my fondest memories of it? Well...
The universal remote control that controls your universe, seeming ingenius at the time, proved itself to be something of a play-by-play rip-off of the eminently better Bruce Almighty (complete with women troubles, manipulating the dog's free will, and 'God' - who in this case is a Christopher Walken-shaped Death), with the creative remainder taking all of its direction from A Christmas Carol. There is nothing new or inventive about Click, its plot, its acting (it is, as ever, Adam Sandler playing shouty, angry, horny Adam Sandler), and its characters.
On the point of characters: Click is sexist beyond belief. When I went to see this at the cinema as a much younger man, I was so caught up in the fart gags and the dog penetratinf a hole in his toy duck's backside, that I didn't notice the lack of anything constituing a genuine female character - as, neither did the writers. Kate Beckinsale, as Sandler's wife, is as close as we get, but even then she really only exists to further the male protagonist's plot, seeming to have no greater narrative drive than what man she might ultimately end up serving. Beyond her, every woman seems to be no more than a brainless pair of breasts in a plunging neckline - other than Sandler's timid assistant, whose only purpose in the film is to briefly become transgender for a deeply offensive throwaway gag. The fact that this film dedicates an entire scene to a sexual harassment seminar, trying to lampoon the sexist corporate landscape whilst at the same time upholding it, shows how utterly out of touch and unaware of itself it really is."

I saw the previews for Click and figured if it had Christopher Walken in it that it might just be worth watching. It was a very pleasant surprise.
It was just quirky and funny enough to be enjoyable. Granted, some of the jokes were a bit forced and corny, but overall it held my attention and entertained me.

","Adam Sandler vehicle Click starts off as a goofball fantasy comedy that isn't all that funny, then turns into a surprisingly bleak but eventually heartwarming parable about not wasting your life, although for a while there I could have sworn that I was watching something else entirely: a movie about depression.<br/><br/>Sandler's character, Michael Newman, a workaholic architect who cannot find the time to spend with his family, is obviously suffering from severe stress and appears to have a mental breakdown. It's at this point that the enigmatic Morty (Christopher Walken) offers him a solution: a universal remote with which he can control his life, fast-forwarding through all the bad bits.<br/><br/>Think of Morty as a doctor and swap 'universal remote' with 'anti-depressants' and what follows can be seen in a different light. When Michael uses the remote, he is on auto-pilot, like a zombie, and before he knows it, years have passed and he has missed out on many of his family's special moments. Ultimately, his relationship with his gorgeous wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale) breaks down, he piles on the pounds, and winds up alone, having lost all that is dear to him. Then he dies.<br/><br/>Of course, this being a Hollywood comedy, this isn't how the story ends: Michael's miserable life turns out to have been a dream; waking up before his encounter with Morty, he decides to change his ways and make the most of every moment from now on. When offered the remote once again, he simply chucks it in the bin. If only it were that simple.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for the astounding old age make-up."

There were also some very good moments of actual drama which is a bit of a rarity in a this sort of film.

Aside from some slapstick humor and comedy, like the scenes where Michael makes the baseball hit the bully neighbor and him slapping his boss in the face, much of the humor is overshadowed by the excessive clichÃ© and tasteless sexual innuendos (especially involving the dog and the toy), which I thought weren't even remotely funny.<br/><br/>You are asked to sympathize with Michael when the remote control gets out of control, and he sees his life passes right before his eyes and into some life and death situations. But, Sandler's sometimes overbearing acting was a bit of a turn off and the mediocre acting by Christopher Walken was a bit boring. The pacing of the plot wasn't very solid, therefore, didn't generate much suspense.<br/><br/>There are some laughable moments and some touching ones as well, especially toward the climax, but overall, I've seen funnier stuff.<br/><br/>Grade D+"

","Click (2006): Dir: Frank Coraci / Cast: Adam Sandler, Kate Beckinsale, Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler: Unfunny comedy about taking life for granted. Adam Sandler plays a workaholic father who receives a remote control that magically controls his life at the click of buttons. Routine setup is followed by predictable formula where the remote overrules his life where the remote overruns his life and causes chaos where he eventually learns hard lessons about life, fatherhood, and being a husband. Director Frank Coraci worked with Sandler in The Wedding Singer, a better film. Here he has fun paralleling life with DVD features. Sandler is playing his usual persona but what's worse is when he lays down on a department store bed, the so-called plot twist becomes way too obvious. Kate Beckinsale is wasted as his frustrated wife. Christopher Walken is typecast as the ominous character distributing the remote. This whole invention is a great idea but played as more a prop. David Hasselhoff plays his controlling boss whom at one point receives Sandler's ass in his face after a pause button situation. Henry Winkler appears as Sandler's father with some annoying trick he does with a coin. The remote control element is creative otherwise it carries similar themes as It's a Wonderful Life, which I would recommend viewers to click on. Score: 4 / 10"

"JackBurtonsMullet","3","0","2","17 June 2013"," A 3/10 is being pretty generous towards this movie.
","This 2006 comedy does have a pretty creative premise that did open up doors for plenty of comedic material. Being that this film was produced by and stars Adam Sandler, it could have been terrible or mediocre given his track record. This one falls somewhere in between those labels. <br/><br/>There are some genuinely entertaining moments, all of which come from both Christopher Walken and David Hasselhoff. However, almost none of that enjoyment comes from any of the actual writing. It comes from the fact that both of them have ridiculously amusing on-screen persona's. Their lines are funny,only because it is either Chris or David saying them. <br/><br/>Other than those two, the comedy is pretty bland. Adam Sandler does his usual obnoxious runs, Kate Beckinsale looks bored and Henry Winkler is stuck playing the movie's heart. Any time the movie needs to be ""sad"" or ""emotional"", Henry is always either the focus of it or is directly referenced.<br/><br/>Weak comedy and performances are not the movie's only problems. The most significant fault of ""Click"" is that it does not have enough confidence in its script in order to create a bridge between the silly, low-brow comedy and the more dramatic elements of the writing. Every time the movie wants to be serious, it feels the need to throw in a sight gag because it thinks that it will lose the audience's attention. There is no shortage of farting in David Hasselhoff's face or kicks to Sean Astin's groin, even when the scene did not exactly demand it.<br/><br/>""Click"" had a lot of potential as either a fun comedy and/or a heartfelt comedy-drama. I wish that the writers were more willing to either be tonally consistent, or create a balance between the two. If you want to see a funny comedy that also pokes at your heartstrings, I would recommend something like ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""."

This is easily one of my favourite performances from Adam Sandler, he's done many comedies and has had a few dramatic roles but he rarely gets to do both, he does in this and it really shows us how talented and versatile Sandler really is as an actor. It's not a perfect comedy, but it is quite funny and surprisingly dramatic, and for that I would recommend Click to anyone looking for a good comedy or drama. <br/><br/>A stressed business is given the opportunity of a lifetime when he is given a remote that can fast forward, pause and rewind his real life, however, complications arise when the remote starts malfunctioning. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Adam Sandler Worst Performance: Jennifer Coolidge"

""Click"" a button! <br/><br/>But alas, the same old scenarios come into play, do you really want to know your future or even have that much power over your life? Trying to control your own time-line still brings into the play the same inequities and personality quirks that you used to handle (screw up) the present with, and the same mistakes can easily affect your renewed intentions.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken plays the ""mystical owner"" of a store that has more purposes hidden behind it's curtains than what might first meet the eye of a prospectively innocent new customer, and it is here that Adam Sandler's life begins to change when he purchases a ""new tech"" remote control to rid himself of all the separate controls that continue to be misplaced around the house.<br/><br/>Walken's role was perfectly cast, but they could have used more flare and more acting spots to further evolve his character. Problem with most people is that they try to play a role all by themselves of heavily gifted movie critics, and thus this movie has been greatly underrated for its wonderfully entertaining, attention keeping and tickle funny creative concepts.<br/><br/>rent it, buy it, watch it, for it is well worth the ""8 star"" rating I generously gave it, as I would watch it again and then maybe once more again over a small spell in between, just because I remembered the depth of perception they included in a comedy that gave it its worth and meaning.<br/><br/>The Will Ferrel type of stupidity isn't in this one to grasp a hand towards an excuse of a movie just to claim its a comedy."

No need for those scenes. The ""dramatic"" parts toward the end of the movie are okay, but the movie would have benefited without them. And I think the movie could have used a different ending.

There's some very good work done by the special effects and makeup department. Some of the jokes are quite cheap, which is expected, but most of them work.Adam Sandler is the usual but I found his annoying in the over-the-top and whiny scenes.

Split very much into two vastly different halves, Click finds Sandler reining in his usual shouty goof ball persona. Naturally for the first part we get the comedy set ups, at times hilarious and at others a little crass, but it's never sledgehammer comedy of the like that Sandler has previously served up in spades. The reason for the restraint becomes evident when the films second half arrives, full of emotional fortitude it's something of a shock at first to grasp the switch in tone, but it works real well, and it's testament to Sandler's straight acting ability that he manages to sway the viewer into this fantastical realm.<br/><br/>Click is no genius piece of work, and for the genre it tackles it's probably some way short of being up with the best. It does however punch the right buttons. From Sandler and a highly accomplished supporting cast {Kate Beckinsale, Christopher Walken, Sean Astin and Henry Winkler}, to its delightful and rewarding finale, this most definitely is one that is worth punching play on your remote control for.

Click is something special, and I feel obligated to do my part to make people aware of the fact that this is actually a great movie, and not at all what you probably think it is.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying, Click is advertised all wrong. It is advertised as just another mindless Adam Sandler comedy. And while it certainly has its typical Adam Sandler moments, it has true heart. Something you hardly see in a Sandler movie.<br/><br/>It starts off light-hearted and comical, and remains that way for a while. However, slowly but surely, you watch as the transition between goofy comedy and deeply emotional drama begins. The contrast is stark, and of a magnitude not often seen. The truth is, there are several scenes that are brutally sad. One in particular really threw me for a loop, and is among the most emotional scenes I've ever laid eyes on. In the midst of all the heavy stuff, there are some little reminders that, hey, you are still watching an Adam Sandler movie. Quite frankly, I could have done without them. And it is one of the movie's few true flaws. In my opinion at least.<br/><br/>Many people bash the ending. But the reality is, it was written exactly the way it had to be, in order to make the movie as effective as it is. Had it ended differently, the whole message behind it would have been diminished somewhat. That's all I will say.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, it is an incredibly overlooked and misrepresented movie. One with some deeply moving moments, and a powerful message to go along with it. I recommend it to everyone, unless you really have a hard time with the sad stuff. In that case, it may be best to avoid it. At the very least, it will surprise you. At best, it will shock you, and really have an impact on you emotionally."

","Click isn't your ordinary Adam Sandler movie. We see much more of Adam, from the comedic side, and the dramatic side. There is the original modern era' humor, and characters but Click is not like all the other Adam Sandler movies. This movie does send through a message and it's not a hard one to figure out, it's easily spotted through-out the whole duration of the picture; yet so many people take advantage of it. This is a must-see for all comedy, and Adam Sandler movie fans. It's got a very intriguing and sufficient plot, that will keep you hung until the very end. We see all different types of Adam Sandler in this movie, you figure out which one suits him best."

","I agree with a number of other comments that this is one of Adam Sandler's best films. Since he has appeared in numerous mediocre films, that's not necessarily much of an achievement. Still, 'Click' works remarkably well as a modern day cautionary fable, reminding its viewers of 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Things get almost unbearably painful until the final happy ending (surely that's no spoiler in an Adam Sandler picture!). Alas, the film partially ruins this by running a series of annoying juvenile jokes of the sort favored by young teenagers. Worth watching nonetheless.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10"

"Electrified_Voltage","8","0","1","6 December 2008"," Often funny, sometimes not so funny, but it's not all about the laughs
","I guess I first heard of this movie around the time it was released in 2006, but never looked at it as a must-see, or a movie to avoid at all costs. I've never been a HUGE Adam Sandler fan, but he has made me laugh in some of the films I've seen him in (mind you, I think he can be pretty lame at times). Over two years after ""Click"" was released in theatres, I finally got around to giving it a try. It seemed to be looked upon as one of Sandler's better films, unlike that lame ""Eight Crazy Nights"", so I had reasonable expectations. Like probably many others, I was expecting typical Sandler fare for the most part, but eventually, that wasn't entirely what I got, not that I'm complaining.<br/><br/>Michael Newman is a workaholic architect who lives with his wife, Donna, and two kids, Ben and Samantha. Determined to please his boss and get a promotion, he prioritizes his work, which interferes with his family life. Another problem is that he eats very poorly. One night, tired of clicking the wrong remote control while trying to turn the TV on, he decides to go out and buy a universal remote, which he will be able to use on all electrical items. During his search, he meets Morty, a strange scientist who introduces him to a brand new remote control, one which isn't even on the market yet! With this remote, one can actually control their entire universe! Michael takes it, and soon finds that his life is now a lot like a DVD! He can even skip any moment in his life he wishes to, going through it on auto-pilot! So, his life seems to be improving with this remote, until he begins to lose control of it! When this happens, it causes him grave misfortune, and he can't get rid of it! <br/><br/>One may assume that this is another silly Adam Sandler comedy, and for much of the film, this is true. It starts out like that, and remains that way for quite a while. I laughed quite a bit, especially during scenes such as Prince Habeeboo annoyed by the mispronunciations of his name, the rivalry between Michael and a kid next door named Kevin O'Doyle, and Michael pausing his boss to slap and fart on him. Yes, even though I find fart jokes to be a major clichÃ© in modern comedies, and not usually funny, for some reason, that one made me laugh! I guess it's better than a character just farting at random. Sometimes, the humour in this film gets a little TOO juvenile, such as the jokes about the main character being born with an unusually small penis. If it were all about the humour, I wouldn't be able to rate this film any higher than a 7, but later in the film, it becomes more dramatic, sometimes even heart-wrenching! They really pulled this off, and I sometimes got a lump in my throat from it! <br/><br/>This isn't the only film Adam Sandler has ever starred in that has drama in it, but so far, it's the only one I've seen, and judging by his performance here, it appears he can do it! Also, I have to point out Kate Beckinsale in the cast. I've seen her before in ""Brokedown Palace"", ""Underworld"", and ""Pearl Harbour"", but for some reason, I still didn't recognise her in ""Click"". However, at the end credits, when I realized she played Donna Newman, I thought it was nice to see her in a decent movie for once. Of the previous three, I found that ""Brokedown Palace"" was the best, and even that one isn't really that good. Another highlight in this film's cast is Christopher Walken as Morty. The last role I saw him in before this one was the main villain in 1985's ""A View to a Kill"", one of the inferior James Bond movies, so this film is much better than that one as well! Anyway, overall, ""Click"" is an impressive dramedy, with a good message about the importance of families!"

I'm thinking awesome as in Star Wars, Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction awesome. A serious film whose TV ads/previews didn't do it justice. I saw the movie thinking I was going to see something like Happy Gilmore or Waterboy or maybe even 50 First Dates, but no, it's a movie definitely worthy of 10 stars and better than 99% of the crap that's put out these days.

","The retelling of a Christmas Carol, even more than It's a Wonderful Life, by resort to a gadget - a supernatural remote control that literally alters time for he who operates it. I caught the broadcast premiere, probably in the effort to make this yet another 'holiday' favorite (and which is appropriate, if the 'holiday' meant more than simply - holiday). It's a 'Capra-film' (Frank Coraci, actually), nonetheless, just not quite as good.<br/><br/>A struggling junior architect, happily married with two small children, wishes to become partners in a firm designing large projects. He's having trouble with their domestic squabbling, like George in the 'fixer-upper' after having lost the day's cash, and wants time to himself for an important presentation. More importantly, with the various remote controls around the house, he keeps picking up the wrong one. Finally frustrated, he takes off late one evening to pick one up. For some reason, the device mysteriously appears in a Bed, Bath and Beyond store, down the end of a dark hallway and inside a mysteriously gigantic warehouse - the mystical genie or fortune teller at the carnival that later disappears, as it were. Walken is the 'angel', appearing as some 'nutty professor' at first, that delivers this pact, and this device, without ever quite explaining how it works.<br/><br/>Our hero, Newman, returns to find it operates his TV, but doesn't notice it also operated his wife. Soon he starts to notice that he can adjust the volume, and the world around him becomes mute. He can pause/stop time with the pause button, and so on. He finds he can skip uncomfortable family meals and outings, or skip to a possible promotion day, by hitting fast forward. And as soon as he discovers this power, even someone unfamiliar with Dickens is going to say - that way lies tragedy. And of course it does.<br/><br/>Eventually, he returns to the store, finds the same hallway, and questions the 'angel'. More about the device is explained to him. At this point, he'd rather pass. But now he can't get rid of it. Try as he might to destroy it, it keeps coming back. It does proves its worth, in a way, in overhearing and translating a Japanese contingent complaining about the project he had proposed. He presents their complaints back to them, before they leave, and wins the contract, and is on his way . . eventually . . to partnership and to wealth and power at the head of a large firm before he dies.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, the remote is firing off fast forward even when he doesn't push the button. He lives his life on 'auto-pilot', it's explained in those periods. He can return as an observer to those times he missed, but cannot do them over. Years are lost to him. He wife leaves him. And at the end, he speaks badly to his father over a game of a 'magic coin' that had always been their secret and bond. Dad leaves the room in tears, and dies not long afterward, all of which our hero missed for fast forward.<br/><br/>Standing at his father's grave, the 'angel' again shows up and says - I am the angel of death. The device had been the trick of the genie, basically. You asked the devil for a favor, and it wasn't quite the bargain one imagined.<br/><br/>Oddly, though, as he dies in the rain, in the street, having run out of his son's wedding to warn him - take time with your family, because his son was up against the clock on yet another project of his own at the same firm - the 'angel of death' for some reason relents and hits the reset button. Our hero awakes in BBnB just before he discovered the hallway that night so long ago. And like Scrooge, like George Bailey, he appreciates what he had that he hadn't before. He gets his second chance. In fact, as a final temptation, the device again appears before him, supernaturally, one last time. He throws it in the trash.<br/><br/>It's the same moral or object lesson. We don't really get do-overs, which is probably the source of pathos in these stories. But we can by such stories learn to be thankful and appreciate our loved ones, and even all those around us. In Dickens, the angels or phantoms were doing as told. In Capra, Clarence got his wings. In this one, however, we tend to forget the 'angel'. Seems like he might just have gotten a reprimand."

","This is a pretty difficult movie to surmise, as it doesn't quite work and it's quite hard to say why.<br/><br/>The plot has Adam Sandler as a busy working father who discovers a remote control with the power to bend space and time. The movie fuses elements of comedy, drama, and fantasy, but none of these elements are particularly powerful enough to make this a really good movie.<br/><br/>The comedy isn't belly laugh hilarious, but than again it's not totally devoid of laughs. There certainly enough of the fart-gag type humor you would expect from an Adam Sandler film, but some other nice comic touches as well.<br/><br/>The elements of fantasy and science fiction have interesting possibilities but the whole premise hasn't been properly thought through. The remote control devise seems to have no rules which ends up being confusing.<br/><br/>The drama is probably the films strongest card, and at the center of this is Sandler's time demanding career threatening to cost him his family. The Christmas Carol style out of body journeys through time are pretty insightful and moving, and in the end it's pretty nice redemption story.<br/><br/>Fans of the insane acting stylings of Christoper Walken are in for a treat, and it's good to see 'the Hoff' doing nice work in an extended supporting role. I can't confess to seeing all his stuff but looking back at his career this could well be the best thing he has ever done.<br/><br/>There are a lot of threads running through this film, and a good film in there somewhere. When put on paper the film is probably less than the sum of it's parts, but when compared to other Adam Sandler vehicles it's actually pretty good. If it had more focus in the story, stronger direction, and dropped about 20 minutes of the weaker comedy I think it would have been a whole lot better, possibly even very good."

","Click isn't an ordinary Adam Sandler movie. It's distinctively different than the typical dumb comedies that Adam Sandler does. I love Adam Sandler, but he continues to do stuff like ""Don't Mess With The Zohan"" which has become tiring. Either way, Click is a much better role these days for the older not in his twenty's Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>Click starts off as a humorous light comedy, and eventually turns into a more dramatic modern day version of ""It's A Wonderful Life."" It's so eerily similar to the Capra classic. Both movies deal with being grateful and appreciating what you have, even when thins can become tough and frustrating. Sandler is surprisingly good as the bitter, regretful frustrated older man who can't control his life. Obviously Sandler deals well as his usual younger funny self, but it's in the desperate and tough times where Sandler's character captivates us, making us feel sympathetic for the spiral downfall that his life has become due to a remote control that skips in time because it has become programmed to fast-forward the normally skipped parts. It's an extremely intelligent piece of software that re-programs itself based on what Michael (Adam Sandler) decides to do.<br/><br/>I know I felt a lot of pain for Michael's (Sandler) character at the end; it's such an emotional scene that works so well. It sort of loses its value when they decide to use a cheap moment for comic relief. And it's that sort of thing which shows us what the movies is supposed to be. A light, fun, humorous enjoyable comedy/drama with a little message to share to us. And it's this conventional method of entertaining which keeps the viewer in it from beginning to end, letting us never miss the message the producers, writers, and directors wanted us to see. Click is great solid fun, that's surprisingly funny and sentimental at the same time. 7/10"
"super16","2","0","1","25 May 2008"," Predictably Unamusing
","As some other users notes, this is a timeless story - that has been both beautifully and interesting presented, in movies like It's A Wonderful Life and in the story of Faust. However, why Adam Sandler's production company decided this needed to be updated and retold, is simply unknowable - because other than adding an unfunny crudeness (fart jokes, boob jokes, dogs humping a stuffed duck?), it did nothing that a recent, better made movie like Nicolas Cage's The Family Man did, while covering much of the same territory.<br/><br/>What is also further implausible (and becomes even more so as Sandler ages and lets himself go) is that he would end up with the hot girl. In some of his other movies, there was some unknown charm or childlike wonder or other unearthed element to the roles he played to justify how he got the girl (say in Big Daddy or even Billy Madison), but in this he plays a unpleasant, unattractive, unappealing shlub. He might rate a decent girl - not Kate Beckinsale.<br/><br/>Another problem with the script is how poorly thought out some parts are - why would the Angel of Death do something for a ""nice guy?"" In this role, Walken was either the devil or god, but not the Angel of Death. Its elements like this that show how poorly thought out and poorly developed this concept was - once they decided to rip it off from better made movies."

I was laughing out loud many times (the fart in mouth joke was particularly funny) and all the fun stuff Newman does with the remote, like changing the color of his face, teasing the obnoxious neighbor boy and making his boss all wide. This also shows that ""The Hoff"" can take the p*** out of himself. So indeed very funny. But what really makes me praise this movie so much is that it touches your heart. Sandler can really act, and I was crying several times. The scene where he sees his father for the last time and keeps rewinding breaks my heart. I love Julie Kavner in this. She is amazing!

"vip_ebriega","7","0","1","15 April 2008"," Happy Gilmore... with his universal remote.
","My Take: Derivative yet funny. <br/><br/>Almost all of Adam Sandler comedies sum up similarly. HAPPY GILMORE, THE WATERBOY, THE LONGEST YARD, and now, CLICK. CLICK isn't any different from other of Sandler's movies, but it's perhaps the most relevant and, perhaps, the smartest, even if it isn't the least brilliant. It's pure Sandler formula, but it works well with a better script, derived from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and BRUCE ALMIGHTY, and its mildly amusing with a touch.<br/><br/>I hardly bought Sandler as a father in his movies (BIG DADDY mainly), but he did better this time around. He plays Michael Newman, a workaholic who chooses work, aiming to be his boss's new partner, over spending time with his family, much to the disappointment of his wife (Kate Beckinsale) and kids. When life gets too tough for him, or basically getting a difficult time to turn on the television, he decides to buy a universal remote to ""make his life less complicated"". Christopher Walken plays the eccentric ""store clerk"" named Morty who gives him a Universal Remote Control (""the remote that controls your universe.""), who also pops up unexpectedly to give him advices on how to use it. This gives Michael, of course, the opportunity to do things he'd been dying to do. This includes messing with his boss (David Hasselhoff) who refuses to promote him, shutting up his wife's nagging best friend , and mess with the little annoying kid next door. All this is quite funny and they deliver, even if some jokes are mean-spirited and some, fall short off the mark.<br/><br/>Although it doesn't always work, CLICK delivers the promise. It's quite funny enough, especially during the scenes with Sandler and Walken. When both of these guys are on the screen, the comedy sparks fly. Sandler's acting hasn't yet improved over the years and the morality is simply spoiled by the fact that Michael has been to mean all his life, but I didn't mind, it delivers exactly what I wanted.<br/><br/>CLICK is far from its inspirations (said above), but all in all, its worth the effort. I had fun enough to give it a ***1/2.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

","Click tells a story of a man who works hard for his family but doesn't always get due returns and so he's frustrated. Then a remote control lets him fast forward some of the tough moments or take it out on his jerk boss (David Hasselhoff), etc. Plot is good, supporting cast is EXCELLENT. Adam Sandler is just not good enough of an actor to play his character. For example, there's a scene where Adam Sandler comes home with disappointing news. Sandler's character appears as a jerk and a whiny loser to his family because his angry rants have no other feelings due to poor acting. You're more annoyed than cheering him. This happens through all of Sandler's scenes and this spoils the movie. A skilled actor would have offered more emotions of dedication or care for his family or even humor during the sad scenes if he's real good like Robert Downey Jr. You would have better understood and emphasized for the character. <br/><br/>On the positive end - Kate Beckinsale plays her role very well and looks good too. David Hasselhoff plays is great as the boss and his only comic scene is hilarious but you already see that in the trailer. Christopher Walken delivers his lines well and is funny as usual - but he plays a very minor role so we don't see much. This would have been a 7.5 if we had a better actor than the very limited Adam Sandler. Suppose Kevin Spacey, Ben Stiller, or even Jim Carrey. I saw it because the trailer was very promising, plot sounded good. The trailer had all the substance of the movie and the funniest jokes.

I became apparent quite early that the message the film wants to get across is the main plot of the film. The script however deals with it in a novel, interesting and innovative way which other films dealing with the subject don't all do. Sandler is more subdued than usual and proves again he can act other roles with aplomb. Walken is superb, as is Beckinsale. Funny, this afternoon I saw her dad in a rerun of a 'Porridge' episode and he was class too. This film is funny and serious, it allows for balanced viewing of gags and life's more tragic moments.

In fact, it looks like any other fluffy Hollywood light hearted tale with plenty of amusement and more than a touch of sentiment.<br/><br/>And for the first 45 minutes to an hour, it does this more than successfully - it is actually amusing, it is fairly sweet without being saccharine, and it is extremely entertaining with superb performances all round, including Walken as a crazy inventor and Hasselhoff in a role he was born to play as a hedonistic boss.<br/><br/>And yet thereafter it becomes a dark, epidermal, and actually rather depressing tale of a man who makes mistakes and has to pay for them.<br/><br/>Before ending sugar sweet, nauseatingly so.<br/><br/>The problem I have with reviewing this movie is that it isn't sure what it is. It is not a comedy as the second half is anything but, and it is not a dark tale as the first hour is so light. So what is it? I'm not sure.<br/><br/>First off, I have to say Sandler plays his part well, and does a good job of such a tricky role, while the simply gorgeous Kate Beckinsale provides the glamour and a very convincing US accent.<br/><br/>And the direction is good with the story never slowing down.<br/><br/>But it's the wild shifts in direction which leave a sour rather than saccharine taste in the mouth.<br/><br/>One minute it is a comedy, then it's a depressing and grim sci-fi drama, before turning into 'it was all a dream' Dallas style (yes, really), before a sickly ending which tries to pay homage to the end of It's a Wonderful Life and fails horribly.<br/><br/>That all said and done, it is not a bad movie, just a mixed up one.<br/><br/>You will see worse, but it's better you know what on earth this one is."

The plot basically involves a job-serious man named Michael Newman that discovers a ""universal remote"" that manipulates time, volume, and other things in real life. When using it, he becomes detached from his family in order to satisfy his personal tastes and lead a successful business life. The message is strong and powerful. By the end, its hard not to feel sympathetic towards Newman.<br/><br/>The acting was great and the dialog was decent. Adam Sandler does a great job as Michael Newman, conveying the emotional impact of the remote perfectly. The other acting was great as well. The special effects were good, but a little bit overdone when displaying the interface of the universal remote menu. The first half was basically the comedy part; I got a few laughs but nothing priceless. During the second half, things really come together to create an intriguing story line. It reminded me a lot of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, in which Newman plays the part of Scrooge and Morty (the remote vendor) is the ghost. Newman experiences his past, present, and future and sees the problems of his life. Despite this, the ending is very ""feel-good"".<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and content of Click. It is much different than Sandler's earlier films in a good way. One can't help being absorbed by the plot, despite numerous technical errors regarding the remote (which doesn't damage the story at all). Recommended for all viewers."

The guy was totally mean-spirited, self-obsessed, violent, revenge seeking and infantile before using the remote (for instance shown by his treatment of his wife's friend played by Jennifer Coolidge, which had nothing to do with the remote) and it was pretty clear he didn't deserve to be with Beckinsale's character form the start. This made me totally root for the character played by Sean Astin.<br/><br/>The movie is UNfunny! What about that terrible running gag with dogs humping the stuffed duck time and again?

So, they set up Sandler as this overworked architect (cough, cough) who doesn't spend enough time with his kids and wife. How many times do they need to do this storyline? I don't need to learn a moral--I spend time with my kids and wife. I want to see what this goof-ball is going to do with his remote. They could have done so much more with that.<br/><br/>Well, I'm going to end on that note--it's really not worth writing even this much about it.<br/><br/>Watch Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore and forget the rest of Sandler's stuff. How long can he go on doing the same crap with the same group of washed-up buddies?"

","I got this film not expecting very much from it except to be a light hearted comedy with the usual plot of the Adam Sander genre i could now be called, but i was very surprised to find quite a deep and emotional plot. The humour of an Adam Sander film is there with great performances from supporting actors such as Christopher Walken as the aptly named Morty who adds so many of the laughs.A story about one mans struggle to balance his work life with his family life but gets his priority's all wrong and is given a chance to redeem himself with a technological advancement that is a remote control that controls the universe, doesn't sound like an epic movie thats what i thought at first but it really is,I really was surprised with how enjoyable the film was and would recommend it to anyone. definitely worth a watch."

","For a Sandler movie, this is surprisingly good, and it has a rather interesting script and some good acting moments (including Sandler!). Of course, you couldn't get along without the humping dogs, fart jokes and some other trivial stuff which have been Sandler's kind of trademark. But it's refreshing how they mixed drama, aging and death in a comedy. Walken was very good, probably the best, as the rest of the cast were almost as sketchy as their characters. There are some twists (some surprising, other corny), Sandler has a few moments, but I couldn't escape the feeling that all was treated too superficially. I laughed a couple of times or so, felt emotion at the dad and death scenes (more because of the situation itself), still something was missing. A reworking of the script, or a better cast, at least."

This movie drove me crazy. There were so many plot holes and details that were overlooked. The film was tied together by calling Christopher Walkens character as the Angel of Death. That one liner was supposed to tie the plot and story together. It didn't. Instead of making this movie just a comedy, the movie attempted to be a drama. But it didn't work. During a number of scenes when someone was sick or dying Adam Sandler smirks. His pain is completely unbelievable. The only real pain is having to endure watching 20 minutes of this movie.

I saw this film mainly because it was nominated for an Academy Award for Make-up, & that fact alone was my reason to watch this,.<br/><br/>I am GLAD that I did,It is a wacky comedy farce about an overworked man, his family & a wild remote control. It is quite silly at times, BUT there is an inner truth to many scenes.

It is about 105 minutes long but seems much shorter.<br/><br/>There is a large song score as well, many songs fit the scene.<br/><br/>Now as too the make-up,Since the characters do age, the make-up also ages & is expertly done, There is body suit make-up as well,that is very good, Its a deserved nomination BUT the other two nominees are somewhat better.<br/><br/>The large cast is very good, all are veteran performers we have seen many times.

"spooly_montana","9","0","1","13 February 2007"," Frank Capra meets Adam Sandler
","Adam Sandler reunites with his friend, director Frank Coraci, in the movie CLICK. They both went to NYU together, and have collaborated on such comedies as 'The Waterboy' and 'Wedding Singer'. Joining Sandler in 'Click' are comic heavyweights Christopher Walken and Henry Winkler, with Kate Beckinsale (Underworld), David Hasselhoff, Sean Astin (50 First Dates, Lord of the Rings), and Rachel Dratch (Saturday Night Live). Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) is an overworked architect, with a lovely wife (Kate Beckinsale), and two young children Â– Ben and Samantha. Michael's boss, Mr. Ammer (David Hasselhoff), is a womanizing, inconsiderate jerk who works Michael way too hard. With the opportunity for promotion always dangled in front of him, Michael feels he has no choice, but to sacrifice the occasional camping trip with his two kids or game of catch, rather than sacrifice his career by letting his boss down. He simply has no time. When he gets home and kicks back on the couch, he grabs the nearest remote and turns on the ceiling fan, the stereo, or something else besides the TV. So one night, completely frustrated, he goes to Bed Bath & Beyond for a universal remote to operate everything simply. In his pursuit of the remote, he stumbles upon an out-of-the-way door in the store with a sign positioned above it that reads ""Way Beyond"". He proceeds through the door, and down a long dark corridor, until he sees a crazy looking techie, mad scientist of sorts, named Morty (Christopher Walken). With a crazy glint in his eye, Morty hands Michael a special remote that will allow him to control everything in his life, and that means everything. So what does he do with these new found powers? With the Menu on this remote he has options like ""The Making Of"" (his conception), ""Language Options"" (ever seen David Hasselhoff speak Spanish?), ""Rewind"", ""Forward"", and ""Skip Chapter"". He uses the latter options liberally to skip the unpleasant moments that arise in his daily life, such as sickness, exhausting work projects and arguments with his wife. Sounds good on paper, but as the remote memorizes his skipping habits, life speeds by around him, completely out of his control. He realizes that those small moments he is missing is what life is all about, and he does not want to lose any of them, but as the years go by increasingly faster, is it too late? Imagine Adam Sandler doing a film in the classic tradition of 'It's a Wonderful Life', except in this telling you have a sandwich of meaty morals, placed between two thick slices of Sandler-esquire bread. There are some sincerely tender moments where Sandler turns in serious ""Oscar"" acting, followed by silly moments that cause you to laugh out loud. All in all 'Click' is a good comedy, with great lessons to take away with you after viewing. You should treasure the mundane things in life; cherish them, because you only get to experience them once. There is no rewind button."

","This is a great movie. It wasn't too cheesy with its message, even though it is a message that has been given many times. This is the first movie that made me actually want to call my dad and tell him I love him, instead of thinking that it would just be a nice gesture. Sandler has tried the ""I love my dad"" bit before in Big Daddy, but it actually works in Click. I also how the movie eases us along with his struggles for success and providing for his family through a easily understood character. There is a bit of crude humor involving dog on stuffed animal action, but it is mostly focused in the beginning of the film. <br/><br/>Plus, the future scenes are still somewhat realistic and don't detract from the story with theatrics. I absolutely loved it...although he never did finish that clubhouse."

","From what I heard about the film and saw in trailers etc I hadn't expected the sort of film that Click turned out to be. The trailers gave the impression of another goofy (but good) Adam Sandler film where Adam plays a dim-witted but funny drop out type. But Click showed Sandler playing a somewhat different role, that of the slightly less goofy career minded family man, a role that I felt came very naturally to him. Later parts of the film had scenes that were very touching including the scene where an old Sandler is using the remote to view the last time he saw his father before he died. I liked the film and thought certain parts, mainly when he becomes a work-aholic, post-liposuction-ed CEO were reminiscent of the Godfather and Michael Corlione's slip into madness. I felt that the emotional significance of the aforementioned scene was similar to that of 'Freddo's last boat ride' in GF2, whereby you have the protagonist wrongly shunning the loving father/brother ultimately leading to their death. Overall I think Click showed another side of the Sandler film and I would like to see more of this."

","A wonderful movie, which could be seen as a very modern type of (positively turned) ""Memento mori"" or better as a ""Carpe Diem""-note.<br/><br/>The main message of the movie is to take life as it is, with all it's bad parts and good parts, to enjoy it and make the best of it - what absolutely is not equal to ""earn as much Money as possible"". The focus of the movie is especially on the importance of the family, which is clearly spoken out at the very end of the film. The ending is very emotional, maybe already a bit too pathetic, in total to ""Hollywood"" - but acceptable due to the fact, that the movie wants to be a film for the whole family first and not an adults drama. So Kids maybe should see a happy ending where I personally would not have needed this.<br/><br/>Beside this the movie entertains with a lot of good comedy parts and little jokes - quiet the right amount not to spoil the entire movie which is in fact facing a very philosophical topic, but in my eyes a bit too less for making this movie a full blown comedy. The acting of all cast is quiet professional, especially Christopher Walkens role ""Morty"" in well done - absolutely innovative for this role which is normally very stereotyped. You will not expect who he is 'til he actually tells you and still after that I found it very astonishing the way he acts and acted before.<br/><br/>In total a good movie. Missing points to maximum due to the typical Hollywood ending, which makes the movie too predictable, and the totally outworn ""I dreamed this all only""-method. It's too many standards in writing, acting and ending to make it a really outstanding movie. But for entertainment and at least some minutes of thinking about your own life and how you are doing it, it will definitely do."

The movie started off exactly as expected: Comedy, some vulgar, and light-hearted remarks by Mr. Sandler. But there was something... different... about the start of this film in hindsight. At the time, I didn't notice, but it was clear that the plot was building toward something. From there, the plot grew with each moment to a budding gem! At first, the remote was a God-send for Sandler, allowing him to ""fix"" the problems in his life, which primarily consisted of getting himself more time to accomplish more at work. Things start to spiral out of control, however, as the remote remembers his ""preferences"", and begins fast-forwarding through most of his life. From here, the plot changed from a light-hearted comedy with a subtle backbone to a heart-rending drama that tore tears from me...<br/><br/>I was shocked when he had to discover his dog had died... I tried, and failed, to choke back tears when he was saying goodbye to his dad, whom he had been exceptionally rude to while in ""autopilot"" while fast forwarding right past his death... And the hairs on my arm raised and I got chills as he sacrificed his life and used his dying breaths to beg his son not to follow in his footsteps and to apologize to his wife...<br/><br/>Of course, the ending is happy, or else this could not have been sold as a comedy at all, but the messages were clear.<br/><br/>This is a surprise gem that you will truly enjoy!"

"triple8","5","0","1","9 December 2006"," I get the message of Click and appreciate it, but I still didn't like the movie.
","SPOILERS THROUGH: <br/><br/>Click was a movie I had wanted to see since I first heard About it and only recently had a chance to watch it. I unfortunately was quite disappointed although I didn't find it nearly as bad as many have said. This wasn't a 1 or a 2 but I Still was let down and wish I had liked it more.<br/><br/>First the good. Adam Sandler was-well-Adam Sander. I happen to be a fan and found him good as he always is. The key to Sandler's charm is that he's so darn likable one can never really dislike him even when he does dislike able things. He still retains that trademark Adam Sandler goofy lovable quality. Here is no different.<br/><br/>But Sandler is the main positive. The problem I had with Click is the movie tries to be both a comedy(in it's very early stages) and a serious drama and doesn't do either really that well. The comedy, what little there is of it, isn't very funny and doesn't come close to much of Sandler's other work. Somehow you'd think it would in a movie with such a premise as this but the comedy doesn't work all that well.<br/><br/>But then there's the drama. OK-I like serious movies-a lot. But this movie defines the term ""bait and switch."" The reason I knew it would be as heavy as it was is because I'd heard about it. But I really think the movie should have bean marketed in a different way. I'm sure there were a lot of young kids who went into it thinking it was going to be a light Sandler comedy and I think it would be nice if people knew what they were getting.<br/><br/>Click's message is a stinging and poignant one and I was very moved by the movie but also felt it went on way to long and the message which is an important one, was pushed and pushed until it became way to much. Watching this movie is an exhausting experience. Yes The message is a good one but Just because a movie is moving and has a good message doesn't mean that it's a perfect movie. I really felt Click, as unusual and as moving as it is, had a lot lacking.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale was not given a lot to do with her part which is a shame since she's such talented actress. Starting the movie as a kooky, almost obnoxious comedy where it doesn't seem to be taking itself all that seriously at times, and then morphing it into a movie so sad it could almost put ""Ordinary people"" to shame doesn't work for me. I think the movie should have played as either a silly comedy only or a serious drama only.<br/><br/>And it went on forever. This is one of those movies where it didn't seem like it was ever going to end. I really like the premise and message of the movie, not to mention the editing which was tremendously creative but I didn't like the movie itself at all. In spite of that fact would still give it an average rating for Sandler, the creative aspect and the message itself.<br/><br/>The dramatic aspects of Click will stay with you and the message, as mentioned is a good and very true one. I wonder if they will do a click two. I still like Bruce Almighty, which this reminded me of , much better even though it was lighter because I felt it flowed better and did the comedy better as well. Click's a movie that isn't for everybody but that one should know what their getting before they watch it. My vote's 5."

It makes me feel it was all nothing that much important, and even it was important, all of its impact on his personality may weaken soon after a while since it was not a serious experience. I mean for people who are addicted to do something (like this workaholic man) change can not be made that easy. they need to experience and reach to the point where their life is in real danger and then they want the ""Change"". the real story was better to be made based on the dream, not to present it at the end as ""just a dream"". The character was not shaped completely. it had lack of connections in its characteristics and personalities. let's say he was not that much serious & oriented man to be a workaholic. these people used to be much more serious than he was. joking and fantasies do not have that much role in their personalities. he was all apart and he was something from everything to be the one , properly matched by the narratives. if the ending of his life ( in the dream) was alittle less dramatic and a bit slower than it went in the last 20 minutes, it could be better to finish the line of his life somewhere, and not to show it as a dream. The Comedy and Drama where mixed up in a way, that I - as a viewer - could not recognize the line many times and being lost in my emotions and feelings was the only short time experience, not that much deep."

","It was another rental evening at Blockbuster and since my wife was dying to see this I gave it a look too. It was actually a pretty good Adam Sandler comedy where he plays a very busy architect always on the go with no time for his family. He burns himself out and receives a super-duper universal remote control from a strange angel (Christopher Walken). Once he has possession of this toy he's able to fast forward through life's boring moments, turn the volume down on people he doesn't want to hear, pause the good times, and so on. But most importantly to me, CLICK actually ultimately had something to say about not rushing through life and taking people you love for granted. I thought I'd be in for 2 hours of nonstop zany toilet shenanigans with Sandler playing with his super-remote and ""clicking"" his way through daily life as he forwards, rewinds, pauses, etc... And of course, that's largely what I got (and some of it was pretty funny); but I was taken by surprise by the serious and emotional tone it took later on. It became more of a drama in the later stages, much to its credit. For those of us who grew up watching HAPPY DAYS on TV, I was somewhat shocked to see Henry Winkler (""the Fonz"" himself) now playing the role of Adam Sandler's dad - and also a grandfather!!!!

I had to phone my parents when I got in just to tell them that I loved them.<br/><br/>This film was advertised as a typical, Adam Sandler, comedy film. Control your life?! Hilarious! But the humour was subtle (after a few screaming moments at the start) and the emotional depth and morals of the film really shone through. As Sandler's character began skipping through his life, his children grew up and his wife divorced him, there was just something in the direction and that action that touched me. And judging by the reactions of the rest of the cinema it touched a lot of other people too.<br/><br/>It was emotional, it was heartbreaking at the end. It spoke to it's audience. One of the best, most emotional, funny films I have seen this year. And it made me think, and indeed appreciate the parents I hadn't seen for over a month by that point.<br/><br/>The film would have received 10/10, however the ending, in my opinion completely ruined the whole film. I understand it makes sense for a comedy to have a happy ending. But when a film has managed to reduce it's audience to tears, has made them feel something for characters in an Adam Sandler comedy then the happy ending is not needed. Making the whole film a dream was, in my opinion, the worst decision the writers could have made.<br/><br/>However, if you buy the DVD and stop the film before that happens, you will not be disappointed."
"doctorx2","8","0","1","8 November 2006"," Multi-generational appeal
","Click is a hybrid of the traditional Sandler formula film (wherein a whacky, violent, and outspoken character placed in an implausible situation thwarts know-it-all bad guys and comes out smelling like a rose) and more recent, cerebral efforts like Spanglish, or perhaps a closer parallel, 50 First Dates. Elements of both appear in Click.<br/><br/>Sandler's character in Click, Michael Newman, is violent and outspoken, and if not as whacky as Happy Gilmore or the Waterboy, certainly free enough with bathroom humor and profanity. Like 50 First Dates, Click addresses much deeper stuff than Sandler's earlier films. Newman races through his life, so focused on goal attainment that he ends up missing out on the parts of life that are really most meaningful and important. By the time Newman realizes what he is doing to his life, his marriage, and his family, it is too late. He can't stop the process or go back and undo it.<br/><br/>Clearly, Click is an allegory for midlife and its attendant crises. It can also be interpreted as a modern-day re-tread of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, with Newman in the role of Scrooge. Similar to A Christmas Carol, Click enjoys a Hollywood ending, so Newman gets his second chance, but the pathos played out in the rapid passage of his life is real enough, and hits home for anyone over the age of 40. In this way, Sandler scores a multi-generational home run: Click contains patented Sandler rough-and-tumble, adolescent humor to please preteens, teens, and young adults, but unlike previous films, also includes a subtext relevant to an older audience.<br/><br/>Sandler's easy delivery and general affability make him likable and believable as ever in the lead role of Newman. Kate Beckinsale does a convincing and sympathetic job as Newman's unappreciated, overlooked, and eventually frustrated and disillusioned wife. Beckinsale initially seems implausibly gorgeous as Sandler's wife, but in the context of the lesson being taught, her beauty is important as one of the prominent positives that Newman overlooks in his life. <br/><br/>Christopher Walken, David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, and Julie Kavner all deliver reliable if somewhat broad supporting performances. Hasselhoff in particular is a treat as the self-absorbed Marley's Ghost of this off-beat Christmas Carol. Walken is cast as Morty, the film's equivalent of the combined ghosts of past, present, and future. His innately menacing quality lurks somewhere in the background here, but in general the role is too goofy. It seems a pity that in general Walken has been misused in this way in so many films of late (e.g., Mouse Hunt, Envy, Blast From the Past). His brilliant early work in The Deerhunter has yet to be rivalled; his best comedic pieces involve more restraint, and his talents are put to their best use more in the vein of farce than out-and-out burlesque (e.g., Pulp Fiction).<br/><br/>The supporting cast is competent and believable, and the scripting is crisp and engaging. Overall, this is an enjoyable film with a relevant message that deserves a look."

","As you're like me and you have seen the film you would have been walking into the screen to see this groaning and rolling you're eyes at how bad the movie looked via the trailers. It starts off with the kind of silly jokes you expect in any Adam Sandler movie and I accepted that, but through the movies . The acting isn't fantastic from Christopher Walken, some scenes are slightly cringe-worthy, but this film hops all over. David Hasselhoff makes his appearance as Michael Newman's (Sandler) boss Mr. Ammer. This is a great role for David Hasselhoff because the plain fact is that David Hasselhoff is playing a stereo typical David Hasselhoff character. He has the grin going all the time, he is cocky and of course has the young attractive secretaries sitting on his office desk. This movie has such a huge jump from slapstick comedy into extremely sad tear-jerking drama. And Of course the ending's predictable but it's an Adam Sandler movie. Plus it cheers a weepy audience up. I was relieved by the end, But if you haven't seen this movie go and see it, I hope I haven't given too much away for you"
"jadeleigh14","7","0","1","31 October 2006"," A predictable plot??
","Kayy, well it wasn't the best film i've ever seen but i really liked it, whether this stems from the fact that my mental capability is the same as a five year old or the fact that i'm female, personally i'm going for the fact that this is more of a female film. It shows a stereotypical guy...being that everythings too much, hes arrogent and really doesn't see what a great family he has but then when he gets this remote and when he's fast forwarded through his 'boring bits' he realises what he's lost and when he wakes up and its a dream and starts to appricate what he has it makes us females smile because it shows us guys do have a sensitive side :D. So from a female perspective it was a good film but perhaps a bit too like Bruce Almighty."
"jboothmillard","5","0","1","30 October 2006"," Click
","This film kind of reminds me of Bruce Almighty, because the main guy has been given the power of control (literally), but it is almost a better format. Basically Adam Sandler as Michael Newman is a workaholic architect who wants a break from everything time consuming in his life, i.e. his job and some family life. Then one day, while looking for a universal remote control in Bed, Bathroom & Beyond, the guy in ""Beyond"", Morty (Christopher Walken) gives him the control for his entire life. After finding out that he can control his life he takes the liberties of all controls, e.g. skipping chapters, watching his past with James Earl Jones narrating, language and visual change and much more. Unfortunately, fast forwarding his life so much turns the control into an automatic forwarding device, and he misses so much of his life that is important to him, and along the way he sees the consequences of his ignorance, e.g. turning fat. Don't worry, there is a happy ending, and the comedy takes away some of the sad impact. Also starring Kate Beckinsale as Donna Newman, David Hasselhoff as Mr. Ammer, Scream's Henry Winkler as Ted Newman, The Simpsons' Julie Kavner as Trudy Newman, The Lord of the Rings' Sean Astin as Bill Rando and American Pie's Jennifer Coolidge as Janine. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup. Worth watching!"

Secondly, the film ends (and this is the spoiler bit) with Sandler waking up and being able to rectify his problems in an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" kind of way (but not as good). The film should have ended with his death, but having learned a valuable life lesson (it's only the contrast with the rubbishey bits of life which make the good bits, good) and changing his son's path.

The problem was that it became such a dark difference from Adam's regular gut shot comedy that it would have been much better if it ended when Adam's character died after leaving the hospital, lying on the wet ground, flipping off the new husband and then doing the OK sign. Why does every movie have to resort to the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" format? Why doesn't someone as successful as Adam take a stand and let the story end where it is supposed to? The character already knew he screwed up, everyone but him had turned out OK. He gave his hard learned lesson to his son prior to dying. The End. No, please don't go back to the beginning!

There are some great comedians like Bill Murrey and Jim Carey that when you take them out of the stupid, slapstick American-style comedies and put them in something where their manic impulses are controlled, they just shine. This doesn't happen with Adam Sandler. He demonstrates that without the constant, violent hysteria that is his mainstay and seems to pass for comedy in the US, he is really just an empty shell.<br/><br/>This film is sort of a rip-off on ""Liar Liar,"" ""Bruce Almighty,"" with a touch of a badly done ""Meet Joe Black.""

However, my boyfriend is of a different opinion and insisted on watching Click the day it was released on DVD.<br/><br/>I was very happily surprised.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler plays Michael, a workaholic father of two who always lets his job as an architect come before his family. One day he walks into the waaaaay back of a Bed Bath & Beyond looking for a universal remote control. He is helped by an eccentric sales clerk played by the wonderful Christopher Walken. He gives him an ""experimental"" blue remote control with the warning ""This item is non-returnable."" But this is no normal remote control. Michael soon discovers that he can pause, fast forward, mute, and (kind of) rewind his entire life. Soon, the remote begins fast-forwarding all by itself. Michael misses out on huge important portions of his life, but he can't rewind and do them over. He can only go back and watch how he ignored his family, and neglected everything except his job.<br/><br/>This movie teaches us a very obvious lesson. Family is the most important thing, and it should always come first. I love the scenes when Michael realizes this, and falls in love with his family all over again. I'm not sure Adam Sandler would have been my first though for the role, but after watching it, I can't imagine anyone else.<br/><br/>Overall, Click gave me a tiny bit of respect for Adam Sandler, and I'm gonna go try to watch Happy Gilmore again...wish me luck."

","Adam Sandler is given a universal remote by Morty, the Angel of Death (played by Chris Walken).

But overall this is a drama, and you might cry once the sad music begins playing. Just a fair warning. It happened to me and my brother, it could happen to you.<br/><br/>Sandler is not particularly funny in this film, though it has been pointed out to me he rarely is ever funny. His strength is in playing off his co-stars, and he wasn't really given good co-stars to play with here. His best moment, I thought, was with Rob Schneider, who is by no means a great actor.<br/><br/>Chris Walken, who is an expert comedian, was not really give much to work with here. His character is neither humorous nor as serious as an angel of death should be. As much as I love Walken ,anyone could have played his role.<br/><br/>Hasselhoff was great and this really showcased his potential as a film actor. He has a great presence, and the subtle joke of being around beautiful women (assuming that was a joke) was very nice.<br/><br/>Henry Winkler?

","Many people viewing this movie may say the first half of the movie didn't match up or help present the second half of the serious side of the movie. I started to think this way also, until i got to thinking.<br/><br/>This movie has kind of a realistic emotional timeline because Sandler is happy/funny when he first receives the ""universal remote"", but as he begins to notice how advance the remote really is, he gets frustrated. This is true to many people, many people will take advantage and abuse this type of device. They will completely skip all of the ""unwanted"" events of their lives, and go straight to the moment of ""achievement"".<br/><br/>Unconciously, as Walker says, Sandler has been skipping the unwanted moments of his life, rushing everything and everyone to get to that one moment of happiness. The remote realizes this pattern, and is only trying to help. Once Sandler begins to skip his whole life, first ten years then six years, he notices how wrongly he went through his life. Then the chain effect just kept rolling down and took complete control over his life.<br/><br/>Once you start these bad habits, that can affect the way you live your life, it is hard to notice which moments in life are significant and non-significant. The moral of the story is to take life as it comes, take it by the moment and don't miss life's opportunities."

Inexplicably passing up the Best Buy store, and instead stopping at the 'Bed, Bath, and Beyond' store, goes in and asks to buy a remote. Of course they didn't have any, but Michael notices a door with the word 'BEYOND' above it. He enters, and finds 'Morty' inside, played superbly by always great Christopher Walken. Morty listens to his story and tells him they have this great new remote, and it is so new there isn't even a price on it. So Michael gets it free.<br/><br/>Confused, Michael takes his remote home. The dog is barking too loudly so he playfully presses the volume control, and the dog's bark goes quiet. Later his wife Donne (terminally cute Kate Beckinsale) is arguing with him, he playfully presses the 'fast forward' and the argument is completed in very fast motion.<br/><br/>So, Michael figures out he has a very special remote, as Morty explains, 'It controls the universe."" He begins to see ways to use it to make his life easier. The problem arises when he also finds out that it is a 'learning' remote -- it remembers his actions and eventually begins to execute functions on its own. Michael's life soon becomes controlled by the remote.<br/><br/>Much of the first half of the movie is just the set-up, where Michael and we, the audience, find out what the rules of the game are.

"fwomp","5","0","1","11 October 2006"," Is Click A Clunker?
","Watching CLICK is like watching two separate movies. The blatant parallels to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE are transparent, but that's not what makes Click a clunker. Not that it is a clunker in its entirety, either.<br/><br/>The story surrounds Michael Newman (Adam Sandler, WATERBOY), an architect who yearns for peace and harmony in his life. Part of the problem is the competition (keeping up with the Jones') that he has going on with his neighbors. They have a new RV, new toys and new cars, while Michael and his family just get by. One evening he hears the irritating boy next door talking about his father's new universal remote control that's patched into everything (garage door, TV, stereo, etc.) and it's all that Michael can take. So he heads out to the mall and stops at (of all places) Bed, Bath and Beyond. It is the ""Beyond"" that apparently pulls him in, but once inside all he finds are towels and bedding. He lays down on one of these and then quickly spots a doorway that says ""Beyond"". It looks rather ethereal yet inviting, so Michael goes on in. What he finds is a whacked out looking guy named Morty (Christopher Walken) who offers him a truly ""Universal Remote."" This remote control does it all. It can rewind you to your birth so that you can witness it (or your conception, something we should NEVER have to see), or it can fast-forward you through troubling times, like arguments with your spouse or personal illnesses. The dangers of this Universal Remote aren't evident right away. Apparently, as this magical tool gets used to your requests, it does them automatically for you, without you having to push a button. So when Michael fast forwards through arguments with his wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale), the remote does it automatically for him in the future. Thus, large chunks of what might seem like inane discussions suddenly are wiped away.<br/><br/>Michael soon discovers that his life is in constant fast forward. His job, his kids, his wife, even his own body, change in rapid succession as the Universal Remote takes over. Trying to give back this dangerous piece of machinery, we soon learn that Morty is much more than he seems.<br/><br/>The great thing about the film is the last 2/3 of it (with the exception of the ending, which we'll cover in a moment). When people learn how important life is, it's truly an eye-opener. And this is where Click succeeds. When Sandler's character learns about death and how important it is to live every second of every day, it is heart renderingly pulled off. We get to witness Sandler rewinding time and again the important portions of his life that he missed. And, near the end of his own life, we witness his evolution into a man of distinction, trying to save his son from his own deadly mistakes related to family.<br/><br/>Where the film fails is the beginning and it's horribly clichéd ending. The beginning of the film is filled with bathroom humor (farting in people's faces) and gag jokes that sag under their own terrible weight. This is where one feels like they are watching an entirely different film when compared to the latter 2/3 of the movie. The characters are one-dimensional and utterly unbelievable (quite the dichotomy from what we see later). This isn't a character evolution issue as much as a script failure.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is what finally gives it a poor rating. When we see Sandler lay down at Bed, Bath and Beyond, a creeping disgust enters the mind. The film-makers surely wouldn't use one of the oldest clichés in the book, would they? But, oh yes, they did. Grrr! The unfortunate thing about Click is that it really has a wonderful message and some fine acting moments. Special effect make-up artist Rick Baker also deserves much credit for the aging looks he puts the characters through, from Henry Winkler's role as Sandler's father, to Sean Astin's speedo and chubby swim instructor, it was one of the strongest aspects of the entire production.<br/><br/>As a whole, the film fails because of its childish beginnings and over-used style ending. But make no mistake, there are some great moments in here. Just not enough to give it a high ranking."

He had his share in this one too, but there were quite a few scenes that were very touching and I could not forget for a while.<br/><br/>It also has a moral to it - a very strong one at that. Before, Michael Newman (Sandler) cared, although he didn't believe it himself, more for his work than his family. After the experience with the remote, however, his view on life changed drastically.<br/><br/>You have to watch the movies and each individual happening to truly understand what the producers want to get across. A definitely good movie, with a few tears here and there."
"johnleemk","6","0","1","10 October 2006"," Worth watching, but not as great as some say
","I wasn't planning on writing a review until I saw the large number of people rating this movie a 10. It's an above average movie, I won't deny that. But it simply isn't groundbreaking or brilliant like, say, Schindler's List. It isn't even a Forrest Gump or A Beautiful Mind. It won't be winning any Oscars.<br/><br/>Now, of course, the question is: why? Two things strike me the most: the movie's failure to walk the fine lines any great movie needs to, and its consistent habit of opting for the over the top rather than the understated.<br/><br/>The story of Click is rather simple. Man gets remote that lets him fast-forward through his life, he screws his life up, regrets it, dies, wakes up from his bad dream, and promises to change his ways. The story ain't unique, but a great movie doesn't need a particularly outstanding story. What's important is how it's told, and in this respect, Click doesn't do too well.<br/><br/>Half the movie relies on comedy, but as hilarious as the comedic bits are, it fails to walk the fine line between ""funny"" and ""immature"". Yes, the joke about Wacko Jacko suing himself for self-molestation is funny - but the way it was done was simply too in your face when understated humour could have elicited the same amount or even more laughs. One over the top joke isn't enough to sink a comedy, but practically every joke, given the choice between subtlety and brash boldness, opts for the latter.<br/><br/>Unlike some critics, such as Rolling Stone, I was quite happy with the dramatic aspects of Click. I actually found the scene where Michael sees his father for the last time before he dies quite touching. It was horribly clichéd, true, but the art of film-making is about dressing up several clichés as something new, and in this regard, for a while at least, Click was a success.<br/><br/>What really got on my nerves, however, was the forced happy ending. To be frank, this could have been Adam Sandler's equivalent of the Truman Show if they'd just ended it with his death. I couldn't empathise with Michael's joy when he woke up - all I felt was the numbness of being emotionally cheated. The death scene was truly a brilliant closer, but it was ruined.<br/><br/>I like how the producers tried to go for a deep comedy with a message behind it, but the message simply wasn't conveyed correctly. You want a comedy with a deep message that works? Go for Forrest Gump. Click tried to work along the same lines, but it just fell flat. Relying on physical and scatological gags cheapens the theme, and screwing up what could have been a truly excellent ending is simply unforgivable. A solid six out of ten, but it really could have been so much more."
"psychonautic","8","0","1","4 October 2006"," Finally another good comedy
","This is one of the best comedy movies I have seen lately At some points in the movie you really have to laugh and not just smile The plot is good, the acting, the scenery, the setting. In one word everything. With comedy there is always a catch. Will there be a lot of corny moments. Like those moments you really wanna fast forward. Well there is only one moment like this in the movie and for those who like corny you will cry at this moment. Adam Sandler really does a wonderful job and David Hasselhoff is at his best in this movie (maybe you'll say so what David Hasselhoff sucks, no way, David Hasselhoff is damn funny). Let's not forget, there are lot of pretty ladies in this movie. Anyway just watch it and it's as universal as its universal remote. You can watch it with your girlfriend or boyfriend, alone or with the family. <br/><br/>So that's why I am giving this movie an eight."

","Could be a hit, could be a miss I thought. Lots of not funny humour here, some laughable fart jokes and an original, (I'd never seen it before!) if a bit stupid, plot. Worth watching for Chris Walken's and the Hoffmeister's appearances alone. Wow! Sandler 'buys' a remote control that can control his life: skip arguments, foreplay during sex, boring dinners, waiting for promotion etc.<br/><br/>Sounds great, no-one gets hurt, but it all starts to go wrong. The film shifts from happy go lucky, daft Rom-com, to quite a dark tale, revealing the selfishness of his (Sandler's) acts, and the neglect of his family and the depressing outcome.<br/><br/>Go and see it. This was rated about 6.9/10 - and that seems fair enough. Probably many worse films out there and many worse Sandler films on DVD. (This is my first attempt at an IMDb review so sorry if it didn't help - don't rate my rating!) Jim"
"LazySod","8","0","1","3 October 2006"," Classic Twilight Zone material
","A workaholic finds himself in trouble handling all the different remotes in the house and sets out on a quest to find an universal remote so that he can get rid of all the other ones. What he finds is a little more than he bargained for - a universal remote control that remote controls his Universe. From there the film starts rolling. Armed with this new power he starts to amuse himself through life.<br/><br/>From all the Adam Sandler films I've seen about 40% is good enough to be allowed into the cinema. I'm happy to say that this one is surely amongst those 40%. Click rages on, starting off quickly and not settling down until the end of it. It plays much like a classic Twilight Zone episode - highly moralistic, but fun, in a dark way.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 out of control remote controls"
"cujo2","8","0","1","1 October 2006"," Not what you might expect...
","I have seen my share of Adam Sandler films, and most of them were borderline moronic.<br/><br/>This movie is - for the most part too- if you like the humor of the man - which is always the same- you will have your share of laughs. And indeed in this film the humor is brought in a way that is actually funny ( especially the spoiled brat next door joke, which is very funny)<br/><br/>However around 3/4 of the movie there is a sharp turn and something I thought would never happen actually happened.. it struck a cord. The story revolves around a man getting a universal remote, a remote that controls his universe, so the predictable things happen until he finds out that everything he fast forwards through - hard work for a promotion but also the divorce of his wife and the death of his father- is really gone in the wind. Like another reviewer said ""it makes you think""and it actually does. This movie is more sensitive and hearth warming then I ever thought possible.<br/><br/>Very very recommended, and there is at least one person on this planet that rethought his opinion of Mr Adam Sander."
"yevonwm","7","0","1","1 October 2006"," Less agenda, more comedy.
","This isn't a bad film, especially by todays standards, but its not a comedy - as long as you accept this fact then the movie begins to hold its own. Jokes come thick and fast at the start but die down for about half the movie whilst the writer pushes his agenda which isn't a bad one - if you fast forward life you wont enjoy the moment etc etc but its a com-e-d-y. The other people writing reviews are saying they cried which is fair enough but only proves the point, if you go in wanting to laugh don't expect to leave laughing. On the other side of the coin this is a very poinoiant movie which will no doubt affect everyone that watches it in a positive way."
"Chrispatschack","Null","0","1","23 September 2006"," A Wonderful Film
","At first when I was going to see this movie, I thought It was going to be another dumb Adam Sandler comedy. But it was fairly you're average Adam Sandler movie. Just a little bit of his humor was in the movie. This was a different movie for Adam Sandler, it also has a very, very true message ""family comes first"". Adam Sandler is becoming a really good actor. And Christopher Walken was funny as Morty, I notice recently that He's been doing a lot of comedy recently. But Walken is not only a talented actor, but he can be a very funny man, too. <br/><br/>I thought this movie was worth more than that stupid Steve Martin movie CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN."
"LittleGirlLost","5","0","1","20 September 2006"," Heartwarming feel-good comedy... that actually works!!
","As most of us already know, Sandler has done some good comedies (""Happy Gilmore"" among others) and some really crappy ones (""Little Nicky"" among others)! I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised by this one :) There are some scenes that's really funny, and many heartwarming moments that made me smile... Like most of Sandler's comedies, this one also has an underlying moral. When the familiar clichés threaten the ending of this one, I actually just smiled and wished them welcome through my hard-to-get-rid-of-tears... This is not the best comedy I've seen, but then again, comedy is a hard genre to conquer...!! Regardless of that, ""Click"" is a warm and loving feel-good film with an important message :) Adam Sandler was his usual likable self, but the best achievements in this one was Christopher Walken and David Hasselhoff..."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","11 September 2006"," Schizophrenic
","I'm not sure if many people have had this experience but I think some would. When the family cat got rather noisy as I was watching TV, I pointed the remote at her, said ""Quiet Smurf"" and pressed the ""mute"" button. This never worked, but would invariable draw a ""dumb dad"" look from the kids.<br/><br/>Maybe that's the sort of real life experience that inspired ""Click"". Others credited ""A Christmas Carol"". Probably both, as it features a universal remote control that does to you life what it normally would do to the TV, thereby allowing you to see what sort of a nasty person you have been and will be.<br/><br/>I found the movie a little schizophrenic. On the one hand, you have all the really low down funnies that you have learned to associate with Adam Sandler. On the other hand, there are moments of rather affecting poignancy, and even downright sadness. The dividing line is the middle of the movie, after the fast forward of the mysterious magical device gets out of control and our ""hero"" starts to lose big chunks of his life, to find that things get progressively downhill. And therein lies the moral, cliché but still well worth repeating every now and then: if you don't treasure the things around you and enjoy them, you'll find that it's too late, when you've lost them all.<br/><br/>Adam Sadler is trying to grow up (particularly in movies such as ""Spanglish"") and may I suggest, film critics and moviegoers, that we give him a chance. Kate Beckensale is absolutely adorable in this movie, although she does have a different type of charm wearing body-tight black leather, chasing and killing werewolves. Christopher Walken is the Christopher Walken you have learned to love in movies like ""Sleepy Hollow"". Henry Winkler  it's good to see him in any movie, and will be, to some of us, always ""The Fonz"". And there's Sean Astin, in not much of a role here, but always remembered as Frodo's ""Sam"".<br/><br/>This is not by any stretch of the imagination a great movie, but satisfies as a piece if good entertainment, and may even give you something to think about."
"dragonjhlee","Null","0","1","10 September 2006"," this movie is so awesome!!
","Today i saw this movie with my friends... It is really funny and awesome. Before i watched it i thought its story is similar to Bruce Almighty, because this movie talks about a man(Adam Sandler) who got the universal remote control which can control whatever he wants. For example, if somebody makes noisy or annoys him, he can stop that moment by clicking the ""stop"". I like one of scenes in this movie that when his boss annoyed him, he stopped that moment and did fart on his boss' face. And then he clicked ""stop"" again so his boss felt very bad even this boss complained about the food because this boss was eating something. It was so funny even though some scenes make me sad. This movie gives us something that you don't have to waste your time and take care everybody who relates with you before they disappear."
"anilos81","7","0","1","30 August 2006"," A Modern Day 'It's A Wonderful Life'
","I saw this one at the $2 Theater mainly out of boredom. I did not expect to like it; I did not expect it to be funny, or interesting. I did not find it particularly funny, and the plot was only somewhat original. But the message was good, and it was very touching at times. It was definitely a bit hokey, and VERY predictable, but I was entertained nonetheless.<br/><br/>Don't go to see it expecting to fall out of your chair laughing, but you will leave the theater touched, and being reminded of the important things in life. This is a standard Carpe Diem movie, a modern time 'It's A Wonderful Life,' literally."
"christelle_cuenca","7","0","3","11 July 2006"," OK, that was fun
","I went to see this movie with no idea whatsoever what it was about or who the cast was! All I had was the title... ""Click"". The first good surprise was the cast. Adam Sandler is who he is and does what he does as the main character here, but other characters really livened up the movie. I was pleased to see Christopher Walken (a great performance) and many other familiar faces continued popping up throughout the movie. The story line is very predictable from beginning to end, but there are some fun twists and turns that makes this a fun movie to watch. I just wish the writer had somehow managed to create a more clever ending than the usual waking up from a dream trick. It is as if you just wait for him to wake up during the whole movie..."
