","An incredible film from beginning to end, historically accurate set and costume design, performances of the actors was fantastic.

","WHEN OPERA BECOMES REALITY / One of Netflix's strongest titles. The work simply becomes reality and it is like being in the theater all the time and time flies. A stellar cast that plays its part in a credible and passionate way. Timoth√©e, once again, confirms to be one of the most promising stars of the current decade and Michod has only done what was not done since the days of Ridley Scott's Gladiator."

","I went into the movie with modest expectations. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I absolutely wasn't expecting this. I was blown away by this movie. It kept me interested from start to finish. Even though the movie contains a lot fewer battle scenes than previously expected, it was still intriguing and made any battle scene that much more rewarding. This could be the movie that helps Netflix win their first academy award for best picture. I highly recommend that anyone with a Netflix account watch this. You won't regret it."

"louis1011","8","246","339","2 September 2019"," Great movie but slow at times
","I'm grateful that Netflix are pumping money into films like this and is a great sign of things to come.<br/><br/>This movie has some great acting, a superb script and some great sets and costumes. This all adds to the authenticity of this 15th century English period piece. I do have a few problems with the film like some of the 15th century language can be hard to follow and I don't think this film will be as good on Netflix as it was when I just saw it at the Venice film festival.<br/><br/>Despite my issues with the film, I think it's great and would recommend it to any film lovers."
"blkopanski","5","79","105","4 November 2019"," Great entertainment but extremely historically inaccurate.
","Overall I enjoyed watching this movie. I like period pieces like this and Netflix delivered again. The acting, cinematography, and battle scenes were fantastic. Unfortunately the story line is interesting but completely false with its character depictions and timelines. Not only did Henry V's brother Thomas not die prior to his father as shown at the beginning of the film, but he actually served as a commander in the English Army and died 8 years later well after the battle of Agincourt which is shown at the end of the film. Sir John and the French Dauphin also don't historically die in the battle of Agincourt as depicted in the film. Sir John actually loses the battle of Patay a few years later against Joan of Arc and becomes the scapegoat that is blamed for the defeat. The Dauphin is actually crowned the King of France after Joan of Arc wins a few important battles 14 years after the battle of Agincourt. There are other historical inaccuracies as well but I've made my point. Like I originally said, I enjoyed the movie and applaud certain aspects about it, but ultimately the director/ writers should have done a little more research first."
"jlcdrama","5","212","298","4 November 2019"," Not a movie for historians or Shakespeare buffs
","Once I went to a medieval times restaurant with my father. The section we were seated in was the ""Green Knight"" section and the Green Knight turned out to be the villain of the play before us. My father got a bit excited by this. At one point the king declared that he was making peace with the Green Knight's country. My father then shouted ""No peace, war! War!"" I feel like almost everyone in this movie is doing the exact same thing for Hal.<br/><br/>Now, I'm quite a fan of Shakespeare as well as something of an amateur historian. I have a small library of books dedicated to British history and the monarchy. So I was excited by the announcement of this film as it touched two passions of mine. Needless to say, it wasn't quite what I thought it would be<br/><br/>It's very clear that this production is only minimally based on the famous Shakespeare plays. They borrow the characters and follow the same plot to a degree, but it bears very little resemblance to the plays beyond that. This isn't about the matter of language, but more the feel and actual story of the plays.<br/><br/>That's not always a bad thing. The character of Falstaff is not just a cowardly buffoon like in the plays, but an interesting man and capable warrior even. Still a drunk yes, but his character is richer and has more depth than in the plays.<br/><br/>No my main problem is Hal. Though acted well, Hal just feels so very out of place in this story. Like I said about my father, Hal is the king desiring peace while my father is everyone in England desiring war. Hal feels like a 21st century man in a medieval drama. It just doesn't fit, especially not in history.<br/><br/>The real Hal, or Henry V, was actually a man of his time: a brilliant warrior and quite the opposite of the pacifist he seems in this film. The fact of the times is that war was popular in medieval times, and war with France was very popular in England as they had quite the rivalry. There is a reason Henry V's son, Henry VI was deposed twice: peace, especially with France, was seen as weakness. Henry V would have been raised from the cradle to believe France was the enemy and England should defeat it. It just struck me as so completely out of step to have Hal be so against war. Perhaps they were afraid they would make him look like a warmonger, but that would have been easily enough to avoid. Rather they fail to grasp that this is a historical film, and the truth of the matter is war was the most effective means of diplomacy and brought about glory and popularity. There is a reason Richard the Lionheart has a better reputation than he probably deserves in England: war equaled strength and in that day a man wanted to be seen as strong.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie. The acting is good, the story isn't bad either, but it clearly wasn't meant for people like me. If I didn't understand the tine period as well as I do, know the plays so well, nor have studied the true history as I have, I probably could have given this a higher score. It's a good drama, but Hal just stands out as out of place and nothing like a true medieval king."
"SafChaleur","9","196","279","25 September 2019"," Great movie - a touch long
","Just saw this film and it is captivating. What ever you do don't believe the low rating some others have given it because it is not accurate and you will need to question the motivations of those scoring this film so low when it is worthy of much more. Maybe a touch of jealously cause it is a Netflix film. The acting is superb with a great script, crisp cinematography and wonderful sound. The director transports us in the 15th century and we are captivated by the situation King Henry V finds himself in. Surrounded by corruption and men who are willing to kill each other for property and status.<br/><br/>All the cast was brilliant and the two lead actors were exceptional.<br/><br/>The only negative is that it is a touch long. I say that it was long but I can't see anything that could have been left out. I saw it at the cinema but I think if you were watching it at home you could pause it and still return to be immersed where you left off.<br/><br/>I hope we see more from this team as they did a great job."
"Lowcountry_Girl","4","379","553","4 November 2019"," 25% history, 75% pure fiction .. Transforms one of England's most martial kings into a pacifist with Daddy issues who got tricked into going to war
","Why do they do this? Who does Hollywood think it is exactly with this unadulterated fiction? To have the temerity to fictionalize major facts of the life of an historical figure takes some kind of elevated opinion of yourself.<br/><br/>Here's a newsflash: Henry V was the member of his family most keen for war with France; Henry IV and Thomas favored peace. For reasons known only to Netflix, precisely the opposite is portrayed in this film.<br/><br/>So Daddy disinherited Henry and made Thomas the heir, really?? (NOPE) So Thomas was green and got killed in battle before Henry IV died, really?? (Both sons were seasoned warriors, and Thomas died well after Agincourt.) So Falstaff (Sir John Oldcastle) heroically died at Agincourt, really?? (Henry executed him in 1417.) There's much more, but the point is made.<br/><br/>So sick of historical figures being transformed into someone they weren't to suit whatever message the screenwriter is pushing. Just. stop."

"fx-23112","5","138","200","3 November 2019"," historically inaccurate
","The battle of Agincourt as presented in the film has nothing to do with the actual events. And cause of this was a huge disappointment. It makes no sense to me why is it so difficult for so many movies to stay in the facts.
When it is a film about the battle of Agincourt I want to watch and learn what actually happened those hours, and not a fantasy story."
"nindave-movies","9","162","239","22 October 2019"," What a gem of a film..
","Had to track this down to a Curzon in Oxford to see this, well worth it. What a gem of a film. Absolutely excellent, top class acting by the whole cast. Although not totally historical accurate, it's not far off. Loved the rawness of the battlefield, very realistic to what I imagine it would have been. This I would hope should be considered as best film awards contender without a shadow of doubt."
"micheyns","5","46","63","7 November 2019"," Why bother with history?
","AS a swords and sorrow epic this is okay, good performances, pretty locations, but why bother to pretend that it's about Henry IV and V? Not to mention Falstaff? A straight fiction could have worked; but this half-assed gesture in the direction of historical accuracy is just irritating. And it sure drags."
"RoganShea","3","245","377","2 November 2019"," A wasted opportunity
","Henry V's Agincourt campaign was an important event, and very dramatic - excellent subject material for a feature film. Why would you take that riveting subject and spend a considerable amount of money making a film about it and then litter that film with gross historical inaccuracies? Henry IV did not try to disinherit Prince Henry. Prince Henry did not kill Henry Percy in a duel (Percy died in a pitched battle 10 years before Henry IV died). Prince Thomas was not killed by the Welsh shortly before Henry IV's death (he died fighting the French six years after the battle of Agincourt, eight years after the death of his father). Neither prince was an inexperienced soldier by the time of Henry IV's death - both were experienced captains with multiple campaigns behind them. All of these depictions in the film are major historical errors - and that's just the first 15 minutes of the film!"
"shandi-965-604789","5","78","121","2 November 2019"," Great disappointment for Shakespeare fans
","The picture is good. But it is very disappointing that half a millennium after Shakespeare, the authors of the film made familiar images much more flat. The point is not even the grimacing Pattinson, diligently depicting a parody of a French accent. Not in Catherine Valois, who speaks to the crowned groom as a modern feminist (in the play, and in medieval life, she could only refuse to kiss before the wedding). It can be forgiven - after all, Shakespeare's ""Henry the Fifth"" is just a kind of propaganda, well below his true masterpieces. But the authors raised their hand to the most sacred - Sir John Falstaff. In my opinion, this is the best character created by the genius from Stratford. Funny and disrespected coward, drunkard and chatterbox was, nevertheless, a figure of tremendous charm, easily overshadowing other heroes. And yet, despite his weaknesses, he was wholeheartedly attached to the prince. When the young king breaks with the past, rudely treating the old knight, this decision can be considered fair, but you still sympathize with Falstaff. A comic jester suddenly turns out to be a deep tragic hero, and the death of the abandoned and forgotten Sir John becomes the most touching moment of the ""sequel"" to the brilliant ""Henry the Fourth"". As one of critics rightly noted, Shakespeare killed this character primarily because ""the public's sympathies for Falstaff's humor could not be reconciled with the idea of statehood, which logically was supposed to complete the play."" However, ""Henry the Fifth"" as a work of art is not comparable with its predecessor, so Sir John Falstaff with all his vices finally won, as life always ultimately defeats the cold state machine.
What do we see in this movie? The director turned an old cowardly drunkard into a wise, laconic warrior and a brilliant strategist, whom Henry the Fifth draws closer to himself and puts him at the head of his army. The French are defeated. And with them, the author buried Shakespeare in the mud too. As a result, we have a nice plot, from which hardly anyone's heart will get pinched, and which will be forgotten in a couple of days."

"BadCinemaHabit","9","101","162","24 October 2019"," All Hail! Great Cinema
","I had the opportunity to see this movie in a theater a few days ago. I'm pleased to say that it was not a waste of time. I was thoroughly caught up in the story and invested in the characters, particularly Hal and Falstaff. I am not a medieval expert nor am I that familiar with the works of Shakespeare, so don't look to me to pick this movie apart based on those terms. Was this movie perfect? No. Was I entertained? Hell Yes! Every single performer in this movie gave it everything they had and its all up there on the screen. The filmmakers and the actors have my respect and gratitude. And kudos to David Mich√¥d for landing Timoth√©e Chalamet to play Hal. This kid is something else. He is absolutely fascinating to watch. By the way, don't get Hal mad at you, he is somewhat of a bad ass. So here's to a great time at the movies and I look forward to watching this again at some point when it shows up on Netflix."
"Lewis_Heather787","8","48","73","10 November 2019"," Top quality from Netflix...........at last !!
","For a while now Netflix has been flirting with the idea of releasing a film which is universally loved by the critics and audiences. An also one that could be recognised and respected by the film industry. One film to make people take Netflix seriously when it comes to its own film content it produces. I'm happy to say that this is the first on the list..........for me anyway.<br/><br/>Now I know this film has done a good job for one really good reason. It got someone like me to watch it in the first place. I will be brutally honest I don't care about any stories or films about medieval times or Shakespeare...........any of that stuff. Its just not my thing...........thats not to say there aren't any great films about this topic cause there probably are. The reason it got me to watch it was the cast first and foremost. The talent that was involved in this film really drew me in because it was a combination of new talent and stars we are accustom to.<br/><br/>Timothee Chalamet is a very young talented actor.............I am a firm believer that he will be the biggest film actor in years to come, because not only is he great but he chooses such interesting projects to do. Being English I was obviously going to be more critical on the accent of his.........well I was gonna pay more attention to it..........but wow extremely good. Overall a really really good performance. The other big standout and again with a great accent is Joel Edgerton............my oh my what a great and understated performance from Edgerton. He fit very well into the part and definitely was a great presence in the every scene he was in. Obviously Sean Harris was really good as well..............and shoutout to BATtinson.........oh sorry I mean Robert Pattinson, with another great accent in some incredibly tense and uncomfortable scenes.<br/><br/>But what also separates this film from others Netflix has released prior is the directing, cinematography and production design, they are off the chain in this film. From start to finish this film is extremely beautiful to look at..........a very grounded feel to the film, Adam Arkapaw has done a great job. But more praise should be given to David Mich√¥d because his direction is brilliant.........some beautiful sweeping shots of the battlefields are incredible, they are heart pounding chaos. Definitely feels like a modern shot film but at no point is there an overuse of CGI or silly aerial shots that would feel out of place. Everything is shot in person on the ground to make it feel as if you're there everything step.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed the film its really good 80% out of 100, if it can get someone like me to not only watch it but to come out loving it then I cant see why it wouldn't do well with its actual target audience. Although saying that there are probably some historical nuts out there taring this film to pieces, but oh well !! Trust me I'd give it a go! Finally some top quality film content from Netflix !!!"

This film took literary license and turned it on its head."
"badbunnyinhell","2","122","208","2 November 2019"," Made up nonsense
","As a re-enactor who displays this period, I was excited to see this. I wish I hadn't watched it now. Why is it so hard for Hollywood to do a little research into our history and at least try to get some of it right. Even Shakespeare didn't get it this wrong.
If you are looking for a medieval romp then you'll love it, if you know anything about this period, don't torture yourself."
"northernpaladin","3","85","144","1 November 2019"," Utter Fail
","A dark brooding medieval tale that by the end has descended into farcical melodrama held together only by the performances of Chalamet as Henry and Harris as William Chief Justice and even they are failed by a post modernist script and borgiaesque politicking and murder in the final 20 minutes.
Neither a Shakespearean reimagining nor a full blown historical drama this effort seems to be unable to make its mind up and fails in both instances. Now it is often said that historical films don't need to be completely accurate to be entertaining and that's true but this is 100% inaccurate and that effects its entertainment value because even someone with the most basic knowledge of the events will eventually say ""hold on?""
Where to start?
Henry IV; a schizophrenic usurper played here as pantomime villain and a waste of the talents of Ben Mendelsohn.
Hal; the drunkard wastrel of Shakespeare duly played as such here by Chalamet supported by Edgerton as Falstaff but both are pretty unconvincing as such and of course he wasn't, in fact by this time he was playing an active part in the running of the kingdom.
Hotspur; the eternal rebel played here really well by Tom Glynn-Carney, who I thought would have been a better Henry, but no he wasn't killed in hand to hand combat by a reluctant Hal in front of two armies but died at the battle of Shrewsbury a battle Hal wasn't at.
Thomas; younger brother of Hal, no he didn't usurp Hals position, no he didn't command at Shrewsbury, no he didn't die in Wales, he actually acted as adviser to Henry IV and V and died on Henry V's French campaign, why do this when the reality is more interesting?
William Chief Justice; really well played by Sean Harris but the reveal of him not being the loyal minister but a scheming capitalist who manipulated the king into a war so he could profit is utter nonsense and a pretty poor commentary on recent US foreign adventures, it's also grossly insulting to the actor who has to mouth the final scenes and to the audience who has to listen. Yes the character existed but he resigned when Henry V was crowned.
Falstaff; played straight out of Shakespeare by Edgerton but with the addition of being a military genius who plans Agincourt, utter nonsense and why? In Shakespeare the character has a purpose in this he has none and Edgerton looks lost despite being one of the writers.
The French plot; there wasn't one, oh no it was that nasty chief justice! Henry wanted glory and didn't much care how many englishmen had to die in France to get it.
The Dauphin; was Robert Pattinson deliberately hamming this up? A quite bizarre performance that jars against the sombre mood of the film and guess what? The Dauphin wasn't at the battle so didn't die there and certainly wasn't murdered by a bunch of muddy soldiers on the nod of Henry in what is quite a disturbing scene.
Agincourt; a famous battle both in Shakespeare and history so plenty to go on but here is the worst part of the film. The English were in retreat and the French were in their way so they had to fight. Yes it rained and the ground was boggy. No a valiant advance guard didn't advance up a slope led by Falstaff. No Henry didn't hide in ambush with no armour along with the rest of the soldiers, these guys are nobles for God's sake they fought with their own class. No the French didn't trot down a slope armed only with swords, they advanced on foot with halberds, half pikes and great swords, if they had been mounted they would have used lances! Everyone wore livery otherwise who would you know who to kill or capture for ransom? Metal autonomons rolling around in the mud just looked ridiculous. The reality is far more cinematic than what we see; Henry and his men at arms stand their ground between two woods where they position their archers - you know, the famous English longbowmen who are barely seen! The French knights advance on foot enduring an arrow storm which kills many and forces them to bunch up in the mud so that they can barely raise their weapons then we have the savage hand to hand at the English line as waves of the French nobility sacrifice themselves. Had the film makers not seen Helms Deep? Had they not heard of CGI? The battle was both woeful and wrong.
Was anything any good? Well yes, the score was excellent and the overall mood for the first two thirds attractively dark but in the end it was a failure and in this day and age with the technology available and a talented cast it shouldn't have been."
"ninjawaiter","2","20","29","7 November 2019"," What A Mess
","Let's get the simple stuff out of the way first:<br/><br/>1) The people who made this film have never cracked a history book in their lives. They don't know anything about the period the film is set in, or the real people and real events they were trying to portray. Apart from getting some people's names and a couple of locations right, they fail at literally everything. It would actually be hard to get this much wrong if you weren't deliberately trying to do so. With so much going on, statistically one would be likely to get more right simply by chance if the script were being handled by chimpanzees.<br/><br/>Shakespeare took his share of liberties with the story of Henry V, but then, his audience was literally Henry's descendants, so he had a particular motivation to portray things in a certain light. One cannot imagine what the writers of this mess had as motivation. The story they are telling is supposedly a blend of history and Shakespeare, but they utterly fail at being faithful to either the events or the spirit of both. I suppose I could have just left this portion of the review at ""they utterly fail.""<br/><br/>Agincourt, the battle on which the entire story revolves, was a brilliant and incredibly dramatic battle. A faithful depiction of the battle would have cost no more resources, been no more difficult to portray or for the audience to follow, and would have been vastly more visually impressive and dramatically impactful than the bout of silly fantasy we are instead treated to. If you watched that and thought, ""This is what a medieval battle would really look like,"" your education is lacking and you should consider picking up one of Bernard Cornwell's excellent novels of the period as a primer.<br/><br/>2) I cannot for the life of me fathom why there are two 21st century characters shoehorned into the middle of this 15th century story. It's not just that Prince Hal/Henry V does not even remotely resemble the real person- it's that even if this were a made up character in a fantasy tale he would still appear six centuries out of place. He is entirely composed of silly 21st century notions about kingship, war, relationships, etc. And Catherine of Valois is even more ridiculous than he is. ""All monarchy is illegitimate,"" says the future queen. If that wasn't a laugh line, I don't know why they included it.<br/><br/>3) I could go on, but this is getting long already, so I'll summarize. The pacing is awful, the dialogue is often painful. I'm not one of those who enjoys Shakespearean language (I'd rather have a faithful modern version of the wording), but at least Shakespeare's dialogue is intelligent, unlike this nonsense. Some of the performances would probably have been impressive if they hadn't been wading through such utter nonsense. And why is Falsaff here? He's a fictional character ripped from Shakespeare, but entirely divorced from the actual Shakespearean character. He simply makes no sense, despite Joel Edgerton's herculean efforts.<br/><br/>In short, fools may like this film, but it is bad history, abysmal Shakespeare, and poor film making. I highly recommend watching Henry V (1998) instead, for a much better telling of a similar story."

","Inaccuracies aside this film made a valiant effort to look, and sound historical and up until the actual battle of Agincourt (basically its climax) it was almost getting away with it. Agincourt, however was a huge disapointment.
I was a member of a longbow society, have been to Agincourt (now Azincourt) have visited the battlefield (virtually unchanged) and the impressive museum in the small village. I have read extensively about the battle and know what a mere 60lb draw weight longbow can do over 150 -200 yards [The archers of 1415 used between 90 and 120 lb bows)
This film rode roughshod (pardon the pun) over the whole progression of the battle - The desperate state of the English army, the squabbling and competitive lack of unity amongst the French nobles, the terrain of the battlefield, the use of swiss mercenary crossbowmen, the whole class divide between the archers and the knights they so ruthlessly slaughtered, all in favour of a jolly romp in the mud with chaps punching away at each other in suits of armour (DON'T try punching someone in a suit of armour, it hurts!) . Even the killing of the prisoners (still a sore point for the French) was portrayed as almost as aruthless, post battle act of revenge. The battle was stilll raging and the English just didn't have enough guards for what was in effect another army in their rear."

","I'm all for re-staging Shakespeare, but the bard doesn't need much help.<br/><br/>Over four centuries ago, he was already dealing with 21st century issues: the crisis of leadership, separation of Church and state, the clash of cultures, class struggle, and the intersection of God, politics and history.<br/><br/>The big question about *The King*, is ""why?"". Timoth√©e Chalamet, hobbled by a weak script, is swallowed up by his role. Prince Hal Shakespeare's ultimate King; Chalamet is barely a prom king. And the bard's iconic Falstaff, who scoffs at authority and believes honour is never worth death, is mysteriously transformed here into a military hero who leads a suicide mission.<br/><br/>*The King* was made for fans of ""Game of Thrones"", not for fans of Shakespeare.

"merkelson","2","21","32","24 November 2019"," Just a nitpick
","This is a pretty good movie, but I'm only here to nitpick one little thing that bothers me.<br/><br/>The writers for The King could learn something from what the writers of The Last Kingdom got right -- timeless language. The dialog in The Last Kingdom is entirely believable because they are saying things that sound like what people in the 9th c. might say.

"BestBenedikt","5","49","85","1 November 2019"," Neither historical nor entertaining - A rather dull effort by Mich√¥d
","While I appreciate Netflix for still financing big budget historical epics in a time when no major studio does, I couldn't help but feel quite disappointed by David Mich√¥d's THE KING.<br/><br/>Once you look past its stunning visuals, there is really not much substance to the film. Being almost entirely deprived of historical markings - e.g. location informations, time specifications or even just names of historical figures - and filled with inaccuracies, THE KING basically fails as a historical film. Now, that in itself wouldn't be a problem as shown by films like BRAVEHEART, which are highly inaccurate in their depiction of historic events and figures, but nevertheless work from a cinematic perspective. Mich√¥d however, who clearly wants his film to play out as a dramatic character study, never achieves depth, empathy or even a sense of urgency for his story to be told at all.<br/><br/>Watching this film, its obvious flaws made me think a lot about last year's OUTLAW KING. But while Mackenzie's Netflix epic at least had an exciting core to it as well as somewhat compelling characters backed up by memorable performances, THE KING is ultimately a dull and sluggish two-and-a-half-hour drag. And who on earth thought casting Robert Pattinson as the (English-speaking!) Dauphin of France was a good idea? At a time when this man is starring in films like GOOD TIME and THE LIGHTHOUSE, Mich√¥d's script manages to craft a role that may be good meme material but is embarassing to watch and almost an insult to Pattinson as an actor.<br/><br/>In the end, THE KING is a very average film, potentially boosted by great visuals and an undeniably high production value. Thinking about all the talent involved though, it's definitely one of the bigger disappointments of 2019."

","There was Sir Laurence Olivier. There was Kenneth Branagh. There was Tom Hiddleston. Then there is this pile of rubbish and a mumbly poxy American kid that spends all his time concentrating on trying to sound English rather than conveying any emotion or character, or actual acting. Awful. The most ""helpful"" reviews sum up who this is for: Good even with the '15th century language'(Oh Lord...that's 21st century English trying to sound ye olde timey with the occasional use of ""mine"", hon). Numerous mentions of the two young heartthrobs because they're kids and have never seen a decent actor before and the general quality of Netflix films (which we're ""jealous of"" for some reason not because we're history and film buffs with decades of experience and know what a pile of turd is oh no it's something to do with Netflix and jealousy). So not a high bar, is it? WHY did they run with and ruin the Shakespearean version with Falstaff? Why does this exist? A Joel Edgerton vanity project that's why. It has been done MUCH better with MUUUUCH better actors and it is painfully noticeable this is inferior despite nice enough cinematography, a good budget and a THEORETICALLY decent supporting cast (but they couldn't save it either). This is just no Hollow Crown or Henry V. This is a mess. Despite the fine wrapping and bows I just mentioned, the Emperor has no clothes. For a nearly 2-and-a-half-hour film it is shockingly lacking in depth and character development or any general personal investment. I couldn't care less if Henry died of Pox and Agincourt never happened. That might have actually been interesting and new if it did happen. Falstaff was unnecessary, un-Falstaff and I felt no real emotive connection with Henry or Falstaff, which is a special feat of mediocrity because usually I am deeply conflicted and impacted over that relationship in several tellings. I get that it might be nice to see Henry V with Falstaff in easy language rather than the usual screen versions that are the Shakespearean language play (imagine how the '15th century language' dude would fare in those ROFL). But it was a gamble that failed imho. If they tried for an historically accurate Henry V without Falstaff maybe I'd be more forgiving - at least that would be something a little new but they bollocksed that up on a spectacular scale ne'er before seen as well. Truly awful. It's not a douche or a turd. It's a douche turd. It's the absolute worst of both worlds - Shakespeare and ""history"" and destroying both. It's barely watchable and is outright slow and pointless for more than it should be, some serious things come off quite cheesy or rushed and will certainly not stay with me in the way The Hollow Crown did at least not in a good way. Sean Harris, a FINE character actor couldn't pull it together - even he was weirdly quiet and mumbly. I can imagine Edgerton going: ""OK guys like quiet mumbling means something is REALLY important and serious OK because the calibre of acting and the script itself obviously can't convey that on its own OK? And...... Action"" Yes it's that bad. Pattinson's accent not good and annoying and the dialogue is poor but why pick on him? Everyone's accent is put on and bad and the dialogue is poor. Why bother casting an American as English and an Englishman as French? And Australians everywhere with bad English accents too. Who are you people giving this 9-10 stars and what is actually wrong with you? Are you 10? Have you not seen historical movies before? Or even just... movies? Like this was not a good movie period, not just on historical terms. The acting was woeful. The script was truly horrible. The ending just lost it another star (yes, it's taken me two days to finish this monstrosity I couldn't bare it). ""Great Speech"" hey? You people have obviously never seen a decent movie or heard the Shakespeare you boggle my darn mind. It was ludicrous and badly acted. Accurate Agincourt? Get out of town. Shiny things and a big soundtrack and budget do not a good movie make. On St Crispin's Day that was a speech but ahhh whatever who cares the CHILDREN rating this obviously don't. Just end.

This one, in particular, I have to say his accent is quite off in many scenes, which really bothers me. The way he talks (always low voice) and his performance in general needs some work. I watched the movie twice, once only listening without watching, and the problem becomes more obvious, especially compared to the other actors.

","First I have to tell you that I truly love historical drama. I also don't mind if, for the sake of a more thrilling movie and an accelerated pace you take a historical tale and change it in fitting way.
However, this was not done in this movie, on no level. They ruined a perfect historical tale, which had all and could have taken a lot of inspiration from Shakespeare's work. But they just added the spirit of our current time and unnecessary changes which not just ruin the historical accuracy of the movie, but also the authentic atmosphere of Medieval times.
The dialogues were dull, even outright dumb and the language more appropriate for a modern bar than a royal court.
The French were presented as a total caricature of real people. The king was made a peace activist which constantly tried to kill and torture accidentally, while the background story of the father-son conflict and the war with the French became twisted in so many ways it hurts.<br/><br/>Last but not least, what some describe as the climax of the movie: The battle.<br/><br/>Horrible, just horrible. They tell at the start what was supposed to give them a chance, but beside some ridiculous scenes, the whole battle turns out to be some sort of mud wrestling. The true value and importance of the bowmen in the battle of Agincourt, the proper positioning and prepared defences of the English, anything of military facts was either ignored or downplayed in one big mud show.
The king going into battle without support, without body guards and anyone around him, like a modern animated action hero is completely out of the context of any battle at the time.<br/><br/>I'm not just criticising the lack of historical accuracy in every scene, this would be not enough. They really made it a fantasy movie which lacks even the slightest touch of reality.<br/><br/>Talking about the pace and suspense: Did the movie, with all the cobble up of historical and literary themes, make any lasting impression if being seen from a purely action movie perspective? Not at all. The pace was slow, the tension didn't build up and overall it is a forgettable piece of film making.<br/><br/>The 4 stars being deserved by the music, camera job, outfit and acting. Yes, that were all strengths of the movie, but with this pace, dialogues, mingling of the story until it was strangled and nothing worth to talk about left, ruined a great historial theme.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh movie lacked the eerie sound and the ""dirty medieval feeling"" somewhat. Its acting and language was to artificial in a way, since it was based on Shakespeare primarily, but still: It depicted real people, acting like humans do and presented the story in a relatable and historical more accurate way. Branaghs Henry V is on a different level than this piece which could have been great, but was, unfortunately, ruined by bad writing first and directing second."

Once you know it never happened, you ask the question, ""why did this film ever needed to be made?"""
"rainerurmas-maine2","5","13","19","2 November 2019"," What a let-down
","First, I have to state the obvious - for a person who is not well-versed in history or simply doesn't care for it one bit and wants some action on the screen with a few good-sounding lines for trailers with a bit of added flavour in the sense of this being set in the Middle Ages - this is absolutely passable and you may even get some fun out of it.<br/><br/>For someone who is a little bit more knowledgeable of the history behind the reign of Henry V, the politics of Middle Ages and more precisely of the politics surrounding Battle of Agincourt and the related events and persons, this piece is utterly dreadful. This movie doesn't do justice either to the history nor the Shakespearean take on the events which seems to form the bigger part of its basis.<br/><br/>The movie starts out dreadfully slow and seems stretched out for no reason at all. The clear centre of the story is the Battle of Agincourt and instead of beginning out with Henry V being a drunkard for half an hour or even more, this part of it all could've been a lot shorter (this is just my opinion thus far).<br/><br/>The moment I felt that this movie is getting out of hand in its depiction of the events that transpired early in Henry V's reign was however when all of the sudden, the English were going into battle, the plot was so thin that I didn't even properly understand that war had now begun, it seemed almost comedic how the Henry in the movie had wanted peace all this time and for the smallest reasons, on almost a whim, decided to go into war with France which was by far a superior force in terms of size and population.
The second moment I felt that this is getting into the territory of being a parody of itself was however when Pattinson came on ""stage"" with his French accent, why on earth was this horrible mockery necessary - it wasn't and it adds nothing to the movie.<br/><br/>The third moment which really gets under my skin is the battle itself. The battle is clearly inspired by the Battle of Bastards in Game of Thrones, which is fine in itself but the battle starts to make very little sense when you start thinking about English longbows - which are most famously related to the battle at Agincourt. The longbows were so far off from the French, it seemed two stadium-lengths, that there is no way these could have ever reached the French, the distances in the battle and the way the French fell, was totally absurd.<br/><br/>The fourth moment when the movie seemed akin to parody was when the character of Pattinson went on the battlefield. No leader of armies ever enters the battlefield like that and especially in a way that battle would simply stop immediately. This is so weird because in first, the battle was depicted as pure chaos, as should be, then the moviemakers suddenly forget it and it seems like a small brawl where on first signal all quiets down, war doesn't work like that. Then Pattinson just skids around on mud and Englishmen jump on him with no interference from the French. How? What? Why?<br/><br/>All in all, the reason I'm writing this tirade is that the movie has so much potential, it looks sublime on screen and really does mostly justice to the era in its depiction of armies etc. But somehow, the simple plot plodded on the actual historic events comes loose at its hinges, Henry V is depicted as this holier than holy character to I suppose appease those wanting to get a modern take on the events in 1415, and to top it all of, the French side of the battle (people who could have been great villains) are simply used for comedic effect.<br/><br/>This leaves me with the sad realisation that for all its potential, the movie just isn't worth its running time. This is all the more baffling as flicks like Outlaw King have shown how to do justice to the genre without really having too much to do. This movie however while having all the right bits and pieces seemingly, simply doesn't get the job done for anybody who is actually a little bit familiar with the history of the event or the dramatic take on it by Shakespeare. The betrayal plot added to the events (Chief Justice and Henry V stabbing him to death) is the biggest offender in this, history and Shakespearean dramatisation of the time period have more than enough drama, antagonists and protagonists to highlight on the big screen without this immensely pointless added plot and mockery of Pattinson as an actor.<br/><br/>All in all, if you want a good take on Henry V's rise to throne and the Battle of Agincourt, stay away. If you want to netflix and chill with your significant other watching some swordfighting and Pattinson making a French accent, go for it!"

The young king just stumbles from whoring around in the ghetto into being a considerate, brave and intelligent leader of men on the battlefield. A very unconvincing performance. It would have been a little better had they at least cast a strong Englishman as Henry, but for some strange reason they picked a 60 pound skinny-pants-wearing Israeli.

Perhaps he screened ""The Chimes at Midnight"" and realized there was really no point in trying to improve on Orson Welles's version of Sir John Falstaff, and his will left him. Or perhaps he watched Laurence Olivier's brilliant 1944 adaptation of ""Henry V"" and was too stunned to move afterwards, and could only shuffle onto the set as if in a trance. Or he might have had a look at Kenneth Branagh's 1989 version of the same play. His wholly affectless face and dull, tired gaze tell a story of a man robbed of all energy, a broken, humbled actor who understands the impossibility of the task before him; the giants of cinema loom large, and though he tries to stand on their shoulders, their combined weight ends up crushing him.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast and crew caught the same fever. The movie is empty, listless; it drags along, as the actors mumble into their beards and slouch around the gloomy medieval locations and tedious battle scenes.<br/><br/>Only Robert Pattinson seems to have survived intact. He puts on an outrageous French accent as the Dauphin, taunting those silly English kniggits who have invaded his dreary country. Too bad he didn't stick around longer, but it was probably a wise move on Pattinson's part. Lily-Rose Depp as Princess Catherine shows up about twenty minutes to the end to liven things up, but she also beats a hasty retreat in the face of Chalamet's sulky countenance.<br/><br/>Everyone else seems determined to fade into the background, as if they were too embarrassed to be noticed. Joel Edgerton gets away with the bare minimum of effort as Falstaff, a Shakespearean invention elevated here to historical standing, and killed off in place of the real Duke of York. Welles left big shoes to fill, and an even bigger suit of armor, and Edgerton makes no effort to fill them. It's easy to forget he's there.<br/><br/>It's encouraging to know that you can write and direct a historical movie without ever bothering to open a history book.

EDIT: I should also add that the score is excellent.<br/><br/>Now to the negative:<br/><br/>This movie is boring and spineless. Apparently based not on history but the plays of Shakespeare, the screenplay is utterly uninspired by both. It consists of people sitting in small rooms mumbling modernist platitudes in faux-shakespearean - shot, reverse-shot. Why is Falstaff, one of the most celebrated jovial, care-free characters in literature, a mopey, mumbling, shell-shocked, bearded hipster? When they are not in rooms (or tents) King Henry is at the head of his slate-faced zombie army of Englishmen without personality. Where is Fluellen and Pistol? Where is the conversations with the soldiers the night before the battle? We do, however, get a terrible attempt at a speech - but I will get to the performances later. The film is spineless in its portrayal of Henry V. How do you give this rather bloodthirsty historical figure a character sympathetic to modern sensibilities? Why, make up a conspiracy behind his invasion of France. This is not Shakespeare's Henry either. It seems the writers only made it based on the plays rather than history so they could include an unhistorical riotous youth, and can add Falstaff - in this version, a man of the people who can spout both philosophy and battle-winning strategies. It is certainly not history, but it is not Shakespeare either: it is a painfully dull plot languishing in abject fantasy. While Timothee Chalamet's perfomance occasionally rises to mediocrity, his best attribute is that he looks almost identical to Henry's famous portrait. However for most of the screening time they would have benefited from just using the king's funerary effigy. His performance is risible, and his accent embarrassing. While Robert Pattinson's performance made my skin crawl (I think this had more to do with direction than ability, which is usually strong), he was at least charismatic, unlike everybody else in this film.<br/><br/>It is clear nobody knew what they were making with this film. Rather than draw from Shakespeare they came up with their own witless banter that occasionally struggles into archaic form, then plummets into anachronism (Thomas of Clarence refers to Hotspur's head as the 'prize scalp'; obviously not an English cultural notion until encounters with the Native Americans some centuries thence). I won't even mention the historical liberalities in the plot, since it is basically all of it.<br/><br/>If you love history or Shakespeare, stay far, far away from this mess."

Also (and this is more personal as I am French) : the performance of Robert Pattinson, supposedly a French prince speaking English with a terrible accent, was unbearable to me... I mean, they could have easily found an authentic French actor with a terrible accent. Most French people do have terrible accents. But an American actor faking a French accent... such a weird idea - it simply doesn't work...

"iemdeboer","9","35","64","1 November 2019"," Balanced piece of cinema
","Some reviews criticise the historical accuracy and literary origin of this film, but is it claiming to be a documentary or Shakespearean piece? No. So why fuss about that.
The script and acting is splendid. The way that Chalamet brings the character to life with an old-style English feels natural and true instead of a stiff play. The lighting and the battles also stood out to me. The darkness within the buildings of the time is not often shot so accurately. Nor is the clunky, exhasperating fighting with heavy armour and weapons. Usually battle scenes are made up of flashes, so that you can't pick it apart. It's nice to follow the main character throughout the scene and really see what's happening. Also great: fightscenes where main characters do not posess superhuman abilities.
Some found The King too long or tedious. I say it is nicely paced, doesn't feel rushed to get to the action-filled bits, but takes the time to develop its characters and politics.
Netflix pleasantly surprised me with this one, will watch it again."

The director clearly had great vision for this film but was unfortunately dragged down by a tedious and tiresome plot.

"evanston_dad","5","8","12","20 November 2019"," It's Hard Out Here for a King
","""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" was on TCM the other night. I re-watched a little bit of it, and then I had this brilliant idea that I wanted to make a new adaptation of it, but I don't like any of Edward Albee's dialogue, so I'm going to dump it all and write my own. It's going to ROCK, and I don't see how I could possibly fail. It's not like Albee's dialogue had anything to do with the success of his play.<br/><br/>If you're going to give us yet another screen adaptation of ""Henry V"" (because apparently neither the Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh versions exist) but you're not going to use Shakespeare's actual text, then the least I feel I deserve is a ""Henry V"" that feels like it has some reason for existence -- i.e. relevance to our current times. But this film doesn't have that. It's just full of a lot of cliche ""it's hard out here for a king"" ideas about leadership, politics, and war that we've heard a million times in a million better movies. ""The King"" looks handsome, but its own sense of self-importance is so cumbersome that watching it is like slogging through the mud that mires the English and French warriors fighting it out in the film's climactic battle.<br/><br/>The film is slow and ponderous and its solemn tone never varies. Timothee Chalamet (as Hal) seems bored to be in this film, and his performance has a curious lack of energy. The first time we see him in the movie he's sleeping, and it's like he never fully wakes up. I'm sure his bedroom eyes could make a tweener swoon, but my goodness someone give the boy a sandwich and a jolt of caffeine. My wife could body slam this dude, and she's about 5'4"" and 120#.<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton, who wrote the screenplay, plays Falstaff, but his primary purpose for being in the movie is to look gross. The film wants us to think the relationship of Falstaff and Hal is critical to the plot's outcome, but it doesn't ever feel like more than a sketch. In fact, that applies to the whole movie. I saw one review that described this movie as being a bunch of plot developments on an outline that no one ever bothered to connect to one another with substance, and that's a pretty apt description of my own experience watching it.<br/><br/>With about five minutes of screen time, Robert Pattinson shows up late in the film (because he's obligated to appear in literally every movie released in 2019) and tries his hardest to inject some life into it by way of a Monty Python French accent. It's like he listened to all of director David Michod's notes on how to play the character and then was like ""nah."" He makes fun of Hal's penis size before beheading a child and then slipping around in some mud, and appears to be having a blast doing it. I'm glad he had fun, because someone connected to this film deserved to.<br/><br/>Grade: C+"

He had reconciled with his father. He had 3 younger brothers (born 1386,1387,1389 and 1390) and as such great material for the complex relationships of family loyalty and personal ambition. Thomas of Clarence, a suicidally brave soldier did not pre-decease his father but died in 1421 well after Agincourt. Henry Percy 'Hotspur' was over 20 years older than Henry and was not killed by him...the Dauphin did not die at Agincourt...Henry V was a seasoned warrior with the claim to the French throne ingrained in him.

He looked like a good meal would have killed him, never mind a bloodthirsty foe clad in iron armed with an axe. The accent held up reasonably well, but he still struggles to shake off the winsome, ""butter wouldn't melt"" image and as he has to pretty much carry this film en seul, it just doesn't really work. The rare appearances by Robert Pattinson border on the hammy; with his final appearance reminding me of the first few steps taken by ""Bambi"" back in 1942. It is great that Netflix are prepared to fund projects like this, but the plain truth is that no amount of money can compensate for a poor screenplay - think Shakespeare ""light"" - supplemented with a few high-profile cameo contributions."

If this film was played at 1.5x speed, its shorter length and faster pacing would've made this film more entertaining. Many scenes were too long/dragged out.

"jcarlos-96740","7","2","2","11 April 2020"," I wasn't going to make a review...
","...because may expectations were low and I thought it will just be an entertaining movie but without nothing to say about, I guess I was wrong. Timoth√©e over exceed my expectations at playing young king Henry and made a remarkable job. There were two things that I completely loved about this movie, the first were the battle scenes, they are probably the most realistic battle scenes in this historic time I've ever seen in a movie, all the other shows battles with armors and horses like the knights and soldiers were ninjas with swords that moved very easily even though the weight of the armor and that controlled the sword and everything on the battlefield with perfection but this movie doesn't do that, this shows what the battles really looked like: a total mess! The other thing that I loved is that they didn't tried to romantize the Henry wedding with the French princess with some love at first sight thing like a lot of movies do about arranged weddings in this period.<br/><br/>The direction was also pretty decent and that final plot twist was good and completely unexpected. Despite all of these good points the movie is historically inaccurate and also inaccurate in comparison with Shakespeare's plays that were the base for this movie. This can be a bad point if you care about history and facts but if you only want to have a good time watching a good movie this won't matter.
This is probably one of the best Netflix movies!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","2","24 February 2020"," Duel between two heartthrobs was totally anti-climactic
","This 15th century court and battlefield drama, oozing Shakespearean influence, is not entirely devoid of simple funny dialogue. Early in the story, receiving words from his half-delirious father King Henry IV (Ben Mendelsohn) asking him to come home, Prince Hal (Timothee Chalamet) bluntly tells the messenger that his father's requests will be ignored. When the messenger stresses that the request is urgent, Hal, walking briskly away and without breaking stride, shouts back ""The urgency is also ignored"".<br/><br/>Another example. During Hal, now King Henry V lays siege on a French castle. One advisor comments that it is not advisable doing nothing and just waiting for the enemy's provisions to run out. Another advisor answers for the King ""This is the definition of a siege!"" But alas, such simple levity is few and far between.<br/><br/>The main thrust of the plot is straightforward. As a juvenile delinquent of a prince, Hal is forced to face his newfound responsibilities upon the death of his father. Moreover, unlike KHIV, a reckless warmonger, KHV is a pacifist. Failed efforts to seek compromise ends in the fabled Battle of Agincourt where, against overwhelming odds, Hal defeats the army of the French Prince The Dauphin (Robert Pattinson), who, incidentally is just as delirious as his father KHIV.<br/><br/>The above is an over-simplification of the movie which offers interesting subplots, anecdotes and characters. But first to my headline. While Chalamet enjoys his meaty lead role, Pattinson in his brief but scene-stealing role is the funniest as you have ever seen him, exaggerated French accent and all. In what ought to be a climactic duel between the two heartthrobs (half a generation apart?), we see The Dauphin, approaching Hal menacingly with raised sword, slips in the wet mud and stumbles under the weight of his full armour before he can deal a single blow. The sight is so pathetic that Hal sees no point in engaging him, but just orders his soldiers to finish him off.<br/><br/>While there is a sizable support male characters including Joel Edgerton playing Hals' best friend John Falstaff who engineers the victory of the Battle, there are two female supports, both with very limited screen time but both turned in impressive performances.<br/><br/>Thomasin McKenzie is Queen Philippa of Denmark, Hal's sister, warns him against people he believes that he can trust. Lily Rose-Depp plays Catherine de Valois the French princess that her defeated father offers to Hal in marriage. Anything but a damsel in distress, she is the one that makes him pay attention and try to grow up.<br/><br/>The cinematography is too dark for my liking. Background music throughout comes from a string ensemble that leans heavily on the lower-registered instruments."

"reddice26","8","2","2","5 January 2020"," Great action sequences
","The storyline, I can't say if it's true or not. I know nothing at all about English history, let alone Henry the 5th. Parts seem exaggerated or at least approached with artistic freedom. The political intrigues did not come over as realistic to me at least, the twists and turns were amateuristic and no king would fall for such a lame attempt at anyone undermining his power.<br/><br/>However, the movie's greatest asset is not in its narrative (even though its it's a good story), but in the gruesome fight scene(s). It's bloody, its dirty and it's close and personal as any real battle would have been back then. It's a very uncomfortable watch to be honest, but I was still glued to my seat.<br/><br/>I won't spoil too much, but even the death scenes are presented in a realistic way. People don't just drop to the floor, you actually see the life leaving their body. This is not something you would typically see in any R rated movie, not even Dredd, Punisher or Deadpool show it in this fashion.<br/><br/>One of the best Netflix movies out there."
"milesgreg","9","2","2","4 January 2020"," A work of fiction
","I kind of loved this movie. Very well produced. The musical score throughout was great. From the first panning shot on the battlefield with the setting sun I was hooked. And I don't understand all the complaining about historical inaccuracies. Isn't one of the characters completely based on a character from Shakespeare?
It is over dramatic at times. The one instance that stands out is when Chalamet is arguing with an advisor and there's all this hair in Chalamets face for dramatic affect. Ohhhk get over yourself. There are other instances as well. Also, Chalamet is a good actor but doesn't ever quite pull off being a king.
I thought the script was almost perfect but too modern at times which made no sense. Dropping the f word and some other phrases that were just out of place. Robert Pattinson was a great surprise. Pretty hilarious with his French accent but it worked.
I did not like the script writers character, Falstaff. He was trying too hard. It was like he was trying to be Russell Crowe from gladiator, dropping his voice as low as possible.
But I swear I really did enjoy this movie. The production value is fantastic. I just wish I could see a movie like this in a theater!"

","The King is one of that movies which starts very slowly and picks up pace very fastly towards the end. The King is a well made character study. Timothee Chalamet gave a decent enough performance as King Henry V. Joel Edgerton was really good and his character is very likeable. The King gives some really good scenes which stays in our mind. Robert Pattinson is unforgettable in this movie and he has done so well in this small role. The war scenes are captured well and I really liked it. The background music is also very good which suits the overall tone of the movie and gives us that historical feeling. Overall, The King is a good movie and everyone who likes slow paced movies can definitely watch this."

","Prettt decent movie. It took the important parts of King Henry and put then together. Through these moments, there was room for conversations with alot of silence in between. In the beginning there was a not-caring teenager that despised his father. He eventually grew up to a king that won a desiding battle in France. Ending with a question of his future wife asking why he wanted to go to war, what is all was for.<br/><br/>It could have been the translation of some chapters straight out of a book or from a documentary.

But the best way to bring England together turns out to be war - a war against France.

"howard.schumann","9","2","2","8 December 2019"," Convincing performances
","Loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Henry IV: Parts 1 & 2,"" and ""Henry V,"" David Mich√É¬¥d's (""Animal Kingdom"") epic medieval drama The King lacks the Bard's poetry and soaring eloquence, yet its intensity, intimacy, and brooding power will keep you captivated throughout its 133-minute run time. Co-written by Mich√É¬¥d and Joel Edgerton (""Boy Erased""), the film is marked by the convincing performance of Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet (""Beautiful Boy"") as Prince Hal, later King Henry V, whose growth from a rebellious and ""uncourtly"" teenager into a king who commands respect and even fear is astonishing. Though the film departs from the Shakespeare play and the historical record, it is easily the equal of the ""Henry V"" films of Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh in its ability to probe the depths of the royal mind.<br/><br/>The King opens in court. Hal's rage against his father King Henry IV's (Ben Mendelsohn, ""Robin Hood"") obsession with internal wars in Scotland and Wales has caused him to leave the royal court and associate with John Falstaff (Edgerton) and his friends in the Eastcheap tavern. Unlike the cartoonish buffoon of Shakespeare's play, however, Falstaff is the king's trusted adviser and honest friend as well as a man of reason and deep military experience, serving to later remind the king of the ideals he espoused as Prince Hal. Though Hal's defeat of Henry Percy (Hotspur) (Tom Glynn-Carney, ""Tolkien"") in a sword fight saves his father's throne, his worthiness to become king is questioned by the dying King Henry IV who anoints Hal's younger brother Thomas of Lancaster (Dean-Charles Chapman, ""The Commuter"") as his successor.<br/><br/>In the opening scene of the Shakespeare play ""Henry V,"" the Archbishop of Canterbury says ""The breath no sooner left his father's body, But that his wildness, mortified in him, Seem'd to die too."" When his father dies and Thomas is killed in Wales, Hal becomes King Henry V. As if the title brings with it a mythical power, Henry is transformed into a philosopher-king, more than ready to prove his right to rule. Determined to avoid patriotic wars, the new king ironically finds himself immediately embroiled in one. After an alleged assassination attempt and an insult by the Dauphin of France (Robert Pattinson, ""High Life""), Henry is ready to go to war with France.<br/><br/>In the stirring epic battle at Agincourt in October 1415, immortalized by Shakespeare, the English soldiers are heavily outnumbered by the French led by the cocky Dauphin who taunts the monarch in a dubious French accent by saying, ""I enjoy to speak English. It is simple and ugly."" King Henry, however, relies on Falstaff's masterful military mind to win the battle against overwhelming odds, turning the conflict in his favor by use of his long-bowmen. Empowered by the cinematography of Adam Arkapaw (""The Light Between Oceans""), the costumes by Jane Petrie (""Suffragette""), and the relentless score by Nicholas Britell (""If Beale Street Could Talk""), the horrors of war are conveyed with graphic authenticity.<br/><br/>Considered by some modern critics as a reckless warmonger, in Mich√É¬¥d's vision Henry V is the personification of England's triumph over internal dissension and foreign threats. The film, however, does not glorify war or turn it into poetry to inspire the troops. Here there is no battle of Harfleur with the stirring exhortation, ""Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or close the wall up with our English dead,"" nor do we see the young king wearing a disguise to survey the troops opinions about whether or not the king's goals are justified.<br/><br/>What we do see is Henry not only winning the battle but gaining the hand of French King Charles VI's daughter Princess Catherine of Valois (Lily-Rose Depp, ""Planetarium""). The outspoken princess boldly tells the English king that ""All monarchy is illegitimate"" and causes Henry to question his rationale for starting the war. In spite of England's success on the battlefield, however, Henry is an ambiguous figure whose manner of wielding power has raised questions as to whether he was a ruthless oppressor or a great liberator.<br/><br/>Though it was within the rules of war in the fifteenth century, not a second thought seems to have been given to the order to put prisoners' heads on spikes, or to murder hundreds of French prisoners ostensibly because a number of English page boys were killed. Whatever our ultimate view of the character of Henry V is, it need not deter us from appreciating The King, a remarkable achievement and a big winner for Netflix."

If you know this going in, it is very much worth a watch."
"arlaan","9","11","20","12 November 2019"," A great piece of narrative cinema
","It is baffling to me that this film is receiving so much legitimate rancor for being historically inaccurate. I would think that anyone with a functioning brain would realize that this is narrative cinema and not a documentary feature film. If you want to learn the true history, take advantage of the existence of the totally real and separate genre of documentaries. It's utterly ridiculous that these stuck-up know-it-all amateur ""historians"" think that the director/script writer/etc. didn't do any research. The wikipedia page for the Battle of Agincourt or even King Henry V will give an accurate account of events; it's not exactly valuable, hidden knowledge that they seem to bandy it as being. I don't see anyone dumping on Shakespeare for writing a dramatization. The fact is, this is a story about The King, and this holier than thou contrarianism has no place in judging this film.<br/><br/>To start, it's a great Netflix movie. In the vein of Outlaw King, the film does a good job of immersing the viewer in the setting. The acting was solid all around, and the musical score, while not particularly memorable, had its moments. The set pieces are good, and the props are even better. True armor-buffs will no doubt have something to say about the historical accuracy of the costuming, but the performance put on by the actors in these seemingly real sets of armor was very convincing. Above all, this movie gave us something that other media has repeatedly failed to give us: convincing armored combat. Gone are the wild swings of longswords somehow cleaving through a breastplate. Instead we finally get the good old grappling and knife fighting skills that proved to be so useful on the battlefield. The fights were a joy to watch for this reason. As for the plot; it's solid. Some moments approached melodrama, but all good stories should be a little over the top, or they wouldn't be worth telling.<br/><br/>It may not be a true to life version of events surrounding Agincourt and Henry V, but the history is interesting to study, but not necessarily fun to tell your mates about. What we got here was a good story."

","The king delivers another great film to Netflix's list of exclusives, the topics covered throughout the film like, man's need for war has a profound effect. Chalamet delivers an excellent performance which is now to be expected. The acting is the strongest asset to the film with Joel Edgerton and Robert Pattinson both adding weight to their characters. The score is fantastic as well as the cinematography capturing some well crafted battle scenes as well as the politics behind war which are all fantastic to watch.<br/><br/>The only gripe I have with the film is it is somewhat committed to the Shakespearean language,but not entirely as it keeps swaying back and forth between regular English and Shakespearean English. Also some audiences might find the film to be quite slow at points, however I believed the battles needed this build up and politics to further heighten the reasons both these countries are at war.<br/><br/>Overall I had a great time watching the king, Timothee Chalamet is one of the best actors today and it shows in this film. With a great supporting cast backing him up, direction which is passionate about the subject and a story that is extremely intriguing and exciting. Definitely a film you should consider watching."

","I think this movie is very good because I like the atmosphere of the dark European Middle Ages. ""The King"" provides it."
"A-vanMarle","2","9","16","6 November 2019"," A boring mess of a movie
","The biggest problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. On the one hand, it tries to take a fresh look at the person of King Henry V, but ta the same time, it tries to be an adaptation of Shakespeare's play. As a result it false at both, lacking the flair and drama of the play, while at the same time managing to be LESS historically accurate than Shakespeare's work. E.g. It shows the Battle of Shrewsbury as being settled with a single duel. (The 5000 or so casualties of the battle would be surprised to hear that!) It states that Henry's brother Thomas dies in Wales before Henry's coronation (The real Thomas, duke of Clarenc, lived another 20 years and died in France.) It claims that Sir John Falstaff led the vanguard at Agincourt. (The person Falstaff was based on was already dead by then and the vanguard was led by the Duke of York.) And, finally, it claims that the Dauphin (Played by Pattinson and arguably the only watchable part of the movie)was killed at Agincourt, whereas in reality he never went anywhere near the battle.
None of this was necessary.
So, lacking even the pretense of historical accuracy, does the film at least present an engaging story? Not at all. It presents us with a moping, emo, Prince Hal turned King Henry V (I swear Chamelet's expression doesn't change even once during the entire movie), who lacks the determination and dynamic personality of Shakespeare's eponymous character. For two thirds of the movie, the audience watches as this charisma-challenged individual stumbles around in a mental fog and allows himself to be pushed around by events leading up to the climactic battle, where, instead of actually taking charge, he has to learn basic tactics from other people. Then, to top it all off, we are treated to the meeting between King Henry and Princess Katherine of France. Whereas Shakespeare used this final scene as release tension by showing the two protagonists in an comically awkward courtship, hampered by language and cultural difficulties, the makers of 'The King' use it to show the world how WOKE they are. Within seconds, Princess Katherine, the only meaningful female character in the movie, unravels the conspiracy, analyses Henry's character and generally demonstrates the infinite superiority of the female mind over the poor befuddled males. I have some advice for you: If the only way you can write a strong female character is by making all men look dumb, I suggest you find another job. This does not show social awareness, it shows a lack of writing skill.
So, where does this leave us? If you want to learn about the real King Henry V, this movie is useless, because it lacks even a veneer of historical truth. If you want to be entertained, I strongly recommend watching the 1989 movie starring Kenneth Brannagh. I gave The King more than one star, simply because I liked Pattinson as the Dauphin but his role is too small to make the movie watchable."

"ThomasDrufke","8","8","14","14 November 2019"," Peace Forged By Victory
","The King is getting compared to last year's 'The Outlaw King' quite a bit. Released on Netflix, period piece 'epic' war film, reluctant hero, etc. While certainly a fair comparison on the outskirts, I think The King deserves to be praised on its own merits, though both films are quite good. With a much slower burn, The King is a film largely about trying to fix the sins & mistakes of the previous reign/generation so that peace can be brought to the world, and it succeeds on almost every level at telling the story in that way. I was worried about Chalamet and Pattinson's accents, with only the latter feeling a tad off. But overall, this cast is magnificent, both leading men are surrounded by an incredibly talented character actor based group who know exactly what is needed of them to tell the story (or at least the beginning) of Henry V. Joel Edgerton absolutely steals this film from the get-go, and the final 15 minutes contain just enough surprises for the casual viewer. Loved this one.<br/><br/>8.7/10"

","As a stand alone movie about a King in medieval times, this was an ok movie. As a portrayal of Henry V it was lacking. The sound sample of the full plate in the battle scenes made me think plate armour was made of slightly stiffened tin foil. The locations looked lovely and much attention was paid to try and achieve an authentic feel. This movie was let down by the dialogue which at times passed as authentic and other times did not. The plot featured historical events but they were creative with how they shared them with their audience. Overall a good try but I wish it had been better."
"transientdreams","9","8","14","2 November 2019"," Brilliant script and beautiful flow of chemistry between everyone involved...
","It's so very rare a movie can combine so many things, and so beautifully that it can almost leave your expectations as but fugitives to the gift you are witnessing before you. Whatever Netflix is inspiring in creative 'morale' alone is a pioneering effort. It has, in effect, raised the bar of movie making to a wondrous new level of creativity. Whether the genera here might interest you or not, the inherent talent involved in the final product of many of their films is simply breathtaking in the extreme. Somehow, Netflix has has been able to imagine, conceive, and execute many of the best films in just a few short years that even Hollywood hasn't been able to do in the last 30, and likely more. Constant re-makes of Hollywood films barely 20 years old do indeed tell that tale. As an artist, when you come from the GUT in your vision of exactly how it should be, and someone actually listens to you, and believes in your vision on a GUT level, then you often have such genius as this coming forth that damn near puts everything else to shame. Many Netflix films are simply beyond Oscar worthy. Mainly because the old guard of 'Standards' doesn't like the 'New Kid' walking right in, and doing everything exactly as most everyone watching wants it to be."
"BeRightBack","10","22","48","1 November 2019"," Henry V, Pretty Darn Great
","The King is a beautiful movie, and the story of King Henry V is great history. You couldn't ask for a better story and this movie does it justice.<br/><br/>Excellent cast (Chalamet, all grown up! Lily-Rose Depp, all grown up!), particularly the movie's writer and producer, Joel Edgerton, as Falstaff. Falstaff is not a historical character but a composition of several historical characters. (Yeah, he's Shakespeare's recurring favorite, along with his goat as incarnated in Henry VI's John Falstolf, who WAS a historical character). Everyone was just great, including Robert Pattinson as the doofus Dauphin. And Sean Harris, who is never not great.<br/><br/>This isn't Henry's entire life story, just the highlights. Loved it."
"lyntonm","9","11","21","2 November 2019"," Timothee Chalamet shines as Henry V
","This Netflix-produced movie is a standout with brilliant casting of Timothee Chalamet as Henry V and Joel Edgerton is superb as well.<br/><br/>The screenplay, writing, historical accuracy and violence of battle make the movie a treat to watch; but Chalamet's portrayal of a young Henry V is definitely what makes this film. Even the slow parts and dialogue show his natural acting talent and depth if character. He brings passion to the role as well as vulnerability and as people already know, he is one to watch for big things in the future, already having established himself as a household name in Hollywood at such a young age.<br/><br/>The film mixes betrayal, friendship, political and emotional connections very well, and pieces it together in an aesthetically pleasing film. Watch it, it's long, and you'll probably learn something about history you never knew. You may not rate it as highly, but you'll be the better off for seeing it."
"MOscarbradley","9","7","12","9 November 2019"," A very different take from Shakespeare's.
","A very different take on the story of King Henry V from the one we're used to seeing; you know the one a certain Mr Shakspeare has served up. As might be expected from a director who as already given us ""Animal Kingdom"" and ""The Rover"" there's a whiff of the gangster to be found here. These are the courts not of the high born but of the common, men who have fought their way to the throne through muddy fields of blood while Michod's vision of medieval Europe seems wholly accurate without being overdone.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a Henry far removed from the nobility of an Olivier or a Branagh. Chalamet's Henry is certainly noble but he's also much more of a pragmatist, prepared to think first and act later, unlike Robert Pattinson's over-the-top and somewhat camp Dauphin; the contrast between them is beautifully delivered. The other main character is, naturally, Falstaff who, in Joel Edgerton's superb performance, is a much more subdued presence than we have seen before. Indeed the acting throughout is outstanding as is the screenplay co-written by Michod and Edgerton, while the Battle of Agincourt is as fierce and as bloody as any battle ever put on film. In an age of Marvel movies ""The King"" might seem like a fish out of water but it's unquestionably one of the best films of the year."

","I'm glad I did check this out, because this film is certainly a step up from some of the Netflix releases I've seen from last year. To a point, I understand most of the middling reviews for this film. It's not perfect, far from it: it's a bit too long; Timothee Chalamet acts circles around everyone else on screen; and I will admit that some of the scenes in the first half of the film that feature Falstaff away from Hal are rather unnecessary. Some of the writing, too, feels a bit over-earnest, and at times a bit cheesy, but there are other moments where the writing soars (Chalamet's speech before the final battle). This film teetered on a 3.5/5 and 4/5 star rating the whole time I was writing my review, and I decided to give it a 4/5 star. There are issues with this film; I wont pretend there aren't. But this film also shows a lot of improvement over some of the direct-to-Netflix releases I've seen recently. I would much rather have films like this, that fall make a vie for greatness and fall just shy, than I would have a dozen more middling, soulless, committee-written-and-approved Marvel movies. This film might not be the one of the great medieval epics that will be remembered for years, but it's a step in the right direction for a company who has, at best, only put out decent movies so far."

"donegalcat","8","5","8","4 November 2019"," Dark and gritty take on Shakespeare
","The King is a suitably dark and gritty adaptation of Shakespeare's Henriad play's, Henry IV Parts 1 and 2 and Henry V. Avoiding the warlike triumphalism of some of the previous adaptations, King Henry V is portrayed here as a reluctant monarch and quiet pacifist forced into a war he doesn't want. The film is probably more accurate to actual history than the sanitised version presented in Shakespeare's plays. The battle scenes are bloody, brutal and dirty. The key battle of Agincourt is presented as a muddy quagmire of hand to hand combat rather than the heroic battle of legend. The film shows the brutal reality of medieval warfare and ultimately its futility.<br/><br/>Timothee Chalamet as Henry V and Joel Edgerton as Falstaff both put in strong performances while there are good cameos from Robert Pattinson, Ben Mendelssohn and Lily-Rose Depp. And the film is visually impressive.<br/><br/>The one downside are the accents. French-American actor Timothee Chalamet struggles with the English accent while English actor Robert Pattinson makes a laughable attempt at a French accent in playing The Dauphin. One can't help but wonder if they might have been better off switching roles."

The photography and customs are on point and the sound i found it considerably outstanding.

"jennifercapp","9","8","15","7 November 2019"," Definitely Not a Film to be judged by it's Beginning.
","At the beginning of this film, I thought, oh no, a high school emo film *cringe*
However, from the point where Hal becomes king, this film just takes off. I guess, upon reflection, that these people were teenagers, and the rather childish scenes at the beginning are actually very clever if viewed as establishing a status quo which the course of events within the film thoroughly disrupts.
The action, especially the scenes of war, are dark and gritty and really exceptional. I am so pleased that these are in no way hokey. Too often films represent medieval warfare as a bunch of knights in gleaming armour, posturing with swords as though they and their armour weigh nothing; but this was so much more realistic. I'm a fan of compelling war scenes, and this film has them.
I thought the acting was really good across the board, even from people who I don't normally like. A special mention goes to Joel Edgerton, a brilliant Australian actor who always convinces. His portrayal of Falstaff was perfect."

"enyakvarantan","8","3","4","29 March 2020"," All in all, a film I would recommand
","Before watching this movie I had read some reviews about inaccurate historical information, which yes is true. Some parts are twisted, as well as the timeline, especially when talking about the Hundred Years War. The plot was moderately gripping, however not as much as I had hoped. The casting was done very nicely, even though some would say that they only cast Timothee Chalam√É¬©e and Robert Pattinson for their looks, which I definately would not agree. Having seen many films in my time, and many of their films as well, I can say that they are both outstanding actors that always give a great performance. The only thing that disturbed me, was the inaccuracy with which they percieved the war. It was a war that lasted more than 100 years, however they had made it seem as if England had won instantly. I do understand that it was in order to give the film a beggining and an ending, but maybe they could have done it differently. As far as the historic inaccuracy goes, they could not have done it in another way, as the aim of the film was to depict king Henry. As one cannot do a detailed biography of each important thing he had done, it was necessary to ""cut it short"", in order to present as much as possible. As I have read many negative reviews regarding the historic part, I would like to remind people that films are not documentaries. We watch documentaries for historic facts and evidence however, we watch movies for the cinematography, for the moving performances of the actors and for the entertainment."
"aarovicsc","6","3","4","2 March 2020"," Could Have Been So Much Better
","This was a film I enjoyed watching. The acting was excellent, the atmosphere was engrossing and the cinematography was captivating. The story line was very predictable which is understandable as this is based on real events but the ending I felt was very abrupt. There was so much more to tell and I was left a little disappointed and somewhat cheated after the final scene. It was as if the writers decided they didn't really want to develop the character of Henry and further. I was left with the impression that he was going to become another hen pecked monarch (as his son was to become), instead of one of England's most noted warrior kings. In my opinion if film producers such as Netflix are going to go down the road of selling us the promise of historical drama they should at least attempt to be as accurate as is reasonable. It is interesting to note that at least part of the film used Shakespeare's Henry V as a basis for the writing. He was of course well known for taking liberties with historical fact.

","My Review : Netflix The King. My Rating 8/10<br/><br/>Another fine movie denied a decent Cinema release by Netflix I couldn't help thinking how spectacular some of the sets and locations would look on the giant screen.
I know it's my soapbox but I view this latest trend as a form of censorship and I hate any form of censorship. The censorship comes in the form of exclusivity to Netflix customers only.
I digress but it angers me if anyone can explain how a film that obviously costs millions of dollars to produce ( Netflix don't divulge their production costs) can recoup the costs with no advertising on Netflix just from subscriber fees I'd like to know.<br/><br/>The King is a beautifully produced movie I notice Brad Pitt is ons of the producers and of course it's the tale of young King Henry V and the Battle of Agincourt in France in 1415 which was just one of the battles of the 100 years war.<br/><br/>William Shakespeare wrote his play Henry V in 1599 and now 420 years later Australian Joel Edgerton and David Michod have written their version of events and written them very well indeed. Joel Edgerton is an excellent screen writer as he showed us in 2018 with the excellent film Boy Erased in which he exposed the evils of gay conversion therapy.<br/><br/>What impressed me about The King is that it's not a 21st Century dumbed -down version the dialogue is all believable and while not Shakespearean it still has almost an ""operatic "" feel without the arias.<br/><br/>The performances are wonderful especially Timothee Chalamet as King Henry V a young almost metrosexual pale Prince who gives up his playboy Prince sabbatical to return home and take the throne after his fathers death.<br/><br/>There's a lot of Australian talent in The King Ben Mendelsohn is impressive as King Henry 1V and of course Joel Edgerton is very impressive as John Falstaff the Kings most loyal friend and ally. It's also beautifully directed by Australian David Michod .
Robert Pattinson gives a good brief performance as the nasty threatening Dauphin of France who taunts the young King and ultimately falls on his sword.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Timothee Chalamet and beautiful Lily-Rose Depp ,who is lovely as the French Princess Catherine are actually romantically involved because Timothee's meteoric rise to stardom reminds me of Lily-Rose's father Johnny Depp's amazing career start except I think Timothee is developing into a better actor with greater range .
I'm looking forward to seeing him in Little Women later this week at The Cinema on a decent sized screen in a movie that all film goers can see without having to subscribe to a streaming channel.<br/><br/>The King is a long film 2hours 20 minutes,it's not a fast paced action movie but Australian director David Michod who also wrote and directed Animal Kingdom is an expert at portraying his characters personality and emotional state and I imagine he's a Dream director for actors to work with.<br/><br/>It's interesting to see the role of English King Henry V played by a New Yorker of French decent and in contrast an English actor cast as the Dauphin of France The King is a very impressive film."
"computer2computer","10","4","6","23 December 2019"," I just watched a masterpiece
","This movie is faultless in all aspects. I've enjoyed every moment of it from start to end. Time spent on seeing it, is definitely not time wasted."
"Shostakovich343","4","4","6","20 December 2019"," The King
","All ""The King""'s problems speak from its opening scene. We see the sun dawn on a desolate battlefield, where Sir Henry Hotspur (Tom Glynn-Carney) assesses his victory, and stabs a crawling survivor to death in the mud. It is a brutal and unflinching deed, committed by a handsome young man with a contemporary haircut.<br/><br/>That says it all, really. ""The King"" wants to have it both ways: to portray the Middle Ages in a historically accurate manner and to appear relevant to 2019 audiences at the same time. Yet the one devaluates the other.<br/><br/>Take Henry IV (Ben Mendelssohn): None of the exalted nobility and gothic gloom of John Gielgud here -- that's way too theatrical for such a serious undertaking. So what does Mendelssohn bring to the character? He plays him like Denethor of Gondor. Just watch any of his scenes: once you've noticed, you cannot unsee. How this is more realistic or benefitting the character in any way beats me.<br/><br/>Similarly, Joel Edgerton has rewritten Falstaff, 'Shakespeare's greatest creation' (Orson Welles), to make him less larger-than-life. And what do we get? A more buoyant Davos Seaworth.<br/><br/>Edgerton's performance ensures what I have been suspecting all along, namely that ""The King"" wants to be ""Game of Thrones"". It wants to indulge in the same courtly intrigue and massive onslaught, but hides behind the name of one of history's greatest authors. This produces a fascinating trail of derivation: a film inspired by a series adapting a novel inspired by the plays this film insists on adapting.<br/><br/>So Falstaff becomes a war-marked mentor and Bardolph, Pistol and Nym are out. Lord forbid we enjoy ourselves. 'Don't you get that ""The King"" has something serious to say?' you might argue, 'You cannot remain serious with constant comical intermezzos.' The thing is that Shakespeare could do precisely that. His plays remain simultaneously funny, touching and thought-provoking to this day because he was a great writer and had a matchless feeling for narrative tone and pacing.<br/><br/>It is the lack of these exact qualities that sinks ""The King"" -- not the mere fact that the script differs from the play, but the manner in which it does.<br/><br/>The big new spin that writers Edgerton and David Mich√¥d put on the story is that Hal is a pacifist now. He doesn't drink and hang around because he is young and cocky, but because he is revolted by life at court and the cost of war.<br/><br/>Chalamet certainly deserves the praise he has received for his work here. He gives everything the script demands and more (his pronounced cheekbones even make for a visual similarity with the real Henry V), but it is precisely this script that is lacking. In the entire film, Hal's gloomy attitude is disrupted not a single time by a moment of happiness or joy. Yes, Laurence Olivier may have been too much of a golden boy, but Chalamet is so edgy it feels like a missed opportunity that he doesn't apply eyeliner. As a result, the film has but one tone, and it happens to be a very weary one.<br/><br/>The turning point in Hal's development occurs when his brother Thomas (Dean-Charles Chapman) is sent to beat down Hotspur's rebellion. Last seen snoozing in a tavern, Hal suddenly appears on the battlefield in full attire, challenging Hotspur to a duel to prevent further casualties. Besides the fact that an adaptation of ""Henry V"" borrows its core dramatic material from ""Troy"" of all films, the dialogue in this scene is unbearable. 'This is *my* battle! (...) If I have my way, there'll be no battle (...) These men are not our enemies!' Such eloquence would not misfit a Roland Emmerich film -- or, indeed, ""Troy"". The writing and directing are at times so terrible it makes you want to throw up.<br/><br/>If you're not too busy wiping puke off your carpet you will notice that the ensuing sword fight is actually great. The duel is awkward and dirty, dominated by constant panting and the rattling of ill-fitting armour. If this is the realism the filmmakers were striving to achieve, props to them. Such a shame that most of the film is 'Agamemnon vs. Westeros'.<br/><br/>When Hal finally becomes Henry V, king of England, the film arrives at its core dilemma: will the pacifist Hal manage to... No. The answer is 'No.' ""The King"" wants to be all about the gradual corruption of power, but within two minutes Henry has a grudge against France, and within 20 he is beheading his own courtiers. He bites his lip twice, then starts a war. Anakin Skywalker's conversion to the Dark Side was more gradual than this.<br/><br/>The meat of the film is an hour of pedestrian warfare. Don't look for any tactics or character insight; it is just fighting in a supposedly realistic yet aesthetically appealingly manner. Even the odd appearance of Robert Pattinson's positively psychotic Dauphin -- the only character who appears to be enjoying himself -- can only raise the spirits for so long.<br/><br/>Just when you think the worst is over, the film ends with a comically shallow message about manipulation and (out of nowhere) female empowerment; as if were saying 'Don't you see how relevant I am!?'<br/><br/>I am sorry, ""King"", I was busy ordering a carpet cleaner."

"theredsky","5","4","6","10 November 2019"," The King Review
","The King is a pretty bland and forgettable Netflix movie. Just because it is bland and forgettable does not mean I would call this a bad movie. There are elements that I did appreciate. I thought Robert Pattinson did a great job and I felt that his character was interesting even with the small amount of screentime. Timothee Chalamet started giving a pretty good performance in the second half of the film and Joel Edgerton did good most of the time. The sets were pretty great and looked authentic to the time period. This is the same for the makeup and costumes. The costume design is the only aspect of the film I felt was fantastic. There are a handful of good shots and a single good piece of music and I think the 3rd act battle scene is well done. My biggest issue with the film is that it isn't presented in a unique or interesting way. In short, the film doesn't stand out. The cinematography is pretty bland and uninspired for the most part. Besides one or two shots, I don't remember most of the scenes. The music is pretty bland and sounds a lot like stock music for the most part. The acting from everyone else ranges from decent to bad. None of the acting besides most of Chalamet's performance and Pattinson's performance was that great and was mostly passable. The script is pretty weak in most areas and the story generally isn't that interesting. I was bored for a majority of the film. I'm most likely going to forget about this film before the end of the year. Overall, The King is not a bad movie but it doesn't do anything to make it stand out from anything else I've seen this year."
"tjsbmurphy","8","4","6","10 November 2019"," Good character study, so-so history
","Very good movie of what is essentially a modern version of Shakespeare's ""Henry V"". The evolution of Hal into Henry is well done, the performances are solid, and the action sequences-especially the seige of a French castle- are excellent. I felt the final murder was inconsistent with who Henry had become, but aside from that its a solid piece of what is essentially historical fiction."
"wongcalvin","8","4","6","8 November 2019"," Running away from history but still great movie !
","This movie had a great cast, especially by casting Timotheen Chalamet was the perfect role for becoming Henry V, on the other aspect like score, cinematography, editing were all great but not the best. One great part of this story is the dialogue which is fairly well written among the characters.<br/><br/>There's one scene on the medieval battle kinda resembles The Battle of the Bastards from Game of Thrones, which is filled with horror, blood, killing and well claustrophobic but I kinda feels HBO's GOT done that scene better due to the budget constraints but it's fine.<br/><br/>Overall it's a great movie, great battle , great dialogue and great performance from Timothee Chalamet !!"
"lwgoodrich","9","4","6","4 November 2019"," A Royal Treat
","Beautifully acted and directed, The King is a riveting film. It's over two hours long, and every minute is watchable. Much of the dialogue reflects the spirit of Shakespeare, on whose work this film is based. Henry V is still one of the most revered kings in English history, though it didn't start out that way. Lead actor Timothee Chalamet does an excellent job portraying Henry's transformation from dissolute hellraiser to a young ruler of growing maturity.
His supporting cast is peerless. Sean Harris brings his usual intensity to his role as Henry's top advisor. Joel Edgerton gives a fine edge to his performance as Falstaff, and Robert Pattinson chews up the scenery as the French Dauphin, a nasty piece of work.
The costumes and sets lend authenticity, and the battle scenes are remarkable - and brutal.
This is a great viewing experience....and not to be missed."

","I've watched this film 4 times now, and each time I've noticed new/different things, the main thing being that this film is a masterpiece.
Some scenes are a little slow, but you've definitely got to stick with it!
Timoth√©e Chalamet is the perfect casting for Henry V, he absolutely nails the role.
Robbert Pattinson also deserves a mention for he too nails his role as the Dauphin√©.
The music score is powerful throughout the entire movie and compliments the cinematography perfectly.
Although I will say that some certain things are historically inaccurate, the two major things being; Henry V did not kill Sir Henry Percy as shown in the film, and the Dauphin√© was nowhere near the battle of Agincourt. But I can see why these events were maybe altered for a more dramatic effect, and to be fair it works!
The main thing I can say is watch this movie AS a movie for entertainment and not to get the full true historical information from."

"albertam","9","7","13","2 November 2019"," Great movie in every aspect
","I didn't see this movie coming and have no expectation. However, this is a real gem.<br/><br/>What surprising me at first is that the Percy got killed in the very first 15 minutes. It is nowadays very rare for a modern screenwriter depicts the main character Henry in this old and effective manner. The movie doesn't have much battle scenes and relies heavily on well-drafted conversations. Some setup could be easily spotted are about human weakness and the payoff are amazing. The last battle scene is not made up of CG but the revelation of the violence and brutalty.<br/><br/>However, The best part of the movie is after the last battle scene. It questions about the nature of war and politics. The King raises the high bar of period war movie.<br/><br/>If you love Game of Thrones (except the last season), you would love This King. The King is also far better in terms of depth."

","The King does an excellent job in adapting its source material (William Shakespeare's King Henry IV & Henry V) for modern times. The dialogue feels realistic and authentic to the times, yet it never feels too Shakespearean for a modern audience to really connect with. The scope is grand yet not too overbearing. The story is provocative, but still rather personal.<br/><br/>This is probably the best original film that Netflix has ever put out, it's gritty, it's epic, it has a lot of heart, and all of the performances are incredible, the standouts being, of course, Chalamet has the titular Henry V, and Pattinson as the Dauphin of France.

","So, it might not be exactly the true events of the Battle of Agincourt. I don't know; I'm no historian. I just read a couple of books that didn't seem to probably get it right, either.
It was, however; a satisfying movie. All the basics are great (acting, cinematography,etc....). And I couldn't believe how well and exciting the action scenes were without gore. It really represents the carnage without any blood; I would've said that's impossible before seeing this.
It is an action packed and thoughtful ride. Highly recommended."
"Erlik_Han","8","6","11","3 November 2019"," Most realistic depiction of medieval armored knights in battle.
","I've never seen a movie or anything that depicted medieval war so brutally realistically. Fully plate armored knights fall from their horse or are pulled to the ground where they are overwhelmed by lightly armored troops sticking long daggers into their visors, and other weak spots in their armor (neck, armpit etc). Hammers, axes and picks are much more effective (against plate armor) than swords that are basically used as long iron rods to hammer each other with. You even see knights holding their swords both at the handle and blade using their pommel to hit people in the face.<br/><br/>Then there is the cavalry charge that's absolutely brilliant. Characters hit by the cavalry charge are hit super violently and are literally thrown on the floor due to the sheer power and weight of the cavalry charge. Never seen such a realistic depiction of a cavalry charge. Henry's friend whose name I just forgot stands in front of his line (bit dumb in my opinion) but when he is charged he is smashed into his own line and literally flies backwards due to the cavalry charge. In stark contrast with what we usually see on TV. Like with game of thrones where a certain person who ""knows nothin"" runs towards the enemy lines and then survives a cavalry charge while standing in the middle of the battle field on his own.<br/><br/>
That said, the movie should have been at least 1 hour longer. So much was not told and some parts were historically inaccurate. Like why is the movie pretending Henry did not want to be king? Or that Henry was this hippie type character at first? I guess it makes him more likeable. They are doing the whole insecure anti war boy becomes strong ruler. Which is simply not true. Henry had been leading men into battle since he was a child. He wasn't new to this.<br/><br/>Like these are sorta my biggest issues with the show. Henry's friends give him blind trust but there is no reason why? Because he is better than his dad? He multiple times wants to slaughter all his captives, crucify.them etc completely opposite to the boy he was at the start of the movie. War sucks and it's a lot of pressure but we barely see him have to deal with any adversity and yet this dude goes from ""war is bad"" to ""let's kill all the French rats and crucify them""<br/><br/>
My point is. Even of they wanted to take so.e liberties with the story they should have at least prolonged it and given room for more character development.<br/><br/>The movie shows parts of henrys life and makes a narrative out of it. Ignores a lot of stuff around it and never tells us what happens. There is no 3nf scene with ""Henry lived a couple of years more but then died, his son.never really ruled France"" etc.<br/><br/>All that said. It is still a very good and interesting movie. And the battle is absolutely fantastic."
"fashinrashin","10","6","11","3 November 2019"," STELLAR, Please watch this
","Fabulous film making It can be said its not Shakespeare or correct history, but from my research the history isnt far off.
What is outstanding are the production values THE ACTING ! , lighting, direction, script , locations - its all excellent.
The reason this film was made is Joel Edgerton realized that this part of European history is about as important as any in history, and defines the English.
Its a great story.
The English crown was anyone's for nearly 400 years starting with William 1st (1066).
When Henrys' new wife Catherine says ""we are all usurpers"" it was true. The crown was up for grabs particularly in England.

","I enjoyed the props, costume design, battle recreation and sound effects - which means that the research team was capable - but that's all. The acting and script is very weak and specially Pattinson is attrociously awful playing a dumb French character. Finally, the worst of all is the sloppy visual aspect of this thing.<br/><br/>The cinematography is so bad that it almost looks like a current North American film production. Any perfectly calibrated screen or accurate projector may look like a damaged device while playing this movie. Somehow the mediocricy of digital colourists is spreading across continents, like a disease outbreak infecting all cinema. The imagery is so poorly captured and manipulated in post-processing that most of the movie seems to be shot in the light of the weirdest candles ever made, casting an orange light with greenish shadows. Also the sunlight coming from the windows is intensly yellow but casts green and blue reflections on the wooden or stone walls. It's ridiculous. Even the few exterior takes have an awful use of light and colour capture - the sky is often green and the moon is cyan, but the whole scenery, including clouds and people's skin, turns dark blue in the ocean scenes. All the lighting and colour work of this movie looks terribly careless and incompetent."

"phd_travel","2","8","16","10 November 2019"," Robert Pattinson and Timothee Chalamet should have switched roles
","What a tedious movie. Terribly miscast, incomprehnsible dialog, often too dimly lit. Chalamet is too slender to be the heroic warrior king. So many other actors would have been better. In fact Rob and him should have changed places. Robert Pattinson is totally laughable as the buffoon like Dauphin would have made a better Henry and Chalamet as the Dauphin. The dialog is often incomrehensible. Why fake such heavy accents? Bad casting.
The story is hard to follow unless you are familiar with the plays. Bad writer. Very modern expletives. The characters are had to differentiate. Bad director. The lighting is pitch dark or close to some scenes. Can't make out what is going on.
The muddy battle isn't exciting because can't tell who is who.
Lily Rose Depp as the queen is out of place with her exotic looks.

"cordenw","2","9","19","3 November 2019"," Another failure
","With a Netflix production you have only a fifty fifty chance of getting anything decent and even those odds are diminishing with the newer projects.
First of all....... no one , not one single person, was ""tasked"" with doing a job back in the late 1300s . They were ordered, or told, or commissioned to do the job but never tasked. That's because task is a noun, you buffoons! What are they teaching in film school these days?<br/><br/>As a movie covering an epic tale, this one is about as thin as a sheet of graphene, more like the ""Holy Grail"" made serious.<br/><br/>A few have commented that there is no character development (or very little at the most) and I have to agree.
They must hire their producers from Hallmark cards because it has all the feel of ""The Gift of the Magi"" but maybe I'm just too demanding.<br/><br/>On the good side it does have great costuming and evil looking and scheming courtiers. If some of the supporting cast had been brought in a bit more it could have been much better production.
I'm beginning to think that I myself could come up with much better stuff than most of the latest from netflix, but they won't let me out of the old people's home for fear I'll get lost.
If you've got time to waste or it's the inflight entertainment, then indulge yourself but if you have to make any sort of effort to see it .......... don't bother"

Instead we are treated to whispering, angst ridden performances that drag the film down like the weight of full armor on the French knights at Agincourt. Timothee Chalamont's performance as Henry is sadly lacking in emotional depth. Robert Pattinson 's French accent was the equivalent of high school actors trying to capture foreign accents. The battle sequences at Agincourt were taken directly from Game of Thrones. The production is wasted simply because of poor acting or direction."

"robertguttman","3","7","14","2 November 2019"," Glum and Dark Medieval History
","""The King"" is a modern revisionist-history reappraisal of the rise of King Henry V of England (""The Ideal King""). It is a story that has been done before and, one might venture to say, done rather better, by the likes of William Shakespeare. Like most modern movies, nobody in ""The King"" speaks above a murmur, a mumble or a whisper, not even when they should be making themselves heard before an audience. It is also very modern in that it depicts the Middle Ages as having taken place entirely in the dark or, at best, during the hours of twilight. The movie also persists in the modern belief that, contrary to the evidence of the numerous Medieval illuminations of artists such as Jean Froissart, the Middle Ages were a period completely devoid of color. According to the makers of ""The King"", in those days mpbpdy dressed in anything but black, brown or gray, all of the trees and grass were gray, and even the English flag, which is well-known to consist of a red cross on a white background, apparently consisted during the Middle Ages of a black cross on a while background. In fine, this movie undoubtedly will appeal to those to whom revisionist history appeals, and will not appeal to those who appreciate the poetry of William Shakespeare."

","This is a terrific film and, above all else, worthy of your time.<br/><br/>Much has been made of its lacking in historical fact, or its failure to follow an accepted storyline, but to slavishly follow either of these courses would have delivered a movie we have seen many times before. What's the point of that?<br/><br/>One word: adaptation. Any screenwriter worth his or her salt is going to play with historical fact or the essences of a work of fiction; after all, who wants to see the same stories copied over and over again?<br/><br/>I remember thinking just this when so many people complained that a recent retelling of Agatha Christie's The ABC Murders, was so different to all the others. It had to be, otherwise we would be seeing the same thing repeated endlessly.<br/><br/>This movie tells as much as we need to know of history and is a worthy addition to the many tv and movie adaptations we have seen over the years.<br/><br/>If I had a prior reservation about this film it was the casting of Timoth√©e Chalamet as a fighting King. Surely too slight a build to portray a warrior. Well, whatever this extraordinary young actor lacks in physicality he more than makes up for in sheer screen presence. A gritty and convincing performance. Maybe not an Oscar, but surely a nomination.<br/><br/>Don't look for accuracy here. Go see a documentary or read a textbook if that is what you want. This is a retelling worthy of its own entry in the annals of cinema history. Bravo!"
"caixajoao1979","5","5","9","17 November 2019"," Innacurate and dull
","I'm not even going to mention historical accuracy because most of the realistic reviews in this list already took care of it. The movie is dull, slow paced and long, too long for it's own sake. I know epic/medieval movies have high standards (due to masterpieces like Braveheart, The Last Samurai, etc) and it's difficult to achieve such quality, but The King drags you through an exaustive narrative and the characters are too shallow. Great photography, though. It lacks a true and immersive soundtrack like Horner or Zimmer."

The story is so relevant now about war. Especially the reveal at the end. It's about every recent War we have in real life, what was the reason for it??

"vandykeu","6","5","9","4 November 2019"," Quite good, but historical issues undermine the plot
","This is a gritty, but somewhat predictable, historical gem from Netflix. The acting, dialogue, and cinematography are excellent. There is a bit of a plot twist that I was pretty suspicious would be the case, and in I think the plot is a bit rushed or forced from the start. Maybe that is because there is so much that happens in the story, so something is bound to get rushed somewhere.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is probably how Henry V is portrayed as a sympathetic hero who is only invading France due to insult and to firm his support at home. This is fine from a point of fiction, but Henry in reality invaded France as a way to demand historically English (the royal family was Norman/French in origin) lands that the French had re-taken during the Hundred Year's War. He wasn't a hero as portrayed here. Obviously the politics/history is beyond the scope of the movie, but by forcing Henry to be more sympathetic, the movie contrives reasons for his war that are not quite believable. As a result, the movie works largely as a gritty medeival action movie, but the plot isn't too coherent/believable. Had they made Henry's motivations more real, the movie would probably be more believable (but far less sympathetic). In Shakespeare's time, English nationalism would make this more acceptable. Now, in our cynical day, it is less so.<br/><br/>I think this sums up most Netflix movies for me. They feel rushed for some reason, even when they are long (2 h, 20 m in this case). A bit more consideration would have made this far more epic, even if it was still false to history. Hell, Braveheart is 99% fiction but is still a great movie."

","I thought this was a very well done and tense film. It does make you feel bad for Hal that he's thrown into this life he never really wanted and doesnt know who to trust. Who's really there for him and not just because of his status. I thought the battlefield shots were great too. Very bloody and dirty and makes you sad/angry about war. And stylistically I thought shot well too. One shot in particular I liked was this overhead shot of Falstaff getting lost in the field. And speaking of Falstaff I thought Joel Edgerton did a really good job of playing him and he also chose to make the character more sympathetic. He also is less cowardly than portrayed in Shakespeare's works. Its an interesting take and I actually liked the change.<br/><br/>Acting wise, I thought the cast did a very good job. Especially Timothee and Joel. The one disappointment I had acting wise was Robert Pattinson. It's not the worst thing in the world but in comparison to everyone else, his french accent is a tad over the top, some of his mannerisms when you first meet him are a little silly, and then theres a scene later on where he keeps falling in the mud. Tonally, I felt like stood out like a sore thumb. Im sure that's also how he was written/directed to be....but ehhhh just didnt work for me.<br/><br/>The only other thing to mention is that the film is over 2 hours long and does feel like it in places. There was times where I was wondering how much long the film was going to be. So, some pacing issues.<br/><br/>Other than that though, I did really enjoy the film. No, its obviously not super historically accurate (especially since it includes Shakespeare's invented character of Falstaff) but the cinematopgraphy and the general story and acting were great. It is a quite dim story and if you don't like gore there are definitely gonna be scenes that make you a bit queasy."

"i_odin","4","4","7","13 November 2019"," Another Historical Fiction Twisted to Suit Writer's Masculine Heroism
","This film is probably bearable, if not presented as a story based on a real life historical figure. The reason why this film doesn't work is the sheer audacity of the writers to make the film about ""washing"" a figure just to suit their narrative. (Just create a new character, if all you want is to tell your story, why bother stirring up the past?)<br/><br/>Even if we focus just on the technicalities of the film then also this film is just not good enough.<br/><br/>The writing is just bad.
And you know pretty well enough about this yourself, when you see almost every scene in the first half starting from someone waking up somebody from deep sleep (or just someone who is pretending to sleep). First few times it's okay, then after that it's just lazy writing.
Speaking of writing, this film (at a certain point) seemed more of a vessel for Edgarton's character to shine rather than about some great monarchy of England. (Edgarton is also the co-writer of this film, just saying)
The war sequences are nothing which we have not already seen in other movies. The long war choreography with men valiantly fighting each other is just a cliche now. Moreover the fact that England beats France with rain is kind of far fetched and doesn't come out of the realms of this cinema.<br/><br/>The music is good. But with it's monotonicity, doesn't uplift the story. The cinematography is ambitious. And production design manages pretty well.<br/><br/>Speaking of casting, Chalamate is probably not the right person to play The King. He is an overrated actor. I am sure there are characters which he might nail while performing. But King Henry V was not one of those (at least for me).<br/><br/>Overall a decent film, if you could overcome few boring moments here and there."

"manuel_medeiros","8","4","7","8 November 2019"," It's a solid movie - and an ambitious release for Netflix
","The King's ratings are probably diluted down because of the (alleged) lack of historical accuracy in the movie.
Since this bloody chapter of the 100 Year War between England and France has been depicted by many - namely in Shakespeare's epic plays - it is only natural that people dislike any deviations from reality.
To me personally, it is not a deal breaker. Perhaps because I am not fully aware of the inaccuracies depicted in The King.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself - I think is a very good portray of how a young King rose to power. His transformation from a drunken kid at fault with his father to the rightful king and leader of an army is well performed by new Hollywood hot property Timoth√©e Chalamet (Call My By Your Name).<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton plays his right man and protector Falstaff - but also co-writes the script with director David Michod, a collaboration previously enacted in Rover.<br/><br/>Overall the movie has a solid score and visually ambitious scenes. Namely, the climax battle of Agincourt is reminiscent of the superbly conducted chaos of the best battles we saw on Game of Thrones, for example.<br/><br/>The things I disliked about the movie are perhaps the lack of something more epic. Everything seems planned and going in the right motion. There are not many changes in pace. There is a relevant twist near the end but other than I thought it needed to feel grander. More epic that it really felt.<br/><br/>Also - nothing against Robert Pattinson, but why casting an American actor and make him a cartoonish jackass with a fake French accent? Would it not be easier to cast a French actor to make the accent more believable? Found that part to be a bit childish.<br/><br/>But in any case it is a good historical epic movie - more a 7.5 than a 8 really - and a visually and creatively ambitious one for Netflix. Worth a watch.<br/><br/>PS: Netflix had already ventured in the genre in Outlaw King, but I think The King is a superior movie overall"

","The King has everything you want from an historical drama, particularly if you are male and love battles. The battle scenes are awesome, though still fall short of the literal thousands that actually took part. Close-up fighting means you won't really notice. But The King is also a thriller as well as a drama. There are some very unexpected twists. And it has a conscience, which is perhaps the main theme. This is the real surprise. It's a beautiful piece of writing, keeping within actual history, yet expanding for intrigue. Many of the characters are truly well done. It's brilliantly cast in that regard. Oh, and Henry actually looks like the real Henry. I can't tell the filmmakers how important that is. There's an overall darkness, that is, low light, to the piece. The medieval ages were lit by candles. Whatever, it works, as does the muted tones. The King will be one of the more respected historical pieces for 2019."

","Ok, there are a few artificial and modern devices and phrases thrown in that seem forced and a bit of PC nonsense. The do mar the surface of this screenplay and production a bit from perfect to nearly perfect. But so too do verbatim Shakespeare productions with his anachronisms, kowtowing to the then contemporary sensibilities and interests of the Tudor court, and his glossing of the Hundred Year War chevauchee warfare (going around the countryside and killing all the villagers and farmers when your 'noble' opponents won't leave their castles) -- which in modern times would be classified as a major war crime. So this is a ""based on"" story written by one side, just as all of Shakespeare and virtually all war stories are since the Iliad itself.
Even Hollow Crown, which is at least a star or two above this in quality, strains against the dishonesty in some of the source material.<br/><br/>So aside from script writing/dialogue of this which is above average but does not excel, the rest shows talent and and an overall well done and entertaining work. Clearly they had to pick a young heartthrob actor for Henry V to have a prayer of getting the valued younger demographic viewer , but given so many of them are without talent, the lead actor, Timothee Chalamet, is quite talented and able to carry this film well. Sean Harris, has graduated from his whispering almost mumblecore Borgia days and is great. The rest of the cast is quite good, although Robert Pattinson seems to half play his part as camp and that is a tiny bit distracting.<br/><br/>Overall though this is much better than Netflix's record of mediocre productions. Certainly accessible to all audiences as well, especially compared for example to the Hollow Crown, which as I noted is considerably better acting, but not really accessible to people not already familiar with the major events and characters from Richard II to Henry V."

The first half of the movie focusing on the fictitious ""young Hal and Falstaff"" story line is acceptable for its well recognized mythology. But when the movie plays fast and loose with clear history such as the campaign against Percy Hotspur I should have known nothing good was in the offing. But I still held out hopes because the production values were so good. Yes the acting is good, particularly if you like brooding young men. It truly is a lovely, gritty tale. 75% fiction, but a lovely tale.<br/><br/>The Battle of Agincourt is soooo wrong. Yes, there were archers. Yes there was mud.

I am not one of you either so why should I go to war because you tell me to? (paraphrased)....I think hearing Muhammad Ali's words as a young girl clarified my purpose to support peace and repudiate war.<br/><br/>Is it not clear now -oh my countrymen, living in a land meant to be the paradise where all who come are to be welcomed in spite of their differences or beliefs? Is it not obvious that we are being driven by false counselors of the airwaves, and even more, so the false leaders we've elected that we should battle each other?<br/><br/>Whereas if we but joined together in a collaborative mission to truly, in reality, provide support to each other, each in our own way, to focus our energies as one to heal and support all life, that of man, mammal, fish, fowl, and plant alike!<br/><br/>WE ARE THE CHILDREN Of GOD!

"Freedom060286","2","3","5","1 December 2019"," Nice Visuals and Costumes, Poorly Written Story and Not Historically Accurate
","There are impressive battle scenes in this movie, and the costume design is excellent. Some of the cast perform very well, such as Sean Harris, Thomasin McKenzie, Joel Edgerton, and Thibault de Montalembert.<br/><br/>But the story is poorly written and it greatly changes history. The real events of this time period are much more interesting than those of the contrived and rather silly story of this movie.<br/><br/>1. They ignore the ten years between the Percy Rebellion and the death of King Henry IV. The king was just age 36 and not dying in 1403, he actually died in 1413. Henry ""Hotspur"" Percy, shown as a young guy about age 20 in the movie, was actually three years older than Henry IV.<br/><br/>2. They chose the wrong actor to play Henry V. He looks much younger than Henry was at Agincourt (Henry V was age 29 at the time). Henry was actually a typical Plantagenet, a tall, athletic, strong man, not adolescent-looking. He had a stronger personality, he was more charismatic and better able to inspire his men.<br/><br/>3. Henry V never killed Hotspur in single combat. Henry was just age 17 in 1403, while Hotspur was age 39, although they seem about the same age in the movie.<br/><br/>4. Henry was not as rebellious and as much a drunkard as shown in the movie. He was, like many of us a bit wild in his teens, but this was greatly exaggerated in the movie. Although he probably had disagreements with the king, I doubt as a devout Christian he truly hated his father, as shown in this movie.<br/><br/>5. Henry V never killed William Gascoigne, who died in 1419 at the age of 69. Gascoigne retired voluntarily several years before his death.<br/><br/>6. The English nobility and clergy are all portrayed as stupid, scheming and/or cowardly, while the drunkard Falstaff is portrayed as wise, honorable and brave. This is rather silly.<br/><br/>7. The Dauphin of France never came to meet Henry before the battle of Agincourt, nor did Henry go to the French camp to challenge the Dauphin to single combat. It would have been foolish for either to risk capture."

","I'm still of the opinion that Netflix should give large releases to their motion pictures especially seeing as many are worthy of such a large theatrical run worthy of the content on display. I'm bummed that I wont be able to see the upcoming ""The Irishman"" for the same reason. And while I wish I couldve been able to witness ""The King"" in a theater nearest me, it is not hindrance on the quality of the film.<br/><br/>This is a film for a niche audience and one that perhaps only Netflix is in a position to fund and proudly support as of late, especially in this saturated market of summer tentpoles and franchise pictures. And it is for that reason that I adore this film even more. It is a full-stop motion picture set in England of old loosely based on history to tell the tale of a man who must truly find his own Avenue to become the man he is not meant to be but who he really is. And what does that mean for England? And for France? And for the loads of people who just want to get on with their merry lives. Without spoiling too much of the film, we follow Hal as he just come to succeed the throne from his father for whom he is greatly estranged from. In his unexpected succession he must grapple with whether or not he must go to war with France under suspicious circumstances. This campaign for which he must now lead gives us a truly interesting look at what it must be like for a young man to have to rely on older men, many of which he can't hope to fully trust, to council him to make decisions that grow increasingly more difficult to surmount.
The film takes a more subtle approach to character development as it shows Hal, wonderfully portrayed by Timothee Chalamet, come to conclusions on his own about who he wants to be but time and again be shown that who he desires might be impossible in the world that his father left in his wake. The cinematography is good and captures the tone and the beauty of the gloomy land of Britain and France while the musical score by Nicholas Britell is simple in its composition but by relying on strong strings and ambient sound design, adds to a steady tug of war between hope and doom.
The screenplay by Joel Edgerton and Director David Mich√¥d is equally literate and compelling if nothing else, tracking the nuanced obstacles that our characters face.<br/><br/>The film is a great reminder of the quieter epics that can still be delivered in this saturated market and one that Is both contemplative and ultimately highly entertaining. In regards to historical accuracy, it should be noted that the film is based in part of Shakespeare's Henry V and thus is more in line with classic Drama than historical documentary. Even still, the film has merits both technically and in the acting department that hold it up.<br/><br/>This was a delightful film and a little treat in the holiday Season."

","With the success of GOT, there has been a renewed interest in late Medieval English history, and Shakespeare's history plays . The King is loosely based on Chimes at Midnight by Orson Welles which Welles based on Shakespeare's Henry V. It's the story of Chimes at Midnight told from the point of view of Prince Hal rather than Falstaff. Prince Hal is young rebellious and dissolute , Falstaff is his mentor in debauchery. Then through circumstance in-spite of Prince Hal's disavowal of the throne he becomes king. This all happens at the beginning to reveal more would spoil. All the references I mentioned at the beginning are alluded to enough to pick up on if you are familiar with them but don't get in the way if you don't know them as the film can stand on it's own.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot darkly in natural light gives both accurate vision of what the late Middle Ages looked like and sets an emotionally sombre tone for the movie, the acting is very good and seamless, all the cast working off each other so none truly dominates.

","This was on at the London Film Festival. It is loosely based on fact, though there are three inaccuracies one about Thomas of Clarence , one about Falstaff and the other about the Dauphin of France. but they get the result of the Battle of Agincourt right.
The dialogue attempts to sound slightly Shakespearian but there are various phrases that grate on an English ear like "" lets go visit with Henry IV"" and ""in order to have reform you need regime change"", and a reference to the archbishop tasking.
We saw it with the HOH subtitles and there was a bit where a horse ""nickers"" which I assume is the American or aussie for whinny. The graphics are good- computer generated sailing ships,and a fairytale castle , The sets were shot in Hungary and feel genuinely medieval, costumes, props, battle scenes all done well. The acting is pretty wooden except for the Dauphin- straight out of Blackadder. It takes longer than it needs to to tell the story but its an enjoyable romp through ( somewhat inaccurate) history with plenty of gore and grunting."

","My god, what a well made Netflix film - Enjoyed every second of it. Based loosely on the works of Shakespeare, 'The King' has both drama and nail-biting action. It stars Timoth√©e Chalamet who really deserved a Oscar nomination for his performance, but the supporting cast where brilliant as-well."

","You know what are cliche elements in a historical drama? This movie has those cliche elements and doesn't have them at the same time.
You believe the main character as a young boy and understand all of his actions, his weaknesses and his brave character to face his difficulties as a new ruler. Most of this connection is for Timothee Chalamet great acting and also the good writing and directing of the film.
The battlefield filming was also great and realistic."
"richarddillomes","7","2","3","22 March 2020"," You take the wins with the losses.
","The King is based on plays written by William Shakespeare ""Henriad"", which were based on actual events. The movie has taken some liberty to change things here and there to move the story along, most notably the character of Sir Falstaff, King Henry's most loyal confidante in the movie but was disregarded as a fool and jester with no clear ending in the play (boo! loved the right knee bit.) The haircut is real, the immediate marriage to Princess Catherine isn't (took five years later, lasted only five months, reuniting when he was on his deathbed.) All the politicizing must have been real, as you know one thing humans are consistent with is greed.<br/><br/>Timothee Chalamet proved he has already earned his stripes tackling this role with ease, a testament to the great actor he's slowly becoming. He has proven 'Call Me By Your Name' was not a fluke and that he can go as far back as the 1400s to add a scrawny yet authoritative King Henry to his Filmography. Robert Pattinson was larger than life, as was intentioned by the writer but there were moments where he came off as trying too hard. But the commitment was there to see the character through and he deserves praise for that. Note that Chalamet whose father is French plays an English king while Pattinson who is English plays a French prince. Lilly Rose-Depp, Chalamet's on and offscreen partner was only in the movie for a short time but managed to make her impact. Dean Chapman (who we adored in Game of Thrones, right?) was cast again as a prince eager to prove his claim to the throne.<br/><br/>The set design paled in comparison to big-budgeted films but it's good enough if we're not being too picky. That drone shot mirroring Jon Snow gasping for air in the Battle of the Bastards, they knew would elicit comparison which they didn't seem to mind. As far as historical war movie goes, this isn't bad, but it isn't the most memorable. There have been many Shakespeare adaptations before and there will be many more to come. Unfortunately, this might get lost in the shuffle just as Prince Dauphine did in the battle of Agincourt."

"nicomarroquin1998","5","2","3","19 March 2020"," A beautiful showcase of a slow burn in an excessively serious tone
","Whether the historical accuracy of the film is correct or not, this showcase of a medieval period drama lands flat in that, it tries, but fails to reach a deep enough character study for the main character played by Chalamet, with his motivations not fully explored, or his psychology as he takes on the role of king left almost as a second thought.<br/><br/>While it is beautifully shot and there are a couple of highly accomplished action scenes, ultimately this movie shows its length, and however good are the acting performances, particularly from Chalamet, acting alone can't help salvage this movie from being sadly passable."

","8/10 but it's a dwindling one. It really scrapes an 8 just about, it's really close, and you know what, Netflix almost made an absolute hit,m. They almost united everyone under one rule - the "" i fu**ing love this movie rule"" - they 'almost' did.<br/><br/>Hate me if you want, but I actually didn't realise this was based on true-events until I came on here to check the reviews, and to be honest, I loved it before I knew about the historical inaccuracies and the few niggles here and there people have picked out. Really, if I had known about the historical inaccuracies beforehand, would it have made a difference to this review?, probably not. I love it after too but it's an a 'what could've been' in all honesty. I don't think it's too long either, but they had the capabilities to create a masterclass here funding-wise, they really did. Just missed the bigger picture with this topic and setting - feels like they saw the headlines and gobbled up that thought. It's a shame Netflix will be the brunt of the hatred for something that could've been perfection.<br/><br/>However, lets not forget the good things about this movie because it's entertaining and immersive if you can look past the accuracy factor. It's unfair to write a review and only have gripes with accuracy and no positives I feel, but hey, different rules for different people right? But here's a fair review, so I'll run through the pros and cons summarising each below for your reading pleasure.<br/><br/>PROS
---
+ Acting: I thought the acting was excellent. Egerton and Chalamet are great, and the talent of the latter is noticeable immediately I think.<br/><br/>+ Music & Sound: Excellent music and sound throughout. Really chosen well I feel, and all create immersion for the scenes and the vibes throughout. There's slight humour, grit, anger, tension, anxiety and it's all portrayed well.<br/><br/>+Cinematics: Again excellent. As a spectacle, it's something for sure. It's shot really well, especially the battle scene. It's slow when it needs to be, fast when it needs to be; it's immersive at times and entertaining At times too, and that's what you want from this section really.<br/><br/>+ Length: I think it's perfect to tell the truth. It's no Irishmen or OUATIH, but its no short either - it's right for me personally. It all knits together really well (inaccuracies aside) and I enjoyed the length. I was engaged throughout and wanted to see the next scene.
//
CONS
---<br/><br/><ul><li>Accuracy: So here's the rub. I guess it really does have to be mentioned because it's HUGE, and I don't think being American counts as a factor here lol (and yes I did laugh). They really should've done better with this, American or not. You don't set out to build a masterclass movie with all the pros listed above without researching first. It's just silly. If Its billed as a Historical movie, then why change the facts, if not, then fair enough, it's amazing. Like I said, I didn't realise beforehand, maybe I should've in fairness, but it's a gripe that has to be mentioned. Poor, poor on the directing part. I don't think anymore needs to be said, it's far too apparent and obvious to the history buffs and lovers of this time period.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Historical Language: Now this follows a little from the previous con, but I think it's worth mentioning separately. Some of the language is a bit 21st century for the time period. Now I've seen a few other reviews with this factor and I agree, but it's not always present. Some of the language is very eloquently written and flows really well (but that might be the acting in part). Just listen a bit closer on your next watch, you might pick out a few.</li></ul><br/><br/>//<br/><br/>Just two cons you say? Well they're big ones, but that's really all other people have been saying too as far as I see. A movie heavily downgraded for its historical inaccuracies both in events and language but one I loved out of my partly my own stupidity and partly because IT DID have some great features. Netflix almost had a viewership united, apart from some braindead research and a look for a cash-grab.<br/><br/>8/10 but it's a dwindling one."
"impeyrules-54634","6","2","3","7 January 2020"," Decent enough
","Decent enough but i thought it lacked enough content. It felt like it was a battle and it was over. There wasnt enough story or background. Would maybe have been suited to a 6 part tv series.
Acting was good but i didnt get enough from the film to recommend it with any vigor"
"shnames87","7","2","3","26 December 2019"," Pretty good
","Another fine addition to the Netflix originals that are vast and many are wonderful. It is certainly very slow paced at times as most of these middle ages epics tend to be. Much of the cast were people I had not heard of. There were a few though that I definitely recognized.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were well done and the action was gritty and believable. I don't know how historically accurate it was as I know little about King Henry.<br/><br/>There are definitely better movies based in the same era but this one is still worth looking at. Assuming you have Netflix there isn't much reason to not check it out. If you like movies with medieval knights and honor stuff then it should definitely be checked out and I would watch it again for sure"

"akcenat","7","2","3","14 December 2019"," English period drama with story we've seen before
","In keeping with the surge of medieval dramas - popularized by Game of Thrones - Netflix has released another period film ""The King"" that sheds light on the lesser-known history of King Henry V of England during the early 15th century. One of the biggest issues with this movie is it last for more than two hours and I'm are still trying to understand protagonist's motivation. How did Henry V go from a reckless youth all the way to calling out an enemy to fight in single combat? How did he go from refusing his father's throne to accepting it? etc. The reasons are a little muddled. At the end, movie is an admirable, albeit forgettable, retelling of a well-known (Shakespeare) character. While it does have its qualities, the flimsy character development hindered me from investing emotionally into this portrayal. I'm glad I saw it, but I doubt anyone (except some old English people) will rush back to see this in the movies.<br/><br/>Rating: 7"
"dreamaek","10","2","3","12 December 2019"," Amazing movie!

"berndgeiling","7","2","3","10 December 2019"," Kill them all!
","This is a dark movie, brilliantly photographed and acted, maybe historically incorrect...but who wants to watch a High School History lesson in cinema?Watching Chalamet as King Henry with his angel like face demanding to kill all the prisoners of war was a moment which gave me goose bumps all over, one of many intense moments this movie offers. The Battle scenes are spectacular.
Chalamet is the most talented and gifted actor of his generation.
I hope he'll be having a great career ahead, as long as he stays true to the seriousness and the depth of his acting. He has a wide range of emotions to offer, between anger, fear, sorrow and sensitivity.
And that wars have always been built on fake reasons and lies...thanks for the screenplay to make me realize that."

"shelcove","10","2","3","30 November 2019"," Enthralling
","I now feel I've been as close as I could come to Agincourt and survive. What a battle. Truly one for the ages. Showing Falstaff as a canny old warrior who predicts (and explains) the outcome, worked for me, however contrary it may have been to either Shakespeare or history.<br/><br/>Speaking of Shakespeare, I WAS disappointed with Hal's battle speech to his army. Naturally, the writers couldn't having him spout Shakespeare's inimitable words. To have had him mention ""band of brothers"" or ""St. Crispin's Day"" would have destroyed the illusion of reality in the present movie. But I think Shakespeare's concept of Hal claiming to not want even one more warrior there, though they were greatly outnumbered, because then there would be less glory to share - I think that could, and should, have been stated in contemporary words. Also, the incredible pride which survivors would feel for the rest of their lives, and could share with grand-children (and the envy of anyone not present on that day.)<br/><br/>I thought Robert Pattinson was fascinating as the Dauphin. I didn't know beforehand he was in the movie, and did not recognize him at first - only thought to myself, Who is that riveting and strangely handsome presence? In only a few scenes, he deftly projected a slimy evil that was a necessary counterpart to the not-totally-good English.<br/><br/>One error, I think, was not to adequately introduce the audience to whomsoever became the disembodied head that the Dauphin had the little boy carry to Prince Hal. Who was it? A female? It didn't look like the sister. No other clues.<br/><br/>I watched the movie as an English major who has read all of Shakespeare, and a history and battle buff who has read most of Churchill, and I was riveted to the screen for the duration of this movie (which is longer than movies I usually watch.) I was thrilled with this rare film, and came away feeling that I understood much better what happened at Agincourt, and the complexity and mystery which lie behind great events of history.<br/><br/>Thank you to all who made ""The King"" possible."
"black-k-en","10","2","3","29 November 2019"," such a shame!!
","I feel so sorry for people behind creating such movies, when I see movies which are empty of everything, of plot, of good acting, of music, yet they are perceived as great movies just for a well known director or a famous actor, while real pieces of art such as this movie are completely underrated and underestimated, a great film, brilliant acting, breathtaking music and cinematography, and a good plot, am really glad I watched this, thank you for making this movie"
"WalkdenEntertainment","7","2","3","16 November 2019"," The King has more strength than I Expected
","Hal (Timothee Chalamet) receives word of his father's, the current King of England, illness. Right now, Hal is leading a quiet life as he has turned his back on his family. Hal soon finds himself in a challenging position and feels forced to accept the life he once tried to ignore. After his father dies, Hal becomes King Henry V and must now take over from where his father left off or perhaps... Hal might even take a different path all together, especially regarding war and delicate topics such as politics. Thankfully Hal won't be alone. Hal invites one of his closest, most trusted friends from his hometown, John Falsaff (played by Joel Edgerton). In the past John was once a knight but in the present day he spends most of his time sleeping and drinking beer.<br/><br/>For the history and Shakespeare buffs out there, I can warn you in advance to keep an open mind while watching the film. This film does in fact take a different path at multiple times compared to what the history books may actually tell you.<br/><br/>The introduction to ""The King"" is a slow burn. We gain a basic understanding of Hal and his life, but the story goes back and forth as he talks with his father and mopes around in his current life. Needless to say, once Hal is crowned King Henry V, I found myself rather curious and wishing to progress further into this film.<br/><br/>Visually, The King is a great looking film. Cinema buffs who own the latest high resolution TVs will be impressed with the film. The image quality for Landscapes and Costume designs should also be praised here.<br/><br/>As for performances, ""The King"" is generally loaded with positive experiences. Actor Tim Chalamet as the lead role was generally fine but I felt he got better as the film progressed (and no, I'm not just talking about his character). Robert Patterson I would say for most part was also fine. Solid praise should go out to Joel Edgerton who manages to deliver a fun and heartfelt performance and was easily one of the best elements of this film.<br/><br/>As a plot, apart from the slow start (20-30mins in), I generally found myself enjoying the film more as it progressed. Naturally the film builds up to a bloodbath finale.<br/><br/>Overall, The King has more strengths than weaknesses. Praise goes out to the supporting cast such as Joel Edgerton. As a plot, it's a slow beginning but worth while if you can push through it. The film's visuals are also enjoyable and solid considering this is now a Netflix exclusive in Australia.<br/><br/>6.6/10

"Alexander_Blanchett","7","2","3","16 November 2019"," Very decent but flawed.
","Another interpretation of William Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" quite modernized starring two of Hollywoods most -in hotthrobes.
The execution is quite good with many epic moments, great production design and costume work. The story itself is interesting however the story telling sometimes a bit slow moving with the tendency to bore the audience a bit.
Performance wise it was convincing most of the time. Timoth√©e Chalemet was as expected very good. Sometimes a bit one toned but skinny Timmy had indeed some memorable moments where he could show off his acting weapons. I also really liked Joel Edgerton. Thomasin McKenzie had an appearance but rather unnoticed and unspectacular.
Robert Pattinson was the weakest part, I can see why he was cast but I found his French accent rather a bit ridiculous and performance wise also not the most convincing stuff he did.
I assume the film could have been a bit shorter and probably had the same or even better effect. Still a good historical epic with many good scenes and a great look and feel in general. Nice atmosphere. Could just have worked a little on the direction and writing."
"fannyelisabethdahlin","7","2","3","13 November 2019"," Slow burning and beautiful with strong performances
","Quite frankly, long battle sequences is like the most boring thing. And this film basically revolves around a war. But it's not what stays with me after it's over and essentially not really what I think it's about - to me it's more about family. Solitude. Responsibility. I take with me the silence between the lines. The facial expressions. The suppressed emotions. ""The King"" is a slow burning and beautiful film. Timothee Chalamet is brilliant in the leading part and Robert Pattinson has great comical timing in his unexpected role."
"eddie_baggins","7","2","3","6 November 2019"," Michod returns to form with The King
","Since making his stunning debut with Australian classic Animal Kingdom in 2010, director David Michod has struggled to deliver a project to the same high standards he set for himself, with the good but not great The Rover and the genuinely lacklustre Brad Pitt starring War Machine failing to showcase the director we saw unearthed initially.<br/><br/>It's pleasing then to see the Netflix released The King show more than its fair share of promise of the director we know exists, in what's a well-filmed, acted and staged epic that at times transcends itself to become a moving and contemplative examination of power and leadership as it shines a light on King Henry V.<br/><br/>Teaming up with his long term friend and collaborator Joel Edgerton (who also makes his mark on screen as the no fuss John Falstaff), Michod and Edgerton craft a grim and grey insight into the time in which England found itself at war with France and under the leadership of a previously reluctant leader in the shape of Timothee Chalamet's Hal.<br/><br/>There's nothing surprising about The King's narrative movements, one that feels similar to any other similar medieval epic, but Michod and Edgerton explore some interesting themes in amongst all the betrayals, beheadings, battles and bloodshed, that's expertly played out by a very capable cast.<br/><br/>Continuing on his hot form that has now gone on for a number of years, Chalamet is well cast as Hal/Henry V and the way in which Chalamet moves from drunken slacker to a man determined not to make the same mistakes as his father is perfectly constructed, a performance that is backed up by the reliable Edgerton, a solid if underused Ben Mendelsohn as King Henry IV and a scenery chewing and thick accented Robert Pattinson as the detestable Dauphin of France.<br/><br/>For a Netflix film, The King also feels a cut above a number of its other counterparts with Australian D.O.P Adam Arkapaw's cinematography capturing a mixture of beauty and horror effectively, while Nicholas Britell's thoughtful score ensures that Michod's vision is enhanced by some moody and atmospheric accompaniments.<br/><br/>If there is a notable issue holding The King back from reaching a higher level of accomplishment, it would be that throughout, many of the films characters remain cold and unreachable, even Hal is a hard figure to completely fall for, while many of the films other players are never allowed to grow fully enough for us to invest ourselves in, had the film managed to instil itself with more of a beating heart (say like a Braveheart), its likely Michod would've finally had another Animal Kingdom on his hands.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>A step in the right direction for director David Michod, The King is a well put together epic that should appease historians and fans of sword and sandal extravaganza's, that also features a number of solid acting turns that help maintain a constant level of engagement, without ever fully hooking us completely into its time and place.<br/><br/>3 ¬Ω rain predictions out of 5"

"mnogogaloshi","7","1","1","27 May 2020"," Fun historical fiction
","The King is inspired by historical events and the works of Shakespeare. A lot of people say that its historically inaccurate and it misrepresents many historical facts.<br/><br/>The thing that struck me while i was watching it was how quickly this movie rushes through the different stages of its story. This is a bit of a double edged sword, because it gives the movie a good tempo, but at the same time i felt like there is so much happening in such a little period of time. I think that it couldve made a great tv show if the writers wanted to really develop their plot and characters.<br/><br/>Personal relationships play a great role in this movie and we are exposed to many acts of bravery, leadership and betrayal. We see the virtue of friendship and duty. There is a lot of cruelty as well.<br/><br/>I didnt have any issues with the inspiration of the film and its choice to pick random events and to give them a spin fitting its trajectory. I really liked Pattinson in the role of the french prince and his accent didnt bother me at all. What i disliked though is how pathetic and unimportant the actual french king was. For a character of such importance, i think his presence felt incredibly marginal.<br/><br/>The movie emphasizes a lot on how brave and honorable young Henry is and how he is ready to sacrifice himself in order to safe his men. Yet at the end we see that being young means being naive most of the time. Henry is questioning his decisions and is struggling to find meaning behind them.<br/><br/>Its a great story of how growing up with more responsibilities than you can take can lead to unwise, spontaneous decisions. We find a lot of Shakespearean traits to the people surrounding the young king as they play their own personal games and pursue their own individual goals.<br/><br/>The sets are great and the productions is wonderful. For the relatively small budget of $23 million the movies looks really convincing and the choreography of the battles is awesome. Im not sure if it was because of the budget or the length, but many important ceremonies and meetings were shortened and felt a bit rushed.<br/><br/>Overall a great medieval tale of kings and battles, but if youre looking for historical accuracy its probably not for you."

Lately these sort of movies have been misses.<br/><br/>Even if it was slow once or twice; the script, dialogue, score, (maybe some suspect) fighting, cinematography, I enjoyed the shot of King Henry V in the courtyard when there was a beheading.<br/><br/>I'm no historian, just enjoyed a good movie"

","Brilliant, well-paced supremely-acted bopic of the young Henry V. Slow-paced but in a good, thoughtful way, with a great and haunting score, and the Battle of Agincourt was realistically portrayed. Took me a few minutes to recognize Joel Edgerton as he was middle-aged, portly and with a brilliant Lancashire accent. However, undoubtedly, Timothee Chalamet dominates this movie with a tour de force performance. What a screen presence for someone so young, especially when he isn't speaking. I have no doubt he is going to be huge, the next Leonardo DiCaprio I suspect."
"patriciogl10","7","1","1","16 December 2019"," We need more period pieces these days.
","If you have a problem with historical inaccuracy, just straight out avoid this film. Having said that, The King is a valid fictitious portrait of actual historic events and lives such as that of Henry V, appreciably portrayed by Timoth√©e Chalamet, in a correct performance that doesn't strike at first but slowly begins to entice. Historical subject matter is dealt with care and attention to details, minus some historical facts which history buffs are not even done complaining about.<br/><br/>When I was watching the film, it felt slow and tedious in some moments, unable to grab my attention to its full extent. The pacing can be quite damaging to this film, although it's easy to confuse slow pacing with slow tension-building moments, which are done purposefully to generate impact at certain points in the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps you could compare this film with Kenneth Brannagh's 1989 film Henry V, which was adapted from the Shakespeare play, and its dialogue is million miles away from the one in The King, but both portray king Henry V in different manners, in different tones even, with both title performances being up to par. Robert Pattinson's performance is excellent, if there is someone who shines in a role, it is him, without a doubt, and his French accent is delightful.<br/><br/>Whether you are into English history or are a fan of Shakespeare's Henry V, you probably won't enjoy much of The King, but you could certainly try if you want to. Otherwise, I think this is a quite enjoyable film, one of Netflix's best productions for sure."
"d-JCB","8","1","1","16 December 2019"," Mich√¥d returns with a solid period war drama
","The King was a solid, tense period film over the English/French rivalry from the middle ages. Aussie master David Mich√¥d returns with a gripping portrayal of these dire times, with touches of Shakespeare tongue and brooding drama. It's a tale about honour, family, and the fight for peace over war. With many stories from this turbulent era in history, the film keeps you hoping, but is bittersweet by close...<br/><br/>From the opening moments, the film has an unsettling mood that carries the tension throughout, never over erupting but sticking to the very end. It's dark mood is pitch perfect for the era where beheadings were commonplace if you dare go against the King's wishes.<br/><br/>Timoth√©e Chalamet as Henry V is outstanding, one of the most promising young actors with this performance here, proving his efforts for the masterpiece Call Me By Your Name were not by chance. Michod & Edgerton on the writing credits again here, backing up the tight script of The Rover (2014) they co-wrote. Not to mention Edgerton acting abilities are on point once more as Henry's best mate on and off the battlefield. Incredible cinematography from Adam Arkapaw that depicts the scale of these battles brilliantly, while showing the intimacy of Henry's life and the decisions he chooses along the path.<br/><br/>Considering this a Netflix film, this along with Annihilation proves they can deliver cinematic pieces of cinema worthy of the masterpiece throne. There was no sniffs of it being a Hollywood blockbuster here, with material like Henry V's battle against France would be a money hungry producer's dream to glorify and exploit for the masses to suck up. Instead we have a well paced brooding tense film that is executed with a dirty sword right from the mud pit of the battleground. More of this please...<br/><br/>7-8/10"

","I must say that i am not aware of the historic events that tha movie depicts. Neverheless the movie was surprisingly good. The acting was good (Pattison not so much), the fighting realistic and all in all a very down to earth but still interesting enough movie to watch."
"skepticskeptical","7","1","1","11 December 2019"," Best Regarded as a Work of Fantasy-Fiction
","I found that the cinematography, costumes (chain mail everywhere!), acting and fast-paced and suspenseful plot of The King all combined to produce a satisfying and fairly gripping film.<br/><br/>After reading some of the negative reviews, I see that a significant contingent of people are quite angry about the historical inaccuracies. That¬¥s always a problem with fact-based films. There are so many people who believe themselves to know all of the details (I presume because they read a lot of books? Written by other people who read a lot of books?), and they are going to be annoyed at whatever is changed or omitted for the sake of the film and at the behest of the director/writer/producer (in this case, all three are probably complicit). It is true, too, that Shakespeare wrote a very famous play entitled Henry V, and some people appear to be angry that this is not that.<br/><br/>My best advice would be to watch this production as an action-adventure film created in the 21st century. Thinking of The King in that way eases some of the quandaries which will surely arise in inquiring minds, such as: why was a young metrosexual male with the body of a pre-pubescent girl cast in the role of Hal? It stretched credulity, to put it mildly, that an adolescent with a toothpick thin body (his torso was displayed naked in more than one scene...) could have prevailed in any hand-to-hand, knife-to-knife battle to the death with such thick-necked, seasoned warriors.<br/><br/>Ultimately, The King is a fantasy tale in which a slacker with pacifist leanings eventually undergoes a transformation not unlike that of Michael Corleone in The Godfather."

","Toegegeven: Henry IV / V zijn niet de beste stukken van Shakespeare. Prima dat je ze eens in de zoveel jaar afstoft en weer eens probeert. Dat is met mate / gemiddeld gelukt. Henry wordt vrij donker, gepijnigd neergezet door Timothy Chalamet. Hij maakt er het beste van en overtuigt wel als koning tegen wil en dank. Zijn kompaan Fallstaff is een mooie rol die er uitspringt. Goed neergezet. Voor de rest vooral vrij rauwe sc√®nes in een vlakke film vol intriges en verhaallijnen uit de middeleeuwen. Meer van hetzelfde. Gaven geen nieuwe inzichten. Pattison als Franse kroonprins was om te huilen. Volstrekt ongeloofwaardig en tweedimensionaal. Dat was sowieso de afdronk van de film: erg tweedimensionaal. Met Henry en Fallstaff als enige ingekleurde figuren in 3D. Maar dat is best weinig."

"ahk-37714","6","5","12","1 November 2019"," Expectations weren't met
","This film had high praise and quite good review from various film critics coming from film festivals. So at first glance the film seemed to be filled with a great cast and a promising director. Many of the cast members had proven to show great performances so acting wise I had expectations. However, I felt that Timoth√®e Chalamet was the wrong choice for Hal. His accent wasn't convincing and didn't feel natural throughout the film. At times you could even hear his American accent which lost the authenticity of the character. Whereas I thought Joel Egerton was very good and provided a good side character that was needed. The standout for me was definitely Robert Pattinson. His french accent was on point and very authentic, at times some of the pronunciations of words didn't seem right but overall was good. My only issue was that the he was in the film for a very short time and didn't show his presence enough. The dialogue was okay for him but there is one joke made by him that evidently was funny but didn't suit the atmosphere of the film and how people would actually talk during the 15th century. I also disliked the way his character eventually dies. And if it is accurate to history then fair. But his death was extremely stupid and removed any prowess that he processed as a character. But his performance saved the character. The script was messy at times and that's shown when a actor writes and script and not a proclaimed screen writer who could have easily elevated the film on many levels. The film was quite long and slow paced. It definitely could have cut down the film by 15-20 minutes. I thought that the cinematography was good and the battle scene at France was excellently made. It felt gritty and historic to how war really was depicted. Chalamet was extremely good in this part showing his excellent training that really paid off. For me the film is being praised and disregarded in the wrong areas. Chalamet is getting positive attention to one of his weaker performances and Pattinson is being overlooked even when he is clearly the standout. The battle scene is being overlooked for being 'too muddy' which is wrong in every sense. Also a true historian wouldn't like this film based on the inaccuracies in the film. But if you are not into history. The inaccuracies won't bother you.
But overall this is a watchable film but not at the standard some people are putting it to be. With better acting choices such as Dacre Montgomery who was also up for the part of Hal would have been the perfect choice based on his audition tape that really showed brilliant acting that Chalamet didn't in this movie. The script really isn't that good and needs improvement."

From one side I laught of his accent and tried to be French and other side I was impressed with his acting skills. Way better than before.
But the ending made me angry. I am not really like Depp's acting and the way she portrayed Catherine of Valois.
And the end, I like more Hiddleston's Henry V better, than this. Timothee is great but Tom's Henry has more potential as a military king as this one."

The fight choreography was purposefully sloppy, and I felt that added a lot to the film and helped the tone they were trying to create.
Joel Edgerton's performance was solid, and he stole every scene that he was in.
Robert Pattinson and Ben Mendelsohn were nice surprises but were not in the film enough.
The directing was serviceable with no glaring irregularities.<br/><br/>Cons:
The film was both too long and underdeveloped. I feel this would have worked better with four, hour long parts to really flesh out the characters and their relationships.
Characters would come and go in the blink of an eye, causing me not to care about any of them.
Timoth√©e Chalamet is a vacuum of charisma and was boring in this film, per usual. The moments where he had to show emotion were jarring and fell flat, mostly due to his character not being fleshed out.
A lot of the film was too dark to make out.
An essentially non-existent score.
The twist at the end explained one of the main red flags of the story but was still unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Overall: Soulless and lacking any kind of originality. I admired the world/tone they created but since I didn't care about the characters it was in one ear, out the other."

I do give props though for not using swords as the Knight's main weapon during battle.<br/><br/>The acting is good, although Robert Pattinson's french accent really bothered me and I couldn't take it seriously. The story though is different, it bothered me a lot. not just because of its historical inaccuracies but also on how the characters were portrayed. This is not an acting problem because as I have said the actors did well it is more on the directing or writing side of things where this movie fell short. The characters aren't likable and I found it hard to sympathize with them. I don't really want to spoil the movie so I'll just end the review here.<br/><br/>so TLDR: You can watch this is you have nothing else to watch but if you have any sort of love for history and the medieval setting then DON'T! you'll just hurt yourself :D"

"christopherbradbury","9","3","6","2 November 2019"," Henry the Fifth - The Myth.
","Wow! This is a brave and controversial movie. It takes Shakespeare's Henry IV (in part), Henry V (in part), a pinch (a really tiny pinch) of history and throws it all into a pot. The pot is shaken vigourously and out comes Henry V: The Myth. The timeline is messier than Bohemian Rhapsody - and that was a mess - and the screenplay plays hard and loose with the truth, but the end result is so captivating and so utterly entertaining that I could not help but love it - once I had realised that it had no basis in fact but for a couple of names.
Written by Joel Edgerton and David Mich√¥d, the director, they throw history and the truth out of the window and just go for pure, sincere entertainment. Edgerton, bravely or foolishly, even takes on the icon that is Sir John Falstaff and is triumphant, giving Falstaff the role of glue between king and commoners. His accent wanders and is not historically accurate, but I really didn't care - this was no Russel Crowe as Robin Hood via the Beatles, George Best and Jim Bowen. The performances are, without exception, spot on, but credit goes to Sean Harris as William, Chief Justice (a role inflated greatly from the original) who plays the role with powerful understatement and innate menace, much in the mode of Mark Rylance as Cromwell in Wolfe Hall. It is, dare I say it, almost Oscar-worthy. Also worth noting is Robert Pattinson in his scene-stealing cameo as the Dauphin. He is perfectly accented and suitably cyclothymic in the role and adds a tremendous amount to what could have been a throwaway role. The screenplay did, of course, allow for this, but he really takes it to another level.
I think this is the important lesson to be taken from the film. It is very much a team effort. Nobody hogs the limelight, nobody's ego is on show. The director has presented an ensemble piece that is both intimate and epic. The music provides a sturdy emotional core. The camerawork is as good as it gets. The costumes and production values are given full reign.
I don't like to give films a high score generally because it raises expectations and can lead to an equally strong counter-feeling, but in this case, I will take the risk.
Great film. I think I might buy the Blu-ray when it appears, it's that good."

","The King is without a doubt one of the best written, directed, acted, and produced pieces of medieval film ever made. The cinematography, productions design, music, casting, costume design, and every other part of this production were top notch. David Michod and Joel Edgerton did a extraordinary job writing this story in such a way that it felt like the characters and dialogue were completely believable. David Michod does a superb job directing both the action and dialogue heavy scenes. I will definitely be seeing all his future directorial efforts.
Timothee Chalamet is phenomenal. I haven't been this impressed with an up and coming actor since I first saw Leonardo DiCaprio. I expect to see big things from him in the future. His character arc from a drunken prince that nobody respected to the well respected king of England is believable and satisfying. Joel Edgerton was excellent as Sir John, friend of Prince Hal. He did an excellent job playing the reluctant warrior. Without him saying a word you could tell had seen his share of war, knew the horrors of it all, and still wanted to fight and sacrifice for his King. One of the few female characters in this film is the wonderful Lily-Rose Depp as Catherine of Valois. She is beautiful, strong willed, and perfectly cast in this role. I absolutely hated the Twilight movies, but Robert Pattinson started to change my mind with his performance with The Lost City of Z, and solidified his position as an outstanding actor in my book with his performance, although brief, as the Dauphin of France. Ben Mendelsohn is in the film only briefly as King Henry the 4th, but he is outstanding as always. He is one of those actors that can make a big splash with only a few scenes.
The Battle of Agincourt is the most realistic medieval battle scene I have ever seen put to film. Usually movies show medieval battles as intricate sword fights and well choreographed battle sequences. The King shows battles like they actually were. The battlefield is filthy, the sides start off organized and soon descend into chaos, and with everyone covered in mud it's hard to tell who is your friend and who is your enemy. This film does a great job in this battle scene showing just how tiring it is to actually fight in armor on a wet battlefield with swords, axes, and hammers. During the siege of Stirling it shows a great depiction of the use of Trebuchet's to pound a fortification into submission. I love Trebuchet's and its not that often you get to see them in use.
Do yourself a favor, if you haven't already, and go watch this movie right now!"

The cinematography looks beautiful, some of you might get annoyed by the tint they used, but for me it worked, fits well for a period drama. I had no idea about this story and regardless about how accurate it is or not, I was invested.<br/><br/>It's nothing game of thrones or Vikings but as a film it works fine. The twist which they add at the end that, France never really attacked Hal can be predicted when the assassin just surrenders in the beginning of the movie and tell Hal that he has been sent to kill him. This idea doesn't sell you, But inspite of this suspicion, the movie catches up with Pattinson's character and you kinda forget it for a while and then it's officially revealed at the end that the attack from France never really happened and the ""Good"" king, was corrupted by his own people for their own benefit.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of scenes where the emotions are portrayed with actions over dialogue which I love.

"iquine","9","3","7","21 November 2019"," An Enjoyable Fictitious Account of Henry V's Ascendance to the Throne
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Without researching or dwelling on the facts, as many reviewers have complained about, this story is weighty and engaging. An unwilling prince Henry V is thrust by fate to the throne after his younger brother, designated to reign, is killed in battle. Future King Henry V has vision for peace for England while being pressed to take large swathes of land by force by his father's inner circle; namely all of France for starters. When a peaceful approach fails, the new King prepares for battle. Will the outnumbered English be able to defeat France's mature army? When the dust has settled and the blood finished dripping, who can he trust to forge his early reign? The atmosphere is full of darkly lit scenes also devoid of color; muted when used. The story's tone is portrayed serious and gritty with heavy music painting the mood. The acting, editing and production were high quality. Take the story for what it is and it'll be enjoyable."
"crazogd","8","3","7","20 November 2019"," Masterful Storytelling
","Hal (Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet), disgraced eldest prince of England, whose disdain for the disingenuous nature of politics has rendered the reluctant heir to the English throne. Hal, having turned his back on royal life, choosing instead to live amongst the people in disgrace, as a philandering outcast. Hal is put in the unenviable position of assuming the English crown despite having tried valiantly to protect his undeserving and unprepared brother whom he presumably loved, and who was favored by his tyrannical father, and birthed the crown. When both his brother and father die, England looks to Hal to be crowned King Henry V. He is then required to embrace the life he had endeavored to escape. This film does a brilliant job of showing the many obstacles the young king must confront. From palace politics and internal betrayals, to chaotic inter-kingdom disputes, the young King Henry must confront the feuds his tyrannical father left behind while balancing the needs of his subjects with the emotional strings his past life have left to him. The relationship with his closest friend and mentor, the now alcoholic knight, John Falstaff (Joel Edgerton) conspires to portray this coming-of-age story of a king at the helm of a kingdom on the brink of war, faced with the daunting challenge of making a name for himself, securing peace for his kingdom, all while remaining true to himself and honoring the virtues he understands to be he and his people's only saving grace. This story is masterfully written and acted. It does a wonderful job of leaving the task of deciphering its ethical conundrums and moral underpinnings to the interpretation of the audience. Wonderfully done, all around."

I was born in Shakespeare county close to Stratford, and I am sure never in his wildest dreams could Shakespeare have imagined that cinematic technology would be able to portray history this way and with such plethora of talented actors. In Shakespeare time, the audiences had to use their own imagination to see the battles. This movie is brilliant."
"MovieQween-33622","9","3","7","4 November 2019"," Timothee Chalamet is amazing
","So I'm not sure how historically accurate this movie is but I can say that Timothee Chalamet truly shines. He really grabs your attention and busts out his acting chops in the first half especially. Acting was good all around!! Going to give a shoutout to the amazingly horrid bowl-cut bangs that were featured throughout. Never did I think I would enjoy loathing a hairstyle so much. Robert Pattinsons wig was swoon worthy and I wish he was in the film more. His insultingly theatrical French accent needed more screen time. I had to keep pausing to do dishes, laundry, etc so it felt very long but that was because I had so many distractions probably. Overall, I really liked this film! I love that Netflix is finally giving us higher quality films with top notch acting!! Give us more!"

","As a big budget epic ultimately made for a smaller screen, the lighting balance was bang on - even dark scenes were discernible mid-afternoon in my living room. Additionally, the sound was *excellent*. All dialogue - even the thick accents - was clear and evenly balanced, and I didn't have to adjust the sound wildly to not be deafened by battle scenes or strain to hear TC's Hal's sotto voce tones. The cinematography was great - no pixeated blurring when the camera panned quickly - and the colours looked gorgeous. In short: cinematic production values exceptionally well employed for television viewing. Chalamet & Sean Harris very good. Pattinson hilariously villainous - as intended."

Highly recommend even if kings and knights aren't your thing."
"sagittarius_rising","8","3","7","3 November 2019"," Probably the most realistice depiction of Agincourt
","Just caught this today on Netflix. As an English major, I am well versed in Shakespeare's Henry V and the films by Olivier and Branaugh. As an 'armchair historian', I am familiar with the historical battle of Agincourt, particularly the account by the late John Keegan, a renowned British military historian. The location of the films battlefield resembles the actual site which is important. The problems of the French mounted and knights on foot had with bog conditions and the crush of people is accurate.<br/><br/>The film does borrow from Shakespeare in a couple of inaccuracies for the sake of the story.
1. Henry and Hotspur as contemporaries. Nope Henry Percy, Hotspur, was roughly 15 years older;
2. Single Combat with Hotspur. Nope, the Battle of Shrewsbury was an actual bloody battle where Hotspur died.
3. Falstaff, A beer once brewed in St. Louis but not an actual person<br/><br/>I did like how they tied in the issues of the legitimacy as Henry IV, aka dear old dad had usurped Richard II and was constantly challenged by other nobles."

","The only place I found fault with The King, was the cinematography. For me, it was often too dark, which muted the detail from many a critical scene. Otherwise, The King was a well done and a complete epic drama, one I most assiduously enjoyed."
"con_au","9","3","7","2 November 2019"," Judge it on its own merits
","It's not Henry V and it's not a documentary of the events leading up to the Battle of Agincourt. Judge it on its own merits.
Personally, I liked it a lot. It's dark, it's not a fast burn. The acting and script aren't flamboyant but rather sparse and conservative.
I could have lived without the ye olde pre-battle speech although it did let lead actor Timothee Chalamet off his leash for a second which was nice.
The battle sequences are lumbering and brutal - probably a lot more realistic than a lot of the ballet productions used in many period pieces.
The supporting cast I thought was great. Joel Edgerton is transitioning into an elder statesman-like period and this role is a great start. Robert Pattinson is the only real disappointment in a brief but pivotal role as the Dauphin. His accent and blonde dye-job compete for the worst bits about his performance but the whole thing lacked the chicanery and arrogance I think he was aiming for.
I think Netflix has done a good job. The movie worked great for me at home but it's also cinematic enough to render well on the big screen."

"jmariano99","8","4","11","2 November 2019"," Surprisingly good and quite intelligent
","I liked this movie a lot. Watched it to see how Timothee had done and I ended being quite surprised. It's technically a war movie, but war is of little importance in it, it was only the necessary end that the plot was asking for. But the movie is much more than that: it's about what it means to become a man, to ""come of age"" in its literal sense, to be free, to not let yourself be carried from life any longer and truly start to make decisions, to be conscious (of yourself and of life, of finitude, mortality). It's a ""slow"" movie compared to what we usually have today, but it had to be to say something besides thrilling and drama and plot twists. The director did very well, there's always present the detach of Hal from the others, his (supposed) coming of age, his detach from the life he led: above war and drama, that's what the director was going to: show him detached from the rest, from whatever is in front of him, and not left there lost in the middle of life, and he did that very well. Timothee's put a very good performance: he shows confusion, determination yet still grieve: a mix of expressions that do not fit a king but yet fit very well what he is in the movie.
His dialogue with Lily rose Depp is the moral of the story: after all, he never detached from his old life, he still wasn't free, he was still moved by grief, played by life. And only in the end does he show that he understood what is needed to become a man, to stop being young.
The script is quite good, never too clear, almost always just on point, saying what it needs to be said for the public to understand.
Congratulations Netflix for another good movie."

"knifemagnet","7","2","4","25 December 2019"," Great film but not an accurate depiction of Henry V
","There is a lot of positives regarding this film. The acting, sets, costumes, and locations are superb. It is undoubtedly worth a viewing. However, one should not watch this and feel that they are informed of this period of the Hundred Years' War, as it is historically inaccurate... Which then begs the question, again with these types of films that are based loosely on history; why not simply make a thoroughly fictional film inspired by real events and state as much - though in this case it isn't nearly as historically inaccurate as Mary Queen of Scots was as that film was turned into a modern activist or social statement film based on falsities and fantasy."

I'm ashamed to admit I was a huge Twilight fan (Team Edward) so I was anxious to see Robert Pattinson as the Prince of France and he excelled my expectations. Lily-Rose Depp (Princess of France & Henry's wife) only appeared for a bit at the end but she was noteworthy and I look forward to watching her in the future."

"aguynameddrew","9","2","4","29 November 2019"," Very good movie
","Many reviewers have complained about the historical inaccuracies of this film. That's a legitimate criticism, but i am watching and judging this movie independent of the historical constraints. If you want to see a movie about the details of King Henry V's ascension to the throne of England and the battle of Agincourt, you may be better served by a documentary.<br/><br/>The King is a well written, well directed, well produced, well acted and thoroughly engaging film that i think should be judged on its own merits.<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton co-wrote and also starred as the superbly likable Falstaff. Quite an accomplishment.<br/><br/>The transition of Hal from drunken lech to wise and unflappable King Henry was probably a bit fast, but it hardly detracts from the credibility of the character or the plot line. A testament probably to both the writing and to the strong performance of Timothee Chalamet.<br/><br/>I even found myself liking Robert Pattinson who played the obnoxious Dauphin.<br/><br/>Sean Harris is a unique character actor who rarely disappoints and his portrayal as William is riveting.<br/><br/>The King has a high level of quality violence but not in major quantity and certainly not used in such a way to dominate the entertainment value of the film.<br/><br/>If this ensemble of writers/director/actors/producers decide to collaborate again, i'll be lining up to experience the result."

Unfortunately it could have been put to much better use had the writing been more subtle, maybe the writers could have taken their time to reflect on Shakespeare's writing, who knows, maybe they even did. Henry's drive and ambitions could have been much deeper than merely the maturing of young rebellion.
Without getting into spoilers, Catherine's scene could have been dealt a lot better and given real depth to her, much of what she said could have been acted out instead, as would befit such a conversation, and such a time."

The film highlights how in medieval times power really was portrayed as the key to happiness, and to be a worthy man, you must have power. For me it was fascinating to see the character of Henry V develop and what power and pressure can do to someone. How his original morals were left behind, along with any emotions of fear and grief, otherwise it would defy how men were supposed to be. Sure it ignores historical facts, yet in that it achieves multiple character lines that are much more impactful, giving the film itself real substance and worth. loved it"

","Beautifully shot by the extremely talented cinematographer Adam Arkapaw & with a surprisingly evocative score which literally gave me goosebumps during certain sequences (courtesy of Nicholas Britell), ""The King"" looks & sounds incredibly impressive, additionally boasting numerous effective & understated performances from recognisable household name actors - most notably from lead Timoth√©e Chalamet who is simply magnetic on screen...<br/><br/>But unfortunately, none of this compensates for the noticeable missed opportunities; multiple important events occur off screen & the plot is progressed through verbal exposition instead of visibly depicting the story as it unfolds, immediately breaking the ""show, don't tell"" golden rule of filmmaking. Hence, scenes are disjointed, often misconnected & incoherently constructed; giving a sense as though the feature was condensed & edited mercilessly until what must've been a 4 hour runtime was sliced to 140 minutes.<br/><br/>Dialogue is clunky, verbose & regularly provides the impression rewrites were required in order to perfect & streamline the narrative before shooting; after witnessing ""Boy Erased"", the main culprit for this error would be Joel Edgerton - who is continually proving himself to be unfit for helming the scripting process.<br/><br/>Questionable directorial decisions are made too: for instance, providing a character with a distracting lisp... Tonally, in such a brooding & atmospheric piece, a comical pronunciation felt out of place.<br/><br/>It's a good film... Not remarkable.

","The King (3.5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>The King is a pretty fair historical drama film about King Henry IV of England. About a story when Henry gives his distant son Hal (Timothy Chalamet) the role of being king after his passing. Hal was always a drunk and distant son which Henry preferred his other younger son. Hal trying to correct the conflict that his father has left behind. He receives an insulting message from France. And an assassin sent by the French King. Which Hal prepares for war with the French.<br/><br/>The plot is entertaining and worth watching if you care for historical dramas. Especially the story and setting taking place in the 15th century. The script and direction may be a little too long or prolonged in the second act of the movie. Which made it slow and boring in some parts.<br/><br/>The acting is great with the performances by Timothy Chalamet as Hal. Joel Edgerton playing Falstaff, Hal's best friend and advisor. Sean Harris playing William, Hal's advisor. Ben Mendelsohn as the ill King Henry. And Robert Pattinson playing the Dauphin, the French King's son. Pattinson's performance as a French prince with the accent was something different.<br/><br/>The direction of the historical drama is worth watching. The story behind King Henry's son Hal and his rise to ruling England and making it a peaceful place was good. There will be some slow parts which the film could have used some editing some scenes to help with the pace.<br/><br/>The battle sequence is decent. It was a bit confusing with the chaotic battle with both armies crowding in. Making the characters feel claustrophobic and buried underneath the bodies.<br/><br/>Overall, The King is a pretty fair film. The plot is good. The performances are great. And the direction is decent. The film suffers from weak pacing and prolonged scenes but it delivered telling this epic tale of these characters."

","Why do film makers insist on mangling history? This film, whilst reasonable to watch if a good 30 minutes too long, has about as about as much to do with the historical facts as does a Harry Potter book! There are so many inaccuracies it would take too long to list them all but just a few are:-<br/><br/>There was no such man as Falstaff - Harry Hotspur and Henry did not fight each other, by the way whatever happened to the actual Battle of Shrewsbury? - Henry IV was on the battlefield at Shrewsbury and nominally in charge, not Henry's brother Thomas - Thomas died in France, not Wales - The field of Agincourt is nothing like to one shown, go have a look if you want to, it's well signposted - Henry ordered the killing of the prisoners after the battle not before it - The Dauphin died of dysentery months after the battle, not on the day - I could go on all day!<br/><br/>The real history is exciting enough without the fanciful imaginings of the writer/director getting in the way and remember, a lot of gullible people will watch this film and think it is all true."

","The King is one of my favourite films from last year and I love this movie. The score is fantastic. I like the theme behind this film as well which is be careful who you surround yourself with and in this case, King Henry became like his father, he didn't intend to be like him but due to personal agendas and glory from members in his court, he was deceived into being a reflection of his father. The dialogue was superb and it's beautifully shot. Can't recommend it enough."

"DeBBss","6","0","0","10 May 2020"," Good, but Forgettable
","The King is another middle age war story, that's impressing visually, but offers nothing new to the table. These types of movies that Netflix are producing are becoming a lot more common, but Netflix is doing nothing to make them stand out. The King and Outlaw King have different plots, but both feel the same to me. They're alright when it comes to the screenplay, and they both have amazing visuals and war scenes; I've already forgotten most of Outlaw King, and since The King is so similar, I think this movie is just going to slip out of my memory in about a year.<br/><br/>The screenplay is a major factor as to why this movie is so forgettable; there's nothing to talk about, it's simply plain. They should've put more into it and make it more unique, even if it makes The King not true to history. The way the characters were written felt really lazy. Why does Hal hate war so much and try to avoid it? Why does Hal not want to be king even though he doesn't want his father in charge? What battle did Falstaff take part in and why is he in such a good friendship with Hal? It's like all the characters were written to feel or be something but without reason. The screenplay in general is lazy, and the runtime is over two hours, I think they could've put in a lot more to improve the characters.<br/><br/>The acting was great, but the way Timoth√©e Chalamet acted Hal felt cold and emotionless most of the time. Timoth√©e Chalamet probably had to act Hal in that way, but it does the character no justice. If Hal was acted more in a compassionate human way, then I might've cared if Hal would die or not. In fact, since all the characters are so one dimensional, if they all died, I would wouldn't care at all.<br/><br/>The best part are the visuals, battles, and music, which is what holds up The King from getting a rating that is lower than a five. The visuals is what you'd expect from a Netflix film; it has stunning cinematography and excellent filming locations. The action is realistic and I like how they mention the fact that fighting in full knight armor is going to tire you out quickly. The music is my favorite part; it's sad and droopy which adds to the entire mood of the film.<br/><br/>The King is pretty much standard in the genre and it's not going to be memorable in the years to come. The acting and aesthetics can only go so far when the screenplay adds no context to any of the characters. The King is not a bad movie, but it's not a necessary watch, just watch it without any high expectations."
"CinePete","7","7","25","21 October 2019"," No Majesty, No Chivalry
","It is totally opposite to its predecessors, the Olivier and Branagh versions of Shakespeare's Henry V. In The King, there is no majesty or nobility, neither in kingship nor in war. Collaborators Joel Edgerton and David Michod give their film strong anti-war and anti-monarchy sentiments, re-imagining the literary tradition in an unflattering way.<br/><br/>The pace is slow and the decor stark, drained of colour and vitality, without any pretense to rousing historical spectacle. Most of what occurs seems little more than drudgery -- the drudgery of office, of diplomacy, of battle. Even in speech, long pauses between lines make it seem that even to articulate a thought requires effort, and talk is a kind of drudgery in itself.<br/><br/>The odd, deliberate miscasting of Timothee Chalamet gives the soldier-king a
rather startling effect. He isn't given many dramatic high points, but we still keep watching Timothee's pallid Henry in his various predicaments. He is enigmatic, even compelling sometimes, a misplaced boy-king stumbling through history.<br/><br/>The King has a cold, Nordic look, maybe like a Carl Dreyer film. We expect Falstaff (Joel Edgerton) to enliven the general spirit, but the famous buffoon here is merely a dry advisor to the king. Any lightening of mood comes from Robert Pattinson as a clumsy, loony Dauphin of France, and Lily-Rose Depp as the insightful and superior Princess Catharine.<br/><br/>The Battle of Agincourt itself is a superb mud-bowl, with armoured knights clashing blindly at one another, filmed in sharp lines and grey tones like a medieval etching.<br/><br/>In its own fashion, The King is engrossing, maybe even once in a while a bit exciting. If the film's intent is to depict a cheerless, unheroic age, it does so well enough. As a dark meditation on royalty and militarism the film more or less succeeds on its own terms."

","If you want a great, entertaining movie, watch The King. It may be inaccurate, however, it is a film, and an absolutely amazing one, at that. Though littered with inaccuracies, the film is nothing short of a landmark in showing realistic battle from the 15th century. In my opinion, people need to stop rating something this well made, so low just because they have a personal vendetta against historical inaccuracies. Most movies would be boring, if not made different than the actual story. It keeps us captivated. Then after, if you are interested in the history, go and read for yourself, but until then, shut up and enjoy a very VERY well made film about the battle of Agincourt."

On the other hand, Netflix is making Oscar worthy contenders such as Marriage Stories, Irishman and The King. And the general movie industry are treating them unfairly due to lack of screen time in theaters. That's the definition of discrimination.
Back to the movie, I'm only a regular movie fan so I'm not qualified enough to claim this's a Oscar worthy or not but the story line is solid with memorable twist. The acting from Timothy is fantastic and he deserves at least a nomination for the role. He has been completely transformed from a dreamy, good looking type cast to a deeply thoughful and troubled man. I believe such transformation of acting requires dedication and research."

I recommend you watch this movie twice, because you might not be able to absorb its beauty in the first watch. Second time you will see how genious is Timoth√©e Chalamet as Henry V.

I generally know the material fairly well, and I love historical dramas like this, but everything about it was so dull and leaden, and nearly all of it missed the mark, that you'll need to be a major Timoth√©e Chalamet fan to sit through it. Robert Pattinson's French accent is ridiculous, and he's on screen for maybe five minutes, but Joel Edgerton, who co-wrote the film, is great as always.

"Holt344","10","2","5","3 November 2019"," The epic and magnificent production, visually stunning and a masterpiece
","This will probably be the best costume drama of the year as it has the atmosphere, costumes and the sets that makes a great medieval movie. It's so believable, just visually stunning to experience and look at. It's also one of the most realistic medieval movies I've seen, the fight choreography was just brutal and real which made me sit on the edge of my seat as it was unpredictable and not the regular sword fights, it was something special. What also made it realistic was the musical score as it wasn't really any music at all but when there were music, it was really epic and powerful. Another thing which I noticed was the natural lighting that was used. Some people may find that a negative thing, see the Game of Thrones episode but it works here as it is a historical medieval drama, where there only were these kind lightning so what we see in front of us is natural lightning and a lot of darkness which also goes for the dark nature of the film. Costumes, props and the sets were some of the best things of the movie, for example just seeing the historical accurate armor that the actors wore was just an amazing feeling as it was one of those childhood fantasies and it is justified in how it's portrayed, clumsy but effective. The battle we get to experience is something I was expecting after watching through the movie, true mayhem of nothing other than blood and death, that whole sequence was just magnificent. How the last sequence of the battle was shot in one take made it so much better and realistic, superb choreography.<br/><br/>David Mich√¥d did it again with his dark visual story telling with his spectacular directing and crew behind him, the cinematography is just stunning, wow. The script is great, a lot of dialogue which makes it really slow paced but it works if you take the time to see the artistic cinematography behind it all. I believe you have to re-watch the movie to get all the details as there's so much detail in each scene, just the wide shots are just incredible. The script which is written by David Mich√¥d and Joel Edgerton who also stars and produced the movie. I only have positive things to say about the script but the dialogue could have been more Medieval and what I mean is the profanity in it, other than that nothing else. This story is nothing that I have never seen before, it's amazing and sorts of breaks the old Hollywood way of making medieval movies. It's a beautiful thing.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast all does a great job, an excellent job at that but there is a couple of them that stands out. Timoth√©e Chalamet plays the title character, King Henry V. His performance is so strong that I would be rooting for a Oscar nomination, it was superb as I found it as great acting but also doing the character justice of the real life counterpart and Shakespeare proud. Joel Edgerton is the other actor I want to praise, I got this feeling that his character wasn't needed in the beginning but I was wrong as his character and performance makes the movie, the inspiration and help he gives to Henry V and the chemistry Joel and Timoth√©e has is amazing. To the third and final actor I want to write about, Robert Pattinson. It was a really good performance but the thing everyone have talked about is his accent and it's bad but I think I know it is bad, through dialogue and character sake. The character dislikes England and mocks them with speaking with such bad English, it can be that? Who knows, it was laughable either way. Otherwise a good performance! This was seriously a really good movie, an epic one at that and one that is far from others in one way. Perhaps one of the best historical medieval movies I've seen. A coming of age story of Henrik V from his father's death to his adventure in France, a story worth told and executed perfectly."
"thekingsdom","6","2","5","4 November 2019"," Good.. but they made a lot of it up!
","I originally had this down as a 7/10 film..and then I did some research. Bad move! Turns out old Henry wasn't a pacifist at all. He was a 'hack em all down' type of guy. Also, a lot of the one to one fights never happened in real life and Sir John Falstaff is a fictional character who is mentioned in four plays by William Shakespeare. Ok! So, basically, they made most of it up! Anyway, that said, it's an enjoyable film. It's written well, acted and directed well. The film held my attention and drew me into the story. 6.5/10"

","I knew nothing about the film more than some noise during his run through festivals, so I decided to watch it and it was a marvelous surprise. I know it's not really historical accurate, but I don't mind, because it gives you a wonderful story that's really rounded from start to finish.<br/><br/>Everything is superb in the movie, Story, Direction, Photography, Acting, Music...and I just want to point that this kind of acting is something not usual on this kind of movies, I guess that's why some people is giving bad reviews. But if you enjoy the cinema outside hollywood, that's not fast paced and tries to go deep inside the being while the story is driven by the actor, this is your kind of movie.<br/><br/>If you expect an action movie with a lot of fake fights with FX this is not what you'll find here. How the actors and director creates tension on every fight is worth some study, they are slow and clunky but they really work.<br/><br/>About the acting,they try to give a lot of weight and substance using silence at their favour, all of them act this way except Robert Pattison that plays the opposite, being gross with a funny accent that helps to give some contrast in the movie. I really don't get why people is doing memes about this, when is totally intended and well executed.<br/><br/>More than that, and without wanting to do spoilers, the way Henry goes from start and how it close the story at the end is super nice to me, he though life was easy but we all know it's not.<br/><br/>Have fun watching it :)"
"jadepietro","7","2","5","3 November 2019"," Slow but Rewarding Retelling of Henry V Legend
","GRADE: B-<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A powerful battle scene and Timoth√©e Chalamet's fine performance does not an epic make.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: It isn't easy being king, especially if you don't want the job. But duty calls, and Henry, Prince of Wales, or Hal to his friends, must fulfill his destiny in David Mich√¥d's historical drama, The King. The film is given the royal treatment with good production design, panoramic vistas, and lavish period costumes, with special mention to Nicholas Britell's elegant music score which elevates the film's pedigree to nearly epic stature. Yet, despite all of the filmmakers' noble quest for accuracy, the final result is a bit of a prodding melodrama lacking a strong narrative, compelling characters, and any real excitement.<br/><br/>Timoth√©e Chalamet has the title role as the unlikely king and this young and talented actor adds another thoughtful and convincing portrayal to his fine repertoire. As his loyal friend and mentor Falstaff, Joel Edgerton plays his character with no humor and a far too serious edginess but Sean Harris has some nice moments as the scheming William Gascoigne. Robert Pattinson is Hal's chief nemesis, the Dauphin of France, and he entertains in his few scenes, but his borderline campy buffoonish interpretation and thick French accent just does not gel with the serious trappings and undercuts the conflict and the character's needed menacing nature.<br/><br/>Still, Mr. Mich√¥d directs with authority and he crafts his film with much flourish. But his screenplay, coauthored by Mr. Edgerton, gets bogged down in too much historical details, politics, and court intrigue while failing to establish well-drawn characters and interesting dialog. Everyone talks in dry expositional conversations with no genuine emotional heft. Everyone pouts and stares. Everyone broods excessively. But then, is anyone ever happy in the 15th century?<br/><br/>As the battle lines are drawn between King Henry V of England and King Charles IV of France, the film starts to build some interest, especially in its very well-staged mud-soaked action sequence of The Battle of Agincourt, but this overall thrilling effect comes a little too late.(And let's face it, Mr. Chalamet's rousing pep-talk on the battlefield, sans Shakespeare's prose, pales by comparison.)<br/><br/>The King strives for greatness but settles for conventional storytelling with just a tinge of mediocrity."

","This is a bit of a tough one. Part of me wishes to sing this movies' praises as a gripping tale, well told. It certainly is that. That said, the movie is completely a-historical. This just isn't, at all, how these events went down. It makes me wonder how we would judge a movie that simply, in a straightforward manner, portrayed WWI with Germans winning. That would be kind of weird... right?! As such I'm going to give it a compromise 7. As a more overt piece of historical fiction, I would give a 9 or 10. But given this drapes itself in a historical gloss, I'm subtracting points.<br/><br/>Now I get those reviewers who will reply that this movie does not bill itself as a documentary... but historical quibbles aren't the issue here. This movie just makes stuff wholesale. You might as well call the king Jason the V, or Fred the V... I could say more, but you have probably gathered my point by now, this movie really pushes the boundaries of narrative ""liberties"" in the service of relating a historical event a bit too far, I felt."

"sarabuller","4","2","6","31 December 2019"," Great romanticized drama with too little historical fact
","This film is gorgeously filmed, gritty, and haunting as DRAMA. Unfortunately, it suffers much of the same historical inaccuracies that plague many recent films of its genre.
Much has already been said about the goofs in the staging of the battle at Agincourt, and I won't bother to reiterate those.
What I find much worse is the casting and characterization of both King Henrys, and Catherine of Valois. Thimoth√©e Chalomet gives a wonderful turn as Henry V- as he would have been at least 7-10 years BEFORE Agincourt. At the time of the battle, Henry V was 24 - NOT a boy, especially in those times. But issues with Catherine are worse. She was 15 YEARS younger than Henry, and casting and characterizing her as his contemporary is a ludicrous as the casting of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII in ""The Tudors"" - but that's a separate gripe. And Catherine of Valois was a royal princess trained from birth to prepare for and accept her role in the Royal Marriage Game. No matter how she felt about her husband, she would NEVER have spoken to him as was depicted in The King, ESPECIALLY given the difference in their REAL ages. A) she would have known better and b) he would not have tolerated such words from her. Henry V was notorious for his insensitivity and intolerance for criticism. All the contextual errors means that that final, touching scene where Catherine and Henry ""get each other"" is probably even MORE inaccurate than the omission of the stakes in the ground that protected the archers in the REAL battle of Agincourt. Oh, and Ben Mendelsohn is tragically wasted as Henry IV. Mendelsohn is fine talent, but his mumbling and lurking beneath filthy hair do no justice to either the role or the actor."

"gpcheng87","6","2","6","18 November 2019"," Condensed soup, ""inspired period-piece family melodrama"" flavor. Enjoy!
","As many reviews have already noted, this film takes liberties to historical accuracy like a knife to butter. A hot knife through room temperature butter. (i.e. Thomas was never considered as an heir in lieu of Henry, both boys were experienced soldiers by their late teens, and Henry's ""party boy"" years were a literary flourish by William Shakespeare - historical documents show he was consistently involved in war and politics since youth. He was also not one to shy away from war and his marriage to Catherine of Valois was considered/negotiated when they were very young, in part to give him legitimacy/acknowledge his right to the French throne. He was also 6' 3"", but perhaps that's nitpicking. Battles were also inaccurate: Hotspur was actually 23 years older than Henry, who was only 16 when Hotspur was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury at the age of 39; the one-on-one battle never happened, being yet another invention of Shakespeare's. Finally, the Dauphin, Louis, Duke of Guyenne, was not present at the Battle of Agincourt.)<br/><br/>So, we'll continue as if this was a period/historical drama inspired by real people (except the fictional Falstaff) and real... er... general events. Again, said by other reviewers, this movie had so much potential but for some reason was forced into a 2hr + film format; a damn shame considering it was on the perfect platform for any other alternative. Characters were underdeveloped to the point that I didn't care about them. Henry's sister, Queen Phillippa of Denmark and Princess Catherine of Valois, his future wife, each had only one scene of dialogue; the bar hostess had more screen time/character development than two of the most important/influential women in the film. It's not just the ladies - Henry's father, who he did have a difficult relationship with, was not given enough opportunity to show their troubled relationship, making the deathbed scene was unmoving. Henry's cousin, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, who he says was ""like an older brother"" to him, is beheaded after telling Gascoigne he accepted a surprise meeting with a French agent... and I kind of didn't feel anything. All these characters needed much more screen time for us to feel like they mattered, for us to be invested, and for us to relate/sympathize with Henry after their betrayal. It should have been easy... in real life/actual history, he and Sir Thomas Grey were executed for an actual conspiracy again Henry, known as the Southampton Plot. There was also a third guy - but let's not bite off more than we can chew. The only character I felt for was Falstaff... the only fictional character in the movie. I know I echo the sentiments of other reviewers, here and other places on the 'net, but this should have been a mini-series. If it were structured/presented in ""acts"" (each titled ambiguously like ""The Rise"", ""The Plot"", ""The Betrayal""...or something) then it would hint/hearken to Shakespeare and all these historical inaccuracies would/could be ignored/explained. Finally, I had a problem with the accents - something I feel would have been fixed with a miniseries, considering the caliber/abilites of the cast. Pattinson and Chalamet slip up noticeably several times, to the point where it interrupted my viewing. Pattinson might have had an easier time, considering that with Chalamet, it was not only pronunciation, but also cadence - he pauses/takes breaths/speeds through parts of sentences in the way American speakers do. It was most apparent in his private conversation scene with Lily-Rose Depp (who did a lovely job, by the way) near the end of the movie; several entire sentences are delivered in an American accent; it also doesn't help that he's the only American in the main cast and Chapman, who plays his younger brother Thomas, is actually British. In any case, I think both actors would have been fully able to deliver more convincing accents if given more time, i.e. a mini-series.<br/><br/>All in all, the acting was great, the script felt natural and unforced, the cinematography and speed reminded me a bit of Macbeth (2015) and The Lost City of Z (2016), both of which I enjoyed. Not a waste of time, but not as good as I had hoped/as advertised - definitely a missed opportunity."

Any little scoundrel can teach you that, even when they aren't called Kant.<br/><br/>The story is an honest portrayal of the infidelities of the mind of those in power, sometimes led astray by those that seek power but not more than advantageous position. The King meant to break with the former King, his father's ways and seek peace. The King meant to leave the people be. The King meant for the people to enjoy the spoils of life and was no stranger to them himself.<br/><br/>Why fight even though there's plenty of room to live? Why fight taking your people to war lest they suffer famine they hadn't suffered, had you not taken them to war?

"chiaragiacobelli","7","1","2","14 December 2019"," An interesting movie about the youthness of King Henry V
","""The king"" is a good movie about the youthness of Henry V, especially the period just before he became king and the first war against France. It is interesting to follow the change of his personality after having inherited the crown, due to power, fear, responsability, enemies and the difficulty to trust in someone.
It is also an important moment in the history of England, although unfortunately Henry V is not much told by movies or books. One more reason to appreciate this work."
"The-Sarkologist","8","1","2","2 December 2019"," Agincourt
","This turned out to be a pretty impressive movie, but then again, any film about Henry V that happens to have Falstaff in it is going to grab my attention. However, I should point out that this is only based on Shakespeare, this is not a rendition of any of the Shakesperian plays that centre around Henry V. The first thing is that Falstaff, at least in Shakespeare, doesn't go to France with Henry, and secondly the language in this film is somewhat more modern that what one generally gets with Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The main focus of the film is the events that lead up to the battle of Agincourt, though at the beginning we are introduced to Hal as being the hard drinking, carousing, prince that we all know him as from the Henry IV plays. However, Falstaff, while being his good friend, is actually much more level headed, and much less of a buffoon in this film. In fact, as I mentioned, he travels with Henry over to France, as his personal advisor, much to the disdain of many in the court.<br/><br/>There is a lot of political maneuvering in this film, particularly with Henry IV initially disinheriting Hal, but later being forced to accept him as king due to the death of his other son (and his other son basically died due to stupidity). However, a lot of the focus is the preparation, and the invasion, of France. As I mentioned, there is a lot of political maneauverings here, and it appears that the French are actually attempting to goad Henry into action, though it turns out that there is a lot more going on behind the scenes.<br/><br/>One interesting thing in the film is how the battle of Agincourt played out. Look, I'm not entirely sure if the battle was actually filmed at Agincourt, because it certainly didn't look like it, but then again much of where the battle was fought has been turned into fields. Yet, in part it didn't seem like it went on for too long, and it certainly didn't feel as if there was a huge number of soldiers participating either. Personally, maybe that had something to do with budget constraints. Yet, the thing about the muddy ground, and the English using that to their advantage, certainly does add to the realism.<br/><br/>Yeah, this turned out to be pretty cool film, and there was a lot of realism about it as well. It is certainly worth checking out."
"fredagsedb","6","1","2","27 November 2019"," Solid, but don't call it biography IMBD
","A story with strong points about things like leadership, who a leader can trust and family relations, where a lot turns on the line ""uneasy lies the head that wears the crown"".<br/><br/>Some points are heavy-handed and somewhat clich√©ed, where the longs cuts and overdramatized, long looks of the actors don't help, while others are handled with more depth.<br/><br/>However, it has very little to do with biography, when you compare it to the historical knowledge we have of Henry V, his personality and the unfolding of the events it covers.<br/><br/>They have told their own story drawing on a well-known historical figure and famous plays, which is fine, but biography is a mislabel."
"PyroSikTh","7","1","2","14 November 2019"," Slow and Inaccurate, but Solid Nonetheless
","The King follows Henry V from his drunken antics as a prince through to his first victory in France. Of course first thing's first with this kind of movie; it's exactly that, a movie. This is not a documentary. It's a piece of thrilling entertainment based just as much on Shakespeare's play than it is on actual historical records. To treat it as anything other than that would simply be unfair to the film's intent. There's a lot in here that isn't accurate, such as the plot behind the scenes, or the strategies used at the Battle of Agincourt. But on the flipside there's a lot here that does feel authentic, and I feel like it struck the right balance between fictional entertainment and brutal realism.<br/><br/>The movie can feel slow at times, as long stretches of time can go by without anything bombastic happening. The first hour of the movie follows Henry as a prince, resisting the crown and seeking solace in his own brand of peace, before being thrust into leadership after a dying father. While slow, I didn't mind this section much because it took the time to really establish Henry's character and his borderline pacifist nature. It gave him trauma and motivation in an abusive father, and laid the stage for the French campaign. It's not until halfway into the movie that the French campaign even begins, and even then it's a slow start thanks to a castle siege depicted as slow and uneventful as a castle siege would really be. It all culminates in the Battle of Agincourt and the French surrender, leaving ten to fifteen minutes for a coda at the end, complete with story-defining plot twist. Pacing is not this movie's strongest suit, that's for sure, but for me it never dragged and kept my attention throughout.<br/><br/>Arguably The King's most visceral aspect would be its battles and fights. While the Battle of Agincourt lacks the historical accuracy of the strategies utilised, it worked because the focus was put on the press in the muddy field, complete with claustrophobia and brutal, ugly brawling. In many ways it felt reminiscent of the Battle of the Bastards in Game of Thrones, which is certainly no complaint. When charged by a vanguard of cavalry, the hero of the battle doesn't casually step aside and carve the horse in half, dismounting its rider. Instead the horse crashes into the line and the hero is catapulted off his feet into the line of men behind him. Similarly Henry's challenge early on starts out like knights in shining armour, but a sword fight quickly becomes a wrestling brawl on the ground, clanking armour plates, and exhausted breathing from both parties. Even the siege in its uneventful presentation still felt surprisingly visceral as three trebuchets launch flaming projectiles into the castle day and night, and the looming threat of hunger and disease is never forgotten.<br/><br/>Another aspect in The King's favour lies in its pure acting talent. I didn't always dig it as sometimes it felt like certain actors were taking the film too seriously, begging for awards with gravely whispers erupting into dominating shouts, but that's honestly not much of a criticism. Hey actors, how dare you take your craft seriously and put out great performances! Timoth√©e Chalamet was the worst offender for this, but he pulls off the role of Henry V so well, balancing the tender desire for peace with the anger and authority required to be a strong leader. His portrayal was definitely full of layers worthy of dissection. Ben Mendelsohn chewed up his small runtime the only way he can, Sean Harris played the advisor William with as much ingenuity as required, Joel Edgerton was the perfect best friend, tired soldier, and wise mentor. And then there's Robert Pattinson who took his role as The Dauphin as seriously as was necessary and had fun sinking into the role of a slimey, privileged villain. His French accent was not authentic at all, but deliberately so, mocking Henry and the English and insulting their language.<br/><br/>The third big plus for The King comes from Nicholas Britell's domineering score as it sweeps high and low and keeps the plodding pace of the movie moving ever forward. It embraces the medieval setting with authentic-sounding instrumentation and composition, while also maintaining a brooding string section throughout. It is equal parts melancholic and bombastic, changing as required without losing its uniform tonal quality that brings the whole film together. Similarly Adam Arkapaw's cinematography once again proves he deserves to be up there with Deakins and Hoytema. Every shot is oozing with artistic merit worthy of being framed, and the Battle of Agincourt wouldn't have been nearly as spectacular to watch without his eye behind it. For me his most successful shots lie in the more subdued and tender moments, framing a solder against a sunset, or the montage of trebuchets in the siege, or the decidedly muted colour pallet in the royal courts.<br/><br/>The King has some big problems, mostly in pacing, historical accuracy, and mumbling line delivery, but when it does something right, it goes the extra mile. Chalamet is great as Henry V, offering us an interesting character to follow and sink our teeth into, the battles and action scenes feel true to realism despite how inaccurate they might be, focussing on both the thrill and monotony of war and not hiding from the brutality of either, and in almost all technical regardless I don't have a single complaint. I give The King a good 7/10, pushing up the higher end to an 8, but not quite topping the crest.<br/><br/>https://qyrosmovies.blogspot.com/"

I tried to watch another film by Michod, the Rover, a year ago and couldn't finish it either. Both that film and this one are technically well executed, the dialogue is grounded, there are no obvious and irritating plot holes and yet I at least can never connect with any of his protagonists. This is strange because Guy Pearce in the Rover is quite sympathetic, so it's not whats on the paper but the execution of it that fails.<br/><br/>It takes guts to rewrite a period in history that has already been covered by Shakespeare, and it can be done successfully but I don't think it's been done well here.

A role that makes you want to second guess him as a leader and then want to follow him into battle. Something that is truly hard to convey. The supporting cast is just as impressive...every character is believable.<br/><br/>There are some beautiful shots in The King. Stand out battle scenes that are breath taking and desperate.

"CabbageCustard","6","2","7","14 November 2019"," Slow moving historical drama
","If you're a history buff with an interest in seeing real life events dramatised on the screen then this film is for you. If you're looking for something with lots of action and excitement then you should look elsewhere. This movie tells the story of King Henry V of England's rise to the throne and his war with the French and decisive and important victory at Agincourt. The thing, of course, is that while the story is broadly based on actual events, it does not stick to the facts. Instead, it embellishes, changes and sometimes omits what actually happened in the interests of making a good movie. If you're wanting a history lesson this isn't it. There is no question that this movie is brilliantly acted and executed, but it is pretty slow going for the most part and takes a while to actually get interesting. I resisted the impulse to abandon it early on and by the time the battle scene came around I was glad I persevered. In the end though, I was left feeling pretty unmoved by it all and doubt I'd be bothered watching it again."

Yet his death scene was very lacklustre and i felt all this built up through the film was for nothing!<br/><br/>Sean Harris as always excels playing Chief Justice William Gascoigne - theres a scene near the end that had me soo gripped just by how he completely embraced this character and went toe to toe with Chalamet.<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton as Falstaff brings a much needed breath of fresh air into The King and for me is one of the biggest stand outs from the beginning.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are directed brilliantly and gets you right in to the action - which at times is quite brutal but the cinematography adds a new dynamic that feels more rich and exuberant.<br/><br/>The end battle in particular did give me Game of Thrones vibes which i also quite liked.<br/><br/>Overall there are alot of peaks in The King which kept me gripped, however there are other movies in this genre i have watched over the years that i feel are better developed."

","A stereotypical prince whose interest is about war.. It is easy to predict he will be dead even if you don't know the history.<br/><br/>I am not much a reviewer on the view of ""hystorical accuracy"". If the movie's itself have a really good concept of its own history and convince the viewers on this frame then i don't obsess to historical accuracy but this movie could not convince the viewers on this frame.<br/><br/>Even all soldiers wear a kind of plate armor, which is not real. There is a difference between a soldier and a knight.<br/><br/>I don't know that but when i read somethin it says that Dauphin, the French hair did not kill children in the forest.<br/><br/>One of the most important scene is battle of Agincourt and it is really disappointing. The tactics in the battle are really terrible. You can win this war with this tactics if your enemy is dumb. There was no crossbow archers in French army. There can not be so many plate shiny armors in a battle. One of the main mistakes is not usage of tabards in the battle. You are shooting a battle scene but most of the soldiers did not wear any tabard therefore it is almost impossible to know who is friend who is enemy.<br/><br/>Apart from historical accuracy, there is no good cinematography. Could not find any dark and epic atmosphere so the movie could not convince the viewer.
They are shooting a movie, with no gesture no mimics of the 15th century. It is almost like they put together cast and said lets shoot a battle scene. No good performances, no good character development...<br/><br/>Most importantly, it must be a joke that the ratings of Alexander, King Arthur or Kingdom of Heaven is lower than this garbage."

But at least this movie was without disgusting CGI effect, explosions, crazy soundtrack, stupid over-the-top makeup. The tempo was extremely slow, but the dialog was still quite intelligent enough. Acting of all the actors was pretty good, they were just enslaved by a very slow script with very uninspiring conversation among the characters. The head chopping scene in early British style punishment looked quite shockingly real. If it's in 3-D, the head might rolling out of the screen and ended up on your lap.<br/><br/>All in all, it's watchable, not great, not even would move you emotionally. Forget about what some of the reviewers' accusations about not matching the exact historical facts. Give it a rest, will you? This a dramatized movie adapted and roughly used some history as the background. You don't have to check your history textbook moment by moment, scene by scene, to see if it's correct. If you're so split-hair stubborn, try to find some BBC documentary stuff to satisfy you.

","This film starts out well by depicting Hal and Thomas, the sons of Henry IV Lancaster, and how Hal assumes the throne. The first third is fine. However. The supposed machinations to get Henry V to go to war in France are so wildly off the mark as to ruin the movie. Much of the Battle of Agincourt itself was depicted accurately. But the Dauphin was not present, and he did not challenge Henry to single combat. The King did not personally surrender to Henry either. There was no assassination attempt on Henry historically, and both the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Chief Justice were loyal and favorites of Henrym unlike in the movie. Oh, and in the royal Court bishops do not wear mitres- that's only in church services."

"gsmudger-13470","3","1","3","17 April 2020"," Mud and armour can't hide a lame screenplay
","This movie thoroughly traduces history, but so it goes. Historical fiction is first and foremost fiction, with history as selective window-dressing. This film fails because the clunky, tone-deaf screenplay makes so little sense - with or without a little prior knowledge of the history - that no amount of mud-streaked plate-armour or moody candle-light could make it less grating.<br/><br/>The film ignores the fact that England and France had been at war since the mid-14th century, and that Henry V came to the throne as an experienced, enthusiastic and cunning warrior-king with a keen sense of entitlement to French real estate. Yet what really grates with this script is the grossly simplified picture of Henry we're given. The writers plainly boiled everything down to a simple idea: a pouting teenage wastrel has responsibility thrust upon him, eventually steps up to the mark when his innate nobility is stoked and is so guileless that he is dragged into war by scheming grown-ups.<br/><br/>I fear that the expensive pretence of historical accuracy blinded viewers and producers alike to the fact that the story is so crass and simplistic, and the characters so one-dimensional, that it wouldn't make the cut for an average soap opera.<br/><br/>On a positive note, I can now see why Timoth√©e Chalamet was cast as Paul Atreides in Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Dune. He can bring grit and majesty."

"sddavis63","5","1","3","7 December 2019"," Well Put Together But Full Of Historical Inaccuracies
","As the movie opens, young Prince Hal (Timoth√©e Chalamet) - the first son of King Henry IV of England - has left behind royal life and adopted his infamous ""wayward"" life. But soon thereafter his father's illness and eventual death brings him back to the court and ultimately puts him on the throne as King Henry V, immediately plunged into the complicated politics of the 15th century English court, with a desire to set right some of his father's wrongs, to establish the legitimacy of his reign and to achieve some of what his father had been unable to achieve - primarily to successfully claim the throne of France.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie is well done technically. The sets and costumes give an authetic 15th century atmosphere, and the climactic Battle of Agincourt, in which the English (led by young Henry, by now King) defeated a much larger French army, is extremely well choreographed and it does accurately depict the use of the English longbow, which was in fact a much superior weapon to the cross bow used by the French, the use of which played a key role in the real Battle of Agincourt.) Having said that, the movie is also riddled with historical inaccuracies that are too numerous to recount here. Rather than being based on the historical record, ""The King"" is largely based on the relevant plays of William Shakespeare, which produces one of the greatest (because it was so central to the story) of the historical inaccuracies - the front and centre presence of Sir John Falstaff - who never existed, but was a fictional chartacter created by The Bard. So, if you're looking for a history lesson, you won't find it here except perhaps in very broad brushstrokes. Nor will you find a recounting of Shakespeare. This is more of a mish mash of some of Shakespeare's work, combined with a bit of history and a lot of historical licence.<br/><br/>It's a tough slog at times to get through. I found it far too long at almost two and a half hours and there were times when it felt as though I could have skipped lengthy parts of this and not really missed very much of consequence. However the performances were good, and while I think it's a bit over-rated, I certainly wouldn't call this a bad movie, especially for those with an interest in the medieval era. (5/10)"

","I just want to outburst my honest review about this film, The King. I wanted to share this because of how good the movie was from every inch of it as I'm suffocated to its story and script. This was the first movie I watched Timoth√É¬©e Chalamet having a role that is mature but still have the heart to it as Hal, King Henry V of England. It was pretty epic, I am so engaged on how it is put together and end up becoming a masterpiece. And now, I believe that 'A King has no friends.' It is challenging to accept the fact that most of the good people comes from those who are forced or love to do stupid things to fullfill their needs and leisure. But this film, earned my respect on how to treasure the person you truly know from the beginning as they tell you the truth of yourself like being honest that it could hurt you in a good way leaving you knowing who you can trust. Robert Pattinson was so outrageously fun on this, like in his line as I remember 'Speak English, I enjoy speaking English' as he fought the King of England with his childish words knowing that he deserve to be a King's alliance to his father in France who he, indeed laughing in return of not knowing what the future is up for his blonde son. It was hands down, one of the movies I find long for a war era type of film but the substance is pure. Like it lingers on your thoughts knowing every person around you might question those you can trust in peace and by words. I will never forget how Hal offer The Dauphin of France a request for a battle but refuses him by shedding blood on an open field making me sad for what awaits on Sir John's fate. I felt the words of Hal returning to his men with anger and despair as he kneel to the dead body of his friend showing desperation of making decisions which made him a King of truth by the end. Such a film with great performances, I just loved it. *****"

"samyoung-82648","8","1","3","2 November 2019"," Highly Recommended (and is ""woke free"")
","The reviews I read so far fall into two categories. Firstly, it's not historically accurate. Secondly, it's a superb story.<br/><br/>Firstly, Shakespeare often took liberty with the truth (eg. Macbeth). This story does nothing Shakespeare would not have been willing to do himself. However, the language is not accurate (it's nothing like Chaucer). So, I am comfortable with its accuracy and deviation from the truth, especially as the deviations were not for political reasons.<br/><br/>Secondly, the story telling is very enjoyable. The movie deals with logistics in battles, politics, power struggles, and alliances. The meeting between the two kings was very well played out.<br/><br/>I saw some comments about the ""woke"" nature of this film. I strongly dislike Netflix who have a string of fundamental issues with their dealings of the sexes in their productions. This is the first show i've seen from Netflix that does a solid job in dealing with the sexes. Keep in mind that most characters were passive (and that includes a few of the female characters). The characters that counted (of both sexes) were thoughtful and thought-provoking - which is almost unheard of from Netflix (or modern Hollywood for that matter).<br/><br/>If there are weak characters, it would be Pattinson (who was almost certainly told to play a French Imbecile) and Harris (who was mostly steady but inconsistent, especially as the story progressed).<br/><br/>For those that complain about the portrayal of Depp as Catherine, she is exactly what I would expect from a woman brought up in a noble family surrounded by wealth and the best tutors money could buy. I would suggest that many modern actresses could learn MUCH from Depp (eg. Blanchett, Gadot, Brie Larson etc who are frustrating actresses with minimal subtlety, minimal strength of character, and inconsistent acting talent). Depp was amazing in that she behaved much like a normal but very capable human being who earned respect rather than telling you she deserved it.<br/><br/>I am married to a professional, very capable, and strong woman. Any decent man would want a woman like Catherine. For that, I am grateful that film makers cater to people like me who are not politically correct. I lost a lot of respect for actresses like Blanchett and female leaders like Kathleen Kennedy who were once amazing women (see Kennedy's ""the force is female"" t-shirt as an example of how immature this once amazing woman has become).<br/><br/>The King is a slow paced movie. I enjoyed much of the dialog. I enjoyed most of the acting. I would suggest the portrayals are somewhat sanitised - although they were not sanitised for sexist/racist purposes as oft happens today.<br/><br/>If you like a thoughtful story, this is definitely worth watching. If you have been burned by Netflix's intolerance that it frequently exhibits (eg. the later seasons of Black Mirror), rest assured, this film is not your typical Netflix ""woke"" propaganda. I certify it ""woke free"".<br/><br/>There is some violence. I do not recommend this for under 16 or those that are squeamish as a few scenes are up close and personal."

The photography, acting, and direction are top notch. The screenwriting is well-researched and translated to our understanding. The action is quite sufficient for this caliber of film, which reminds one of the HBO approach to John Adams. But the striking aspect, as another reviewer pointed out, is the political war that was engaged before the young king came into power and the persistence of just behind the throne treachery pervading the entire story.

Not wanting to be pedantic, I missed the Battle of Shrewsbury, because according to this nonsense it DID NOT TAKE PLACE. Anyone with the slightest historical knowledge knew that this was one of the most important battles in English history. The first between 2 English armies using longbows against each other. And where was the King? Henry IV had an army of 28,000 against Hotspur's 14,00 (Owen Glendower never turned up in time to help out). Prince Henry was carried from the field with an arrow through his head, and Hotspur took a fatal one in the eye.<br/><br/>There was no need for Falstaff (played by one of the writers) because he didn't exist. I wasn't going to stay with this for the Battle of Agincourt: apart from having a fair idea how it actually went, I have been on that battlefield and wasn't going to watch more fiction.<br/><br/>Finally, the idea of Prince Hal beating Hotspur in a one-on-one fight is ridiculous. I'm being generous, giving this 6."

I get annoyed with Falstaff being the one genius who puts the strategy of Agincourt together (not only is that crazy, but Falstaff only existed in Shakespeare's plays, not in the real world), that the king fights on the field in complete absence of the Royal Guard, and that the various embellishments like single combat to settle wars.<br/><br/>The real problem is that it is a one note work. The same dull droning music plays throughout, mumble whispering is the order of the day for every scene, and there is no emotions portrayed except, well, sort of a cross being ennui, fatalism and this is the first reading of the work.

","I am a man who is quite knowledgeable in history, whose authenticity and accuracy are important. Obviously, a perfectly authentic film is almost impossible to make, I wouldn't expect it, and of course, movie is movie. But nowadays, there are plenty of options at your fingertips. Since this movie is a historical one, you need to test its authenticity!
First of all, I would start by saying that this movie is not bad, but unfortunately it is not good either. I'm a little disappointed... Just a little bit, because I saw in the trailer what the movie would be like... In my opinion Netflix wants to compete with the HBO Game of Thrones (which is a big mistake in such a historical movie) and the crew (and many others, unfortunately) are very misinformed about what the late medieval Europe was look like. There are many stereotypes...
I understand that the budget was fundamentally low, and that movie is partly based on Shakespeare Henry V's (which in itself makes the film in many ways inaccurate in itself, mainly in terms of events), but the former reasons do not explain the more historical inaccuracy. I've read reviews (both here and elsewhere) that sets and costumes are realistic... No, not realistic! The whole environment is too dark, the costumes are not authentic, understated and too colorless and for example I don't see any skinny dresses on man (which was very popular back then). Medieval people loved colors! From the points discussed above, Henry V (1944) is much better. And then there is the ""battle"" (of Agincourt) (which is not entirely bad, there are right moments), which is like the BotB in GoT (sad). The Battle of Agincourt in this movie is too chaotic, unrealistic, with mistakes, for examples: mounted men-at-arms have no lances, there is no French dismounted men-at-arms and infantry (crossbowmen), English and Welsh archers are ""shooting"" at the wrong angle with their longbows, no sticks, etc. And finally there is the siege, which is worse than the battle (very minimalist)... Some (major) mistakes of many: the besieged place (Harfleur) is not a castle, but a port city, instead of trebuchets should have been used guns, no mining, etc. Sad because I was expecting something from this movie, but it seems to be so telling. Thanks to everyone who read my review!"

","As a sometime musician, I find it interesting that while a modern musician would be loath to change a single note from any of Bach's or Mozart's compositions, today's screenwriters have no problem rewriting Shakespeare so as to not only change the play, but to make it the opposite of what Shakespeare intended.<br/><br/>Watching this I had mixed feelings. It is a well made production, the cast are generally good, the battle scenes are well done. The problem for me was the premise; if you want to rewrite Shakespeare you better be an extraordinary writer, or it will not work. One of the most important things for any movie is the ability for the audience to suspend disbelief and to maintain that suspension for the whole movie. It becomes a serious problem when the audience starts asking questions like ""Wait, he's an anti-war millennial but out of the blue says kill all prisoners"". Where did that come from? Or he's a King who just conquered France, but then gets lectured to by the French princess and he just stands there looking like a lost puppy. It just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>It occurred to me that this movie isn't supposed to make sense, it's only supposed to tick the boxes for the woke millennial college student who fantasises what it would be like to be a King in the middle ages. It would be a great opportunity to show medieval neanderthals concepts like being against war and listening to princesses. The woke millennial fantasises that he can kill real warriors in single combat but he'd rather be sitting in a dark corner being moody. He looks moodily at the deplorables around him and wishes the middle ages would end already.<br/><br/>I don't know too much about the real King Henry V, but for me to suspend disbelief I would have to go along with the idea that a modern woke millennial can mood his way through being a King in the middle ages, to be a pacifist and sensitive guy who reluctantly kills because he's forced to. Such a King would have been regarded as a pathetic weakling and Henry's own father usurped just such a King. As I said, I don't know too much about King Henry, but I know he wasn't this guy. So my suspension of disbelief failed, which is disastrous for any movie. I think this kind of rewriting of history to suit modern sensitivities could work, but it requires writing and directing with much more skill and subtlety than shown here."
"dsdsds16","6","1","5","10 November 2019"," The King has no friends, nor future
","""The King"" is an entertaining movie which offers great costumes, battle scenes and effects. However, it's quite forgettable and mediocre when it comes to the plot, its development and the characters -an issue that also plagues ""Outlaw King"" (2016), Netflix's previous try on the Middle Ages.<br/><br/>The creators of ""The King"" just couldn't decide what they wanted the movie to be. Shakespeare or history? An oppressed protagonist, belittled by all, or a fearful warrior ready to lead his country? Falstaff, the coward, or Falstof, the brave? Joel attempts to make a blend out of these options, but the result is utterly unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Let's elaborate a bit. A movie on Henry V. It won't include St. Crispin's Day speech, won't depict Falstaff accurately, won't spit archaic terms and witty humor profusely and won't glorify the English cause. Sorry, mate -Shakespeare knows thee not.<br/><br/>We can't argue ""The King"" aims for historical accuracy, either. Many reviewers have outlined in good detail the blatant twists poor dame History has suffered on the hands of wicked and gloomy Joel and his companions.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie never claims to be a recitation of the Henriad (we already have ""The Hollow Crown"" for that purpose) or a dramatization of the actual life of Henry V (such an intent would better fit a documentary or a mini-series). Indeed, movies are supposed to be creative, thrilling and impactful; deliver quick, but powerful messages; surprise the viewer most acquainted with its underlying story.<br/><br/>Now, ""The King"" has none of these qualities. It's a dull piece about a ruler, somewhere in the world, fighting a national war, pressed by the sword of Damocles -one of the most overused plots in cinema history. It's riddled with clich√©s and cheesy dialogues which disrespect the talented cast here assembled, so badly wasted.<br/><br/>Speaking of the cast, again we contemplate the creators' indecisiveness. They're evidently unsure as to who is their protagonist. At first he's a pacific, unserious scoundrel, repealed by his father's warmongering nature. Crowned, he's despised by followers and foes, for his young likeness. Suddenly, however, he becomes grave; a ruthless patriot; a cold and virtuous despot; a Netflix-sponsored music video of Sabaton's ""Carolus Rex"".<br/><br/>Yes, I understand that's called ""coming-of-age drama"". That he's fooled in the end, as an epitome of the blind masculine ambition. But everything is too fast, too unsubtle, too unconvincing.<br/><br/>Now, contrary to some, I wouldn't say the director miscasted the main role. It's just that it lacks verisimilitude, which is paramount in a movie of such serious atmosphere. When they cast Chalamet, creators evidently want us to expect him to overcome hardships with a cunning mind or a strategist spirit. But what we see is the very opposite: they make him prove his mettle in the battlecore, in duels, in the mud.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, Joel, but as you yourself said, Chalamet isn't that guy. Next time, invert his role with Pattinson's."

Chalamet is the tricky one and whilst he is a terrific actor and performs a great turn as Henry, occasionally it seems an uncomfortable fit.<br/><br/>There is little to take issue with however. Edgerton's script is fine if a little flowery in places and fun though Pattinson is as the Dauphin, he seems as if he's auditioning for a Bond villain role.<br/><br/>The film twists and turns quite nicely and is often quite violent, but overall it's a great tale, beautiful to look at and well told."
"Dannyboi94","6","1","5","3 November 2019"," A good movie, but also....boring?
","Let me just say, I think this is a good movie, the production, the directing, writing and acting are all brilliant, but the movie is also very slow, and drags a lot during the first and second acts, for the most part. With a runtime of nearly two and a half hours, something that begins to bore you that soon into the movie, that is a problem. The only thing that kept from from turning it off, was the amazing performance of Timoth√©e Chalamet - despite his consistent whispering throughout the film.<br/><br/>The third act is where the movie really takes off, and we get a very intelligent, and well shot action scene. It was very similar to the Battle of the Bastards from Game of Thrones, and it served the movie well. The music in this film is also very good. One of the best things about this movie, was none other than Robert Pattinson. Who would think the emotionless vampire from Twilight would come so far. He shines here (pun not intended), despite his very minimal screen time. His French accent was also very good, I did notice a few off words here and there, but other than that, he was an intimidating villian to the movie. I just wish we got more of him.<br/><br/>However, my biggest complaint, and anyone who has seen the trailer or the news, is that the movie kind-of tried to set itself up to be a romance. Well, that's what I got from it. There is literary no romance in this film at all, and Henry's love interest doesn't appear until very late into the film.<br/><br/>Despite it dragging in tons of places, the King is still a good movie, abit very slow. If you don't mind those kind of films, then you will find a great deal of enjoyment from the King, if you are expecting an action-packed war film, or a love-stricken romance, this isn't your movie.<br/><br/>6/10"
