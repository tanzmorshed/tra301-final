","When the Vietnam War ends, Bill Randa (John Goodman) and his partner Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) from the Monarch organization succeed to get the financing for an expedition to the recently discovered Skull Island from Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins). He hires the former Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to guide the expedition; a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson); and the awarded journalist and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). On the arrival, the helicopters need to cross a storm and soon they drop bombs on the forest to map the seismology of the island. Soon they are attacked by a huge gorilla called Kong that destroys the helicopters and kills part of the crew and scatter the rest through the island. The group commanded by Conrad meets Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a survivor from the World War II that lives with a tribe of natives. He explains that Kong protects the island and the natives from underground monsters and shall not be killed. But Colonel Packard is insane seeking revenge for his men that died.<br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" is a brainless adventure with several stupidities. For example, the number of helicopters in the beginning of the journey of Randa, Conrad and Packard is totally incompatible with the size of their ship. Bo pilot would dare to cross a storm like that in a helicopter. The attack of all the helicopters to Kong is absolutely imbecile. Most of the survivor's attitude are at least unreasonable. On the other side, the adventure is highly entertaining and the special effects are top notch. Therefore the best option to the viewer is to shut down the brain and enjoy the adventure since this is the purpose of this type of blockbuster. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Kong: A Ilha da Caveira"" (""Kong: The Skull Island"")"
"latinfineart","2","546","911","17 March 2017"," Unbelievably juvenile. Ridiculous story.
","Not even sure what to say about this one. Kong was 950 feet tall. And sweet. So sweet. Unless you threatened him or made him angry. Which they managed to do. I think pretty much anything that Samuel Jackson is in these days, must be avoided like the Bird flu. He is a compromised actor of extreme proportions, and will literally do anything for a buck. He is so tired. His routine is so old. Here he plays an army officer, who of course has no respect for nature, animals, or the earth. Hence the environmental statement. It is a statement that feels like it was written by a 5 year old. Hollywood being the nearly culturally bankrupt institution it is, seems to be incapable of a balance, nuanced, elegant statement of any sort. So, they keep producing this kind on inane garbage.<br/><br/>Why did 14 helicopter pilots, when faced with a 950 foot tall Kong, who has a wing span the size of several football fields, fly within swat range of this beast? Was it not possible they could have done any better than that? Does Hollywood really need to continue to insult us at every possible opportunity? <br/><br/>The only redeeming quality this movie had was John C. Reilly. His comic touch was all that kept me from walking out on this turkey. <br/><br/>Hollywood, you can do better than this. You need to stop catering to Chinese teenagers. This movie was terrible."
"vaughnd711","2","339","592","12 March 2017"," Oh, boy.
","I want to start off by saying that I am not going to sit here and pretend to be above wanting to see a 100-foot tall ape shred through some giant lizards and whatnot for around 2 hours.<br/><br/>If you were worried that Kong would wait 40 minutes to show the action only to cut-away when the fan makes contact with the feces, then you can put those worries to rest because this giant hairy grump is in your face right off the bat.<br/><br/>I could immediately tell that this film wasn't about to shy away from what we all craved so dearly in 2014's Godzilla, because from the first gunshot onward this script hauls some serious behind straight toward that colorful Skull Island which we were all so eager to see from the trailers.<br/><br/>Now, I have learned from a number of painful years that discipline is a key ingredient both behind the camera and beneath the projector. I like to think that my expectations were fair. I did not look at any reviews at any point before I hit that seat on that Thursday night - popcorn and drink in hand. I was ready, man.<br/><br/>If I told you that the neat visuals surrounding the lineup of lovecraftian nasties rendered into digital existence to confront the titular ape was enough to save this picture, then I would be lying straight to your face.<br/><br/>Yes, of course we get to see a glorious pair of giant angry ape fists make heavy and satisfying contact with: Some helicopters, a couple of lizards without legs (which is funny, because the T-Rexes in Peter Jackson's King Kong lacked arms), a giant squid because, you know, we needed 5 seconds of squid footage in the trailer I guess, more lizards, and a big lizard whose sole purpose in life is to rustle some serious jimmies.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, these scenes are sprinkled between around 2 hours of having the camera choppily bob and weave between two separate groups containing some of the most boring and uninteresting characters I have ever come to forget. There is a cardboard hero who is good at everything that the script needs him to be good at, a photographer who takes, like, pictures I guess, and John C. Reilly, who is arguably the closest this film gets to an interesting character.<br/><br/>And this is not because of the script. This is because he is John C. Reilly adding his own touch to the script he was given, like Gordon Ramsay doing his best after being handed a bag of plain rice and half of a dildo.<br/><br/>Everybody else is a nameless nothing that we get to see be picked off by giant insects in front of some of the worst green screen I have seen in some time. Good, lord. What time of day was it again? Because I swear to sweet baby Christ on a cracker that the sun set about six or seven different times in the same day.<br/><br/>The helicopter's encounter followed (after seemingly quite some time) by the final throw-down between Kong and captain ptorsodactyl mcwigglynoodle was what truly got me through the cringe-inducing humor and painfully humorous deaths.<br/><br/>This is one of those red-box gems that you'll have a better time with once there is a beer in your hand rather than a 7 dollar popcorn.<br/><br/>03/10"
"andrew-marks59","7","266","464","4 March 2017"," A stylized version of Kong that you may or may not have wanted
","Some people go to the movies to be wowed by the superb acting, heart wrenching and well written story, and overall solid production... THIS has good effects? The acting in this film isn't bad, but it definitely won't win any awards for it. <br/><br/>The story has characters Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) piggybacking on an expedition to an uncharted island to test their ""hollow earth"" theory. Tom Hiddleston plays a tracker, Brie Larson plays a photographer, and John C. Reilly plays a surprisingly funny WW2 vet marooned on Skull Island.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 1973 and loves to remind you with CCR and old technology as if it was a hundred years ago. Kong: Skull Island pays homage to Apocalypse Now quite frequently even though it seems a bit excessive at times.<br/><br/>Kong looked good, almost all the creatures looked cool and all the fights between them looked really good, especially in IMAX 3D. Some of the green screen effects, like backgrounds behind characters, were distractingly bad. Ultimately, you get some great stuff out of all the effects if you're not looking too closely.<br/><br/>The characters are more hollow than the earth (according to the film's characters themselves), the story is mediocre, but the effects reign king in this film adaptation. <br/><br/>My suggestion: See it! it's a blockbuster meant to fill seats, not win awards. Take it for what it is.<br/><br/>Seen at an advanced IMAX 3D screening in Minneapolis."

","I like to see a movie that on some level is at least plausible and does not require you to suspend reality entirely to go along with what you are seeing on the screen. First why would all twelve choppers stay within striking distance of Kong after the first couple were knocked out of the sky?? And then all of them get destroyed as well - Ridiculous! Second how does a creature the size of a ten story building sneak up on the unsuspecting human characters over and over? After Kong being machine gunned early on in the film and seeing that he was bleeding heavily and in quite a bit of pain he miraculously heals as if it had never happened! The leader of the squad of pilots somehow thinks he can kill Kong to the exclusion of all rationality in the face of overwhelming adversity and convince his fellow pilots to go along with him - ludicrous! How do giant squids and the giant skull crawler appear out of nowhere in shallow water not even up to Kong's knees? I could provide many more examples but I think I have made my point clear. Whoever writes these scripts does not base things on even vaguely realistic scenarios which makes for a less than satisfying viewing experience."

"blaskofilms","9","244","431","10 March 2017"," A Truly Great Ape
","Movies used to be fun. Genuinely fun. Kong: Skull Island is a throwback to the era when movies were fun - like, Stars Wars fun. Like Jaws fun. That kind of fun. The leads embody characters that are all understandable and genuinely likable. The plot isn't stuffed with technical geek references and ""easter eggs"" that weigh down other universe-building films. From the fire- singed Kong fur to the slick skull crawler tongues, the special effects are brilliantly detailed and animated. And it's genuinely refreshing to watch an action/monster film in which native peoples are depicted with dignity and respect, and where black and Asian characters aren't used as props or fodder for violence (admittedly, the film could have gone further with this, but I sensed some progress being made). Kong: Skull Island isn't Life is Beautiful. It isn't Casablanca. But it is genuinely, thrillingly, rigorously fun. It has heart, scales, teeth and a ferocious roar. Monster movies are back. Get in line. Hail to the King."
"dwmccleney","1","307","550","20 March 2017"," I walked out after an hour
","Samuel L. Jackson's character ruined this movie. I found the plot and theme to be very interesting, but so much of this movie (that I saw...walked out right after the two parties met up and decided to go look for the airman that was already dead)was just wrong. Flying helicopters, in close formation, through a hurricane so severe no ship can survive it? Ludicrous. Attacking a 300 ft. gorilla the 1st time you see it, without even considering pulling back and assessing the threat, and losing all of your helicopters in the process? Even more ludicrous. The determination, by Jackson's character, that he's going to avenge his fallen airmen and kill Kong? Just plain asinine. This seems like a dig on the military as a bunch of crazed killers, whose first instinct is to shoot and keep shooting until something, seemingly anything, is killed. Rational, thinking people don't do this. A few changes would've allowed this movie to be a wonderful adventure. <br/><br/>Take Jackson's role out of this movie and it might be a classic. As it is, I wouldn't rent it from Redbox. Very disappointed in this film."

","THIS is the way a movie should be done.<br/><br/>Have you ever watched the scene from The Princess Bride where the grandfather tells the kid: It's got everything. ""Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love ..."". Well, in a way, that's this version of KONG, and I am really happy and surprised at just how GOOD it was.<br/><br/>Take a bit of the original Kong, mix it with one part Private Ryan, a dash of The Deer Hunter, some Monty Python, lots of Jurassic Park, a pinch of A Space Oddity and mix well with some (insert your favorite lower-key funny movies HERE). The result is a pleasing fare one can really sink their teeth into and enjoy.<br/><br/>It has some familiar faces too, and what's best about it, is that not only do they live up to their so-called stardom, but even the unfamiliar or not-yet- ""famous"" actors with smaller roles, really do a great job and sell it. At no time while you are watching this movie do you feel it far-fetched or unbelievable that Kong actually exists, and isn't that, in a nutshell, what all movies should aspire to - the suspension of disbelief? Mission accomplished on this one, and good job to the creators.<br/><br/>A definite must-watch."
"Beard_Of_Serpico","8","4","4","20 April 2020"," Very enjoyable action adventure creature feature.
","One of my favourite pop corn movies of the last few years.
This is a very easy watch with a great cast, impressive special effects and a surprisingly dark tone in places with some gory and gross moments.
The action scenes look amazing and are highly stylised using bright colors, smoke and explosions to great effect and the monsters look awesome especially Kong. You can see individual hairs on his body and wrinkles on his leathery palms, it's very cool. Apparently the monster designs were influenced by Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke and i can actually see that.
You'd be silly going in to this expecting an Oscar winning tour de force like There Will Be Blood, this a high octane action adventure movie with massive monsters bashing the hell out of eachother. There isn't much character development but everyone still provides a decent performance especially Samuel L Jackson as a hard as nails and pretty unlikeable US army Lieutenant Colonel who needs war to survive. John C. Reilly is also a joy to watch.
There's a lot of small moments and details which you might not see first time round as well and i like that.
It's a fun time, go see this movie."

","Skull Island is another much-publicised remake that should have been left alone.<br/><br/>Granted, monster movies are enjoyed mainly for the effects, the graphics and gratuitous, large scale destruction and carnage. Top that off with a hero, a damsel and a nutcase or two and away you go. Who cares about acting, characters that you could identify with or hate and a script?<br/><br/>All that is well and good except for one thing and better movies have failed because of it. That thing is in the form of characters who are unusually and blatantly stupid. It may help advance the storyline but if that is the only avenue then the script needs to be rewritten, preferably by someone with an IQ.<br/><br/>No, I'm actually generous in my criticism. Here are some examples:<br/><br/>Helicopter pilots who fly really close to a 100ft ape that has already grabbed and mangled several other helicopters until every single one has been caught and pulverised. These are experienced pilots fresh from the Vietnam war. Now everyone has to get to the North of the island for a supply drop on foot. Really?<br/><br/>Or how about this, a female reporter who wanders into no-man's-land to help a 60ft water buffalo that is trapped under a fallen helicopter. Instead of getting any of the strapping blokes and tribesmen who are just around the corner to help, she tries to shift the helicopter by herself. So what if the megaton bullock couldn't budge it?<br/><br/>Yes, it exposes her to danger. The type of danger that otherwise can not be manifested in any other way. Really?<br/><br/>Oh please, stop! Mercy!<br/><br/>On the plus side, by this stage I had developed real feelings for the scriptwriter, the director and the producer, none of which was intended or that I care to express here.<br/><br/>Go see it if you must. Suspend your sense of reality and just go with it. Rest assured, you too will come out with feelings towards the aforementioned gentlemen."
"thechoctopfilmblog","4","122","216","13 March 2017"," Kong would regret being in this film
","I was confused about the purpose of this film, and sadly, I was still confused after watching the film. All the elements of this new version of King Kong have been recycled. Taking parts of the originals/remakes and hastily gluing them together again in a different way doesn't mean it is going to create an inventive artwork. <br/><br/>And I knew they would put a scene where Kong saves a pretty lady in his palm, I just knew it. All that's improved from the previous films is Kong's appearance. He is fluffier, angrier and more realistic. Some points must be given to the stunning visual effects.<br/><br/>The characters' names and faces have also changed, but their nature and characteristics are half dimensional and predictable. It is stereotypes upon stereotypes. It is a major waste of talent with Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L Jackson and Academy Award winner Brie Larson (""Room"") struggling in the muddled chaos. You could see and feel the disappointment. Even Kong seems confused. The performances are half- hearted and there is just no substance for them to work with. I bet all they were thinking of while filming was 'get me out of here' – literally. <br/><br/>For the majority of the film, everyone says very few words to each other. The conversations are forced and laughable. It wouldn't have made a difference if they were just silent. It's so predictable that you would know exactly what the next line would be. <br/><br/>I thought while watching this, was this meant to be an exaggerated satire of King Kong? Or was it meant to be taken seriously? Even the execution of the film presents the same questions. At one point, it would be slow and mystic, and minutes later, overly upbeat music would hit your ears, and we are treated to magnified slow-motion action. It feels it is trying too hard to get our attention. And once it does, it doesn't know how to sustain it. <br/><br/>And finally, there are so many extreme close-ups of Samuel L. Jackson's face, it probably took up half the film. They did it to match Kong's face, so you can imagine how gigantic it was. <br/><br/>Maybe if Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts figured out from the beginning what type and style of film this would be, it would have been a better film. It seems like he had an idea but is unconvicted towards it, and instead keeps changing his mind to offer more 'fun'. The result that it is a jumble of various pieces that don't belong in the same puzzle."
"iNickR","7","63","107","5 November 2017"," Better Than Most Kong Remakes
","Any movie, or anything, really, that keeps my attention is good. Although I didn't really like the orange tinge everything seems to have in the very beginning, the technical side improves dramatically as the film progresses.<br/><br/>It takes place in 1973, just after the Americans ""abandoned"" the Vietnam War (according to Samuel L Jackson's Preston Packard character). The 70's production design is good and brings me back to my childhood (the soundtrack was awesome with plenty of 70's hits), although you don't see much of the 70's vibe after the first 20 minutes or so. The CGI is very good and doesn't make me feel like I'm playing a video game. This movie is like Jurassic Park meets Godzilla and they had a baby called Platoon and it grew to become a mash-up of the three of them with its own uniqueness called Kong: Skull Island.<br/><br/>Just under two hours in length and ""hold onto your butts"" and watch the credits.<br/><br/>My favourite quote from the movie is, ""A camera is more dangerous than a gun."" Seems like SLJ get's all the good lines."
"wd-8","1","295","556","17 March 2017"," Truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen
","This abortion of a movie should never have seen the light of day. With a credits list of OVER 1,300 people, you think someone would have put their hand up and said ""Umm... Wait a minute""<br/><br/>This is supposed to be 1974, but apparently no one bothered to check any actual history. Even the props are more modern, with an office full of DEC-VT100 display terminals from 1978 and later. Many other items in this movie are clearly more modern than they should be. Totally lazy for such an expensive project.<br/><br/>I guess if you cast Samuel L. Jackson into anything these days, it must pass his ""cartoon silliness test"" to be produced. Tarantino can get away with this with great dialog and action. The clowns producing this hairball should hide their faces in public.<br/><br/>You can tell from the very beginning that this is going to be bad. Even if you, as did I, go into it expecting very little. The setup of the movie is long and face-slapping cliché. The actors, whom we know to be quite skilled, are entirely wasted by bad bad bad dialogue and bad direction. The editing is not so good either.<br/><br/>And when we get out onto the ocean (1974 remember), we are insulted by Hollywood physics and meteorology. A huge storm doesn't even churn up the waves near the ship *facepalm*<br/><br/>Of course, the dorks then fly their non-vintage helicopters into the hell-storm, with super-fake lightning all around, and get through to see the beautiful islands.<br/><br/>Within a few minutes, ALL of them have been knocked down by insisting on flying close enough to Kong to get bashed *facepalm* holy crap.<br/><br/>Things only get more clichéd from there, with the grizzly 28 year survivor (with the 20 year old son at the end), the demented Samuel Jackson staring and almost drooling as he chews the scenery.<br/><br/>Vietnam veterans are insulted by their blind obedience to a ranting idiot. Civilians and military alike enter ""the valley of death"" in spite of the writers allowing some of the characters to suggest it's a bad idea.<br/><br/>And then it gets really bad. ""OMG bad"".<br/><br/>And in all of this, you feel incredibly bored. It's dull, and bad, and stupid.<br/><br/>Oh, and the ""teaser for the idiots' sequel"" comes after the 1,300+ lines of credits, if you are not asleep or barfing in the toilet.<br/><br/>Astoundingly bad."
"odellcameron","2","238","445","12 March 2017"," Second Worst Movie Of The Year
","When I initially saw the trailer to this movie I immediately knew that this movie was going to be absolute garbage. Making a movie just to set up future sequels is a horrible idea since it removes all tension in the movie. Although I expected the movie to be bad, I didn't expect a contender to Worst Movie of the Year (first is XxX: Return of Xander Cage). Almost everything this movie does is horrible due to bad acting, despite having big actors, bad cinematography, bad plot, and horrible characters. One mediocre thing about this movie was the special effects. So let's begin by talking about the worst thing of the movie:<br/><br/>1.Characters: The characters in this movie are the absolute worst. There is not one likable or memorable character in this movie except John C. Reily's character. All the others are uninteresting, stupid, and not memorable in the slightest. One example of this would be San, played by Tian Jing. Despite San being a ""main character"", she is never introduced (if she was it must have been a second long) and is always in the background saying about two lines in the whole movie. The only reason I can think of why her character is introduced is to appeal to the Asian crowd the studio was marketing this movie to. The rest of the characters are just as boring as San with everyone doing a horrible job at acting. It is apparent that the director was trying to make the marine characters likable. However, unlike movies that had likable marine characters like Predator and Aliens, Kong: Skull Island's marines are the most boring characters ever and don't evoke emotion when they die, except maybe happiness. The only good character in this movie is John C. Reily. Even though he would occasionally stop the movie's pacing with his joke's, he was clearly the only one who tried their best.<br/><br/>2.Setting: Another weakness of this movie is its setting. After my viewing of the movie I realized that there was no reason for this movie to take place during the Vietnam War other than to give an excuse to go to locations in Asia to appeal to Asian countries. However, the island is interesting and has a variety of environment, which does add some anticipation. <br/><br/>3.Kong/Creatures: Now it's time for the meat n' potatoes of the movie, the creatures. In Peter Jackson's portrayal of King Kong, the creatures fit in the story. However, in Kong: Skull Island, it seems like the director went outside and made whatever he saw big. Another problem is that the creatures are always alone. In 2005 King Kong, we saw the creatures in big packs that showed how large the population was. Another problem was the main bad creature which didn't fit with the real life creatures featured in the film.<br/><br/>4.Inconsistencies/ Stupid plot devices: One main problem with this movie is all the stupid devices that keep the story more exciting. One example would be how bullets don't hurt the main evil creatures but a sword does. Also, Kong being immune to fire is very distracting and ends up making the ending ridiculous. One distracting inconsistency would be the scene when they head towards the storm that supposedly hides Skull Island. When they are on the ship it is clear that there is about five choppers on the ship. However, when they start heading into the storm there are about twelve choppers. One reason for this is to inflate the number of casualties after Kong destroys all the helicopters. <br/><br/>In the end, Kong: Skull Island is a very bad movie. However, if you are able to turn off your brain and not realize everything bad about the movie, then you will enjoy it.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 2/10"
"garethvk","7","105","191","8 March 2017"," A Better Than Expected Adventure
","The legendary King Kong returns in an all new adventure that gives the classic tale a much needed update and new setting. Unlike Perter Jackson's retelling of the original Black and White film, ""Kong: Skull Island"" eschews the old for the new and in doing so breathes a much needed new life and vitality into the franchise.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1973 when William Randa (John Goodman), informs the government that they have detected a previously unknown island and need to investigate it before the Soviets learn of it and beat them to whatever the island my hold.<br/><br/>William recruits a team which includes a former British officer named James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), and Photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), to assist his team lead by Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins), in mapping the island.<br/><br/>William also asks for a military escort and the government enlists Lt. Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), and his team to accompany the mission. Packard is trying to find his place in the world as he and his helicopter combat team are dealing with the recent end of the Vietnam War. His men are looking forward to going home and resuming their lives, but a dour Packard jumps at the chance for another mission over the uncertainty of the future.<br/><br/>Upon arriving on the mysterious island and starting their survey mission by using seismic charges, the team attract the attention of Kong who is not at all pleased with the intrusion on his island. Kong makes short work of the copters and the team finds themselves scattered about the dangerous island. They soon learn that Kong is not the only danger on the island and must find a way to rejoin each other and make it to their extraction point alive.<br/><br/>Naturally some of the characters have a hidden agenda and there are dangerous and action around every corner. Further complicating matters is the appearance of Marlow (John C. Reilly), a downed WWII pilot who has been stranded on the island for 23 years and warns of dangers far greater than Kong that are ahead of the team.<br/><br/>The film combines a solid cast with state of the art special effects to take a new twist on the standard adventure fare. While many parts of the film remain silly Popcorn entertainment, the quality of the assembled cast allows the film to move beyond being just an assembly of potential victims for a menagerie of CGI creatures to dispatch. While the story is more in lines with the linear and thin plots of adventure films of old, the sum of the parts does add up to an enjoyable film experience for those who like the giant creature films. You will want to make sure to stay after the credits as there is a very good scene that shows a setup for a future film that had those in attendance at our press screening cheering.<br/><br/>The film may be a bit intense for younger viewers but if you are looking for a touch of nostalgia and action, you may find the film just what you need.<br/><br/>3.5 stars out of 5."

","Boy did I enjoy this film.<br/><br/>forget plot and logic. This is an all out creature feature...It is called Skull Island because that's where the action takes place with all the neat creatures.<br/><br/>There is a LOT of screen time devoted to Kong and the monsters. And LOTS of cool death scenes. Pretty gory, in my opinion, and surprised this got a pg-13. Some scenes would be very frightening for little ones.<br/><br/>Most surprisingly, it is the the acting of John Goodman and J.C. Riley that stands out - even overshadowing tom Hiddleston. I am not a big fan of Goodman or Riley, so this really surprised me.<br/><br/>For the plot - people go to Skull Island. They encounter Kong and various giant monsters. Mayhem and death ensues. Some return home. The end.<br/><br/>Doesn't sound like much but the monster scenes really made the movie, and Kong was fantastic. They really had him move - he was almost like a giant Hulk smashing those airplanes!<br/><br/>Oh, and PLEASE stay after the credits. What was shown put a BIG smile on my face... No spoilers.. you have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>My wife and I had a blast.

","I grew up watching classic monster movies at my Great Grandma's place - Wolfman, Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Blob, etc. This movie made me feel the enjoyment of discovering those movies again.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the movie was chronological, and made it very obvious when it changed time or place. I hate flashbacks, and am happy to be able to say that this movie did not make use of them. Thankfully, it also did not make use of the ""shaky camera footage"" that a lot of movies are using these days.<br/><br/>Some big monster movies also tend to be kind of slow at the beginning, and hide the ""main character"" until towards the end of the movie. Not so with this - Kong makes his appearance right at the beginning. The movie also doesn't really bog down anywhere. On the other hand, there are plenty of movies that scream ""eye candy"" - where it seems quite obvious that there is not much of a plot, so they are just throwing things around to distract you. While the focus of this movie is definitely on the giant monster battles, it is done very well.<br/><br/>Both my wife and I give this film an A+ - it's a nicely done foundation for the upcoming Kong vs Godzilla film."

","I am not a movie snob and am easily entertained, but this movie was absolutely a complete and utter joke. It felt like a 3rd grader wrote the script.

John C.

And Samuel L. Jackson?? I think I just might use his appearance in future films as cause to not see them because he is clearly cast for his popularity and for a quick marketing boost for films that clearly need that extra kick. I am going to binge-watch King Kong (2005) with Jack Black until I can forget that I ever saw this new attempted failure to reprise Kong. Have our standards really fallen so far?? I honestly do not think there was a single frame that lasted longer than 2 seconds, I am not joking. Oh, the agony."

","A diverse team of scientists, soldiers and adventurers unites to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific, as dangerous as it is beautiful. Cut off from everything they know, the team ventures into the domain of the mighty Kong, igniting the ultimate battle between man and nature. As their mission of discovery becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape a primal Eden in which humanity does not belong.<br/><br/>What starts out as a well oiled, climactic first act with a big big promise slowly meanders its way more and more through second and thirds acts that constantly keep the viewer less and less involved in any of the struggle, culminating in a very underwhelming finale.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this film is one of those that relies a little too much on its eye candy and whilst you way (or may not) be entertained by the big set pieces and the wonderful design and look of the monsters, the more you think about it the more the movie sticks out as uneven, terribly fragmented in almost all of its departments with many basic story threads not working.<br/><br/>What I will say is that Vogt-Roberts nails the monsters. We'll later touch on the CGI quality, but on a level of scale, fear, imagination and action he is almost constantly delivering. The fights with Kong are always shot in a wide, sweeping shot that turns around him and holds on for long. Those are absolutely incredible, they are sophisticated, beautiful shots to which sounds adds a real savage nature and together bring a real enthusiasm for the audience to the fights. Moreover, the various other monsters from the island are all interesting creatures and all feel part of the island.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the director shows off quite a drive in his first act. The journey to the island is riveting and build with constantly good editing and witty cinematography choices that always keep us oriented in what's going on. The first full blown action sequence is amazing, really absolutely stunning. He places the camera in the most interesting places and it throws us into the world and the size of Kong.<br/><br/>But, after that it is all downhill. The emptiness of these characters slowly reveals itself and once we're at the end of the second act it just becomes forced scene after forced scene of romance. The more it goes on the more it seems to completely fall apart, by the last action sequence the suspense of disbelief has totally disappeared, characters are doing stuff that is out of their abilities, the set pieces become ridiculously bloated, the green screen CGI becomes almost unacceptable, the amount of explosions is borderline parodic and you're left uncaring of anything or anyone, there is no interesting struggle by the end, the climax is underwhelming. Many choices of setting and build up seem really out of place, the whole dynamic that evolves at the end in (without spoiling anything) where they find themselves and where they have to go is shallow. Capping it off is one of the worst characters and portrayals I have seen in a motion picture ever, John C. Reily is a travesty every time he is on screen, there is no contribution he brings to the story and weakens it because of his terrible dynamic that is neither funny nor interesting.<br/><br/>This was definitely a weak day at the theater for me, the first act revved me up, it was really good and had a charm to it, it managed to build excitement very effectively. Sad it is that it didn't deliver on that promise and gave us a pretty mediocre blockbuster."

","King Kong (1933) was a perfect movie in its proposal. A simple, direct and clear message. No remakes or sequels required. This is why all sequels and remakes are always inferior in impact to the original. Filmmakers always want to add anything new and unnecessary. <br/><br/>In this new film, Kong leaves the territory of quality and embarks on a trip to the territory of blockbusters, in other words, special effects and jokes (just watch the retarded and unnecessary joke scene about the Skullcrawlers name with Hiddleston, Larson and John C. Reilly) overlap the story, and so the film is passable and totally forgettable in a week.<br/><br/>Once again, Hollywood treats scientists as idiots when the character of Corey Hawkins can not even open a can of canned food and feels intimidated by a woman. Not to mention the macho colonel, who wants an unnecessary revenge with Kong, because Kong killed his men (in a casual meeting).<br/><br/>And not to mention the idiotic plans that Jordan Vogt-Roberts uses to focus the eyes of the Samuel L. Jackson character with the eyes of King Kong. It seems like the director Jordan Vogt-Roberts wants to make a kind of (unnecessary) fight in the old west style. Pure waste of time, as we know that the macho colonel, is no challenge for Kong, so why waste precious screen time with these situations? Because Kong's story can be told as in the original in just 90 or 100 minutes. And the filmmarkers have to put 2 hours of film and for this they have to put unnecessary situations and scenes. <br/><br/>As the disposable soldier of the colonel, who gets lost from the group, just to see Kong crush a giant squid (and then Kong eats it), then after some scenes, be killed by another giant monster. What could be an interesting conflict between the characters of Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson, but that ends up in nothing. Because people are written from a stupid one-dimensional way (like the stupid macho colonel). That is, more movie time, for less story. This is because Kong never leaves the island in this movie, Kong will only leave the island in 2020 in the movie Godzilla vs. King Kong. Yes this movie aims to create another shared universe (MCU type of crap), and in the end this compromises the quality of this film. The filmmakers have their hands tied, because they can not put their best on this film, however they have to think how this movie will work with another movie from another guy, three long years into the future.<br/><br/>I went into the movie hoping to see a good and fun Kong movie, and I ended up seeing a crap and bad one, because of the ambition of the studio that compromised the quality of the movie, for the money. Not to mention, even as a fun movie, this movie fails so much. <br/><br/>You see, the scenes with special effects, you can see that the scenes were all filmed on a green screen. And the final fight between Kong and the giant lizard is even inferior to the T-rex fights in Peter Jackson's 2005 remake. Yes, the fights and clashes between Kong and the other giants monsters were better, bigger, more epic, more brutal and vicarious than in this pathetic 2017 movie. I'm not defending the Peter Jackson movie, that film obviously had its flaws, but in the department of special effects and action scenes (this department that does not save a movie, nonetheless) is vastly superior to this Jordan Vogt- Roberts movie. Even as an action movie and blockbuster, this movie fails in a big way.<br/><br/>But if you were disappointed, and if you were sad that you had lost money unfairly, you can wait until 2020 to see the rest of the film in Godzilla VS King Kong.<br/><br/>My God, that's why commercial filmmaking is in the mud. The commercial cinema has as main target children, teenagers and young people. And this is why the quality bar is so low."
"jamesrupert2014","7","14","21","9 February 2018"," Visually impressive but otherwise mediocre kaiju yarn
","Similar to a number of Godzilla films from the '90's, 'Kong' turns out to be a guardian monster (despite the carnage with which he greets Samuel Jackson's crew of tough 'Nam vets) who protects humans from some existential threat, in this case, vicious two-legged lizard-kaiju ('Skullcrawlers') from the bowels of the Earth. The film follows the usual trajectory: John Goodman assembles a team of soldiers, a retired SAS spook, a bunch of generic scientists, and hot-shot female photographer to travel to Skull Island, the last undiscovered land on the planet, as part of his obsession to find evidence for a hollow earth and giant monsters. After a 'first act' of mood-drenched slow-mo shots of helicopters, classic 60/70's rock and roll, tough-guy posturing, bro-bonding, and fish-out-of-water shtick, they get to the titular Island, where things immediately go bad. The expedition promptly gets split into two (one group learns the truth, the other is consumed by a need for revenge). All of this sets up a series of action scenes where humans (ineffectively) and Kong (effectively) fight the skullcrawlers. The film is not connected to the original King Kong story and Kong himself is not intended to be a giant gorilla, but rather the last of some primordial species. As such, while his head is certainly gorilla-like, his body and posture is more like a very hairy Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson with simian hands and feet. Despite this odd hybrid status, the titular kaiju looks very good and the CGI for both him and his adversaries is outstanding, as is the scenery (real and otherwise) seen at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately, the story is not as good as the visuals, relying on too many improbabilities, contrivances, and coincidences to be taken seriously. An entertaining, but not memorable film with little 'watch it again' appeal."

","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie opens in 1944 in the aftermath of a dogfight over a supposedly inhabited island. Hank Marlow (later played by John C. Reily) is an American pilot who successfully parachutes out and lands on the island. Unluckily for him, a Japanese pilot also parachutes to safety and when he lands, a fight begins. Neither gains the upper hand but the Japanese pilot has a sword so Hank flees into the jungle. They later continue to fight but it's interrupted when a certain ""monster"" makes an appearance.<br/><br/>After a montage of world events following WW2, the movie picks up again in 1973. Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brookes (Corey Hawkins) are 2 scientists from the Monarch Corp. on Capital Hill for a meeting with Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins). He tries to skirt the meeting, America has just announced its withdrawal from the Vietnam War. Bill and Houston want to map Skull Island geologically to look for mineral deposits. Willis isn't having any of it until Bill mentions that this could be an opportunity to beat the Russians to the island. But they have to assemble a security team to investigate and protect the scientists including a helicopter division led by Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), a former SAS officer James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and a war photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson).<br/><br/>Having seen the trailers for this movie, you would think it would be largely led by Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson but this is actually more of an ensemble movie. Some of the supporting actors actually end up leading the movie for large periods of time. The plus side of this is that they create some cool characters, they're all interesting and their motivations are clear and understandable. Almost every ensemble movie has problems sharing the screen time and this one is no exception. James and Mason were interesting but you didn't get as much time to latch onto them as you probably should have. Other characters lack purpose, I like Toby Kebbell as an actor but his character Jack Chapman has almost no bearing on anything and just acts as a device to get the plot moving.<br/><br/>One of the surprising things about this movie is that it ended up being a lot funnier than I expected. Some people were worried about tonal issues because the trailer showed this frightening monster destroying everything and then it showed the cast cracking a joke. There are some small moments where something violent would happen and then they would try to bring some comedy in. The tone of Kong: Skull Island reminded me a lot of classic adventure movies like Indiana Jones where they weren't afraid to go dark yet they managed to create a memorable movie by including some impressive action and funny jokes. Tonally there are moments where the movie borders on being cheesy but they're few and far between.<br/><br/>Speaking of the action, they really went for it here. Kong is a force of nature and the way he decimates his enemies is surprisingly violent. They give away some of the best bits in the trailer but my favourite parts were when they first encounter Kong travelling to the island and the ending fight between Kong and the other creatures on the island. This is a PG-13 movie that isn't afraid to give you what you want which is some bone-crunching action.<br/><br/>Every frame of this movie is gorgeous too. This is one of the few big budget movies where I didn't feel like it had CGI overload. The environment is beautiful and the movie has some very stylish cinematography. Some of this is expected but I still feel like they went the extra mile. The creatures on the island aren't completely new designs but they're fun to look at and they help bring the sense of epic to Kong: Skull Island. The effects around Kong are also excellent, his look and movements are consistent and I didn't see any flaws in it. You also get some fun stuff like the music from the period too.<br/><br/>The cast here is pretty impressive, they went the extra mile to get some top-shelf talent and the movie largely benefits. Hiddleston is good, he could have carried more of this but he's decent in his spot. Brie Larson elevates her role, I think this movie shows how talented she is because in the grand scheme she's more of a background character than you realize. Samuel L. Jackson was decent, he gets more over-the-top as the movie goes along but he fits. Surprisingly, a lot of the supporting characters stole the show, John C. Reily had the best performance. He changes the dynamic of the movie, he has all the quotable lines and his ending is played pitch perfect. Jason Mitchell was a surprise standout, he was good in Straight Outta Compton but he steals a lot of the scenes he's in. If there was anyone I was disappointed in, John Goodman came across as pretty flat. I don't know if that was his fault or his role.<br/><br/>I don't think that this movie was flawless. Other than what I mentioned above, the only other things I would mention is that the dialogue could have used a little punching up in spots and the editing was a little choppy in the second half. Scenes transition and people end up in different places than they last were and events happen in sequence that don't fit together completely.<br/><br/>People seemed worried that the trailers for this movie looked so good, they were bracing themselves for upcoming disappointment. Let me put those fears at ease, this movie wasn't perfect but it was easily one of the better movies I've seen so far this year. I liked this better than the latest Godzilla movie. I'd give Kong: Skull Island an 8.5/10."
"themadmovieman","8","152","312","9 March 2017"," Action-packed, intelligent and undeniably entertaining
","After the crushing disappointment that was Godzilla, I have to say that Kong: Skull Island is a tremendous surprise. Not only a hugely entertaining monster movie, but a well-directed, well-written and well-acted film full of ideas from start to finish. Its action set- pieces are utterly spectacular, the CGI is fantastic, and there's even a story that's genuinely interesting throughout, something that I definitely didn't expect going in.<br/><br/>But by far the greatest achievement of this film is the presence of Kong himself. As plain as most of the film was, the biggest issue with Godzilla was that there just wasn't enough Godzilla. Fortunately, Skull Island rectifies that exact problem, and makes Kong as big a character in the film as any of the humans, appearing on screen at regular intervals, and actually playing a genuine role in the story.<br/><br/>And that story is probably the thing that surprised me most of all. Again, Godzilla was a slow, empty and formulaic monster movie that really bored me. Kong: Skull Island, on the other hand, is a fast- paced and absolutely jam-packed action movie that actually gets better and better as it moves along.<br/><br/>Of course, there's a part of me that's a little sad that we're not getting the classic story of King Kong that made both the 1933 and 2005 films so beautiful. However, Skull Island does do a fantastic job at bringing the character to a different time period and making a new, riveting story.<br/><br/>Above all, the film's ingenious parallels with the Vietnam War make for fascinating viewing. Bringing a different dynamic to the relationship between the humans and Kong, the way that Skull Island looks at the story through the lens of the anti-Vietnam War sentiment of the 1970s adds an impressive layer of depth to the story, keeping Kong an interesting and emotionally resonant character despite removing his love with Ann Darrow.<br/><br/>What's more is that some of the film's characters have some very layered and interesting backstories. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson's character, a stubborn, war-mongering colonel taken from the Vietnam War he loved fighting in, is hugely interesting to watch. At times mimicking the role of film director Carl Denham from the original, at others adding a far darker and more serious edge to the story of the invasion of Skull Island, he's absolutely fascinating to follow from start to finish.<br/><br/>There are a whole host of other characters that bring some impressive depth to the story, depth that I certainly didn't expect after the two-dimensional heroes of Godzilla, and make the film's large ensemble cast work amazingly well.<br/><br/>One more positive from the film is undoubtedly the action. As I said, this is a very exciting monster movie that's full of action throughout. Above all, the opening and closing action sequences really stand out. Both because of the amazing visual parallels drawn with Vietnam War films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, but also thanks to the stunning CGI that allows Kong to tower over the screen in comparison to the humans, but also puts a formidable and genuinely terrifying enemy on a very level playing field.<br/><br/>As far as blockbusters go, Skull Island is top-quality, but it still isn't entirely perfect. For one, whilst it's brimmed with ideas and interesting characters throughout, that does lead the film to becoming a little crowded at times. The lack of a main character amidst the huge ensemble cast means it's definitely not as streamlined as I would have liked.<br/><br/>Also, the parallels with Vietnam, whilst unique and great to see in a movie like this, are a little overbearing at times. Particularly in the first act, there comes a point where the film really hits you over the head with how similar it is to Apocalypse Now, and although that does die down to a better level later on, it's a little frustrating at times.<br/><br/>Simply put, Skull Island is an impressively brainy and innovative blockbuster, but it goes a little too far with everything it does. That's far better than a completely empty film like Godzilla, but with an enormous main cast and a story that's so jam-packed, I felt like things could have been carried out a little smoother than the finished product.<br/><br/>Still, I had a really good time with Kong: Skull Island. It's a massively entertaining monster movie that places its title character right in the thick of the action, surrounded by more interesting human characters, excellent visuals, stunning action sequences, and a genuinely engrossing and intelligent original story."

The one thing I wasn't expecting was a colder, more emotionally uninvolved ""Fay Rae"" who neither falls in love with the big ape or seems too concerned overt what happens to him one way or the other. And then finally, when he saves her life for the last time, we watch the lonely beast slowly lumber away back to his isolated oblivion while our beautiful little ingrate turns and hugs her boyfriend.

You can tell, from the very first scene, that the people involved in making it took the time to try and bring you (us) a quality product. For the most part, IMO, they succeeded. It is HIGHLY entertaining, the characters are interesting and mostly well-acted, there is humor, anger, the CG is fantastic ... Yes, I agree that Samuel Jackson is pretty played out and when they put him in the game, you always get the same character more or less, but even he can't detract much from KONG, who is after all, the star.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor. Spring for the cost of a ticket or two, take your best friend or lover and go SEE it for yourself. Unless you are hurting for $18, and you are normal, you probably won't come back cry- babying due to lost time or lost money like some of these 'raters' are doing.

","Kong: Skull Island is a monster film starring Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, John C. Reilly, and Brie Larson.

Upon arrival, the group realise the island is swarming with giant monstrous animals and insect-like creatures who have called this place their home for millions of years. After becoming separated amidst the chaos, the groups eventually meet with the local natives who worship a skyscraper-sized ape named Kong who protects them from the giant monsters. <br/><br/>While the film doesn't offer much in terms of actual plot, the action and fight scenes more than make up for it. The special effects were great and the CGI for Kong and the other giant monsters were all very convincing. The characters were all essentially stock action roles but thanks to the believable performances from the lead actors, they're still fun to watch. I also enjoyed the fact that Kong has more screen time and a greater relevance on the film's story, unlike with how Godzilla was barely in the 2014 film.

"moviexclusive","7","42","85","7 March 2017"," Big on action, thrills and pure spectacle and lean on everything else, this latest iteration of pop culture's mightiest simian is good old monster mash fun
","No sequel, spin off or remake has come close to matching up to the mythology of the 1933 classic, and just to be sure, neither does this latest iteration of pop culture's mightiest simian. Instead, this origin story largely set in the 1970s when America was pulling itself out from the quagmire of the Vietnam War inspires to be no more and no less than a monster-mash adventure of epic-sized proportions, pitting not just Man-against-Kong but Man-against- nature-itself, the latter represented by supersized species the likes of towering spiders, blue-blooded pterodactyls and giant saw- toothed lizards referred to as Skullcrawlers that are all too eager to get a literal taste of human flesh. Oh yes, this is a CGI showstopper in many, many more ways than one, with state-of-the-art Industrial Light and Magic technology complemented with inventive creature design by Carlos Huante to create a fitting modern-day throwback to the B-movie action-driven creature features of the past.<br/><br/>Dispensing with any hint of nuance, the straightforward and utterly functional plot has John Goodman's scientist cum bureaucrat Bill Randa assemble a team under his top-secret government-funded Monarch project to explore the hitherto uncharted Skull Island, a long- hidden landmass in the South Pacific hidden by constant electrical storms and magnetic interference which has been only recently uncovered by the first Earth-mapping satellites sent up into space by the US. Among those whom end up one way or another on the mission: Tom Hiddleston's former SAS officer turned tracker-for-hire James Conrad, Brie Larson's anti-war photojournalist Mason Weaver, and last but not least Samuel L. Jackson's embittered Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard and his helicopter squadron (some of the more recognizable faces include Shea Whigham and Toby Kebbell). There are about a half dozen other characters too difficult to keep track once the film gets underway, such as Jing Tian and Corey Hawkins' pair of token-minority scientists who get a couple of pointless lines and no real purpose.<br/><br/>Withholding knowledge of the real intent of the expedition to ""document the existence of massive unidentified terrestrial organisms', Randa instructs Colonel Packard's men to start dropping bombs from their helicopters under the guise of mapping the island seismographically, which naturally irritates the hell out of its eponymous chief resident. Kong's grand dramatic entrance consists of hurling a napalm tree towards one of the choppers, before tearing through each and every one of them by either ripping them apart or tossing them against each other. Oh yes, you'll be glad to know that (unlike Randa) Kong doesn't hold anything back right from the get- go, meaning that you will get to see him in all his massive vicious glory in every single scene that he is in. That awesome introduction not only cuts the ensemble down to those in the opening credits and divides them into two groups, but also sets up the enmity between Kong and Packard.<br/><br/>Given the simplicity of the storyline, it is no surprise that the characters are but stock types – in fact, the most fully developed character only joins midway through the film, a WWII vet named Hank Marlowe (John C. Reilly) who survived the Japanese pilot after him when both their fighter planes crash-land back in 1944 and has since learned to live peacefully among the natives there. Reilly steals every scene he is in – more than just as supporting comic presence, he is a real live wire injecting warmth, humour and dryness as an eccentric lost-in-time pilot. Jackson comes a close second with his brash gusto, but the rest of the actors are not much better than as body count.<br/><br/>But really, who are we kidding – you're probably not here for the story or the characters but the damn ape himself, and boy, does he look magnificent. With tactile fur and soulful eyes, Kong comes to life in breathtaking realism, aided with motion capture by 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' actor Terry Notary. This Kong is majestic on his own (one such moment has him taking a break in a lake while Kebbell's terrified major watches from behind a rock a few feet away), and jaw- droppingly powerful during any one of the startlingly photoreal sequences of bestial combat. It bears noting that the monsters which emerge to challenge Kong or which simply make an appearance as part of the fauna of the titular island are also just as stunning, especially a confrontation in a foggy graveyard between the remaining survivors and a Skullcrawler and the climactic Kong- versus-giant-Skullcrawler smackdown that is impressive even by modern-day CGI standards.<br/><br/>Despite being a visual effects novice, indie director Jordan Vogt- Roberts proves right at home in a big-budget motion picture. He creates an immersive pre-historic paradise to complement the exciting monster scenes, and mixes 70s war imageries from 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Platoon' into the 'Jurassic Park' setting to keep his audience hooked. Because of his firm grasp on pace and rhythm, what is two hours feels much less so – and if there is one unintended outcome of that, it is the fact that we end up wanting to see more of Kong. As much as it is Kong's movie, there are also stretches in between where he is nowhere to be seen, and the other nasty dino-like creatures on Skull Island take center stage to exert terror on the human intruders. <br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a movie fashioned on pure action spectacle, using state-of-the-art CGI to breathe new life into the old-school monster movie mash genre (you would do well to note that this is meant to be an origin story in Legendary/ Warner's MonsterVerse franchise, setting up the beast for a planned showdown against Godzilla in 2020). It may all seem familiar, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun or thrilling, so really just grab your popcorn, sit back and enjoy the ride."
"BigGuy","7","44","90","2 March 2017"," Should be John C Reilly Island
","I just saw a sneak preview of Kong: Skull Island. I don't think this will be a long remembered monster movie. It's a fun movie, but ultimately forgettable. The CGI Kong, Samuel L Jackson, and John Goodman all took a backseat to John C. Rielly, who did a superb job playing a WWII pilot who was shot down and landed on Skull Island. Seriously, his role is the greatest thing in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is set in 1973, and the premise is that LandSat (land mapping satellite) has taken pictures of an elusive island (Skull Island) that has been rumored to exist, but not proved. John Goodman convinces the government to launch an expedition to explore the island. They take some soldiers who were pulling out of Vietnam, and are headed by Samuel L Jackson. They also pick up a British ex-special forces ""tracker"" (Tom Hiddleston) and an ""anti-war"" photographer played by Brie Larson.<br/><br/>They start the mission by dropping bombs on the island to map the bedrock, ostensibly to look for mineral deposits. That's when Kong shows up to smack the helicopters out of the air, and generally wreak mayhem on the team. The scattered survivors then have to survive on an island filled with monsters and get to the extraction zone. One group finds John C. Reilly's character, who has been stranded on the island for 29+ years.<br/><br/>That's about all I'll say about the story, so as to avoid serious spoilers. The story line is fairly conventional with very little arc to the characters. In many regards it actually sets up more like a horror movie than action/adventure movie. In fact, there are numerous jump-scares and other horror movie devices throughout the movie.<br/><br/>In many ways, it felt like the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be. Is it a monster movie? A horror movie? An action movie (anti-war)? There are also numerous characters who seem like they were intended to play more significant roles. For instance they bring along a biologist, played by Tian Jing, who does no biology and seems to mainly appear to allow another character to give exposition. Similarly most of the LandSat team, who seem to be around for comic relief (horror movie style comic relief). Even some of the major characters do little aside from provide a single plot piece.<br/><br/>Then there is Kong. I think they could have spent a bit more time developing Kong, partly as a character and partly as an animation. The CGI was pretty good, but his proportions looked wrong and his motions were wooden.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think there was just too much going on, and not enough time for this movie to be really good. I think it could have been an excellent mini-series, or TV season. As it is, it's an okay movie, that is fun if you go in with a low-bar. 6/10, so I enjoyed it, but not enough."

"Quinoa1984","8","40","82","11 March 2017"," Kong Rocks - practically all of this does too; a sharp, smart, exciting blockbuster
","Though not without a few WTF moments - and not in the way that is fun but more head-scratching, like a couple of characters dying out of nowhere - this is the most entertaining monster movie since The Host and possibly from Hollywood since... well, the Jackson King Kong (though it also has some debt to Jurassic Park and, to a degree a friend reminded me after seeing the film, Aliens). Aside from what is in the movie in and of itself, which is plenty as an ironic and satirical blockbuster (at least up to a point, in small but enough doses), as a world-building enterprise it's spectacular, and is a step up from the previous entry in this new WB/Legendary ""Moster-Kaiiju-Verse"", Godzilla.<br/><br/>I think the difference between the two is simple but profound: Edwards was fascinated more with spectacle and the presence of Godzilla, but he wasn't so set on building human characters to connect with (except for Bryan Cranston, who was shamefully wasted after a promising start). Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts is all about characters, and even gives some time to people who should be nothing secondary ones (I know the complaints already coming, that there are too many, and that may be true - on a first viewing I was fine with it for the simple fact that the dialog given to these military runts and other scientist-types were either funny or clever enough. Everyone has charisma and characters who need to have chemistry (Hiddleston-Larson, or Larson and Kong) give it enough juice in that area.<br/><br/>But more than that is that Kong himself is done right by the writers and filmmakers. Unlike in Godzilla as well, here we have a character who actually IS a character, someone who functions in the story, shows deeper wells of emotion (yes, a carry-over from the best of the 1933 and 2005 Kong movies is that Kong is vulnerable), and finds through non-verbal communication how to connect - or decidedly not, quite the opposite - with these Vietnam war hosts. He has goals and real motivations; while they are steeped in monster movie lore, it's sharp and exciting monster movie lore, and things are explained by John C. Reilly here and there (he's the 28-years-gone survivor of being left during WW2, a more innocent-yet-still-bloody time in US history, also with us vs some Asian menace), yet a lot is left to the imagination.<br/><br/>How do these prehistoric-ish ""Skull Crawlers"" come out from these blasts put out by these helicopters? Who knows? Who cares? The point is these giant lizard things are genuinely terrifying; there's some limited creativity in their designs, but what's exciting is that the direction is all about drawing out suspense. And the island itself has many surprises (there's one point where a creature is revealed as something you would thing you could sit on!) and also with the natives who are... just scenery, mostly, but at least the movie doesn't try to go too far into cultural insensitivity or anything. They're simply there and do what they can for the Reilly character over these many years; Reilly, by the way, scruffy and laughing often and happy even as he is totally terrified (""I've only been here 28 years,"" he says at one point up against military/US egotism personified by Samuel L Jackson) is what Bryan Cranston was to Godzilla, only here there is much more and he's possibly the best human presence in the movie.<br/><br/>How about the satire, if it is there? I think there's more that could be dissected with it being Vietnam, or more specifically in 1973 as Nixon is preparing for pulling out troops (of course that wouldn't be for a full two years later, but you get the idea). Jackson's Col Packard is trying to hide his anguish at having to ""abandon"" this war (he can't bare to say defeat) so this other South-East conflict will do; it's Us vs Them and Us as usual not recognizing all of our might is insignificant when on their turf. It's not the sharpest commentary ever, but it's not without accident it's there either. The iconography is compelling as well: all of those helicopters, blasting away Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"" as these charges drop on the island - asking for it, in monster movie fashion (messing with nature, you fools!), but this time there's the added element of how soldiers and civilians act, and recognizing who is ""King"" in the end.<br/><br/>This is a spectacular good time at the movies, in case I didn't make that clear. All of the actors are doing excellent work, the kind that you would never get to see back when monster movies were in the realm of square B-movie territory. If anything this would be a splendid double feature with Jurassic Park (aside from the eye-roll at Jackson repeating a ""butts"" line straight-faced, as if the movie would be in trouble unless he did it), as both involve charismatic, memorable actors and relatively decent supporting characters facing off against monsters that are from another time and place, with snappy dialog, and visual effects that are out of this world. And the climax - my Kong! Spinkle some 70's Vietnam-Rock icing and you got yourself a blockbuster cake of exceptional proportions."

"dgranger","10","31","62","11 March 2017"," They finally got King Kong right!
","Look, when the story of King Kong was first written, he was meant to be scary and then he becomes the hero as men mistakenly try to kill him. It was meant to be a scary but action story all along. The film that was able to pull off the bring Kong into the city was the first one. Every single remake after that, the movie starts to go wrong after they try to bring King Kong off of the island and into the city. This movie wisely jettisons all that and keeps it as an action movie with some horrific monsters in it and some horrific moments in it. It also wisely gets rid of the monkey falling in love with the human girl. And it still accomplishes the same goals as the original does. Kong it first seen as a monster but eventually turns into a hero protecting men from something worse, usually cause by man's own stupidity as happens in this film. Kong is protecting the natives on the island from the other monsters on the island that the bombs that Goodman's character drops and awakens. The best part of this movie is John C. Riley's character of a WW2 vet who was stranded on the island for twenty five years and who know what to do and what not to do and he tries to stop Samuel Jackson crazy gung-ho marine character from killing Kong because, if Kong dies, who is going to stop the skull eaters from killing the rest of the people on the island. The action is well paced and intense. Too intense for little kids as the film shows people getting eaten or crushed to death. This is not a film you should let younger children see. This is too intense and gory for young kids. The effects are top notch. I will say one thing. SIT THROUGH THE CREDITS! There is a killer after the credits scene at the end of the film. The only tip off to it is in the credits after the song credits where the list credits of using classic monster images that didn't appear in the film. The after the credits scene explains that."

","As far as big blockbusters go, Kong: Skull Island is not half bad. The first 30 minutes or so pass by and plays out in typical fashion, the soldier stereotype as seen in countless films meat headed with a gung ho mentality. Which in essence is a moral of the film ""don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs unless you're picking a fight"". The first 30 mins despite the roaring action is pretty dull, the CG graphics are pretty spellbinding the detail on Kong specifically.<br/><br/>Not until John c Reilly turns up was I fully invested and in all honesty he steals the show. He provides a couple of dazzling lines and weirdly enough injects some much needed heart into a so far emotionless ride.<br/><br/>The music was good except it suffered from the ""suicide squad"" syndrome it was over used almost to breaking point. An excellent use of Jefferson airplanes white rabbit can always be forgiven though. Kong references a whole bunch of other films some obvious choices, others not so obvious.

"dee.reid","9","33","67","10 March 2017"," Into the ""Heart of Darkness"" with King Kong
","2017's ""Kong: Skull Island"" was a much better film than I anticipated it to be. Perhaps my enjoyment of the film was strengthened by the fact that I didn't go into it with very many expectations - as I had shielded myself from the hype and plot details for months, ever since it was announced that the film was being produced.<br/><br/>Boy, am I glad that I cared little, at first, to read or see anything regarding this picture. (I honestly did not care to see the film, period, but my curiosity got the better of me and I'm glad that it did.)<br/><br/>What I did know, before going in, was that ""Kong: Skull Island"" was meant to reboot and reintroduce King Kong for the modern era - and set up a possible future crossover with ""Godzilla"" (2014); Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures are behind the whole thing. (And rumors suggest that ""Pacific Rim"" may figure in there somewhere, too.) I'm 31, going on 32. I grew up on the original 1933 ""King Kong,"" as well as the 1962 Japanese kaiju-eiga (Japanese monster movie) ""King Kong vs. Godzilla,"" which saw America's Eighth Wonder of the World go head-to-head against Japan's mighty King of the Monsters. (""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" is referenced here, too, in one brief eagle-eyed scene, just to show that the filmmakers had in fact done their homework.) Honestly, 2020 cannot get here fast enough for this monster movie fan.<br/><br/>But back to ""Kong: Skull Island."" Let me just say, this film did not disappoint in the slightest. I saw the film with a good friend of mine (which enhanced the experience for me on a deeply personal level). I was surprised to find the picture working from its opening moments, which begins in World War II before fast-forwarding to 1973 during the height of the Vietnam War era. Mixing the story of the original 1933 ""King Kong"" with elements of ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) (and its source material, the novella ""Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Conrad) and ""Platoon"" (1986), plus the South Korean monster movie ""The Host"" (2006) and the critically acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki Anime' ""Princess Mononoke"" (1997), ""Kong: Skull Island"" proves to be one of the more original films of its genre - since I did not know much of this beforehand.<br/><br/>The story involves a scientific expedition led by Bill Randa (John Goodman) and his young associate Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) to the titular Skull Island, an uncharted destination located somewhere in the Pacific Ocean that he compares to the Bermuda Triangle, and he has a small helicopter contingent of the U.S. Army led by Lieutenant Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) as a military escort. Leading them all into the jungle (the ""Heart of Darkness""), is an expert hunter-tracker and former British S.A.S. soldier named James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston). Once on the island, they come to make an amazing discovery of a world that time forgot - and it is ruled by a monster-god who is the last of his kind, but the ""King"" of his domain...<br/><br/>This version of King Kong is a true force to be reckoned with. Brilliantly motion-captured by Terry Notary, this is a Kong that can think and displays ample cunning and intelligence, and attitude. Reimagined here as a fierce protector of his homeland (but whose role is not unchallenged by some of the other ungodly prehistoric beasts on Skull Island), it'll be very interesting to see him go toe-to-toe with Godzilla in three years. That should be an incredible monster battle re-match from when they first fought in 1962.<br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" is a film that had me on the edge of my seat pretty much the entire time that I was watching it. It's not perfect, but director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has crafted a wonderful first entry into a possible amazing franchise. Its screenplay is credited to three writers, one of whom is Max Borenstein, who was on-board 2014's ""Godzilla"" (and thereby sealing the behind-the-scenes connection to that film). Where the film may ultimately fall short, are in its characterizations. While Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly (in a surprise cameo halfway through the film) give the most note-worthy performances, you do care about what happens to everyone, even lesser developed characters like Packard's straight-laced right-hand man Jack Chapman (an effective Toby Kebbell, who also motion-captured Kong's performance along with Terry Notary). My personal favorite character was U.S. Army pilot Slivko (Thomas Mann). Maybe it's because I like Thomas Mann a lot as an actor and that I've enjoyed everything I've seen him in (namely 2012's ""Project X""), that I gravitated mostly toward his character here and hoped he made it out okay.<br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" is a thoroughly enjoyable monster film from start to finish. I had my fun with it. My lack of knowledge beforehand undoubtedly helped me like this movie a lot more than I thought I would, I think. I'm glad that I had the chance to see it yesterday with my friend.<br/><br/>P.S.: Its soundtrack features many songs from the Vietnam era (Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid""!), and if you enjoy the music from that time, you'll probably like the movie a whole lot more.<br/><br/>P.S. #2: Stay through the lengthy end credits. You won't regret it. Serious.<br/><br/>9/10"

To my surprise, this movie not only lived up to my expectations, but actually exceeded it. The highlight is the monsters, and Kong, the titular monster dominates the screen literally and figuratively. The cinematography was excellent and fully captured the beauty and majesty of the island. The monster shots were perfect, it created the sense of awe and dread of seeing such gigantic beasts roaming around. The monster fights were also fresh, and not just two beasts hugging and roaring. Finally, we get to see Kong as never before, fearsome, majestic, and kind with being too dramatic. The used of 3D was well thought since it transports us to a were where giant creatures could really exist. On the other hand, the human story plays a minor role but serves to move the plot forward; since it is the humans who helped unleash the fury of Kong, and other monsters. However, we cannot deny the brilliant performances of great talents like Samuel L. Jackson who manages to make a generic character feel relatable. John C. Reilly and John Goodman, who are side characters manage to steal the scene from leads Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson. Not to say Tom Hiddleston is not talented, but he is not given much to do as a leading man. Despite the flaws, this movie is a brilliant example of how monster movies should be made, and I can't wait for the follow up as hinted in the post-credit scene.

I didn't expect it to be any good, maybe Jurrassic World level ""fun"" at best, but it was a genuinely good movie I enjoyed a lot. Not only were the visuals beautiful, the CGI was great, but what stood out to me was definitely the amount of fun ideas they had, a few beautifully done animals, a few really creative scenes, and some really fun nods to earlier movies that totally made sense in universe, without being too on the nose. It was definitely the most fun I've had at the movies this year so far, maybe due to my low expectations, but it was just really really well done as well. Now obviously you shouldn't expect some masterpiece, it's still a movie about a big monkey, but as far as blockbusters go, this was a great one.<br/><br/>Spoiler review:<br/><br/>As I just mentioned I loved a lot of the ideas they had, the flashing camera for instance was a great idea that made for a great scene and you felt the suspense perfectly, and the gas-mask-samurai scene was so incredibly ridiculous but that's what made it so fun. I loved the small nods to the earlier movies, like the ""love interest"" of Kong being there, yet really not coming into play at all during the movie, and the chains Kong was wrapped up in, yet broke loose of. I really enjoyed the editing as well, from the small bobble heads to the clear fighting scenes. Nothing felt hurried, nothing felt slow. I remember one wide-shot of Kong fighting the big skull crawler that was absolutely gorgeous. <br/><br/>Now my only real complaint of this movie lays in his villain. It's Samuel L. Jackson playing Samuel L. Jackson. His motive made sense, his character made sense, but in the end, it's still another man scared of something bigger than him. I believe his inclusion wasn't completely necessary, and they could've probably relied on them just trying to escape the island, but I get why they needed a villain in there. All in all, apart from the villain and a few jokes that fell flat, it was as good as a King Kong movie can be."

I kept thinking of his lines from Pulp Fiction every time he spoke. I kept thinking he would shout out a similar line to his Snakes on a Plane signature remark. The rest of the cast was okay but some of the characters were unnecessary. That was no problem as the action spoke louder than the chance of any ruination of a movie by the same old Armageddon,Prometheus, & Interstellar dumb crew members on a super serious mission.<br/><br/>I like the 1976 and 2005 King Kong movies too, but this one is my new favorite. I read in many reviews here that if you like this movie you must be a real dummy. I don't get why anyone would say that. This was better than the last two Godzilla movies any way you slice it. I saw this at an IMAX in Real D and it blew me away. I'll buy it on DVD when it comes out on DVD. Let the haters hate, because I predict word of mouth is going to make this a very successful film.

","For a non-American like me i don't really know much about King Kong or his influence on modern day monster movie but that not a problem to hold me back from watching this movie in theater and it was an absolute blast to finally knowing the King of monster movie in America:Kong.I actually did a research and find out the plot of this movie is kinda similar to the original movie in 1933,it both follow a group of people travel to a unknown island soon find themselves being hunt and chase by a giant ape called Kong for trespassing his territory and disturb the peace of the island.First time directing monster movie Jordan Vogt-Roberts did a fantastic job on shooting the island with beautiful cinematography that deliver the savage look of Kong and the rest of monster on island as well.The cast is very large and full of talented actors like Tom Hiddleston,Samuel L. Jackson... and surprisingly John C. Reilly that brought many good and comedic moment so when there aren't any monster around the movie don't feel boring and dragging to watch.Of course everyone favorite parts is always the monster fight scene and this movie has plenty of it although for the most time is not all involved with Kong but trust me when the fight happen seeing Kong punching,kicking and throwing stuff is a very crowd pleasing moment(My favorite is the final fight).It maybe not all that great for some hardcore fan of the series but for new fan like me this is the best monster movie i saw since Pacific Rim.I strongly suggest audience going to see that movie please wait until the after credit"

It just goes from point A to point B with lots of wiz-bang cartoon (CGI) creatures fighting, some people doing stuff, and none of it we really care about. If I was 10, the cartoon (CGI) parts might impress me, but as an adult, I just didn't care about any of it, have no interest in ever wasting time watching it again, and CERTAINLY DON'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.

","Skull island. A movie of titanic proportions starring Kong. The idealistic lone survivor whose ability is to protect the inhabitants from strange, and often vicious creatures that lurk about hunting for prey. Tom Hiddleston who plays John Conrad that is a merc for hire accompanies Bill Randa (John Goodman)to a place no human eyes has seen for over ten thousand years. An island hidden away in a thick stormy mist as a means of a deterrent for curious people. Among them are a military escort led by Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and one photographer Mason Weaver, (Brie Larson). Together they unravel the mystery surrounding the island's policies.<br/><br/>In the middle of it all is the great, and fearsome gorilla who stands sixty feet tall, and weighs in at close to 200 hundred tons. Kong. A name that has been revered for over seventy years by fans all over the world. A brutish violent yet passive ape when he wants to be. Just don't disrespect his island for too long or you will become his next target. As the troupe moves in to try, and bring down the behemoth led by Packard both John, and Mason begin to understand Kong's point of view of why he brought down the colonels helicopter squadron in the first place.<br/><br/>Marred with memories of loss during the Vietnam Conflict, Packard does not want to listen to reason of keeping Kong alive simply because the colonel believes that man is the ultimate king of the world. Was he ever wrong in that department. The movie has loads of action, building sized creatures who battle for territory and a lonely bunch of villagers who do not involve themselves in gorilla politics. Added to the film was music tracks of old time rock, mixed with the existential belief that life is equal including Kong himself. A wonderful cast such as Tom who's only role I knew of was playing Loki from the Thor franchise. He did a great job in his role as did all of the other cast members.<br/><br/>Kong will most likely have another sequel soon. Possibly with more plot such as being smuggled off the island back to New York by one of the surviving members of the team. Who knows. But until then this is a fantastic monster flick with loads of fun for both creatures, and audiences alike. Maybe a duel off with Kong, and Godzilla."
"hegedus_dani02","9","31","63","10 March 2017"," The monster movie you've been waiting for!
","First, I have to admit, that despite this feature, I only saw Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) in movie history's largest monster's franchise, although I read many articles about the famous original film released in 1933. I heard mixed reviews about Kong: Skull Island, but mainly due to the first trailer I was pretty eager to watch it. Particularly the visuals made me curious; that scene in the trailer when the giant ape stretches up with the shrinking sun in the background is just astonishing (of course the hole sequence is even more fascinating in the movie). I also heard about Warner Brothers' and Legendary's plans about the so called MonsterVerse, and I really wanted it to have a proper second installment (I think we shouldn't consider Gareth Edwards's Godzilla a headstart for the cinematic universe) after the massive failure of the latest two films in the DCU. <br/><br/>So I set in the cinema with relatively high expectations... and I got what I wanted and even more. Probably the main reason why the movie is working is because that it isn't take itself too seriously at all and don't want to be anything more than an entertaining monster movie. Unfortunately, many films fell because they either want to be too dark (trying to reach the greatness of Christopher Nolan or Guillermo del Toro) and too stylish (copying Zack Snyder, Robert Rodriguez or even some works of Ridley Scott or Tony Scott, such as Black Hawk Down and Man on Fire). So, as I hoped and expected the visuals are just simply breathtaking. Peter Jackson can literally hide with the enormous battle scenes in The Lord of the Rings. This is really the movie why IMAX 3D was invented. Also, the astonishing cinematography and editing are crucial for the movie's success. The last movie, I saw in the cinema with better camera work than in Kong: Skull Island was Denis Villenuve's Arrival... and it was in last year's November. Kong: Skull Island is also pretty stylish and full of slow-motions, stop-motions and hero-shots, but doing it in an extremely good way. I think Michael Bay should definitely learn from these guys who made this flick. I cannot describe the visuals more precisely, you have to go and see it for yourself. <br/><br/>Of course, there aren't any Oscar-winning roles, but the performances are just simply fine. We know that Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson can act in serious movies, John Goodman's eyebrow lifts are nearly as entertaining as in the Coen brothers' The Big Lebowski, and we won't expect much more from Tom Hiddlestone (though maybe his Globe win may confute this). The soundtrack is just amazing. Both the remarkable songs and some catchy new tunes pleasure your ears while watching. Kong: Skull Island is the perfect example for that the movie is an audiovisual experience. <br/><br/>Every film lover should definitely watch Kong: Skull Island. Though I consider myself as a harsh certificate on IMDb (my ratings are usually below the average), I gave it a 9."
"cruise01","9","24","47","10 March 2017"," Kong is big, loaded with action and visuals.
","Kong: Skull Island is an awesome monster film that fits right in there in the whole MonsterVerse that the movie studio is trying to build up on. Like the 2014 Godzilla film was trying to do. Kong film is fast paced; plenty of action visual sequences, and does have some stunning direction with its Vietnam/1970s style. Kong: Skull Island is more into the whole big fun blockbuster style type of film compared to 2005's Peter Jackson's King Kong that paid homage to the original and had development with characters and story. Even Kong in the 2005 film had more of a personality and emotions than this film. Does not make this film terrible or anything, which this one had more of an action packed adventure and Kong being bigger and viewed as a King of the island. <br/><br/>The plot follows Bill Randa (John Goodman) and seismologist Houston (Corey Hawkins) hiring Former Special Ops James (Tom Hiddleston) to be their tracker for their expedition to Skull Island. Hoping to discover an ecosystem of species that has yet to be discovered. Teamed up with a military unit led by Preston (Samuel L. Jackson). They discover that man is not on the top link on the planet when they come across Kong. Realizing that there are other beasts and Two legged lizard monsters known as Skullcrawlers. <br/><br/>What I really loved about Kong: Skull Island is it was well paced compared to the 2005 film. You did not have to wait 40 or so minutes to see Kong. The film had a little faster set up. Bill Randa proposing his plan to the government and than recruiting a team for his expedition to a tracker James, Military unit, and even a photographer Mason (Brie Larson). Next thing you know, a thrilling sequence with several helicopters arriving on the island and running into Kong. It goes from there with people trying to survive the dangers of the island from flying prehistorically birds, a mountain sized Kong, and Skullcrawlers. Kong's battle with a giant octopus was stunning. Even the climatic battle with the skullcrawlers was pretty awesome. The visual effects were spectacular. It could also be quite overwhelming seeing some cheesy noticeable effects with the choppers formation and being attacked by Kong. This is a fun sized blockbuster film, which goes all out with a lot of action, visuals, and keeping up with the pace. Cinematographer Larry Fong had entertaining set ups with the camera work. There may be a first person moment as a character is firing a weapon at a giant ant, or using a sword on a flying monster. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts had a fun style, having a 1970s soundtrack, a Vietnam tone. Or having spectacular scene set up with Kong rising in front of a sunset. There are plenty of those sequences set-ups. <br/><br/>One slight issue I had with Kong: Skull Island is I was really hoping for a longer battle with Kong fighting against a giant Skullcrawler. The climax was exciting and big and awesome as it is. I felt like it was short in a way, which I wanted to see more of. <br/><br/>Otherwise, Kong: Skull Island is a really good monster film with plenty of action, awesome set pieces, and a great cast ensemble. Also there is a scene after the credits that set up for a special surprise. I would rate Kong: Skull Island 4.5 out of 5."

","This isn't a horror movie, it's a war movie, with an ape incidental to the plot...and it ends the way we've always wanted this particular movie to end. (I hope this isn't considered a SPOILER) <br/><br/>Beginning with the opening credits, displayed in a unique and original style setting the stage and explaining the plot while rapidly spanning from 1944 to 1973 as the cast is shown, the story leaps directly into the action, without all the talky exposition, while the end credits promise Things to Come. This is not only an exciting action adventure flick, but also a beautifully photographed film. Part of it is reminiscent of the WW2 movie A Walk in the Sun, and there will be many pointing out a resemblance in tone to Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>There were characters I hoped would survive and regretted when they didn't. A good many of them play against type, which is refreshing. Juxtaposition of some shots foreshadow later scenes. The parallels between scenes of Col. Packard and Kong in body language isn't to be missed and definitely points out these two characters' relationship.<br/><br/>AS for the monsters themselves...original, imaginative, and definitely deadly. (Loved the giant water buffalo, by the way.) Beautiful scenery and creative filming, with unusual camera angles aren't to be missed. If I were asked,I'd nominate the cinematographer as well as the special effects people for Oscars. Having seen ALL the Kong films, from the original to the Jack Black version (which I also like in spite of critics views to ebb contrary), I easily give this one 10/10."

"mitchellsterlace","9","26","53","11 March 2017"," Marlon Brando really let himself go
","This movie destroys most of all the things I never understood about the old king kong movies. First, this movie's violence is extremely well used, placed, and made. The CGI in this movie was some of the best I have literally ever seen. Coming from the guy who thought Tarkin in Rogue One was amazing. The next best thing in this movie is the acting, and before you think this guy has some low standards listen. This movie is not supposed to be an ""acting movie."" the characters are there to have five or six to like and one or two to love. and this casting assemble killed this and understood that. This is a person who loves retro, throwbacks, and all styles paradise. REASONS I LOVED IT!! ONE - They toned down the love affair between the lead female charter and kong. TWO - The two leads that so happen to be opposite genders don't have to fall in love. THREE - Kong, for the most part, is saving HIS ISLAND more than the humans. FOUR - The movie realizes that it's not a FREAKING REALISTIC MOVIE!! You can have things like a man using a samurai sword and unconventional uses of violence to make it BADASS (ONE OF THE MAIN REASON Tarantino IS LOVED SO MUCH!!!) FIVE - it's downright hilarious in so many scenes. If you hate movies designed for just making money and love to see an original action-packed film this comes both in such an amazing way."
"dave-mcclain","9","26","53","10 March 2017"," Simply fantastic!
","Tarzan may be ""Lord of the Jungle"" and Godzilla is called ""King of the Monsters"", but King Kong bows to no one â€“ man or beast. He is, after all, ""The Eighth Wonder of the World"", according to the original movie. American filmmaker Merian C. Cooper (who co-directed that film) named and created the character of the giant ape, with minor contributions from British writer Edgar Wallace (whom Cooper had hired to write the script, but who died early in the revisions process). The result was the iconic 1933 film â€“ followed by several other movie versions and multiple representations of Cooper's monster in various media and other forms. Over a 72 year span, three films carried the simple title ""King Kong"".<br/><br/>That first version (starring Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot) is dated by today's standards, but featured groundbreaking special effects and music with a script written by Ruth Rose, the wife of co-director Ernest B. Schoedsack (at a time when there were a higher proportion of female screenwriters than today) and remains high on many all-time best lists. The cast of the 1976 remake (produced by famed Italian filmmaker Dino De Laurentiis and directed by the prolific John Guillermin) was led by Charles Grodin and then-20-somethings Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange (in her film debut). 2005's ""King Kong"" starred Naomi Watts, Adrien Brody, Jack Black & Andy Serkis and was directed by Peter Jackson. The original has higher ratings on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes than its sequels, but all made big profits.<br/><br/>The various cinematic incarnations of the titular great ape have seen him with different personalities (sometimes as a wantonly destructive beast and others as a sympathetic anti-hero), at different sizes (portrayed between 12 feet and 60 feet tall) and with different levels of human-like characteristics (for example, walking upright in the 1933 and 1976 versions, but on all-fours for the 2005 movie). He also battled his rival for the title of biggest, baddest monster in the 1962 Japanese film (and its 1963 re-edited American version), ""Godzilla vs. King Kong"", which became and remains the most-attended Godzilla film of all. Regardless of how he looks or what he is doing, the colossal primate has become such a fixture in our cultural consciousness that the 2017 version need only refer to him by a single name, joined with a reference to what outsiders call his kingdom: ""Kong: Skull Island"" (PG-13, 1:58).<br/><br/>Rather than another remake of the original 1933 version, 2017's mammoth monkey movie is a reboot. It's an origin story for the King Kong character and the second installment in Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse series which began with 2014's ""Godzilla"" reboot. ""Kong: Skull Island"" leads into another Godzilla movie, followed by a King Kong â€“ Godzilla crossover. A clever and game-changing post-credits scene reveals the connection and sets the stage for the coming movies. Meanwhile, this one, although based on an original story by John Gatins (""Real Steel"") and a script by Dan Gilroy (""The Bourne Legacy""), Max Borenstein (""Godzilla"") and Derek Connolly (""Jurassic World""), had a number of cinematic influences. According to director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, those films include ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"", ""Princess Mononoke"", ""Spirited Away"" and even ""PokÃ©mon"". After seeing ""Kong: Skull Island"", I'd have to add ""Jurassic Park"" to that list. However, as compared to the former, the latter isÂ… a walk in the park.<br/><br/>After that admittedly overly long introduction (which really only just scratched the surface of the background and influences to ""Kong: Skull Island""), it's finally time to talk about the movie's plot: In 1973, government official William ""Bill"" Randa (John Goodman) and scientist Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) convince a Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins) to support their proposed mapping expedition of a mysterious island in the South Pacific. Bill and Houston travel to Vietnam where they hire former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to lead the mission. They also secure a military escort from U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his ""Sky Devils"" helicopter squadron, which includes his executive officer, Major Jack Chapman (Tony Kebbell), and a diverse and colorful group of experienced soldiers. Rounding out this large group of misfits are other government representatives (John Ortiz and Marc Evan Jackson), another young scientist (Tian Jing) and Mason Weaver (Oscar winner Brie Larson), a war photographer who is suspicious of the expedition's purpose.<br/><br/>After flying through storm clouds which perpetually surround the island and keep it isolated from the rest of the world, the helicopters start dropping seismic charges, ostensibly as part of the mapping mission. The de facto simian ruler of this island doesn't take kindly to anyone disturbing his home. Kong (walking upright, appearing to be about 100 feet tall and played through motion capture by Terry Notary) takes out his anger on those helicopters, killing about half of the expedition's personnel in the process. The survivors, separated into small groups (and one individual) with limited communications, all set out for the other side of the island, where they are to be picked up in three days. Along the way, they encounter a variety of large, unique and deadly creatures, a tribe of island natives and an American (John C. Reilly) who has been stranded on the island for many years. Meanwhile, Lt. Col. Packard, as obsessed as Captain Ahab in ""Moby Dick"", is determined to avenge the loss of his men at all costs.<br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" is simply fantastic! The casting, characterizations and acting are especially strong, the fight scenes and visual effects are even stronger and King Kong appears appropriately powerful, and terrifying, but also sympathetic. Rather than simply building towards one huge showdown, there are surprises and exciting moments throughout the film, but the intensity is well-balanced with some comic relief, mostly from the loopiness of Reilly's character. This film is at least as good as previous Kong movies, or 2014's ""Godzilla"", and is a terrific lead-in to subsequent adventures. ""A"""

","Finally! A worthy reboot (remake) of the very famous monster! I was very very entertained with this movie. It was full of surprising scenes and many crazy fight scenes between Kong and the soldiers, plus Kong and other monsters. The special effects of this movie were absolutely wonderful. Kong was created using motion capture techniques and the rest of the monsters were very lifelike (and scary). The sound effects were very good. There were so many moments where we would be surprised by the sudden movement (with those shocking sounds) during the movie. <br/><br/>What I loved about the movie was also the essence of King Kong story line like in previous movies were also captured, such as Kong's fight with major monsters, the intention of people to conquer him and even his fascination to the female character. And the time of the story which was in the 1970s also added a nice oldies feel to the movie. My wife also highlighted that she felt the movie was having a real 1970s sense which I think was due to the good make up (1970s hair style, suits) and equipments like the old choppers or Walkie Talkie you would usually see in movies with Vietnam wars.<br/><br/>Another thing that I loved about this movie was that the introductions of the characters did not take too long and it was moving in quite fast pace to the main story in the island. The film was almost perfect in providing nonstop entertainment and my wife and I also really enjoyed the full movie. At the top I have mentioned that the movie is a worthy reboot since I believe this movie excel in comparison to the 2005 version. Despite that movie's quite loyal to the earlier 1930s and 1970s versions, I felt that the 2005 movie was not giving the wow factor and scary feeling of what King Kong was supposed to make to audience. <br/><br/>Anyway, in conclusion to this movie, I definitely say it is one of the coolest action monster movie. There was not a lot of drama in it, just pure adrenaline pumping action film. The movie also had some brief funny moments and touching moment before the end. Oh before I forgot, this movie has got a post credit scene. So better watch out for it coz the scene would provide you some very interesting insight and exciting future films. <br/><br/>So for those of you who had not seen the movie yet, please make sure you watch it as I am sure you would be very entertained with this film. Those who prefer to watch drama or romance or Oscar winning movie, then I would recommend to see it without over thinking and just enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>For my complete review: Pls see michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"

Initially, we're led to believe they are lead by Kong, we later learn they are being kept at bay by him.<br/><br/>I was slightly worried by its writing credits "" Story by John Gatins, screenplay by Dan Gilroy and Max Borenstein and Derek Connolly "" which, as per Writer's Guild regulations means that each of the writers worked separately, independent of each other, which is why their names are all separated by the word * and *, rather than a comma, or an ampersand ( & ) , which might lead to a scatter shot, cluster**** of a screenplay, but my concerns were quickly forgotten, as this is engaging from minute one. <br/><br/>The filmmakers got away with a lot of gore, and a bit more violence than expected, considering the film's PG rating, which usually results in a watered down, family friendly time-waster. But the film has several moments of gore, and its climactic battles were surprisingly violent and gory, but not distractingly so. <br/><br/>A lot of intentional humour also relieves the tension, and gives the audience a chance to breathe, in between carnage.<br/><br/>Two minor quibbles: the overuse of classic rock songs (which bore me due to their overexposure in general) and the under-use of beautiful Tian Jing (who is mostly just standing in the background, and has only a handful of lines in the entire film)"

Investors hire army guys to go to a hidden island for research but in reality it is to prove the existence of monsters. They anger Kong, so he kills some of the men and commander wants revenge. Some of the others realize Kong is of importance to the island after meeting a long lost WWII soldier.

It's thirty minutes before getting to the island. Fifteen minutes is plenty. I don't care about Randa's backstory or the political backdrop of the situation. John C. Reilly is off trying to do comedy by himself. Kong lacks the needed humanity. The best is the monster action and Kong fits well in that aspect. The giant spider is amazing creepiness. The movie needs more of those types of thrills. This is an old-fashion monster movie with state of the art effects."

","Color me surprised, as Kong: Skull Island is better than it had any right to be - meaning it's harmless popcorn fun rather than unwatchable tripe. Sure, it's dumber than a brood of drunk chickens, but I don't walk into a Kaiju movie expecting Krzysztof Kieslowski.<br/><br/>Effects are neat, with convincing CGI renditions of the titular ape and the rest of the island's monstrous fauna. Script is serviceable; nobody is going to win writing awards for this, but at least it tries to develop a few characters other than the male and female leads (Hiddleston and Larson) - they're broad, but you can tell them apart.<br/><br/>The cast is rounded out by an exceptional trio of veterans: John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly. If the first two are somewhat subdued (too professional to phone it in but below their par), Reilly steals the movie as the WW2 pilot marooned on the Island for thirty years.<br/><br/>Bonus points for an acceptable 120 minutes running length, which is short for the bloated standard of modern blockbusters, and for avoiding a uselessly complicated plot - walking in, I was dreading a profusion of stupid MacGuffins, Pirates of the Caribbean-style (find the Magic Stone and the Ancient Staff to tame Kong in the Temple of Evil...). Nothing of the sort, the goal is simply to get out of Skull Island uneaten. Thanks.<br/><br/>So? It's a watchable action/adventure with giant monsters. If this is your kind of thing, shut your higher cerebral functions off and open wide.<br/><br/>6,5/10"

","Knowing I'm probably the last person on Earth to review this movie, I arrived at the theater intentionally avoided reading any reviews online or tweets. I did my best to come into this film blind and expected the unexpected. What I got was a strange ""Jurassic World- esque"" film with uninteresting characters, with a great cast by the way, failed attempts at comedic moments, and overall the movie just felt strange. However there is enjoyment to be had in the film. The best part of the movie is King Kong. He's big and loud. A smart ape that will fight for his territory. Also the photography is fantastic. You really feel the scope of the island."
"sossevarvo","7","15","28","9 March 2017"," Kong - an exciting, satisfying monster mashup
","The construction of cinematic universes seems to be the new fad of commercial Hollywood, ever since the Marvel train came along with the original Iron Man and proceeded to churn out hit after universe-expanding hit. Now, we have a ""Monsters"" universe, with Kong back just a decade after Peter Jacksons (superior) rendition of the character to tie into the universe of the lacklustre Godzilla film of 2014. <br/><br/>Fortunately Kong: Skull Island manages to feel like its own movie. What separates this new addition to the Kong mythos from all other films of its ilk is its distinctive visual aesthetic, an aesthetic I can only assume is a gargantuan love letter to Apocalypse Now. Vittorio Storaro's iconic cinematography from Coppola's classic has been reinvented in spades with state of the art CGI effects. Every two minutes or so we are treated to a breathtaking shot - mist and fog are thrillingly utilised, as well as a night scene eerily similar to the Do Long Bridge sequence of Apocalypse Now. While this is perhaps relying too much on a far, FAR, better film, it was refreshing to know that at least from a visual standpoint there were genuine artistic influences that could be discerned, the sense that the filmmaker wanted to put a new spin on the monster formula. <br/><br/>The important thing to note is Kong and his wide array of monster peers deliver the goods. All of the action sequences are fluidly filmed, thrillingly executed, with breathtaking CGI and the help of such atmospheric cinematography as I detailed above. The monsters have real menace and bite, and they're imposing in all the right ways. Through what seems to be on location shooting, you also get a nice sense of Skull Island as a landscape, its harsh and alien nature. When the monsters attack it's always a blast. <br/><br/>Unfortunately when they don't attack, we have to rely on the characters, and there isn't much to rely on. Lazy characterisation and archetypal ""there purely to be killed"" characters are abound, and several great actors - Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Shea Whigham, John Goodman, Jason Mitchell, Toby Kebbell - are really shortchanged for genuine arcs and motivations. Luckily the sheer talent and likability of these actors makes up for a great deal, and when copious eye candy and monster throwdowns occur, it didn't bother me too much. Only John C Reilly and Samuel L Jackson truly stand out, and it's because their characters have genuine development and intrigue. <br/><br/>The soundtrack felt a tad on the nose, with popular 70s tunes, including CCR and Bowie, popping in and out for little reason other than to hamfistedly evoke an era in the broadest possible way. What cannot be faulted however is the film's pacing - there is never a dull moment, with the action and tension kept admirably flowing for a tight sub 2 hour run time ( a far cry from Peter Jackson's 3 hour epic ) In all I had a fun time with Kong. It's likely to leave my memory pretty soon, but that being said it delivers in spades on what anyone would savour in a crazy big budget monster movie spectacle as this, and even with poor characterisation, its visual appeal and effects make it worthy of recommendation."
"rockman182","7","9","15","11 March 2017"," Kong: Skull Island (2017)
","Kong: Skull Island When I heard that a cinematic ""Monsterverse"" was being planned, I got excited. I love giant monster films. There's something about a badass giant monster wrecking havoc that is so captivating. I think Godzilla (2014) was a bit slow and flawed from a storytelling perspective but the monster action scenes were fantastic and its really all you can ask for from a monster film. As expected its more or less the same deal with Kong: Skull Island. Its a flawed film but the monster scenes and the action is terrific.<br/><br/>The film follows a team of people who have been hired to explore the mysterious Skull Island. What the crew do not realize is that they have disturbed a giant inhabitant of the island: King Kong. Much like with Godzilla, Kong is a bit of an antihero. There are more dangerous creatures on Skull Island and Kong is a protector against them. The main foes in the film are giant lizard-like beings that kill whatever is in their way and are at war with King Kong. Much like other monster films, humans are caught in between. For my review, I will start with all the negatives before divulging into the positives. ï»¿ The characters in this film for the most part suck. They are bland, muted, unmotivated and just are there without much characterization. The ones with a bit of character (John C. Reilly) are fed uninspiring dialogue. The humorous moments are predictable and fall flat. Brie and Tom didn't have much chemistry and both characters were so bland and could have disappeared without notice. Its a relatively unknown director at the helm of this Kong film, I think he did a good job but the film would have prospered with a better script, characters, and direction. At times (not that often) the CGI looks ropy at best and its distracting (especially with the non Kong creatures).<br/><br/>Now the positives. Every scene with Kong in it is captivating and mesmerizing. There's more of Kong in this than say Godzilla in the 2014 reboot, which is nice. You don't want to overdo the monster presence and this film just had it right. The final battle between Kong and the skull crawler was fantastic. If you love monster films and blockbuster action sequences, prepare to be on the edge of your seat. Kong took a while to get used to but overall he looked great, had great visuals, and a nice roar. The poster scene with helicopters flying at Kong against the backdrop of the setting sun was incredible.<br/><br/>The film is flawed for sure. The human moments aren't very inspiring, its hard to connect with any of the characters, and there's a bit too many bland characters running around. However, if you are like me you are here for some epic monster v monster action and in that regard you will not be disappointed. I'm excited with the prospect of a Monsterverse. Also, stay tuned after the credits for something really great.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"Anurag-Shetty","8","18","35","12 March 2017"," A monster movie, that delivers exactly what it's supposed to.
","Kong: Skull Island is the second movie in Warner Bros. Pictures & Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse, after Godzilla(2014). A group of scientists, American soldiers, a British secret service agent & a photojournalist, travel to an unknown island in the Pacific. After arriving on the island, they soon discover that it is home to a giant ape, named Kong(Terry Notary). However, soon the group realizes that Kong is not the most dangerous thing on the island. Now, these guys have to do whatever they can to escape from Skull Island. <br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is a great film. This movie doesn't waste too much time establishing the backstories of its various characters. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has realized that people have come to watch the titular character in action & not watch the daily lives of its human characters. This is how it surpasses Godzilla(2014). That film took way too much time establishing the human characters & barely highlighted the titular monster. The story is pretty straightforward but, that's what we expect from a movie like this. The visual effects are flawless. The CGI-rendered King Kong, the skull crawlers & various other creatures in the movie, look extremely realistic. The action set pieces are fantastic & look even better in 3D. The highlight of the film is the climactic set piece. The cast do their best, with the star of the show clearly being the mighty ape. Tom Hiddleston is superb as James Conrad. Samuel L. Jackson is spectacular as Preston Packard. Brie Larson is outstanding as Mason Weaver. John C. Reilly is awesome as Hank Marlow. John Goodman is good as Bill Randa. Corey Hawkins is amazing as Houston Brooks. John Ortiz, Tian Jing, Toby Kebbell, Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann, Eugene Cordero & Marc Evan Jackson are brilliant as Victor Nieves, San, Jack Chapman, Mills, Cole, Slivko, Reles & Landsat Steve, respectively. Last but not the least, Terry Notary is mind blowing in his motion capture performance, as Kong. Kong: Skull Island is a must watch for fans of monster movies & everyone who watched Godzilla(2014). I can't wait for 2020's epic clash, Godzilla vs. Kong."
"rctguy75","9","21","42","12 March 2017"," An Action-Packed Thrill Ride! The best Kong film since the original!
","Ever since 1933, King Kong has thrilled and terrified audiences for over 80 years. The original film still stands as one of the most influential films of all time, and will always stand as the greatest of all the Kong films. This film has been one of my most anticipated films of the year. With an all-star cast and awesome trailer, this was promising to be an action-packed thrill ride. For me it did not disappoint. This is the best Kong film since the 1933 original!<br/><br/>WARNING! I will be explaining the plot in detail! So Spoiler Alert! Go and see this movie before you read my review. Okay, let's get started!<br/><br/>The plot of the film goes like this. The film begins with an American pilot, Hank Marlow, and a Japanese pilot during WWII crash- landing on an island. After a brief conflict and cameo by Kong, the film jumps to 1973. Two men: Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) are trying to get government support for an expedition to an uncharted island in the South Pacific which was just revealed by satellite images. They are able to get their support, an organize an elite team for their mission. They recruit a Vietnam War soldier Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his men, expert tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), and anti-war photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). Their mission begins as they fly through massive storm clouds to reach the island. They begin to drop bombs, which Brooks explains as they are mapping the surface of the island. In reality, they are trying to awaken the monsters on the island. Eventually, the team comes across Kong, and he is furious. Kong begins to swipe down all the helicopters in an effort to defend his turf. Several soldiers are lost in the attack.<br/><br/>Packard threatens Randa, asking him why they are really here. Randa reveals that they were really trying to prove that monsters exist, as Randa is part of a government organization known as Monarch. The team is separated and must meet up at the pick up site. Packard is trying desperately to find a lost soldier, Chapman. Meanwhile, Conrad, Weaver, and a few others find Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), who explains to them how he got there, and the mysterious beings known by him as Skull Crawlers. Packard continues endlessly to find Chapman, who unknown to him, has been devoured by a small Skull Crawler. After learning of Packard's true intentions of wanting to kill Kong, Conrad, Weaver and Marlow stand up to him, trying to defend Kong. However, Packard has accidentally awoken the big Skull Crawler, who chases the group as they try to escape the island. Kong has an enormous fight with the Skull Crawler, and the remaining survivors escape from the island.<br/><br/>The cast was a surprise for me in this movie. I really did like all the characters in this film. It took time to develop each character, and set up the cast as not just expendable. Some of the characters in the film die, but not all of them (No Spoilers Here!).<br/><br/>The film is no doubt, an action movie. From the beginning to the end, you are glued to your seat, watching an action-packed film with great CGI. Kong himself looks amazing, and a lot of the shots in the film are jaw-dropping. The Skull Crawlers are very menacing, and serve as the true villains of the film. The fight between Kong and the big Skull Crawler is extremely entertaining, and in my opinion, beats the V- Rex fight from Peter Jackson's Kong film. There are also a few other creatures, such as Buffaloes and a massive Spider, that are really there to entice the dangers of Skull Island. The island itself is very grand and very convincing. A lot of the sets, such as the boneyard are very detailed and realistic. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Kong Skull Island did not disappoint me. With a well- developed cast, interesting story, and fantastic action, this film has well deserved all the hype it has received. While nothing can top the original King Kong, this film has easily established itself as the king of all the other Kong films. It is massively entertaining and keeps going from beginning to end. Kong Skull Island is first in what should be a great year of blockbuster films. Kong Skull Island gets a 9/10 from me! Go and see it if you have not! You won't be disappointed!!!"
"Cluey","8","8","13","1 November 2017"," A 7/10 film that revels in being a 7/10 film. However, I give it an 8.
","I saw this film on the same day as Logan, and while that film was great it didn't leave as much of an impression on me as it seems to have done for other people.<br/><br/>Kong Skull Island - however - gets me excited thinking about it.<br/><br/>Let me clarify. For me there's nothing better than a film that knowingly commits to genre schlock and style. Something which Skull Island does in spades. The film wastes very little time getting to the action, which puts many people off this take but for me was an enormous breath of fresh air. We all know what King Kong looks like, we all know his M.O and we all know how these films go: first a foot, then a hand, then a glimpse here and there before there's a big scene with some screaming woman tied to a post before the monster can be seen in all its glory. Not here. Here we get straight to it, and I appreciate the film for not taking us down the same old path.<br/><br/>This film belongs to a new wave of film-making which is using pulp and new technology to carve its own film language. The influences here don't come from the oft dug classic directors and films - the influence here is pop-culture, pulp and anime. It sounds like a recipe for the most juvenile and dumb crap ever - but in choosing which elements to lift from each of these carefully, the film manages to create something really interesting. There's spots here of 50's B sci-fi, Vietnam movies and studio Ghibli films and it creates a very textured and rich set of visual moments. <br/><br/>On that note, this is a very visual and visceral film. The characters are pretty stock here - though enjoyable enough to watch, especially John C Reilly and Samuel L Jackson, who chew through the jungle with aplomb - their motivations are about as straightforward as you can get. The majority of the cast just want to get off the island except for Jackson, who wants to blow the hell out of a giant monkey and then get off the island (largely because he's salty about the U.S pulling out of 'Nam and wants to have a victory). <br/><br/>The straightforward narrative is pretty perfect for this sort of film, as there's nothing worse than a B-movie trying and failing to do complex character motivation (well there is, a serious film trying and failing, because then you don't even have the popcorn factor to fall back on). The objectives are all clear and nothing gets in the way of the action.<br/><br/>Which is amazing. Everything you want from this sort of creature feature is here. Giant spiders, weird dinosaurs giant octopuses all make an appearance and are combated in a variety of crazy and inventive ways. If you don't get a little quiver of excitement as Kong smashes a snake monster with a rusty anchor from a shipwreck then you are not wired for this sort of film.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's great fun"
"paul-allaer","8","14","26","13 March 2017"," Rousing and fun reboot of the Kong franchise
","""Kong: Skull Island"" (2017 release; 118 min.) starts a new chapter in the King Kong universe. As the movie opens, we are told it's ""South Pacific, 1943"", and a US pilot and Japanese pilot crash land on a beach, and while they are fighting each other, Kong appears out of the blue. Cue forward and now we are ""1973"" (as we see Nixon announce the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam). Bill Randa is able to get a US Senator to approve a 'mapping mission' of an unchartered island somewhere in the South Pacific. After some quick preparations, including getting a military escort, off we go to that mysterious island... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest reboot of the King Kong franchise, more than a decade since the last one (by Peter Jackson). This time, Kong is bigger and better and 'badder' than ever before, and with lots of other monsters on the island, much to our viewing pleasure. The movie has a distinct ""Apocalypse Now"" vibe going in the first part, even more so as the herd of helicopters approaches the island and is met by Kong. Once the action shifts to the island, there is a distinct ""Jurassic Park"" vibe to it. We all know fully well that there is a lot of CGI in the movie, yet it never bothered me, and in fact I'll see that the movie feels very authentic from that perspective. The support cast is okay, with John C. Reilly (as the stranded US pilot now 30 years later) absolutely stealing the show (sorry John Goodman, Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston, et al.). There is a terrific score to the movie, courtesy of veteran composer Henry Jackman, and there are also a ton of song placements (Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"", CCR's ""Run Through the Jungle"", etc.). BEWARE: this movie is rated PG-13 for a reason, as there are some frightening scenes that I believe are inappropriate for kids under the age of 10 or thereabouts.<br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" opened wide this past weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was sold out to the very last seat. The audience LOVED this movie, and gave it an applause when the end titles started rolling. ""Kong: Skull Island"" is nothing short of a rounding and fun reboot of the Kong franchise. I can't wait to see the next installment (reportedly due for 2019). ""Kong: Skull Island"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"autisticreviewers","7","14","26","9 March 2017"," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
","Following the route of the 2014 reboot of Godzilla, Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures re-team to continue to expand the 'MonsterVerse' with a retelling of the iconic classic King Kong. Packed with epic action, monsters and adventure, this movie doesn't fail for the fans for Kong and Godzilla.<br/><br/>The plot is basically straight forward and requires no brains for thinking and realism to be taken seriously; a group of Vietnam soldiers and explorers head out to the South Pacific to explore an island that may have signs of life and discovery. They find more than what they have been told with a massive and destructive gorilla that is hailed as a king, due to his presence in protecting the natives from the creatures that hunt and feed on the humans. The battle of man vs nature commences but it's not long till they discover that maybe the king is the one in need of protection.<br/><br/>With an awesome eye on action, monsters and scale, first time director Jordan Vogt-Roberts delivers a fun ride. First fault though was the plot, there's not much originality on screen but it does carry the tones to Godzilla. Writers Dan Gilroy and Max Borenstein make the best attempt to make the story work, based on the story by John Gatins and Dan Gilroy who based it on the original film's writers from 1933.<br/><br/>The acting from the cast, raging from Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, John Goodman and such is all great for this type of film. The humorous moments are from John C Reily, who gives a fun role in the adventure. Another problem though was the lack of character development, they don't seem to expand themselves fully but then again it's primary focus is on the monsters and the mythology they come from.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, both the music score by the great Henry Jackman and the 70's themed songs from the era are all amazing. Unlike Suicide Squad, the music is used when it's needed and its not heavily frequent.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island has all the right tones to make it fun, action packed and feel like a summer blockbuster type (much like Pacific Rim). Despite the lack of character development and a plot that isn't original, it makes up for it greatly with the amount of monster action and scale of the adventure on offer. Hail, King Kong! 4/5 - Nick <br/><br/>A team of explorers and soldiers travel to an uncharted island in the Pacific, unaware that they are crossing into the domain of monsters, including the mythic Kong."" The movie starts off rather quickly and you really do believe you are in the 70's. The movie captures the whole ""good old days"" feel. It never takes too long for each scene to get to the point.<br/><br/>Within the first 20 mins you see Kong. So the good news is that this isn't another Godzilla remake where you see Godzilla for the finale 15 mins. This is Kong's Movie and you see him in action plenty throughout. Smashing helicopters, fighting with the creatures of the island etc, he's totally badass. The CGI of Kong and the creatures are quite good as well. There were times where you knew the actors were in front of a green screen, and it's so obvious in parts.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film is that there is absolutely no character development or explanation what so ever. The acting was actually the weakest part of the whole film. The only 2 good actors were Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly. Reilly probably had more character development than anyone else in the entire film, and Reilly really plays his part so well. He made a stupid character so memorable and great. Jackson did well with his part as well, playing the badass soldier and stops at nothing until the job is done.<br/><br/>All in all it's a 50/50 type film. It has good elements and bad elements. If it weren't for Kong himself the film would have flopped big time. P.S. Watch until after the credits. You'll see! 3/5 - Jay<br/><br/>Check out Jay and Nick (The Autistic Reviewers) on facebook!"

","It had only been 12 years since Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong. When Kong: Skull Island referenced ""Heart Of Darkness"", even if it's by way of ""Apocalypse Now"", I was groaning. (Some character's names seem to be reference Conrad's Heart of Darkness)<br/><br/>Then, Bri Larson finds herself face to face with the big guy. And hey, it worked. Kong's heroic character in this one is very welcome. And it seems to work considerably better than in 2005. Kong even lets Bri stroke his snout, but never has an issue with Tom Hiddleston standing beside her. He's not love sick as in 2005.<br/><br/>Samuel Jackson chews up more scenery than the monsters. But that adds to the fun. John C. Riley adds a marvelous touch as a WW2 soldier stuck on the island for decades, a little nutty but able to get along with every one. <br/><br/>At two hours, this movie is not over-produced, and allows our beloved ape rule as a bad mother-scratcher who has a heart of gold."
"ibarrf","7","6","9","22 April 2017"," Entertaining but lacking
","I must say that I feel this movie lacks a bit of consistency, it starts with a decent story but then it just goes down leaving a bunch of questions unanswered and some plot holes.<br/><br/>While you can see the effort in developing Kong and the crawlers,every other creature in the island is just there to fill the huge void in the plot.The guys at legendary pictures apparently heard how everyone complained about ""to much plot and not enough Godzilla"" in their last monster movie production and turned this into something similar to a ""transformers movie"", it's full of visuals but the story is lacking and some characters have no motivation or logic in their actions.<br/><br/>I can't say it's a bad movie, but it's a wasted opportunity to expand the lore of the franchise, you will exit the cinema feeling that something was not there.<br/><br/>It is obvious they are trying to turn this into a profitable franchise, but when you give priority to visuals instead of plot, you end up with movies like ""Alice in Wonderland"" and it's sequel, or any of the recent ""Transformers"" movies, pretty to look at, but completely forgettable, and doing that to a character like King Kong feels just wrong.<br/><br/>However,I would like to see more monsters movies in the future, and Kong skull island was enjoyable and a fresh take to a character that's been around for over 80 years, you probably won't become a fan of ""kaiju"" movies watching it, but let's hope next installments in the franchise are better."

","I say that this is not the traditional King Kong for many reasons. This is not the same story that you all know and love. This is barely even the same monster; this one is much taller. The whole movie really only exists to set up 2020's Godzilla vs Kong. That being said, this is a fun, action packed movie, that rarely feels like a cheap setup to another movie.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a group of scientists and soldiers in the nineteen-seventies who conduct experiments on Skull Island, unaware of the monsters that inhabit it.<br/><br/>The concept is not taken as seriously as many previous renditions of Kong. It focuses mostly on intense action, and features comic relief, mostly via John C Reilly's character. But it is still suspenseful, with many characters dying unexpectedly. It also has some pretty good cinematography, and many scenes reminiscent of Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>This new version probably won't appeal to all King Kong fans. A lot of people will probably hate the lighter tone and the liberties taken with the monster. But it does what it set out to do: deliver a fun action movie. It is nowhere near as good as the original, or even the Peter Jackson remake, but I was thoroughly entertained by it. I'd also say I'd prefer it to the recent Godzilla movie it's set to crossover with. This is a good movie if you know what you're getting into.<br/><br/>jaythemovieguy.blogspot.com"

","I was looking forward to this latest over-sized ape. Coming from the studio who brought us the 2014 Godzilla, starring a stacked cast, and boasting a stylishly fun trailer, I was all-in. Unfortunately, Kong is a special kinda bad, like a throwaway 90s adventure with as much brains as subtlety. It's corny but cynical; it's tongue-in-cheek but mean-spirited; it even made me miss Kong ice skating with Naomi Watts. It's an awful scattershot of varied tones & overwhelming styles. In a re-imagining of the discovery of Kong, a group of scientists, explorers and military-men in 1971 make a trek to the mysterious & monster-filled Skull Island. It's full of some of the biggest actors around, both up-and-coming & veterans. Sadly, it's one of the biggest wastes of a great cast in years, as they are given an unbearably clichÃ©d and incomprehensible script. The soldiers (Jackson) are angry, the scientists (Goodman) are reckless, and the pretty white people (Hiddleston, Larson) are romantically shoved together. The character purposes are unclear, the dialogue is mind-numbing, and the message is essentially, ""Violence: bad. Empathy: good."" Even the basic choice of creating intrigue is pushed-aside, opting to obnoxiously shove us into the monsters' faces from the get-go. It's all as graceful as Kong himself. Not that it isn't stylish; just the opposite. Director Vogt-Roberts decided that if you CAN use a cinematic trick then you SHOULD. Random zoom-in / push-outs, incessant slo-mo, quick edits, old-style reel-to-reel effects, and laughable 3D-only shots; it's a boring theme-park ride, including narrative heft. There's lots of great stuff in theaters: Logan, Get Out, Split, Lego Batman (which has Kong in it!); don't waste your time on this loud-garbage."

","This is the best King Kong film ever. Instead of taking a girl for his wife, being captured, taken to New York, put on Broadway, escaping Broadway, taking the girl again and causing destruction along the way, climbing the Empire State Building and getting shot by planes and falling off, King Kong is the king and protector of Skull Island. He is first encountered in 1944 and then over the years many planes have been trying to destroy him, only to awaken an even eviler monster then Kong. They're called Skull Crawlers or as they are what John C. Reily's character calls them and they look like that monster with fingers like snakes and spiders in his hair from the Nightmare Before Christmas. Nearly 30 years after the first encounter of Kong, a group of soldiers and scientists go and investigate the island for him, only to get a destructive surprise. Some of the soldiers are killed by Kong and only the general played by Samuel L. Jackson, the scientist played by John Goodman, the navigator played by Tom Hiddleston, the photographer and the rest of the soldiers survive. They soon encounter the Skull Crawlers as well as well as a village where the people are protected by a wall from the Skull Crawlers and they worshiped Kong, instead of making human sacrifices to him. They also learn about the Big Skull Crawler who is the master of them. The group also encounter what remained of Kong's parents and that Kong was the last of his kind. They also encounter huge bison's and pterodactals and the general swears revenge on Kong for killing some of his men and the group new he had gone stark raving mad and tried telling him that Kong is only trying to protect everyone on the island, but the general wouldn't listen. Then the photographer and the navigator find Kong and show him that they are no threat to him or the island. The general sets a trap for Kong and was about to finish him off with a bomb, until the navigator, the photographer and the soldier stop him and they see the big Skull Crawler coming towards them. The general stays still and was about to blow up Kong when he is crushed by Kong's hand. He then fights the Skull Crawler and the group helps him out and the Skull Crawler is vanquished and Kong's island is safe. The group then bids him farewell. Yep this is a whole lot better then the original King Kong, the 1976 remake and Peter Jackson's remake. We also get to see John C. Reily's character go home to his family after 30 years of being on the island. Also we learn after the ending credits that Godzilla is also living on Skull Island which means that we'll see a new King Kong vs Godzilla movie in the year 2020 and I am certain it will be better then the original American/Japanese version from 1962. Yep both King Kong and Godzilla are the best movie monsters ever."

"bankofmarquis","8","16","31","11 March 2017"," Very Fun Monster Movie
","I love me a good monster movie.<br/><br/>And, KONG: SKULL ISLAND is a very good, very entertaining monster movie.<br/><br/>Directed by relative newcomer Jordan Vogt-Roberts, KONG: SKULL ISLAND delivers pretty much what you expect - a group of explorers (with Military escorts) descend upon the mysterious Skull Island to find out what's there and what they find are monsters...plenty of monsters...with Kong as King of the Island.<br/><br/>I applaud the restraint that this film shows. Â The action is first rate, but not over the top, the CGI is very, very good and the laughs are plenty enough to keep you entertained. Â It is stylish, but not overly so. Â Adventurous, but not too daring. Â CGI fight- filled, but not overblown. Â The quick-cut, shaky cam that is so prevalent in other films is kept to a minimum here and the monsters are sizable enough for the average audience member to understand without getting overwhelmed by it.<br/><br/>But it is the use of the actors that really stands out.<br/><br/>Starting with the casting of John Goodman as the head of the group heading to the island and good ol' Samuel L. Jackson as the head of the Military team that goes in. Â Instantly, the audience recognizes and understands their generic characters - based on the history of characters that these two have played - and it is like eating comfort food. Â Add to this, Tom Hiddleston (Loki in the Marvel films) and Brie Larson (soon to be CAPTAIN MARVEL) as our hero and heroine, and we have a top 4 that are easy to watch and comforting in their presence.<br/><br/>Now...add onto these 4...solid supporting characters. Â From John Ortiz and Marc Evan Jackson as ""Corporate Suits"" caught in the fray to soldiers Shea Whigham, Jason Mitchell and Toby Kebbell (who also - magnificently - does the motion capture work as Kong) to Corey Hawkins and Tian Jing as young scientists, all do solid work, not a weak performance in the bunch.<br/><br/>But the real surprise to me is the Â wonderful, fun, turn by John C. Reilly as an Air Force pilot who has been stranded on the island for decades. Â I blow hot and cold with Mr. Reilly's antics. Â He can be very good and sympathetic (Boogey Nights, Chicago) or he can be bland when trying to be over-the-top zany (anything he does when he tries to match zany performance with Will Ferrell) but here he finds the right balance in fun, energy, pathos and grit. Â He is, truly, the character I ended up rooting for in this film<br/><br/>Clearly, the ProducersÂ (paired with the successful 2014 GODZILLA film), see a potential ""Cinematic Universe"" with these 2 characters. Â Make sure you stay for the important scene at the end of the end credits - not just the ""home movies"" that are shown during the credits, but the actual scene at the end - and you will see how this film fits into the previous film and how they will be connected going forward.<br/><br/>I, for one, am looking forward to more adventures in this Universe.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: a solid B+<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"

"uroshnor54","10","21","43","11 March 2017"," Does Everything It Needs to Do
","Kong: Skull Island isn't getting a 10/10 from me because it's a terrific movie but because it does everything it needs to do. I've been rather disappointed in action blockbusters for quite a while now. They're all just bland thrillers (like Bourne 5 and Spectre - I like the Bond series a lot, but, my goodness, they weren't even trying with Spectre) or vacuous superhero movies (I won't even name any in particular since I pretty much dislike the entire genre, with a handful of exceptions). <br/><br/>Anyway, some people say to watch movies in other genres, that many good movies come out each year that aren't in either of those categories, but that's besides that point. I want to see competently made $200 million spectacles. I'm fine with (and I want) stupid fun, but make it good stupid fun. I want explosions and gunfights, giant monsters and alien invasions, but not at the expense of a lack of discipline. No, I don't need characters of Shakespearean depth in these movies, but I want to at least feel some concern for them. I don't need the world-building to rival The Lord of the Rings, but I don't want writers to get lazy with background information either. You get the point. For all these reasons, I was ecstatic when watching Kong: Skull Island. (And I wasn't even planning on seeing this movie when I first heard about it. I just happened to see a trailer online a few days ago and thought it might be nice.)<br/><br/>The movie gets to the action quickly, but makes sure to give us a proper setup. I liked how the creatures' existence was explained with the Hollow Earth theory. We also understand the different characters' motivations. They aren't complex characters and they don't get a lot of development, but I cared for them. You know that most of them are going to die, of course, but when they were in danger, I wanted them to make it out safely. John C. Reilly, Tom Hiddleston, John Goodman, and Brie Larson (who's quite beautiful here) give good performances. <br/><br/>One problem that I have with so many action movies these days is that it seems writers don't know how to properly incorporate humor into their scripts. So many times in other movies, a character's wisecracking has prevented me from feeling suspense. That isn't a problem here. The humor doesn't get in the way of the thrills.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island also looks great. I loved the way the jungle and the sunsets were shot. And the creatures are awesome. In addition to Kong, there are the Skullcrawlers you've probably seen in the trailers, pterosaurs, and giant spiders, and the scenes involving these are fun.<br/><br/>There really is only one (minor) problem I had with the film, and that would be Samuel L. Jackson's character. His performance is just fine. It's just that the character's motivation, while understandable, is a little insufficient considering the situation they're all in. It felt a little like he only acted the way he did because the writers thought the film needed a human antagonist. I think this could have been fixed if part of his motivation was guilt for being so eager to accept the proposal to go to the island.<br/><br/>I might be being a bit excessive with my praise and I'm sure on a second viewing I'll see more problems, but it's been a very long time since I saw a movie like this in theaters and enjoyed it this much. I'll be looking forward to Godzilla vs. King Kong. Such a shame it's scheduled for 2020."
"Impsman","8","15","29","12 March 2017"," Exactly what you'd expect and thats a good thing
","Last week I wrote a review of Logan after seeing that masterpiece and commented how it was not a superhero film like others. Going into Kong:Skull Island you would expect to see a film of giant legendary monsters causing havoc with the human cast and having a ruckus between themselves. This is exactly what you get and it's all the better for it.<br/><br/>People will go to this film wanting to see a superbly rendered CGI gigantic ape swatting helicopters, hurling and treading on minor characters and going hand-to-hand, teeth-to-teeth with other giant mutated beasties and you get that in spades. The action is pretty relentless throughout and because the cast if full of character actors rather than stars anyone could be on the menu.<br/><br/>Those actors do what they need to in their roles without needing to push their abilities. Jackson, Hiddleston, Larsen, Goodman, Hawkins and the rest are all very capable actors who clearly know that they won't be the reason people pay their money to see this film but strike the exact note their roles require. A special note for John C Reilly though who is the character and performance which lingers longest after the credits have rolled.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination and if you think about it too much probably won't make a lot of sense, but its a two hour enjoyable monster movie and there's absolutely no harm in that.<br/><br/>Oh and one last thing....being of a certain vintage absolutely loved the soundtrack"
"Okonh0wp","8","15","29","11 March 2017"," A bit squeamish-inducing but plenty of bang for the buck
","Owing a bit more to the James Cameronesque horror of grotesquely-shaped beasts than to the simplistic awe of a majestic beast, Kong: Skull Island is an effective nail biter. It's not for the squeamish, however.<br/><br/>With the genuine shocks of adrenaline and the action geared towards 3-D viewing, Kong: Skull Island feels like a two-hour roller coaster ride but there's an honest attempt at characterization and story.<br/><br/>There's a loosely-established mythology that Kong is the last of his kind and protector to a tribe of very indigenous looking people and a necessary balance to the ecosystem from the dangers of a very ugly creature called the skull duggers and yada yada yada. The film's need for moral parable is precipitated by the fact that Samuel L Jackson (who normally plays such level-headed characters) plays a military commander who's attitudes towards animals are evil with a capital ""E"" which sets up the main narrative conflict of the film, prompting the need for the good guys to step in and rescue Kong from animal cruelty. Perhaps, it's because of the Vietnam setting that the film has an anti-military stance as Jackson's character represents militarism run amok.<br/><br/>Chief among the good guys is a castaway played by John C. Rielly who is both a throwback to 50's B-movies (other reviews liken him to ""Apocalypse Now"") and an endearing character in his own right as a castaway who has been stranded on Kong Island for nearly three decades. Brie Larson makes her first big post-Oscar move in style as a Ripley-esque action heroine and Thomas Hiddlestone proves that this guy has a future as a leading man (piggybacking on his great performance in the in ""Night Manager"").<br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" is beautifully shot and highly entertaining provided you can stomach it."
"gespino-42178","1","25","53","30 March 2017"," Truly the epitome of cinematic GARBAGE
","COMMUNITY SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT RE: KONG If you have seen any of the King Kong movies made in the past, ANY, including the Joe Young one, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY going to see this newest rendition. It is truly the epitome of cinematic GARBAGE. We, who have seen prior Kong films know that the central theme is the romantic battle between ape and man for woman. This is crucial for a Kong flick. Without this, there is no essence, no point to the film, unless it is now wanton carnage and stupid acting. Even during the one 30 moment of mechanical romantic interlude where the girl, in absolute FEMBOT manner, touches the face of Kong, the stupid ape could not get that ""Straight Outta Compton"" look off his face! Next rant, the acting. Samuel L. Jackson, if this is what you've been reduced to, go home. Retire. Join a Tibetan monastery and never show your face again out of shame. Final rant, though I could go on and on, the villagers. All I can say is they are smoking some very powerful hash and the chief's wife looks like Kermit THE Frog's mother. Now, if you're a youngster and/or have never seen any of the prior Kong films, you MIGHT find this wasted space of time tolerable. But a word of advice to all. Bring a small pillow for you will be sleeping during the EXCRUCIATINGLY BORING FIRST HOUR of this film."

The recently discovered island known as Skull Island , it is a place as perilous as it is gorgeous , it is a mythical, uncharted location in the Pacific . No one knows what they will encounter on this island and why it is so mysterious, but once they reach it, they will soon find out. Living on this hidden island is a giant gorilla . Once there, they discover that King Kong is a real creature, living in a massive jungle where creatures from prehistoric times have been protected and hidden for millions of years. As the explorers search for the great ape, their quest puts them up against both Kong and his pre-historical enemies. They are escorted by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his underlings . Later on , the bunch is joined by a former pilot (John C. Reilly) isolated at the mysterious from WWII . At Skull Island they encounter a marvel of evolution , a colossal thing of power called Kong. The squadron and subordinates venture into the domain of the mighty Kong, as their mission of discovery becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape a primal Eden in which humanity does not belong. Along the way , the squad avoiding and battling all sorts of creatures and beasts , whilst Colonel Packard has another plan in mind.The eighth wonder of the world.<br/><br/>
This nail-biting movie contains noisy action , thrills , emotion and a lot of breathtaking battles including gigantic fights among monsters and helicopters crashing on ground .

As the real starring turns out to be the monstrous ape¨Kong¨, the all-powerful eight-metre-tall silverback gorilla who faces off a handful of valiant but insignificant defenders must fight tooth and nail with formidable adversaries and the isle's mighty ruler . This ¨Kong¨retools the original's iconic components through the hyper-evolved wonder of 21st century CGI . The great ape himself is really the big star of the wonderful show , delivering the necessary goods to surprise and wonder us . Kong gives an enormous spectacle made with a level of photo-realist detail so expensive and intricate as to be unimaginable to the Stop-Motion , painted-glass by maestros Willis O'Brian and Ray Harryhausen in 1933 King Kong version directed by Ernest B Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper or the animatronicist with Kong made by Carlo Rambaldi of the 1976 version or the former 2005 by Peter Jackson , made by means of abundant digital effects similar to this last one , Kong : Skull island . It is a stunning technical achievement , but one that threatens to overwhelm the potent tale it supposedly serves . All over two hours , the movie's gigantism extends ways beyond the scale of its effects . The script attempts hard to build on its more interesting components , mixing adventures , military feats and jungle battles as wel as songs in ¨Apocalypse Now¨ style . The screenplay is unreservedly on the side of Kong , in spite of making an excessive massacre, more than the proud and vengeful Colonel Packard/Samuel L. Jackson .

","In the year of 1973 a group of people travell to Skull Island, with the intuit to explore the misterious place.They find themselves in life-threatnning situations thanks to the creatures inhabiting the place.
There have been many different sequels, reboots,etc about King Kong over the years.Now it´s time for Warner Brothers to add a new version to the catalogue.
Let´s start with the script, it´s decent, it works, but it´s clear that the goal it´s not to tell a compelling story, the director is more interested in the big action sequences and the entertainnment value involving the creatures, actually those action scenes are impressive, exciting, well directed and the visual effects very well done.
The cast is good mainly Samuel L.Jackson and John C.Reilly, Tom Hiddelston and Brie Larson were decent, the rest of the cast is fine.The secondary characters don´t do anything and they´re not particulary necessary for the movie.
The visual effects as a said are very good, the creatures look real, Kong looks very expressive. The cinematography also worths a nod, there are magnificent large open exterior plans of the island,the nature,the sunset and others involving saturated orange and blue colors.
Kong Skull Island doesn´t have the best of the scripts, or does it have developed characters.However it has good directing, visual effects, action sequences and cinematography.It´s a big monster movie, and is made simply to entertain.<br/><br/>6.7/10"
"Prismark10","6","2","2","24 March 2018"," Kong is back
","By the setting Kong : Skull island in the 1973 the film gets to dovetail the aftermath of the Vietnam conflict onto the plot.<br/><br/>The film begins with William Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) trying to get government funding for an expedition to the unknown Skull Island who they have satellite images of for the first time. They recruit a former British special ops James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) as a guide and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) for the expedition.<br/><br/>Lt Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his team of soldiers are the military escort. Packard is upset with the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam leading what the fighting was for and what to do afterwards. This mission gives him purpose but as they arrive in their helicopters to Skull Island and start dropping bombs as part of scientific tests, they are attacked by the giant Kong who destroys the choppers and kills most of the men. Packard wants vengeance against Kong.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Conrad and Weaver discover Hank Marlow (John C Reilly) a soldier from World War 2 who crash landed and resides with the natives in the island. Marlow explains that Kong is regarded as a god by the natives and he is their protector as the island has other monsters especially those underground that only Kong can take on.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island neatly reworks elements of the King Kong story. We have the helicopter attack at the early part of the story leading to Packard becoming a sworn enemy of Kong. Of course Packard is crazy whose motivations are nonsense. It was he and his men who have invaded Kong's turf and started bombing it which has awaken the underground monsters. You get some mumbo jumbo about superiority of men while they are being killed by giant spiders and lizard creatures.<br/><br/>It is an entertaining action adventure with a ludicrous story. At least you root for Kong and he does keep the story going. The special effects are very good and you gets all sorts of nasty creatures in the island which again is a call back to the original King Kong.<br/><br/>The film really is unsure what to do with some of the leads. Larson is only there to be the tentative love interest to Hiddleston and bring out Kong's tender side. At least she fares better than the Chinese actress Tian Jing who as the other female is there just to keep the Chinese co-producers happy, she certainly has little to do in this film. Even Hiddleston's action man role is curtailed somewhat."

","The film is a combination of good actors doing their best with what they are given, nice special effects and completely no story. Basically, it is about a bunch of people on an alien planet. It would have worked just as well. In fact, it would have worked better to explain an island that mysteriously has a completely different ecosystem than the rest of the world. And I have to say, a sequel to this would REALLY not need Kong at all, just a remake of Verne's The Lost World.<br/><br/>There isn't much in the story that isn't spoiled by the trailer. And that's because that's the whole story. In it, Kong is just a big monkey. There are no subtle shots at Hollywood's system as in the original, nor much emotional charge. Half of the film is about the other animals on the island and a quarter about how crazy Sam Jackson's characters can get, so it's not even a movie in which Kong has a leading role. It would have been braver and more sincere to just kill the big ape in the first minutes and then get on with their alien explosions movie."
"hitchcockthelegend","7","2","2","6 August 2017"," Yeah. That was an unconventional encounter.
","So here we have it, part two of the franchise reinvention of the beloved iconic creatures of cinema lore. After the 2014 redux of Godzilla was something of a tonal misstep, it's unsurprising to find this version of the King Kong legacy going all out blockbuster popcorner, and with that it succeeds - kinda.<br/><br/>Plot is wafer thin, bunch of humans from various professions rock up at the uncharted Skull Island, each with differing levels of interest as to what might be there. Of which they quickly find out is a whole heap of trouble - big trouble!<br/><br/>It's clear that the makers, fronted by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, are trying to blend crowd pleasing mayhem with thoughtful observations of not only the period the pic is set (1973), but also of man's inherent propensity for stupidity. On the surface, the battles and creature feature carnage in general, are wholly entertaining, but it's sometimes just too ridiculous for its own good. Even worse is that it's shallow, with no real substance of note, particularly where the characters are concerned, rendering a very admirable cast as one note players in the gorilla maze.<br/><br/>However, irritants aside, the pic is great fun, with enough excitement and quip based dialogue to make the time spent on Skull Island worthwhile. Be it man versus beasties and the alien terrain they traverse, a popcorn muncher it be. There's some sly humour within (Nixon going down), and the nods towards Coppola and Cameron et al are pleasing as punch. You may have to lower expectation levels to not let the problems it has drag you down, and for sure it's not hard to understand why a lot of folk hate it, but it's not a disaster, far from it.<br/><br/>One does hope, though, that the next instalment in this series goes up another couple of notches, for Kong, Zilla and the other monster gods deserve it. 7/10"
"TopDawgCritic","8","2","2","12 July 2017"," This was not the role for Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson
","I really enjoyed this latest addition to the Kong franchise. My only complaint, and it's a big one, was the casting of Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston was just not right for this role. He wasn't convincing and I felt he struggled with his characters role. Now Samuel L. Jackson did NOT struggle with his role, but he over-played it. I mean to the point where he was annoying me. He was playing his ""mfk- ing snakes on a plane"" attitude and it was just waaay too much in this film. Had he toned it down a few (well, quite a few) notches, I could've put up with him. A far as I'm concerned, those two ruined this film for me.<br/><br/>Now Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, John Goodman and Corey Hawkins were cast perfectly, and I feel they are the ones that kept me entertained the most.<br/><br/>The cinematography and VFX where on point, but the writing could have been a little tighter to avoid some plot holes.<br/><br/>Otherwise very enjoyable and it's a 8/10 from me!"
"maurice_yacowar","8","11","20","13 March 2017"," New version changes monster Kong to defender of his people
","In addition to being arguably the most dramatic, spectacular and entertaining of the King Kong films, Kong:Skull Island is of special interest as an historical document. As any remake or sequel should, the film inflects the original material to express its current times. As the original Kong expressed the Depression anxieties this one reflects America's post-Nam anxieties. <br/><br/>The opening credits play against a montage of newsreel clips from the 1940s to the 1970s. That summarizes the social and political changes since the original King Kong film, where the beast was conquered by the beauty, Fay Wray (or as I always say, ""Fay Wray from Cardston Alberta""). That Kong sniffed that helpless lady's underwear. The new one softens to her facial caress and rallies to save her life, both by conquering the greater evil monster and by rescuing her from drowning. <br/><br/>The film is set in the wake of the Vietnam war. That allows for some Credence Clearwater Revival and ""White Rabbit"" on the soundtrack, always good for the pulse, and a filial homage to Coppola's Apocalypse Now. The Conrad and Marlow surnames evoke the latter film's source, Heart of Darkness. The music also includes David Bowie, Ziggy Pop, etc., and works up and back to close on Vera Lynn's 1940s ditty, ""We'll Meet Again."" These allusions provide a literary and musical history that parallels the political one in the film. <br/><br/>The WW II leftover Hank Marlow functions like a time machine, having been isolated from his civilization for 30 years. He brings the Vera Lynn climax into the score, suggesting that history is a continuous cycle of wars, separations, reunions. The film's first post-script is his magical reunion with his faithful wife and son, set apart from the main film as a small home movie. <br/><br/>The second surveys the range of threatening unnatural monsters that populate our film world because they inhabit our minds. That is, they embody our primal fears as shaped by our own insecurities and our historical suffering and insecurity. Thus Hiroshima begat Godzilla, Motha, and that crew. That's why Marlow names the subterranean dragons ""Skull Crawlers"" and why Kong rules over Skull Island. These monsters are creatures of our imagination, projections from our fears. <br/><br/>The two senior army men are a contrast in sensitivity. Marlow has lived with the primitive tribe for so long he understands them — and they him — without speech. Marlow (here as in the Conrad novel) is the understanding mediator between the two cultures. These people's closeness to their land is imaged when the camouflaged soldiers emerge from the walls. Marlow persuades the heroes Conrad anti-war photographer Mason Weaver to save Kong because that is Kong's territory. He justly rules it. Moreover, the island, its people, indeed the whole world, would be imperilled by the underground dragons, were Kong unable to continue their suppression. <br/><br/>In contrast, the army captain Preston Packard is the pathological fighter, determined to murder any Other in his path, determined to continue any murderous cycle to the end. Hence his mode of persuasion: You are going to tell me everything that I should know... or I blow you away."" Hence his delusion of insight: ""I know an enemy when I see one."" He tries to stare down his monster enemies. Sad. He denies losing the Vietnam war: ""We abandoned it."" He won't leave this one however apocalyptic its conclusion. Fortunately the dragon chows down on him before he can blow up Kong. <br/><br/>The two monsters whose battle royal provides the film's climax parallel the recent politics especially in the Middle East. Bill Randa's stubborn — and crooked — campaign to avenge his earlier loss recalls Dubya's campaign against Hussein (""That man tried to kill my daddy""). Yes, ""monsters exist,"" but they really may be the hunters of the putative monsters. <br/><br/>This film's initial war is against the villain Kong. But his apparent, temporary defeat only unleashes the greater evil from the deep, the big dragon. The contemporary lesson is clear. If you don't understand the alien culture don't act as if you do. For then, erase one evil threat, such as, say, Hussein, and you only unleash a greater one, i.e. ISIS. Contemporary world politics needs a more sophisticated understanding. <br/><br/>As well, Kong's importance to his island's people is a corrective to the usual American confidence that they can determine what another people need and want. Marlow teaches Conrad and Weaver to respect Kong as part of the alien culture, of which they have no understanding but which has as much right as they to survive and live their own way. Hence the recurring ""We don't belong here."" The King Kong story has always been a parable about colonialism. The present drama of American righteousness, ignorance and belligerence continues that tradition."

","A team of scientists, soldiers and adventurers unites to explore an uncharted island in the Pacific. <br/><br/>isolated from everything they know, they venture into the home of the titular beast, igniting a battle between man and nature. <br/><br/>As their mission becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape a place in which humanity does not belong.....<br/><br/>First things first, if you see this, and can be bothered to stay until the end, there is a pretty nifty sequence that is better than the entire film.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that it concentrates more on the effects rather than fleshing out the characters. And when you have a cast of such calibre, it frustrates even more, because we are subjected to these seasoned actors playing stereotypical roles that you would have probably seen in a Cannon produced eighties action film starring Chuck Norris.<br/><br/>In fact, the only character to have 'Character' is ironically John C Reilly, the comedy relief of the film.<br/><br/>I really believe that the makers wanted to show Kong earlier, rather than fully revealing him in the third act. If they had done this, and made the film a little longer for more focus on the characters, you would probably be more invested in the story<br/><br/>Because frankly, there isn't really much story to talk of.<br/><br/>It's nothing more than a subtle allegory to the Vietnam war, outsiders invading a peaceful place declaring it as theirs, because the outsiders have achieved so much. In one scene, a character says to a Senator 'you want us to find it before the Russians', which is basically saying, you need our country to shine once more, by taking something away from someone else.<br/><br/>Hiddleston is wasted, he looks like he's auditioning for the Uncharted movie, he's your atypical mysterious guy who fights in bars, but will do anything for a price. He has absolutely no backstory.<br/><br/>Larson is wasted too, the Lois Lane of the piece, and again, no backstory, she's just there to take pictures, bond with the titular beast, and be the voice of reason.<br/><br/>And then there is Jackson, who is just replicating his character from 2003's 'Basic', and he is absolutely shocking in this. He's the metaphor of the bitter soldier, the metaphor of not wanting to fall back and relent. He's a man on a mission, in typical big mouth form, and guess what? Because the film is 12a/PG13, his most famous utterance gets cut halfway. This trope is quickly becoming tedious.<br/><br/>And the film takes itself far too seriously.<br/><br/>The effects are amazing though, and there are a few shots that are so genuinely awe-inspiring, they do not deserve to be in this film.<br/><br/>There are two really good set pieces, the helicopter scene everyone saw in the trailer, and the obligatory 'end of game boss fight' in the final act, but you can only be entertained by seeing soldiers being flung like rag dolls no more than three times.<br/><br/>There are hints of Predator in this, and even a few references to Apocalypse Now, but all in all, this is one film that could have done with a little bit more monkeying around, rather than aping much better films.<br/><br/>It felt longer than Jacksons Kong."

","Attending the premiere of Kong many of one's anticipated problems and prejudices come true. I will keep this short because it is not meant as a polemic against anything, but rather a warning bell against the cliché-ridden den that is Hollywood, soon to be Chollywood.<br/><br/>Did you watch X-Men: Days Of Future Past? How about Independence Day Resurgence (which they did not want to call Resurrection because there were so many of those!)?<br/><br/>The well-known Hollywood problem of greed and avarice reappears when they have, absolutely cliché-ridden have, to insert a token Chinese character... not because he or she is integral or needed, but because they want to sell the film to China and show it in China. Plain and simple. Said actors should be ashamed of themselves as being there for no good story, acting or plot reason and Hollywood should be ashamed of itself. But then again, they have never atoned for their sin of 'product placement' why stop now?<br/><br/>Did you think the last King Kong was too stylish? Then brace for Kong! Forced plot meandering, token Chinese chick prancing there for no good reason while doing exactly nothing other than sell to China (like Chinese audiences are so desperate and needy) and to satisfy new Chinese owners and investors, etc. Again Skull Island is not Crouching Tiger or Hero that tells a story with Oriental characters (and I love those), but it is a forced injection of token East Asian as Legendary Pictures promises to do going forward in every Batman movie now that Chinese conglomerate has purchased that studio. So, what do we get a useless Chinese woman not knowing why she is there in yet another sequel/remake/reboot/whatever/who cares anymore? Which takes me to another problem. Hollywood, get an original idea once.in.a.while. What another reboot? Yes, Jurassic park made tons of dough so the fault is ours. But, what is the price of loss of dignity? Look at JJ Abrams. No credibility, no future. He made a ton of money with his unadulterated accountant-driven so-called Star Wars, but he is now washed up and over exposed as a no-talent. The same is happening with these Chinese investors taking over films and force feeding audiences something that is obviously, er, force fed. As for this film, well it is a stylized Kong battling not against humans at first, but against local predators. And there is a token Chinese who is a female scientist. Whoopedeeda! Can you say Rebooted Star Wars syndrome? One last thing, there is a Vietnam connection and so the marketing collateral oh so cleverly hints at Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>Price of admission? Free at local premiere Value of story? None Predictor of the future? Sadly, high. Hollywood has a rope and it will hang itself with it."

","An absolute blast of a monster mayhem flick! Unlike Gareth Edwards' GODZILLA (2014), liked the way this time they made it sure of nobody can complain on Kong or any other monster's lack of screen presence time. A must see & quite a perfect entertaining flick for monster movie lovers. I understand how or why some of the critics are complaining on cheesy dialog & lack of character development parts of the film but to me, those issues were nicely compensated by releasing one after another vicious, weird & interesting massive creatures on screen along through the ""survey job"" turned survival journey of an expedition team on Skull Island. Moreover, this time it isn't that tragic 'The Beauty & the Beast' tale of a colossal ape who all just wanted to have a long date with his woman of love but ended up falling down dead from the Empire State Building. This Kong is quite an angry young lad who's damn serious about protecting his territory and its all helpless inhabitants & creatures from anything that's threatening his kingdom. The epic final battle was a treat to watch & will be remain as something to highly regard & talked about for the monster lovers for a long time. My only complaint is that they really did showed too much (almost all the creatures) on those countless clips & trailers before the release that left little amount of surprise in terms of newly introduced M.U.T.Os for 'MonsterVerse'."

I liked the changes and all the surprises in this version, taking place in 1973 after the Vietnam War. Some parts of the film were very intense and violent and parts were sprinkled with welcome humor, mostly because of the character of Hank Marlow, played by John C Reilly. I recommend this movie for adult viewing. The acting, writing, directing, filming, sets and cgi/special effects were all top notch. If you haven't seen the movie yet I have 2 recommendations for you.

","Movie: Kong: Skull Island the fourth remake of the magnificent story about a couple of geologists and a military group go off to discover an unknown island in the South Pacific, not knowing what they were in for, as they are entering the land of King Kong. Now this movie is titled after King Kong, but its not just the king himself, in the 2005 version the king destroys dinosaurs and other creatures while Kong: skull island has a whole range of creatures, call it Kong and friends: skull island. In the 2005 version of King Kong which went for 3 hours and 10 minutes it took half the movie to reveal King Kong, in this one you see an early view of Kong straight away. Kong: skull island goes for 2 hours, which I thought was good because it didn't drag the movie on for to long, it went straight the point. The movies cast was spectacular. J.K. Simmons and Michael Keaton were originally supposed to be cast ed in this film but both had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, which I thought worked out well because the bad ass Samuel L. Jackson took Simmons place and John C. Reilly took over Keaton's role.<br/><br/>Actors: as I said, I loved the cast for this movie, Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad, a hired soldier for the team, Samuel L. Jackson as Preston Packard was the chief, John Goodman as Bill Randa who was one of the geologists, and more. Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins both played in Straight Outta Compton with Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre and Jason Mitchell as Eazy E and returned again to play in Kong: skull island which was great. You can also tell John Goodman has aged in This movie. Director: Jordan Vogt-Roberts created the look of the new King Kong to look similar to the first King Kong in 1933. <br/><br/>Editing: the editing in the movie was great, there was great shots and clips of the movie that blow you away. Kong himself looked good and horrific and so did all the other creatures. <br/><br/>Feedback: Now, no matter who you are, go see this movie. In my opinion everyone would love this movie. The whole movie is so entertaining, there's not much scenes which bore you with scientific information in this movie, it is action packed, like a huge gorilla the size of a building destroying and killing everything in its path, its just spectacular. To me there was no faults in this movie except for a off leading ending that wasn't fully satisfying. There is a after credits scene with Godzilla, which I missed and found out later. I was also surprised to find out that a majority of the film was filmed in Gold Coast, Australia.

"anupapu8","8","9","16","11 March 2017"," Extravaganza , Yes , that's the word.
","KONG:SKULL ISLAND - Extravaganza , Yes , that's the word. Man , you got to see this in the best theater available. Thats the best way to watch this one. And its worth of your money. <br/><br/>So WARNER BROS is making their own MONSTERVERSE and m glad they are doing it. It started with GODZILLA which i liked an lot. And after KONG it will continue with two films - Godzilla:The king of monsters and Kong vs Godzilla.<br/><br/>Anybody who like giant fights like in GODZILLA or PACIFIC RIM will love this. But its different from the way GODZILLA has been made. GERETH EDWARD chose the way of teasing the audience in GODZILLA but Jordan ROBERT has different ideas for this one. No more teasing. KONG has been shown in a full manner as much as possible. No FOOT SHOTS no CAMERA CUTS , KONG is there all over the movie captured with MOTION PICTURE instead of making it totally CGI , which resulted in better motions. Infect there was a scene , where John C Rilley's character just explain the others about the character of KONG , and the movie shows at the time of that description KONG just jumping from here and there doing his daily things not relevant to the storyline. That scene shows the importance of KONg as a character and not as just a CGI monster and also that studio is not holding back and gonna spend all the money the DIRECTOR needs to show the KONG to his full satisfaction. <br/><br/>The period is 1973 , after the war of Vietnam. The period details are awesome . The visuals , color pallet and the rock music matches perfectly with the era , making this movie unique in its own way. Cinematographer LARRY FONG (cinematographer of ZACK SNYDER and frequent collaborator of WARNER BROS) use very unique and elaborate camera angles to show the fight scenes as a whole. No frequent cuts , no close up , the camera always backs itself so that we can see the action scene in a complete scale. <br/><br/>Speaking of action scenes , its better then GODZILLA , PACIFIC RIM or Even TRANSFORMERS or any other giants fighting each other in any movie for a matter of fact. It will totally 'AWW' you. You would be amazed how great and detailed the visuals are and would definitely regret if you don't watch it in big screen. Here is a big contender for Best Visual Effect in Oscars.<br/><br/>The writers have not written a complicated or emotional story. Because its truly a action movie or even called as a WAR film. Men just die frequently. One after another , just like WAR CASUALTIES , and you feel nothing about them , because that's the way wars movies are. JORDAR ROBERTS purposefully didn't gave any character much of a development , because its not about the characters , its about KONG who has given more then enough character development in it. <br/><br/>The KONG created here is totally different from PETER JACKSON'S KING KONG. This one doesn't use his hands to walk , has better physic , broader chest , like he goes to gym everyday. Which makes him less of an animal but more of a warrior. He is smart too. he knows whom to kill and whom not to. There is a brief scene where two helicopters tries to shoot him from two sides coming closer, and KONG just jumps upward and both the helicopters shoot each other and collide. <br/><br/>When it comes to characters , its John C Rilley who has been the biggest asset. The movie used his comic timing brilliantly without spoiling the WAR scenario. Although i would have liked it if some of his dialogues has not been shown in the trailers. <br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson as always plays Samuel L Jackson. A war hero who has just lost a war (although he describe it as abandoning not losing) and now wants to Kill the KONG because it has killed his men. Jackson's character is comparatively good to other characters. <br/><br/>TOM HIDDLESTON and BRIE LARSON were just two good looking characters in the movie. Tom has been show as a TRACKER , but the movie never explores his talent of tracking ever.Also it would have been better if he would not have wore a tight tee shirt because he doesn't have a body to show. BRIE LARSON ? well she is a photographer , and she clicks photos. She gets some brief moments with KONG but as i said the movie never goes to the emotional arena(thankfully). But the post credit scene shows that both these actors will be in the next GODZILLA movie , so it would be nice if some meaty part should be given to them.<br/><br/>Rest of the characters are not worth mentioning , as i said the movie is not about the human characters. But the KONG will surely entertain you. <br/><br/>its pure entertainment. <br/><br/>8.0/10<br/><br/>by ANuP APu KuMaR"

","This film tells the story of a team of scientists and army personnel, who head off to a remote and uncharted Pacific island for a cartographical expedition. Little do they know, that monstrous lifeforms are waiting for them on the unexplored island.<br/><br/>I didn't think I would enjoy ""Kong: Skull Island"" so much! The story is very engaging because of the constant unknowns. The characters are divided into good and bad, while monsters are also likewise divided. This quadratic division gives characters a clear personality, and what the character represent. The visual effects are really good, as there is just no way that you can tell that the island and it's unusual creatures are computer generated. The credit scene touches me to tears. The post credit scene is comparatively long, and is worth staying for. I think this is a great blockbuster."

The final battle between Kong and Skull crawler is simply jaw dropping, and the cinematography not only in that scene but also in the entire movie is simply brilliant. <br/><br/>Before going to the movie, please realize that you're going for a monster flick and it's not an Oscar calibre movie like Moonlight or La La Land, so critic it on that basis only. What this movie does better than Godzilla in my humble opinion is there is more human touch to it, once you see it you'll come to know what I'm talking about. <br/><br/>Lastly, I was very pleased that this Kong movie wasn't like 1933 and the remakes.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","12","23","10 March 2017"," What's in a name/title?
","I plead justifications for re-cycling my summary line from ""Logan"" where I suggested that it highlights the movie's emphasis in portraying Logan more as a human being than a mutant. Here, the inclusion of ""Skull Island"" in the title obviously suggests that this movie is just as about this island as it is about Kong. At this juncture allow me to quickly note a few differences between this one and the previous one, Peter Jackson's version of the folk legend filmed in 2005. I won't go any further back, although there are plenty more.<br/><br/>The most fundamental difference, as mentioned, is that Skull Island features equally as a ""main character"". Kong never even left the island in this first instalment. Yes, sequels are coming. Even if you miss the advertising ""hook"" after the end credit roll, use of the song ""We'll meet again"" right at the end of the movie is painfully obvious.<br/><br/>So, what happened on Skull Island? We need to go back to the time before this movie set right after the Vietnam War. In a nutshell, there was an earth-shattering (very literally) territorial fight between giant monkeys and giant lizards. After what must have been terrifying carnage, lizards were back underground where they came from, and only one monkey survive, as guardian and king of the island, a self-appointed protector of the natives from occasionally reemerging lizards and an assortment of sundry other over-sized creatures.<br/><br/>Let me first get over with the differences I mentioned between Kong-2005 and Kong-2017. The first is size. This one absolutely dwarfs all its predecessors for a good reason: not particularly for this movie, but as a prerequisite for a planned crossover, ""Kong vs Godzilla"". The good old Kong just wouldn't do, completed outclassed. Secondly, as can be deduced from what I mentioned earlier, this Kong is more of a friend than an enemy. The introduction of him is also done very differently. Kong-2005 (as all previous ones too, I am sure), takes its good time, appearing only after the first hour of the movie. Kong-2017 shows up just after thirty minutes, and in no way shrouded in mystery, but in full majesty (you see right away that this one isn't going to climb the Empire State Building – it IS the Empire State Building). Going a bit deeper into the psychological plane, while the relationship between ""beauty"" and the Kong before has always been somewhat erotic, here it is more like platonic friendship. Hence, Andy Serkis's (Kong in 2005, with Gollum as credentials) level of human motion and facial expression capture is not required here.<br/><br/>We have a big cast here which is basically divided into two separate groups upon being stranded on Skull Island, to reunite only towards the end. The simpler group to describe is the military, recent Vietnam veterans given another chance to see action, a ""chance"" received very differently by various members. While most actually want to go home, their leader Packard (a piece of cake for Samuel L. Jackson) is positively beaming. Among the company, most notable is a young private played by talented actor Thomas Mann who played ""me"" in the movie ""Me and Earl and the dying girl"" (2015). Stuck by chance with the military is Randa (an always effective John Goodman), who initiated the adventure to Skull Island (permit me to leave out the plot device which is not exactly innovative).<br/><br/>The other group, all civilians, has a more complex makeup. One most obvious thing you'll note right away is, in terms of casting, its multicultural nature, blatantly market-oriented. The golden guy and gal are British ex-service man Conrad (not terribly demanding work for Tom Hiddleston) hired for his tracking skills and war reporter Weaver (Brie Larson) who is at special pains to stress that she is an ""anti-war reporter"". On a personal note, as I regret very much staying away from Larson's Oscar-winning performance in ""Room"" (2015), pleading claustrophobia, I welcome this first encounter, although this one likely require only 10% of her acting skill.<br/><br/>But one actor that truly steals the show, upon appearing at the mid-point of the movie, is seasoned veteran John C. Reilly playing a soldier stranded on this island for well over two decades, from right before the end of WWII.<br/><br/>One thing everybody talks about is how this movie pays tribute to ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). If you haven't noticed the tell-tale poster, when you see the platoon of fighter helicopters soaring over the tropical landscape, even without Ride of the Valkyries, you can discern as much. The boat trip one the foggy river is a tad overdoing it."

","This movie is a completely useless remake of a King Kong movie - the monkey is uglier (but if you look at it close-up through a lens it looks scarier, right? - wrong!) They replaced the T-Rex-es with a different kind of creatures that perhaps look scarier if they throw them at you in 3D, or in 4DX, when they splash you with water at the same time... And, yes, for the 4DX viewing this is a good ""ride"" - when the monsters fight the chairs are moving intensely and you're splashed and sprayed and rained with water and air and scents... it's a good amusement park ride. But other than that, in the moments when the actors... ""act"" (do they?!)... this movie is pure boredom. A 5-year old would have written a better script. None of the actors matter, none stick with you (other than, maybe, the American chick in tank top who shows she's got some boobs and that's why they put her there) So, if you need a 4DX ride and you can do something else when there's no monsters fighting on the screen, see the movie. If you'll see it in plain 3D or IMAX... you'll be really sorry you wasted the money. Honestly. PS Who the f**k is paying a**holes to make the rating look so high for dumb movies like this? and write pompous reviews?... Are they smoking something?... A Dog's Purpose got a 3-4 in his opening week, although it was a fun, warmhearted movie, just because PETA got upset with some nonsense stuff (human actors are way more traumatized during filming than that dog who was just being put into the water) - and dumb movies like this one have 7-8 scores?!?!

","So I guess my review is the 2nd Vietnamese review on here so far. Yes! It's my country-Vietnam which on-screen in 70% of the film duration with the magnificent view from Ha Long bay, Ninh Binh & Quang Binh. During the 1 month countdown to the premiere, the present and advertising hit the mass media in my country so hard that almost everyday. I actually pay attention to this movie about 2 years ago when it only a 2017 title on IMDb , before the whole Hollywood crews start filming The movie take the audience back to the 1973 in the withdraw of US Army from the Vietnam war. The start look promising, the battle between the Sky Devils fleet and Kong definitely get you edge of your seat( strongly recommend the Dolby Atmos sound and 2D only for better experience-just my opinion). The film then catch-up with gripping, fast-paced and appear to be little low on plot. The iconic Kong of all time now is the king of skull island and look great than ever. The giant buffalo and the view of endless field, the village & the splendid beauty of Ha Long gain my respect more than ever. The fight in the dead valley is quite cinematic and heroic with Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson came to the crash-site with full of revenge and would do anything just to take out Kong. I understand the whole fleet lost put him to this point but really deep in his mind is a soldier cant leave the war. There many funny dialogue between Marlow & Brooks, Mills and Cole (the impressive one with the AK47) which made the audience laughing over and over. The final fight is so impressive and full of tension, Kong vs the big one Skull Crawler. Kong Skull Island is a highly recommend movie for everyone with just some negative argument for the plot and the character development. On the other hand the movie is great, well direct by Jordan Vogt- Roberts with the A-line cast, outstanding graphics, awesome Kong and open up the Monster universe in the after credit. The director announce with the public to came living in Ho Chi Minh city because he love Vietnam and want to make more great movies here-that gains another respect from me. In the end, the movie will bring all the goods, beauty of Vietnam nature to the world."

","What a trip! The movie takes place in the early 70′s and the entire movie has that vibe. As the movie starts the soundtrack of classic 70′s rock lit up the theater and really blended well with the whole island vibe. This is a great movie that seemed more concerned with a good story than focusing on the big monkey himself and that is a good thing.<br/><br/>A crew of military and scientific people head to an island never before seen until recent satellite images discover it for the first time. From the beginning the crew realizes the man heading the expedition, John Goodman, knows more than he is letting on. Everyone still goes along with it all for their own reasons that are fleshed out as the movie progresses. Samuel Jackson plays a army general not quite done with the battlefield. Tom Hiddleston is a tracker who is searching for something more. Brie Larson is a photographer looking to snap the next big thing. If this sounds like a Marvel reunion then this is the movie for you. Everyone plays their part in this film and while there are plenty of different characters they are all fleshed out just enough to make you want to know more. As with giant cast movies the filmmakers could have dropped the ball like a certain Star Wars movie but that didn't happen here. All the characters have their own quirks especially the incredible John C Reilly. <br/><br/>Kong himself is a technical marvel. At this point in the game CGI really is make or brake and him along with all the other creatures on the island are beautifully rendered. The island itself is also stunning. The whole filming process really had me ooing and awing at everything. This was a very colorful movie fill with very vibrant scenes. Along with that it was really well shot with a lot of thought put into making the movie feel like an art piece. It is hard to describe exact shots but it's the sort of thing that you will know when you see the film.<br/><br/>As I stated earlier, the soundtrack really added to the movie. There were many songs that were perfect for the film along with a really great score. This was a really great telling of Kong and a perfect entry into the monster franchise that started with Godzilla. Speaking of which, there is an after credits scene that fleshes more of that world out so I would recommend staying until the final credits roll.<br/><br/>Overall this was a fantastic movie. Perfect for the whole family. Perfect for fans of Steve Brule. This is a great movie to go to after having a personal pan pizza that you might have waited too long in line for. It is also is the type of movie for a fan of big screen monsters but also cinephiles who love a little art in their movies. Go feast your eyes on this flick."
"Troy_Campbell","8","10","19","10 March 2017"," High on rampaging action, low on plot.
","Largely eschewing the solemnity and symbolism that is often attached to the story of King Kong, this cinematic reincarnation focuses on delivering good ol' popcorn entertainment and very little else. Transplanting Kong into the sun-drenched Vietnam War era is the first step towards lightening the mood, with a cracking 70s soundtrack, playful Apocalypse Now references and vibrant cinematography all amplifying the fun factor. But lets face it, this more action-adventure-ish take on Kong is all about its set pieces. Luckily, they range from very good to downright amazing, with top-notch CGI throughout. The final showdown between skyscraper-sized ancient beasts is a suitably epic climax, although the standout is an explosive and exhilarating introduction (excluding a sneak peek in the pre-credits scene) to the eponymous gorilla. The sheer scale of Kong is showcased in glorious moments throughout this sequence, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts combining slow motion, a rumbling sound design and tricky one-shot takes to immerse and elate. Action aside, there's a nice streak of casual humour to offset the death and destruction, and the noteworthy cast—Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Toby Kebbell, John C. Reilly—ham it up in the best way possible. To the movie's detriment, however, is a script that is fundamentally lazy, only providing enough background info on characters so we ostensibly care whether they live or die, yet without following through on majority of subplots. This lack of depth results in some of the 'emotional' moments either falling awkwardly flat or providing unintentional comic relief. Not as narratively rich as previous King Kong films, but certainly more exciting and visually pleasing, Kong: Skull Island is an exuberant and action-packed blockbuster that rightfully doesn't take itself too seriously."

","First off, I'm a total Kong fanatic, have been ever since I can remember, so needless to say, I was beyond excited when it was announced they were bringing the big guy back for a new generation! But as time passed, and with each new trailer they rolled out, I became more and more apprehensive. I was worried they were going to butcher the mythos into some third-rate Marvel wannabe or something. Thankfully, I was wrong; Kong: Skull Island is a great time at the movies!<br/><br/>It's kind of what I remember blockbusters were, when I was a kid. Adventure, fantasy, monsters, without trying to be overly pretentious... and lots and lots of popcorn- munching action. Man, this movie has a lot of it, so buckle up! If you were disappointed with the lack of monster-stomping madness in 2014's Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island has you covered.<br/><br/>The characters, the dialogue, etc. it's all (mostly) good, and the movie didn't let me down on that front, as I'd feared. But let's not kid ourselves, this is a monster movie, and that means it really all hinges on one thing...<br/><br/>I'm pleased to say that this is probably my favourite iteration of Kong since the 1933 original. As you probably know, he's an absolute behemoth. Way bigger than we've known him in the past. But, thankfully, Kong is far and away the most well developed character. He's a protector, a peaceseeker, and the keeper of balance in Skull Island's chaotic ecosystem. But when forced to protect his island, he's absolutely brutal. He's a total barroom brawler. We've never seen a Kong like this before, and I loved every second of it! I'll tell you, Godzilla definitely has his work cut out for him in 2020!<br/><br/>So, go see Kong: Skull Island, order a jumbo popcorn, don't overthink it, just get lost in the world and you'll have a hell of a time!"

","Kong: Skull Island - Repackaged for 2017, this attempt doesn't take a whole lot of risks. The production design, sound, and sense of scale were really the only positives I could find. The soundtrack was enjoyable, but came off a bit cliché. The exact songs you'd expect to be in a Vietnam war film are front and center.<br/><br/>The movie is all but devoid of humor. And I don't mean it takes itself too seriously or doesn't make time for jokes, I mean that the jokes are just hopelessly off the mark. Lines are delivered and it's almost like the editor left in a beat or two after each one to allow the crowd time to laugh without missing anything. This only made them more cringe-worthy because the movie was shamelessly telling you ""this is a funny part!"" while all we heard were crickets. For the first couple of them I found myself thinking ""there has to be more to the joke, I'll just wait for -- oh OK that was it."" There were a few sections of dialogue that were clearly rerecorded after filming. A person would be delivering a line and then, when the camera was at their back, or on someone else in the scene, the tone and cadence would be noticeably different than their lines before and after. And sometimes they didn't even bother to cover it up. There were two distinct moments where what the actor was mouthing wasn't remotely close to what you were hearing.<br/><br/>Lastly, even with this star studded cast (Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larsen, John Goodman, and John C. Reilly) the writers still couldn't provide memorable characters. The development was so poor that out of all them I actually could only remember the name of Samuel L. Jackson's character by the end of the movie. But does that even count? I was only able to do so because you could see it prominently on his jacket throughout the film.<br/><br/>I went in with high hopes, and while I did enjoy it more than the 3 hour offering from Peter Jackson in 2005, I'm still just not a fan. It would seem this story in general is not for me. Having said all this I'm still hopeful for Kong's planned crossover movie with another certain monster in a few years.

You keep thinking people are dying and then they show up again just fine. The characters are flat and totally underdeveloped. The ones they focus on die in totally anti-climatic manners. They overused slow motion. They used every cliché in the book but not enough to make it a parody. So it had the stupid moments of a parody but clearly was meant to be something serious. I admit that there were a couple parts that I thought, oh that was cool. But, in the end it was just confusing and sucky. Watch it only if you are with people you can make fun of it with. Then it will be funny."
"Samiam3","6","5","8","12 July 2017"," A film of stunning scenery and shallow thrills
","Some of the superficial elements that make up Kong: Skull Island, almost make the film worth watching, almost. An exotically stunning picture where the rain forests are so bright and golden as if sunlight was radiating from in between the trees. Kong emerges under the fiery halo of a setting telephoto sun that takes up half the screen. But it was that that moment when I began to have this feeling that I've had too often before, the movie is spectacle and little substance.<br/><br/>We begin with John Goodman convincing a senator to fund an expedition to a newly discovered island (captured by satellite camera). He also gets the luxury of a military escort. Enter Samuel L. Jackson as the commander, perfectly type cast with his bravado Schick that is no longer entertaining. The film also succeeds in wasting Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson. The highlight of the cast, is John C. Riley. Stranded on the island for two decades, he has befriended the local indigenous people and knows all the Islands secrets. His humour and energy, are a relief from watching everyone else perform with zero enthusiasm. <br/><br/>As for King Kong, He is the biggest we have seen yet in a major motion picture. Unfortunately he is stuck in a movie that is not 'King Kong'; a movie that about a monster finding his humanity. This Kong is all about attitude and not soul. The idea is that he is the guardian protector of the island, who fights to keep nature in balance, by controlling the numbers of the other big inhabitants. He is the last of his kind, and his family was killed by a species that looks like an amphibious version of the distinctive skulled ape in Temple Run. <br/><br/>The climax pits Kong against the big daddy of these beasts, a riveting fight scene but with an inevitable outcome. Other highlights include a daddy 'super' long and another giant insect that can disguise itself as a decrepit fallen tree. The jarheads in the movie are virtually nothing more than bodies to feed to creatures like these. In fact the movie often feels like a realized version of the games we used to play with dinosaurs and little toy soldiers.<br/><br/>Director Jordan Vogt Roberts seems to be mimicking Michael Bay films. You can see it in his use of slow motion, his stagy camera angles, and framing, and in his comic book color palette. He handles his action scenes with a greater sense of orientation, but like Bay, he fails to summon any suspense, thrill or anticipation. The film always seems too eager to get to the action oriented punchline of every scene. <br/><br/>The finished product, is a sexy looking, 50's throwback monster movie, with lots of crazy beasts, stunning scenery and nothing in the way of character development or intelligent dialog. Samuel L. Jacksson points a gun and says, ""unless you tell me what I don't know, I will blow your head off."" You can't get much cheesier than that right?"
"Wingman_S","1","5","8","11 July 2017"," How did this happen?
","It's difficult to convey in words just how bad this movie is, but imagine if someone asked a bunch of random people who'd never acted before to make a movie based on a script that only contained the words ""Kong: Skull Island"" well that movie would be infinitely better than what we actually got.<br/><br/>I refuse to believe that functioning adults wrote and allowed this movie to be made, I have to assume that movies are now being written and produced by a really crappy AI that someone found kicking around on an old floppy disk. Oh and for anyone wondering, Samuel L Jackson basically plays Samuel L Jackson, the same one dimensional character he's worn thin over the years, I suspect this wont come as a surprise to anyone though.<br/><br/>I feel pretty confident in saying that unless I accidentally watch the new Transformers movie that this is the worst movie I'll watch all year."
"bowmanblue","8","5","8","22 April 2017"," My latest guilty pleasure film
","Okay, so I'll start by saying that 'Kong: Skull Island' is hardly high-brow entertainment. It's mass marketed nonsense aimed at the lowest comment denominator. I guess I would have to include myself in that bracket, because I thoroughly enjoyed it! We'll ignore Peter Jackson's recently take on the 'King Kong' story, as it bears no relevance here. Instead, back in 1973 the U.S. government discover an island that's remained hidden throughout the years and decide to send in a team to investigate. We're treated to a brief introduction to all the major players and a quick briefing on board the battleship which reminded me of something out of 'Aliens.' And, while we're on the subject of 'Aliens' Ripley would be most proud about the way the military starts dropping bombs all over the island (with a view to 'study' it – no, seriously). So, while helicopters do their best to 'nuke the site from orbit' one of the island's indigenous occupants – an oversize monkey – doesn't take kindly to this course of action and takes down every last one of them, leaving those few survivors not blown up in the massacre to do their best to make their way across the island to the pick-up point before something even worse happens to them.<br/><br/>Now, it's not just enraged monkeys who they have to worry about. They have natives, giant spiders and horrible lizard-things who live underground to contend with. And they soon realise that Kong is the least of their problems! I'm lead to believe that this will be the first in a line of these movies, some even crossing Kong over with other existing franchises ('Godzilla' anyone?) so naturally Kong is – justifiably – the star. However, this does mean that some of the humans are kind of left in the background a bit. It does try to handle quite a large cast and not all of them get the screen time they deserve.<br/><br/>Arguably the film's (human) star is Tom Hiddleston. He's basically everything you'd expect a fantasy/action film's leading man to look like. And, as anyone who's seen him in action as Loki in any of the Marvel films, you'll know he's got the screen presence to pull off the leading man role. And, I'm sure he can. He just never really gets the chance here. It just feels like he never gets a true chance to shine as there are so many other people to also feature that he's only there to look manly and give us a possible hint at a romance with the obligatory female co-star. Of course when you also have Samuel L Jackson among the cast, you really need to give him something to do as you don't want to run the risk of wasting acting talent like his. And, to be fair, he does his best with all the screen time he's afforded and the 'stare-down' between him and Kong is truly chilling. John C Reilly is also worthy of a mention, simply because he balances some much-needed humour with a role that allows him to be more than just the standard 'comic relief.' Now, with any film where there's a strong element of danger in it, you expect there to be a bunch of cast members who are there only to make up the numbers and will be routinely killed off at various points in the film. 'Kong: Skull Island' certainly has plenty of these and – yes – most end up in the belly of a giant arachnid or something. However – without wishing to spoil anything – a few of them make it further into the film than you'd imagine. They're given next to no screen time, yet they last longer than characters you've grown closer to. Of course all human stars play second fiddle to the 'real' star of the show – the titular character 'Kong' himself, who is looking pretty good for his age! In other words the computer effects used to bring him to life are realistic enough to give him more than just your standard CGI monster. And, isn't he the real reason we're going to watch this film? If there is a down-point it's that it's a little long and some scenes seem a bit drawn out. Plus, when Kong smacks down on other CGI creatures, the effects do blur together a bit into one fast-moving mess (but at least it's still not as bad as any of the Transformers movies!). However, if you're expecting a popcorn flick which, despite hardly re-inventing the wheel as far as plot and character development go, you should get some enjoyment in seeing Kong battle it out against all manner of human and monster foe. It's not meant to be a great work of art, so please forgive it its failing and enjoy it for what it is. Let's just hope that whatever sequels and crossovers its success spawns don't dip in quality too much (Transformers, I'm thinking of you again!)."
"johnzappulla","9","8","15","13 March 2017"," This film is AWESOME!
","Ever since the first King Kong debuted in 1933 I have not enjoyed any of the remakes. I am not even a fan of the Godzilla flicks or the Cloverfield type characters. But I do enjoy great special effects and a good unique storyline which you will find in this Kong. First, let's get something out of the way and here is my biggest spoiler. They DO NOT capture Kong and bind him in chains and take him back to New York to be put on display and climb the Empire State Building so he can be killed. Nothing like that and I was extremely appreciative of that. And the whole beauty and the beast thing played a very small part in the movie. All the actors played their parts very well and were all believable. I only found that Samual Jackson's character at the very end got a little ridiculous but it was over quickly. Action was the key component for this film, and it almost became exhausting. Every time the action dies down and the actors breathed a sigh of relief, whamo, here came another challenge in the way of huge creatures that wanted nothing less than to kill everything that moved. Set in the 1960's, at the end of the Vietnam War, the soundtrack was intense as were the songs of that era. So if you enjoy lots of explosions and shooting and understood that NO ONE was safe from being eaten by some nasty creature, then you will have a blast."
"tinovalkki","8","8","15","11 March 2017"," Surprisingly entertaining
","To be honest, I didn't expect much about Kong: Skull Island. Actually I was just waiting to see pretentious effect rumble movie. I was glad to see I was wrong. Of course the biggest thing in this movie are great CGI-effects, but surprisingly there is something more too. There is some great ragging to Americans about Vietnam war and also a reminding that sometimes it is better to let earths nature to alone or we might face even bigger problems in future. Quite clear parable to climate change and present human kind. Even movie has these ""deeper meanings"" it is fundamentally funny and stupid effect rumble movie. Of course there is also that Beauty and the Beast aspect, like in every Kong movie.<br/><br/>The storytelling and movie action are thrilling and great to watch. Some great evergreen songs slates movie action and cgi-effects greatly and quite enjoyable way. At the beginning of the movie it is very clearly who are the bad guys of yhe story and earn to get killed by Kong. Actually Kong is the stories Biggest lonely hero (in all way), who keeps safe the rest of Island inhabitants.<br/><br/>Although the story is quite stupid and brainless effect rumble, it has it's good moments too. Crazy scenes is easy to laugh and in many way they are the best part of the movie. CGI-effects are great and in their silliness surprisingly believable. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has created very enjoyable neoromanticism Kong-story in quite old fashion way. The biggest lesson of the movie is that the human is the biggest monster of the nature and they should learn their lesson, before we have to face even bigger catastrophe. Kong: Skull Island is very entertaining CGI movie and well done new Kong story.<br/><br/>This movie is in it's best when you watch it from big screen. 3D works well and is well worth of a movie ticket price."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","8","15","9 March 2017"," Great reboot for a new generation
","A very entertaining modern adventure flick with great references to Vietnam war dramas like ""Apocalypse Now"". The effects were great, nothing too new but effective and convincing. The only problem I had with the film were the rather flat characters. The screenplay itself was good enough for a monster flick like this but the character really needed some work. The only character that was fleshed out was the one by John C. Reilly and he also gave the finest performance in the film. Tom Hiddelstone was rather underused and a bit pale. I really looked forward because I thought he fit great into that adventurous environment. Samuel L. Jackson was in typical Samuel L Jackson mode. Brie Larson was sexy but didn't provide much to her character either. Even John Goodman was almost invisible. The direction was original, tho I could have done without the slow motion bits. The score was effective. The entertainment value very high and thus the film mostly succeeded in its task. I also loved the imaginary mostly due to the cinematography. Definitely way better than ""Godzilla"" and in the end a very good old fashioned monster adventure flick."

"TheVictoriousV","5","3","4","20 January 2019"," Because of course we must get that Shared Universe rolling
","I'm not sure why he who must not be confused with Mighty Joe Young needed an update. The visual effects of the new King Kong movie are more spectacular and in-your-face than those of Peter Jackson's film, but I suspect you understand why that doesn't necessarily make them better and I hope it goes without saying that they're not as mind-boggling as that which Willis O'Brien pulled off in 1933. The only thing they did was make the ape bigger so why did we even need to see this reboot? Simple. Because we need to get the cinematic universe based around the new Godzilla rolling, because Lord knows every fictional character ever invented needs a cinematic universe now. Why even go to the movies if there aren't 20 other movies that you kinda-sorta-not-really have to see beforehand?<br/><br/>Of course Godzilla has had a multi-picture franchise in the past, including one fight with a resized Kong, but this was back when people didn't run a risk of getting tired of the idea. Then again, I've watched enough Cinemassacre to get a decent idea of how good the original Toho films were so maybe I'm wrong. And besides, when you've got CGI on your side, I hear audiences are not so stubborn these days after all.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island takes place in the 1970's so one might think of it as a quasi-sequel to the original King Kong tale. John Goodman, as government official Bill Randa, assembles a team of scientists, US soldiers, and others to go on an expedition to a hidden island in the South Pacific and discover just why it has kept itself off mankind's maps. It doesn't take long before they realize that ancient forces roam there, and that there is very little hope of them leaving the island or avoiding the horrors that threaten them. This includes, I'm sure you've figured out, a towering gorilla who needs no introduction.<br/><br/>The team in question contains Tom Hiddleston as a retired SAS Captain and Vietnam veteran, Brie Larson as a photographer whose presence in the first manned mission to an anomalous island surrounded by a perpetual thunderstorm is at best disagreeable, Corey Hawkins as a geologist working under John Goodman and trying to put the moves on a young biologist played by Jing Tian, Toby Kebbell as a US Major who yearns for home, John C. Reilly as a lost World War II pilot who has lived amongst the island natives for quite some time, and several other characters that exist only to be killed off. Terry Notary provides the motion-capture for Kong (why apes in film can't ever have the same limitations on their ability to emote as real-life Hominidae I know not) but it feels like wasted effort. Usually when he appears in this movie, he doesn't do anything terribly important and is mostly there to fill a screentime quota so as to keep the ""just show the damn monster"" crowd happy.<br/><br/>It's astonishing how little King Kong actually does in this movie, and how you change your mind about wanting to see him do things once it finally happens and promptly goes on for too long. The rest of the film is dedicated to abrupt moments of action that are forgotten about as suddenly as they appear and cut together in such a way that there's very little time to wrap your head around which characters are in which group and where that group is at the moment. I can't say we ever get to know any of them especially well either (which would be why Gareth Edwards' Godzilla was more successful in its decision to focus on the humans more than the monsters), nor do we get a solid idea of who our main protagonist is. Samuel L. Jackson, whom I forgot to mention, makes up a walking ""stubborn military leader who refuses to listen"" cliché so that one's easier.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, all I could think about were other things that it reminded me of. The first half or so feels so much like a video game it's fascinating. First we get the obligatory 20 minute cutscene; then the gameplay suddenly starts and prompts you to use the WASD keys to dodge lightning strikes and later Kong himself; then we get another cutscene; then we get a random boss fight against a titanic spider where you need to hit its weak spots to kill it.<br/><br/>Other than that, Kong gets most of its ideas from other films. The subterranean lizards that Kong fights look like the Cloverfield monster with fewer appendages, the forced banter between the army guys feels like something out of a less genuine Black Hawk Down, and there are several homages to Jurassic Park which, distracting as they may be, are admittedly a bit more intentional. It also brought to mind Aliens, Apocalypse Now, and the works of Michael Bay in general - with its CG fireballs, overused slow-motion, shots of helicopters against sunset backgrounds, and awkwardly inserted comedy. The characters aren't much smarter than your standard Michael Bay inventions either.<br/><br/>Kong isn't entirely worthless. The visual effects team, the camera people and the sound designers have done a great job giving King Kong an awesome presence, and some of the references to old Toho kaiju have a charm to them. These aren't spoilers, by the way. Nothing is a spoiler anymore. The cliffhanger at the end of this film's credit sequence will not shock you if you have open eyes and ears and know that Legendary Entertainment have already announced Godzilla vs. Kong. Here's hoping the next Pacific Rim plays into it somehow."
"csh-29563","9","3","4","30 September 2018"," A Good Way to Enter the Series
","As someone who hasn't seen a Kong movie, this was a great way to enter the series for me. The new Monarch franchise of movies seems to be promising, and Kong: Skull Island was a great way to start it off.<br/><br/>The movie starts fast, introduces every main character and play a role in Colonel Packard's (Samuel L. Jackson) crew. The characters fit perfectly in the post-Vietnam War setting with an anti-war photographer (Brie Larson), and several of Colonel Packard's crew just ready to go home (Corey Hawkins, Shea Whigham)<br/><br/>The first scene of Kong being introduced, which is very similar to the poster, just gives you an idea on how destructive Kong can be. Tossing trees at helicopters, stepping on people, brings the excitement of the movie as it gets rid of characters nobody really cared about<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the story moves in a linear fashion, people have to explore the island and get back to the north shore in 3 days. Groups are all split up as the fight with Kong separated a lot of people from each other. You go through each groups' journey trying to find their way to the others, while also not trying to die to either Kong, Bamboo-Legged Spiders, and Giant Tree-Disguised Monsters. The introduction of Marlow (John C. Reilly) provides the comic relief to the story as he's a man who knows all the dangers of the island, and tells the dangers in a funny, but scary way. A few plot holes here and there aren't noticeable until someone points them out, and even then it doesn't take away from the overall story at all.<br/><br/>The ending is the part that really captured me as you see Marlow reunite with his family after spending 23 years on the island away from them, and enjoy his long deserved Hot Dog while watching the Cubs. This ties up the loose end we saw when Marlow and a Japanese Rival crash landed on the island during World War II. The post credits scene sets up the future movies by featuring an old cave painting of Godzilla that will have you excited for the next movie.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island definitely should be on anybody's watch list as it provides a great story and some quality entertainment<br/><br/>4.5 stars out of 5."

","Kong Skull Island is a monster of a movie. King Kong needs no introduction, but Skull Island adds a few good changes. For one the giant ape is about ten times as large as its 1933/76/05 versions and the movie makes sure we routinely get to observe him in all its glory. Special effects are dazzling- the scene where the mercenaries first encounter King Kong is mesmerizing, and the actors know what to expect from a film like this and go along, especially John Goodman. This is a brand-new reimagining of a story that everyone knows and yet Kong: Skull Island will leave you pleasantly surprised. All credit to the director Jordan Vogt- Roberts."
"jtindahouse","8","3","4","31 January 2018"," A massive improvement from 'Godzilla'
","Most people probably went into 'Kong: Skull Island' excited about some King Kong action. I went in excited to see what this fantastic cast could come up with. Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly. All incredible actors and yet all in some way underrated when it comes to their craft. So were they able to turn on the brilliance? Yes, indeed they were. The only one of the five who gave a weak effort in my opinion was John Goodman. His character seems like he's going to be the star early in the film, but then fades into oblivion as things go along. The rest all gave great performances but the best of the five for me was Reilly. He really turned the charm on and was given some great one-liners to work with. He was definitely my favourite part of the movie.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself I was a little skeptical going in. I hadn't really enjoyed 2014's 'Godzilla' at all, and knowing this was a follow on in the same universe had me apprehensive. Luckily though, this was a far superior film in almost every way. The first (actually technically second) time you see Kong in the film is quite a mind-blowing moment. The share size they decided to make him is quite overwhelming and impressive. All the creatures in this movie though are made absolutely terrifically and look great. The action sequences (particularly the one near the end) are filmed exquisitely and are absorbing to watch.<br/><br/>When the 'Godzilla vs. Kong' film is made they need to make sure they lean a lot heavier on Kong and less so on Godzilla. Kong is unquestionably a superior character and makes for far better films. He's relatable is why. People see themselves in him to an extent I believe. 'Kong: Skull Island' was a very good film that I would highly recommend."

","Samuel L Jackson, John Goodman, Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston, star along with a giant ape in this action packed film with a sense of humor. Goodman plays his usual wise cracking guy with a mission to take the military to Skull Island on a supposed scientific mission. Sam Jackson is the leader of the army guys fresh out of Vietnam in 1973. Real news footage of FDR, JKF, Ike, and Tricky Dicky are well used to start the adventure. A soundtrack with Creedence, Bowie, Black Sabbath and more great 70s music make this a fun ride. The story is secondary to the action scenes with the big gorilla battling giant lizards and other esoteric creatures. The CGI effects are excellent and the cast is superb, although Ms. Larson's hair is never out of shape as she slogs through the jungle with an apparent hairdresser equipped with a blow dryer to maintain her perfect quaff. Brie's hair is a minor complaint as I was totally entertained for the entire two hour running time."

","You get a lot for your buck here - not just King Kong but a whole bunch of giant animals and insects. And the effects are good so the fighting between the animals is quite something. It's also quite a violent movie with a pretty high body count - feels like a Vietnam War movie. The filming was in fact in Vietnam and Hawaii and it's quite beautiful and exotic.<br/><br/>Brie Larson is good for this role not annoying and believable. Tom Hiddleston is miscast - like some Engish gentleman on a hunt. Out of place. Samuel is a good match as Kong's adversary. And John C Reilly is good in this role for a change. There is a sense of adventure and a variety of scenarios and creatures that sets it apart from another Jurassic style adventure."

Crashing on Skull Island,the gang find missing solider Hank Marlow,and find themselves facing the king of Skull Island:Kong.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Running at a lean 104 minutes, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts & cinematographer Larry Fong aim at a prime pulp mood, lit by misty yellow filters taking the viewer back to 'Nam, and seamless blending of real and CGI camera moves, stylishly looking deeply into Kong's eyes. Whilst Fong has gone for black on black in his recent work with Zack Snyder, Vogt-Roberts pushes the darkness aside for a lush green backdrop. Closely working with editor Richard Pearson, Vogt-Roberts allows the detailed monster designs (inspired by Japanimation ) and Kong to be fully displayed with extended takes that give the action scenes (which includes a tribute to Cannibal Holocaust!) a mighty crunch,as each of Kong's fighting moves lands with a thump. <br/><br/>Climbing the 2nd stage of a franchise,the screenplay by John Gatins/ Dan Gilroy/Max Borenstein and Derek Connolly nicely follow Vogt- Roberts path by keeping the tale nicely pulpy,as the post-'Nam time period is used to send the gang on a thrilling jungle Adventure flick, where nasty thunderous monsters lurk round ever corner. Tasked being pesky humans for Kong, (played by an excellent, motion- captured Terry Notary and Toby Kebbell) Tom Hiddleston/ Brie Larson and Jason Mitchell give good performances as well-meaning ""Conrad"" (talk about subtle!)

None of the cast is even remotely important, and like I said above, most (if not all) the characters were used as expendable exposition.

In the end I decided to give Kong: Skull Island an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10.

","Going back to when you know what it's on the other side. Exploring the unknown? There's more to see. Remember the 1933 movie ""King Kong""? Well, this is like happened before the blonde beauty, before he was removed from his home. ""KONG: SKULL ISLAND"", is the origin of the majestic ape that ruled the island. We do know that Kong is the last of his kind. His family was wiped out by some reptilian creatures that terrorized the island. When two groups of people come to the island: an expedition group, and a military escort led by Lt. Colonel Packard(Samuel L. Jackson). His team laid out bombs on the island that awoke the protector, Kong. He attacks the team and scatters the expedition team. In 1944, an airplane pilot name Hank Marlow(John C. Reilly) encountered Kong along with his Japanese adversary. When they became friends, his friend Ikari was killed by the Skullcrawlers, and he has his sword to remember him with. When the bombs awoke the Skullcrawlers, it was up to Kong to stop them. Knowing that the colonel is a vindictive madman, they would rather help Kong instead. And the legend of Kong is known. Samuel L. Jackson recalls the ""Hold on to your butts"" catchphrase made famous in ""Jurassic Park"". Too bad he had to stoop so low to destroy a legend. I remember watching the 2005 version of the 1933 remake. The fight scenes are remarkable. I liked it when Kong ripped out the viscera of the Skullcrawler. No wonder Kong was such a legend. This is great. A must see film! 5 Stars!"

I hooked up with a couple of friends from work and we ended up having satisfying and long lasting sex so seriously best advice I have for you is to do something useful that you know you will enjoy instead of dragging yourselves out to a movie just to be up on the latest releases because this one will disappoint you. By the way, I just did a search and I cannot find the answer. this film is based on a character of a giant ape called 'King Kong' but the title only mentions 'Kong.' Is that because of a copyright issue?"

"Wuchakk","7","7","13","7 May 2017"," Delivers the goods for fantasy-adventure lovers
","Released in 2017 and directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, ""Kong: Skull Island"" takes place in 1973 where a military crew about to depart Vietnam is commissioned to guide an expedition to map out the eponymous island. Of course, the giant ape, Kong, is soon discovered, as well as several other deadly colossal creatures, including reptilian underground monsters dubbed ""Skullcrawlers."" Will anyone make it out alive? <br/><br/>Like my title blurb says, this delivers the goods for fantasy-adventure lovers. The opening act is great with its kinetic air and excellent late 60s/early 70's soundtrack. The rest of the movie more or less keeps up the entertainment value, highlighted by the racially diverse cast, led by Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson and John C. Reilly; there are many others.<br/><br/>""Skull Island"" has the high adventure demanded in a King Kong flick and is arguably on par with the original ""King Kong"" (1933), as well as the 1976 and 2005 versions, although it's superior to the latter because it lacks that one's pretentious over-length, cartoonish CGI-jungles and overkill action sequences (like the absurd brontosaurus stampede). Of course, it's criminal to compare a modern CGI-oriented flick with a classic like the 1933 film (or even the '76 version); I'm just saying that, if you favor those movies, you'll probably relish this one because it's cut from the same cloth and is effective for what it is, a colossal creature adventure flick. For further comparison, ""Skull Island"" is pretty much as good or, IMO, better than any of the Jurassic Park pictures.<br/><br/>Along with the thrilling jungle escapades, there are some interesting subtexts and gems to mine, like the quasi-Ahab subplot and the fact that dropping myriad bombs might not be the best answer. Early in the film the photographer (Brie) tells the the gung-ho Colonel (Jackson) that America lost the Vietnam War. Yet, this isn't really accurate since the USA won every battle of that infamous conflict. So the colonel rightly corrects her: ""We didn't lose the war; we abandoned it."" <br/><br/>The movie runs 118 minutes and was shot in Ha Long Bay, Quang Ninh, Vietnam; Oahu, Hawaii; and Queensland, Australia; with studio work done in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

","I've never written a review but I will for this one. The editing is too quick, each shot lasting 2 seconds and switching to a completely different scene. There was too many narratives happening at once, too many characters to focus on at once, the writing was very predictable and there were far too many unnecessary cliché lines. However, the biggest downfall of this film was Samuel Jackson overacting, don't get me wrong, he's a good actor but he never should of been in this film. The combination of the directors choices and his character just didn't work. The only good bits of this film was the beautiful scenes between Kong, Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson.

"drawlife","7","7","13","13 March 2017"," A serviceable, fun spring blockbuster.
","I'll start off by saying I enjoyed this more than Godzilla. <br/><br/>That's not to say I disliked Godzilla, but every time something interesting or a really cool monster moment surfaces, it kept cutting away. Godzilla delivers in the finale, but what Kong does differently is that it isn't afraid to embrace those monster moments. Right off the bat, Kong is showcased front and center and it is pleasing eye-candy. <br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is action-packed, and director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has a keen eye for action. Cinematographer Larry Fong and the hard working special-effects artists produce some remarkable visuals. Kong combats a squad of helicopters who are swooping in formation. Vogt-Roberts doesn't overuse the slow-motion sequences, but he uses them at the right moment in the middle of the action. It never really cheapened all of the action set- pieces, it actually enhanced the experience. Lots of great creatures too, some deadly looking lizards things, a giant octopus, a giant spider, and some pre-historic looking birds. Kong himself looked fabulous. He's obviously the misunderstood monster as he is only protecting his turf and territory. He is ginormous, bigger than ever and it makes a difference. Kudos to the VFX team, there is a sense of scale and weight to Kong and all the other creatures in the film. <br/><br/>The actors do their job commendably. Not much is fleshed out with any of these characters to be honest, but they do bring some gravitas to the film. Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, and John Goodman do their best to make their characters believable. Jackson in particular can be compared to Col. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. Against all logic and odds, he's obsessed with his mission. John C. Reilly provides a lot of humor into the film as he is a WWII pilot, stranded on Skull Island for almost thirty years. Some characters are really there for exposition, particularly the short, not much to do roles played by Corey Hawkins and Tian Jing. <br/><br/>I do want to point out that I appreciated Hiddleston and Larson's relationship in the film. While not fleshed out at all, it wasn't some typical Hollywood, forced down your throat romance, rather just a mutual respect for one another. Larson's character is also involved in the action, useful at times, and not just some damsel in distress. Some of the supporting roles of the soldiers played by Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, and Thomas Mann aren't as expendable as one would typically expect them to be so that was a nice surprise as well. <br/><br/>It's no secret that Legendary and WB are creating a MonsterVerse with Kong, Godzilla, and all the other Toho creatures. They've got some franchise building to do, and for corporate film making, this movie goes through the checkmarks very well. Vogt-Roberts does a good job not making it feel like a ""filler"" film to fill in the gaps, as a matter of fact it does feel like it stands on its own for the most part. He moves the story along from A to Z with a lot of eye candy action. The choice of music and the color palette he choose feels like a Vietnam/70's film. It does what it needs to do and it's a fun way to kill off two hours. <br/><br/>Obviously stay through the credits. It's a nice tease. <br/><br/>7/10"
"ctowyi","7","7","13","11 March 2017"," This is a BLAST!
","I really had no high hopes for this as I ventured inside the cinema, but surprise surprise, I came out with a bounce in my step and if nobody were around I would have beat my chest and roared.<br/><br/>Kong is the second movie in the MonsterVerse series, following Godzilla (2014). The latter is a bit of a disappointment – the monster element is fine, its height used to great advantage and the huge vistas of mayhem and destruction is a young kid's wet dream. However, I couldn't wrap my head around the heavy-handed and joyless storytelling. The human component felt neglected; they barely registered a presence beyond the crazy one, the screaming one, the gung-ho one, the running one, the brooding scientist whom no one bothers with but still keeps around for some alternative voice. I find all the big-name actors very cardboard-y and lifeless. It also didn't help that the story is so fatiguing with so much overbearing self-importance. Fast-forward to 2017's Kong, I would love to say the filmmakers have learned from their predecessor, but in all honesty I can't. However, Kong is a lot more entertaining than Godzilla and for a B-grade movie it embraces its shortcomings with finesse. This is a blast!<br/><br/>Kong has the right blend of silly humour and all-out monster action. Yes, the human characters still feel hollow, the exposition can be clunky and the story is unoriginal and riffs off Francis Ford Coppola's sublime Apocalypse Now, but it is plain dumb to expect the ensemble cast and screenplay to hold up during award season. What this is is a good ole pulsating monster mash of fun. There is a wee bit pressing of genre refresh button in that Kong doesn't fall for a white woman which will lead to his downfall and the sandbox playground is no longer a skyscraper city but Kong's Eden home ground, which is home to a multitude of humongous creatures. It is getting increasingly tiresome to see another city getting devastated, so it is refreshing to see a straight-up survival movie on an island where the human beings aren't on top of the food chain. The star is definitely the lonely God, Kong and the rest of crazy inhabitants of Skull Island. The visual and sound effects are stellar, and most importantly, the action doesn't feel repetitive. Each time Kong goes mano a mano against another monster, there isn't that dreaded been-there-done-that feeling. My fave is definitely Kong having an octopus sashimi for lunch; definitely won't be forgetting that for a while, especially when I am chewing on a tangy squid or octopus.<br/><br/>The impressive ensemble cast plays second fiddle to Kong and his monster ""friends"", and they seldom rise up beyond a distinctive character trait. Tom Hiddleston as John Conrad has to be some kind of convenient homage to Joseph Conrad whose Heart of Darkness is obviously an inspiration. Brie Larson, after her award-winning turn in Room, shows off different levels of seriousness. Samuel L. Jackson almost had time to utter his famous muthafcuking line. John Goodman plays a corporation type with affable charm. John C. Reilly obviously had the most fun playing a WWII pilot marooned on Skull Island for decades. Then we get a myriad of soldiers playing fodder and meals for the inhabitants of the island. This being a partially financed movie by China, we also get a completely disposal China actress doing ""I don't know what"". Sure, the complete cast doesn't get much of a chance to shine, but they are definitely colourful and not bogged down by an overly important story.<br/><br/>Remember to hang back for a post-credit sequence that entices a neat future prospect. After that you can stand up and beat your chest with animalistic confidence and shout ""All hail the King!"""

","Watching the new version of Kong yesterday felt like riding a crazy over-the-top roller coaster without fastening seat belts, and it took me some time to recover from the dizziness.<br/><br/>The movie is soaked in style, and very entertaining; it's not what you're expecting from a prototypical blockbuster creature feature, but instead, it's a mishmash of extravagant themes, flashy tone, and some top-notch set pieces.<br/><br/>What cheered me the most was how they handled the coloration and cinematography. All those irrational close-ups of Richard Nixon's crazily-moving head doll, the reflection of some massive explosion on a pair of shiny sunglasses resting on a soldier's smiling face, the brief shot of the clapping monkey, the rough cuts, the surprises, and the overall surreal tone. Some may see this as an absurdity, but not me. Tastes vary.<br/><br/>This movie intended to be a pure action spectacle, take it for what it is."
"trevor-82944","4","12","26","10 March 2017"," Monstrous Epicness for the Ape Minded
","Were you disappointed by the amount of screen time by the giant lizard in Godzilla? I have good news for you: the big ape of Kong: Skull Island hits the screen immediately before the opening credits in all his grandness, and appears constantly throughout the film with constant action and explosions in the mix. Yet even without the ape on screen all the time, the amount of swords, flames, helicopters, bombs, and Skullcrushers satisfactorily draw out everything moment by moment in an approach comparative to various scenes in Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>So whether if you're a millennial or a baby boomer, the action should satisfy. Standard to the tradition of Skull Island, other behemoths are accompanied to confront both Kong and the humans in search for him. These camouflaged beasts include a swamp ox, a log insect, a giant spider amongst a bamboo forest, reptilian birds, and a kraken who becomes Kong's dinner. Other colorful sights on this god forsaken island range from the mesmerizing northern lights to the horrific pale-tinted mass grave of great ape skeletons, creating a believable look to a testing world against man's successes.<br/><br/>Would such an experience keep you talking in the long run? Will you get pumped for Kong's eventual confrontation against Godzilla?<br/><br/>Well, let's rewind the clock to answer that question, shall we?<br/><br/>As the movie starts, a World War II soldier crash lands on a deserted island in 1944, only to come face to sword against a Japanese warrior. Compared to past King Kong movies, this slightly different period setting receives a rather poor treatment; I mean, when the first five minutes persuades us to cheer on a US soldier fighting against one of the Pearl Harbor bombers, has racism really changed at all by 2017 standards?<br/><br/>Then the opening credits shows historical footage of man's scientific progress up until 1973. Then we see a researcher intent on proposing a government-funded trip to an unexplored destination named ""Skull Island,"" the one island God did not finish creating. They compare it to the Bermuda Triangle, as nobody has ever come back alive. So right at the Vietnam War's end, a team of US soldiers, investigators, and a photographer set out to explore. Eventually they find the same soldier who crash landed in 1944, and introduce the old soldier to the worlds' robust change since he left humanity, and team up with him to head back home. Although could man really be king here? Especially when the castaway tribe worships a 200 foot tall ape?<br/><br/>Kong may be an epic time for all you men out there, but you ladies may be napping once or twice, as your only mode of connection is Oscar winner Brie Larson (Room, Short Term 12), who exists here purely to play THAT kind of female lead. You know, the one who exists just so women have a celebrity name to gush over. The one who gets wet while wearing a skimpy gray tank top. If you're still not underwhelmed, what if I told you about her romantic subplot, one that meets absolutely no resolution?<br/><br/>You may not even notice any predictable romantic subplot anyway, as there are so many millimeter thick cardboard cutout characters, none of which have a proper introduction to tell you who they are as human beings. Some of them are even there purely for comic relief's sake. The large cast's screen time balance of screen time has so little attention, you don't feel any hint of tension or sorrow whenever one of them gets killed or mauled.<br/><br/>Now one question still remains: how will it be when Kong has to fight Godzilla in 2020? I can absolutely presume the fight will be epic. I mean, if Kong can deliver the nonstop action and cinematic grandness we asked for, while also learning its lessons from 2014's Godzilla, then it should turn out entertaining enough.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you prefer a much deeper story featuring characters who are worth cheering on, then you'd probably be better off watching Peter Jackson's version as opposed to investing in future films similar to Kong: Skull Island. It may not be a particularly good movie, nor was it trying to be, but it's still a pretty sweet thrill ride!"
"Semisonic","7","6","11","24 June 2017"," Technically, the most compelling Kong of 'em all
","Yes, the review title may sound ridiculous, especially if you're one of those people who hate remakes. And I agree, it's kinda crazy that the story of a gigantic ape now got its fourth installment. But if you rise above the prejudice, you will see that there's more to this film than just a monetary incentive.<br/><br/>Over the years, I happened to watch all the King Kong films (not the sequels, just the story openers), including the 1933 classic. And while their plot is generally the same, it's the accents that make the difference and show what the films were about in each particular epoch. The first film was basically a wow-inducing breakthrough with a social undertone (showing a giant ape in chains for the white crowd's amusement might ring some bells in 30's America). The film from the 70's was much more of a melodramatic tear-jerker. And what Peter Jackson did, apart from actually remaking some of the original scenes like a fight with a T-Rex, was ultimately devoid of a substantial core of any kind, so the only thing I do remember from that film is Jack Black's character's ridiculous ending line said with a totally unfitting pathos.<br/><br/>But the progress moves on, and even the old tropes acquire additional depth the audience has come to expect from films no matter what the genre they belong to (unless the genre is the CGI metal porn directed by Michael Bay). And this Kong, compared to the previous films, tries its best not to be shallow.<br/><br/>We've been given the characters with reasonable agendas, ones that might seem insane per se but are quite believable in this particular setting. We've got the story progression that gradually shifts our view of Kong from a bloodthirsty killing machine to something worth feeling sympathy for. And all that is done without emotional manipulation of any sort - and that thing alone earns Kong: Skull Island my respect.<br/><br/>But the best thing of this film is that, unlike what others say and what I've been kinda expecting myself, it doesn't just spray acting talent around hoping that the famous names and faces cement the whole gig. No, the film exploits its acting squad just right, making even the secondary/expendable characters memorable. So it's actually not so big of a surprise that the whole emotional narrative of this film is built not around the classic ""beauty and the beast"" line but around a letter that one of the soldiers keeps writing to his son. And the fact that that soldier is played by Toby Kebbell, the same guy who's behind Kong himself, adds even more humanity to this film, something that even the talented Andy Serkis failed to bring to its 2005 predecessor.<br/><br/>Even though Kong: Skull Island is far from perfect, with its own preposterous moments, it's still a film that's enjoyable to watch. And it's something that even being the third remake can't spoil."

","Big, dumb, fun. If you went into Kong: Skull Island expecting much more than that, you were in the wrong theater. Big, dumb, fun was all I was expecting and Kong delivered. I've seen numerous reviews criticizing the movie for being little more than big, dumb, fun. Well, entertainment is the primary reason I watch movies. Character development, a deep philosophical meaning, or gigantic plot holes hardly matter if I'm having a good time watching a movie. And I had a great time watching Kong. <br/><br/>There's just so much about Kong: Skull Island that appealed to me. First, it's a total action movie. The film gets off to a fast start and rarely slows down. I can't imagine Kong's final fight scene being any more thrilling. Second, I got a real kick out of the special effects. Kong never looked better. And the skull crawlers were amazing. I don't think I've been as impressed with special effects in a movie since I saw Jurassic Park back during its initial release. Third, John C Reilly – what a great actor. Very funny stuff. Fourth, Brie Larson's tank- top. Not sure I need to say more. And finally, the interesting island natives. I do wish the movie had slowed down just a bit to explore these people. Their story would make a terrific movie where Kong is in the background and not the central character. Overall, there's so much eye candy on display, presented often at breakneck speeds – that's what I like about Kong: Skull Island.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is with Samuel L Jackson. I know I'm tempting fate and the wrath of fanboys everywhere, but Jackson's character really annoyed me. It's the same character he plays in just about every single movie he appears. He's turning into a one-note actor. I know people enjoy the character Jackson plays (and I did the first half-dozen time I saw it), but how about something a little different?"

I loved this movie as to me, it paid homage to the classic Godzilla in little ways that some true fans might pick up.<br/><br/>This brings me to the subject of this review; KONG: Skull Island. First off, the movie gives us a unique telling of the story by changing the time-line of the story and therefore giving it a different feel to the 2014 Godzilla. The CGI was fantastic and they even went as far as to have Kong stand more erect, like the TOHO Studios Kong from the 60's (due to a man being in the Kong suit). The cast all did a fine job and each made their characters interesting. I particularly liked John Goodman and John C. Riley's performances. Tom Hiddleston did a fine job as the male lead and was noticeably slightly buffed up than his portrayal as Thor's brother, Loki. Samuel Jackson played... Samuel Jackson. LOL... The movie stayed on point and covered the science aspect just enough to give it a follow-able story and yet not too much to bore kids in the audience.<br/><br/>The 3D effects in the film really stood out and were not overbearing or obnoxious. There were plenty of creatures to keep Kong occupied and us entertained throughout the story.<br/><br/>If you do plan on seeing this... please stay to the very, very end of the end credits.

Better yet (and unlike Jackson's film), the new movie understands the line between thrilling an audience and scaring it silly — between action-adventure awe and horror-movie gross-outs.

","While simplistic at first glance, Kong: Skull Island surprisingly has some good ideas invested in it. <br/><br/>The initial 1970s/post-Vietnam feel of the era is well-built. The conflict arising between the scientists' reason and the strongman attitude of the soldiers gives a good color to the otherwise weak plot. There are also some pleasant literary references thrown in, namely to H.P. Lovecraft's works (South Pacific island, dormant species waiting to reclaim the planet) and Joseph Conrad (Tom Hiddleston's character).<br/><br/>These could have easily been developed into a deeper story without making the movie too serious. Unfortunately, it's a purely visual monster fest that doesn't really add much - if anything - to the existing source material. From a technical standpoint, there is an overabundance of music, some sloppy editing, and occasionally awkward camera work, though the CGI is not too heavy and the scenery is quite beautiful. <br/><br/>It's thin on substance even though it could have avoided that, but still entertaining and worth a watch."
"shivamt25","7","6","11","11 March 2017"," An edge of the seat action monster flick!
","Kong: Skull Island is about a team of scientists and soldiers who went on to explore an uncharted island. Little did they know that they are trespassing into the territory of the Kong, the King of Skull Island. Also, the island is filled with many mythical creatures, hidden from the rest of the world. Now, the team must fight to escape the wrath of these creatures. The movie is directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, known for 'The Kings of Summer', and starring a stunning cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson and John C. Reilly. <br/><br/>The special effects team is the one to give credit for the success of the film. The movie starts with a bang and ends with a bang. Everyone of the action sequence, whether it be the introduction scene of Kong or the final fight between Kong and 'Skull Crawler', are so created so well that it develops, and maintains the thrill throughout the movie. The film is well paced. Character build up is concise as we were not there to know about a bunch of soldiers or scientists were we? We went to the theaters to watch the Kong, the mighty monster. We wanted him to throw things, to smash something, to kill and that is what the movie makers understood while making the film. They introduced Kong early and gave him ample extent of screen time. I saw many from the audience screaming in enthusiasm every time Kong appeared on screen. I guess the character has gained a decent amount of fan following. There were a lot many scenes involving different mythical monsters which added to the excitement.<br/><br/>Apart from the constant edge of the seat action, two other things which I liked were the location and the soundtrack. The film is set in the era of 1970s, right after the Vietnam War. So, its soundtrack gave a feel of the 70s with songs by David Bowie, Iggy Pop etc. If we talk about acting, well, there was not much need of special efforts to be put in this department. If I have to mention someone I would say that I really like the character Hank Marlow, played by John C. Reilly. He was responsible of providing half the humor the movie has. All the other just added to the star value of the film. <br/><br/>I can confidently say that the film fits into the pattern of a well- executed monster movie. Compared to the one which came in 2005, this one definitely has much more to offer, but I still can't choose if you ask me which one is better. But what I can tell you is that this one is going to be a part of something bigger, so make sure you watch this, and the 2014 Godzilla movie. Legendary films have recruited writers to create a monster universe (A Mosterverse!) including Godzilla and King Kong, how cool is that right!"

","Going into the theater tonight, I had a lot of expectations. I haven't gotten a taste of the King in a long time since Peter Jackson's take at the series. <br/><br/>What caught my eye at first before the movie even began was Legacy Films and... Tencent Films? Ooh an Chinese film production. This should be good! This immediately led me to let my guards down because I knew this movie was up for some cheesy stuff.<br/><br/>The very first parts of the movie had me siked as hell. Samuel L Jackson, John Goodman, and Loki. Probably my favorite actors in the whole world.<br/><br/>The movie opens up in WW2 with a Japanese soldier's plane getting shot down, and then John C Reilly's character's plane following right behind him. They try to kill each other, only to be interrupted by the King himself... Kong. Not even 5 minutes in and his face is already in the whole theater's face.<br/><br/>The parts right up until we discover the main group is separated are great, but that's when I think it falls downhill. The scenes started to become a real jumbled mess jumping back and forth between the two groups led by James Conrad(Tom Hiddleston) and Preston Packard(Samuel L Jackson)<br/><br/>The movie became SO cluttered, and it didn't flow at all to me. The other the thing that initially caught me off guard was how colossal Kong is. What I loved about Peter Jackson's movie is everything was anatomically aesthetic, everything fit the environment it lived in, which is how it should be. Here? Nah, everything here is gonna be 100+ feet tall by default. The smallest creature we probably see are some Deer grazing and Pterodactyls. <br/><br/>I thought the first lizard was a good size, what bothered me was it having no legs. To me, a creature with no legs and only supported by it's arms is not able to be that mobile and flexible, especially when fighting.<br/><br/>What I also didn't understand is the depth of the water Kong would be in. At one point in the movie, we see Chapman is alone and a gigantic squid is out and about in the water, probably preying on Chapman. The squid descends into the depths and enter Kong, splashing and making a big ruckus, also seeming to walk on water that SHOULD be deep. That whole random sequence of Kong and the Squid fighting was just like ""what?"" because Kong is sitting here slamming the squid's head into the bottom of the lake which must change depths fairly frequently from very deep to very shallow. I noticed this throughout the whole movie, especially the ending scene where Mason Weaver is knocked into water that I was led to believe was once again, shallow, but ended up being extremely deep as the camera panned to underwater and we see her falling down to the depths.<br/><br/>I do realize now, however, that this film was made for Kong vs Godzilla and that this movie is purely for the fighting. I thought the CGI was pretty damn good, I loved the way the lizards looked besides the anatomy. Kong looked even cooler. But the characters, script, and acting eventually became so atrocious I didn't mind the mom and two teenage boys chit chatting it up and laughing hysterically while trying to remain quiet at whatever was so funny...<br/><br/>Another point I wanna bring up is John C. Reilly's character. I really did not think the comedy he brought to this was necessary at all. It felt decently forced, and it really ruined the flow of the scene. Also, a guy who crashed here with a dead best friend that tried to kill him during WW2 and lived with Tribal Members that hardly talk for 28 years and is still 100% sane... how?<br/><br/>I also was fairly surprised the Tribe was not cannibalistic or aggressive. They were fairly friendly to the explorers, which is 100% different from Peter Jackson's King Kong.<br/><br/>Maybe I got spoiled by Logan(which is by far one of my #1 films in the last 4 years) or something, but if you go into the theater expecting a good fight, then you're there for the right reason. The movie is going to be cheesy, it's gonna be slightly edgy with the romance that never really even happened... even though the characters obviously showed a romantic interest.<br/><br/>My final closing thoughts are; Go in and enjoy the CGI and Fighting, I'll be nice and give it a 6/10. Just don't mind the clutter and acting/script."

","Kong of Skull Island is a movie about some soldiers and some government officials and a tracker and a photographer who go to a strange island and meet giant creatures. Most the creatures are neutral - some are evil - but one is a good creature and his name is none other than King Kong. The classic movie monster of the ages. In a reboot. Again.<br/><br/>The soldiers decide they want to kill King Kong - basically because their commander is angry that the Vietnam war is over and now he sees a new enemy. After all - the war can never end in his mind. So this commander - and his soldiers - set forth a series of events that will sew the seeds of their own destruction as they go to war with Kong.<br/><br/>But - the tracker and the photographer meet a slew of interesting tribal folk and they soon learn that Kong is like a force of nature - his existence must be protected or else evil creatures will rise from the decay of the Earth to unleash destruction. They choose to help Kong.<br/><br/>The plot sounds cooler than the movie unfolds. The main problem is that the CGI battles start big and this never gives the movie a chance to reach a climax. Kong fight man. Kong fight squid. Kong fight giant lizard. Kong help ox. Kong help woman. Kong love woman. End.<br/><br/>Also - the commander who battles Kong is played by Samuel L Jackson who basically becomes a parody of himself. It's as if the director said, ""Can we just have Samuel L Jackson versus King Kong - and say everything cool that Samuel L Jackson would say?"" To me - that is a parody that steals a lot from what could have been a great character.<br/><br/>This is basically just a dumb American video game that rips off a lot of script and crossroads moments from other successful war films. There is never any time to emotionally bond with King Kong - or anyone else in the movie - so it's all action and no story.<br/><br/>There was a giant spider that was creepy. I almost wish this movie had been about people who crash on an island full of giant spiders."

"rgkarim","8","7","14","9 March 2017"," The King Has Returned!
","Giant monster movies are always toss up when it comes to quality. They either really impress us, or turn us into monsters as we tear the movie apart. Tonight, the ""King"" of monster returns to the silver screen, in what looks to be a high-definition adventure made for the theater technology. With an all-star cast including Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, and John Goodman this could be the giant monster flick we have been hoping. Robbie K is back with another review, hoping to shed some light on Kong: Skull Island. <br/><br/>LIKES:  Human perspective  Awesome Visuals  Awesome Soundtrack  Action  John C. Reilly<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Most monster movies are often focused on the monster (or man in a rubber costume) wreaking havoc on the environment, only occasionally panning on a human actor. This rendition of Kong shifted that balance back to the humans, putting the tale more from there trek across the killer island. Don't get heated though, because Skull Island has plenty of moments centered on the big ape and all hisnaked glory. Kong isn't the only visual the movie has to offer though, as the team is able to create the nightmare that is skull island in fantastic displays of CGI and real life setting. The environment has a culmination of setting that capture both the beauty and horror that an isolated, prehistoric ecosystem has to offer. The flora, and inanimate stone structures, aren't the only impressive visual though. Skull Island's fauna are also stunning to watch, imaginative creatures that fit well into habitats they call home. Both my friend and I agreed the team did an awesome job crafting monsters that dwell in your darkest dreams, giving them bark, bit, and in some cases slime to truly be deadly. Visuals aside, the soundtrack also has some diversity to it. Our humans theme song seems to be songs from the 70s that will have you classic rock groupies smiling with glee. While those who like powerful symphony work, will enjoy the edge the orchestra brings to the more exciting parts. <br/><br/>Speaking of excitement, Kong: Skull Island brings the action to the full front. Unlike Godzilla (2014), Kong doesn't skimp on the monsters actually doing something other than walk around. Much of the movie involves the humans lighting the creatures up with their guns as they dodge lethal appendages. Yet Kong himself has his moments to shine, in heart pounding, special effects laden sequences that will have you screaming in delight. I myself was impressed with Kong's sweet wrestling moves, including the epic finishes our WWE guys only dream of copying. Sound like too much action? Not to worry, John C Reilly has got you covered with well- timed, well-delivered comedy to lighten the mood. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:  Story is okay  Uneven characters  Rushed Scenes  Cheesy Moments<br/><br/>SUMMARY: The story of King Kong has been told in so many iterations, but most of these renditions give the beast a lot of character outside of wrestling champion. In this telling, the story takes a major dip in favor of the action. As laid out in the trailers, Skull Island's main premise is survival, with a majority of the plot focusing on our human casts journey to get off the land. Oh sure, they try to inject a few other morals into the mix (including vengeance and love) and they do try to give Kong some other qualities in an attempt to develop him. However, many of these extra points shallowly developed, lost to the special effects and battles waiting in the jungle. I missed the deeper nature to Kong's character, but I give props for venturing off the traditional path. <br/><br/>In addition to the simplistic story, Kong's Skull Island also has some editing/developmental issues for me. First off, the uneven characters. Our band of humans is a little skewed, with some getting decent development to others being just another pretty face (that may or may not get devoured). It's the problem when hiring big casts, but this reviewer would have liked a little more backstory to add some emotional turmoil to the mix. The shallow character development paints predictable targets on most of their backs, leading to rushed moments where a character is abruptly, and in some cases pointlessly, eliminated. Sure, it keeps in theme with the island is always hungry, but Skull Island's team needed to go in a clean-up these hasty moments. Ironically, the one thing (outside of the action) they focused on was the anger/hate between Kong and Jackson. Yours truly found the intense stare off and peeing contest between the two to be a touch overdramatic and drawn out. Suspense building? Maybe. Ridiculous? You bet it is. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Both my friend and I agree that Skull Island is one of the better portrayals of the King of the Jungle. With impressive visuals, dangerous environment, and fantastic battles, this is the monster movie we have been waiting for. While there are some story elements that need tweaking and some balance restored, the film gives me faith for future giants vs. human films and the inevitable sequels to come. With all the special effects and action, yours truly recommends this one for the theater, and could see it having some extra oomph in 3-D. And despite what you may expect, one should stick around when the lights go down. You might just find yourself stoked for what is to come. <br/><br/>My Scores: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"

","This movie is very different from the typical creature flick, it introduces many new ideas to the Kong-verse, it adds a lot more new content that contributes towards the Kong back-story. Ultimately, its a fantastic setup for the Kong VS Godzilla that will come out soon. Skull Island was also reintroduced in all its splendor with brilliant visuals, the cinematography is fantastic, great CGI, brilliant character development and the plot is smooth and builds up to an extremely awesome climax. I would definitely suggest watching it."

And the pacing is a little off, which doesn't matter much considering this is an awesome action adventure with amazing visuals. Kong looks and acts great. Oh, I forgot to mention they over did it with the 70s Vietnam/Apocalypse Now soundtrack; remember that sometimes less is more. *add more from video Unfinished review ***"

","Kong:Skull Island is the second movie in a new rebooted Universal monsters universe, the first being Godzilla (2014). I loved Godzilla and I think I loved this one even more.<br/><br/>Everyone says that the movie is bad because most characters are one-dimensional and you don't care about them. That's true. But look, why would you want to know all of the human characters backstories and feelings when you're watching a freaking monster movie? People today are forgetting how to enjoy movies. Not everything should be watched by the same standards. It's kinda like criticizing Moonlight for not being funny and you decided to watch it as a comedy. Think about it, there's really not much difference. Unfortunately, it's starting to look like every movie today is being criticized for not being funny, but whatever. The characters might have been bland, but that doesn't make the movie any less intense. And trust me, it's INTENSE. There are quite a few scenes that will make you anxious especially if you're afraid of bugs or lizards. It's also surprisingly very gory for a PG-13 movie. I was very pleasantly surprised. It's not the PG- 13 ""violence"" that you see in movies all the time lately. This movie is shockingly brutal and one of those that push the PG-13 rating to the limits. And Kong. Wow. Kong has never been this bada$$. Seriously, he's so freaking cool and the design of other monsters is quite good.<br/><br/>All in all, when I put it all together, I suggest that you turn your brain off and let yourself be entertained. If you like movies about giant monsters, you will love this."
"s3276169","8","5","9","25 April 2017"," Decent action flick....
","I came to this film not expecting a great deal. I was then surprised to find a decent action flick with a subtle anti war, pro environment message.....<br/><br/>First off this is above all else, an action flick. The fun starts from the get go and continues at a good pace throughout this film. Unlike previous Kong films, this time its humanity intruding on Kong's patch not Kong being transported back to civilization. Personally, I think this approach works far better. It allows for a world of CGI generated, larger than life creatures, like Kong to be brought to life, creating an outlandish but fun jungle style adventure.<br/><br/>Whats also appealing is the pro environment, anti war message. Without giving too much away, the warmongers in this film really don't fare too well. Mess with nature and pay the price. Something we should all keep in mind. <br/><br/>The acting is for the most excellent helped by well rounded, colourful characterizations, that, whilst not too realistic, fit snugly into the rather fantastical world of Skull Island.<br/><br/>In sort, I really enjoyed Kong Skull Island and I think you will too. Eight out of ten from me."

","The script of the movie is roughly 3 pages long, so I guess it doesn't really deserve a long review either. <br/><br/>First of all: this is for all intents and purposes just a flashy, very long trailer... Neat camera tricks, cheesy lines, explosions, you name it! <br/><br/>Secondly: during the pitch meeting of this ""concept"" (at best) they probably said: we need ""a handsome mysterious type"" (cue: Hiddlestone), ""a busty blonde who doesn't really need to be there"" (cue: Larson), a crazy bearded goofy guy with morals (cue: Reilly) and an angry Samuel L. Jackson to say the word ""mutha****"" every now and again. Then we pile on some other generic, pointless characters, a whole bunch of monsters and put King Kong in the middle. 2 hour run-time? Yeah! Case closed! Lunch!<br/><br/>So, yeah, what YOU need to know, as an audience member, is this: there is no plot, no purpose, no reason, no subtleties, no nuance, no meaning... It's just a big stinking pile of clichés! <br/><br/>They literally could've chosen any random aspiring screenwriter of the street, and just by being awake for the meeting, those guys could've come up with ideas on how to turn this story into a half-decent script, or at least something that resembles a script. <br/><br/>Garbage...

A typical Hollywood action movie, in this one there are 2 monsters and, according to American superficial tradition, one has to be good and the other one bad. There is a shallow soldier who is good in everything, has some conscience and wins a hot chick. Yawn.

","First let me say that my review of Kong: Skull Island is totally biased, since I went to the eponymous Universal Studios ride in Orlando, Fl, the other day, which totally hyped me up for this flick (""KONG, KONG, KONG, KONG..."").<br/><br/>This is not necessarily my type of movie, I usually avoid boom boom blockbuster films, especially the umpteenth remake no one asked for. But after the ride I just HAD to see this.<br/><br/>That being said, Kong still managed to surprise me in a positive way. Here's my breakdown of the things I liked:<br/><br/>-KONG IS KING: Honestly, the Kong scenes were spectacular and he looked awesome. To me, the action scenes didn't look overly CGI'd. I thought they did a great job. I was rooting for Kong the whole time basically. And that's what made the suspense of the movie so great, too. There was also some heartfelt ape-human interaction going on (not too cheesy luckily).<br/><br/>-NEW MONSTERS: This time, Kong has to fight two sides - while Samuel L. Jackson's character has gone bananas and wants to kill Kong at all costs, there are new, strong creatures lurking from below.<br/><br/>-GREAT CAST: If you expect great character development, Kong is not the movie. BUT I thought Tom Hiddleston, John Goodman, Brie Larson and esp. one of my favorite actors, John C. Reilly did a great job in keeping it interesting and fun.<br/><br/>If you're up for a fun movie, I'd say go watch this in your cinema with 3D glasses on. This is a movie that works on the big screen, so you can enjoy all the effects."

","After the disappointing Godzilla of 2014, I was really hoping that this movie would set this little Monster verse back on track.<br/><br/>This movie Took everything that defines a great monster movie and did the complete opposite, it was more of a CGI vomited action flick, at no point was the movie thrilling or even scary like you should expect from a monster movie. It brought together a very impressive cast and did NOTHING with them, the only ounce of character development came from John C. Reilly's character, even know he did didn't really fit into the film. It had one of the most disgraceful screenplays I've ever seen, and that's not an over exaggeration I have seen fast and the furious movies with better writing then that, it had a great soundtrack but unfortunately fell under the same trap that most movies do and used the songs only to advance the movie forward.<br/><br/>And finally the King. Peter Jackson's 2005 reboot was one of my favorite movies growing up, and I did not think it was possible for me to ever hate king kong, unfortunately this movie did such a bad job with not only displaying Kong but with keeping him a lovable yet terrifying monster.<br/><br/>So anyone planning to see this movie, you've been warned, also for everyone who is giving this movie a good review you need to watch some proper movies."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","7","6","12","9 March 2017"," Pacific Rim meets Jurassic Park with monstrous adrenaline.
","This will probably become my biggest guilty pleasure of 2017. Although I do believe Peter Jackson's King Kong is one of the few great remakes that have been made, a part of me always wished they would just skip the first hour on the boat and spend the rest of the movie exploring Kong's world called Skull Island. Rising director Jordan Vogt-Roberts definitely delivers on that. He presents an ecosystem of giant creatures that stands apart visually from other monster movies like Jurassic Park. And it shows Kong less as a misunderstood monster but more as protective figure in this new mythology.<br/><br/>When the director described this new King Kong as a god he really wasn't under-selling it. Kong has never been more intimidated and powerful then ever. He is re-imagined to be more then just an animal and monster but as this powerful force of nature that is both ferocious and benevolent. He felt like a combination of the Marvel's Hulk and Planet of the Apes's Caesar. By removing the beauty and the beast story, Kong is explored more as a character with almost sentient qualities and we see what his existence is like on the island. His best moments range from him taking out helicopters with his fists during his big reveal to when he is just sitting around and killing time with stunning visual effects that rival what was done in the 2005 remake. And the island itself is presented as a character with always having unique ways to reveal the other creatures that hide within Kong's kingdom in suspenseful and surprising ways. The creatures are both beautiful and scary as they feel like they're one with the landscapes. I could watch a whole nature documentary on this fictional world. The most terrifying out of all of them are the Skullcrawlers. If Kong is a god then the Skullcrawlers are the island's demons. They felt like a combination of the creatures from Jurassic Park, Aliens and Bong Joon Ho's The Host. They really made up this great threat to both the humans and the island in new and surprising ways.<br/><br/>Jordan Vogt-Roberts uses a fresh way to show the action and visuals in this big-budget movie. While Gareth Edwards's visual style in Godzilla felt similar to Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan, Vogt-Roberts is closer to that of Zack Snyder, Edgar Wright and Guillermo Del Torro. The action and editing is very energetic and quick with warm vibrant, colour tones. When he shoots action you feel like you are suddenly thrown into the middle of it with amazing slow-motion shots to help you process the destruction and detail you are seeing. This movie has some of the most gorgeous cinematography I have seen in a monster film thanks to DP Larry Fong. The beautiful and exotic real-like locations give Skull Island an extra sense of depth and believability. The Vietnam locations like a Ninh Binh and Hao Long Bay make me believe they could actually hide 100-foot creatures. The monster fights are very brutal and feel very much like a Ray Harryhausen movie where there are long shots that stay on the titanic creatures brawling with each other. The final battle is unique enough to stand apart from the dinosaur fight in 2005 as it shows Kong's intelligence being used in battle in order to challenge the Skullcrawler's agile and nimble movements. The end of that fight makes breaking a T.Rex's jaw look tame by comparison.<br/><br/>What unfortunately holds this movie back from being great is the human narrative. I wouldn't say it's terrible but there is nothing special either. The list of big-name actors injects some personality into it but what you get with most of the characters is just what's on the surface and nothing more. Tom Hiddleston is similar to Aaron-Taylor Johnson in Godzilla where he was just there as a plot device to get from point A to B. Sam Jackson's military leader is uniquely written and has justifiable reasons for wanting to kill Kong but still feels like other roles he has played before. Corey Hawkins and Jing Tian only really exist to setup universe building. Out of all the human characters John C. Reily was the only one I was truly invested in and felt like he matched the movie's stylized surreal tone. Got a kooky Tom Hanks Cast Away vibe from him. His crazy personality and backstory is what kept me going through the scenes without any monsters. His scenes of exposition could have been handled poorly but work when he is delivering them with some well-time jokes. Brie Larson's role in this is not going to measure up to her Oscar-winning Room performance but at least she isn't portrayed as a useless damsel like in most monster movies. I did also enjoy the dynamic between Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham surprisingly. In Godzilla, the movie felt subtle about giant monsters rising from the earth being served as a metaphor for our over-reliance on nuclear power and lack of control on nature. Skull Island's thematic messaging about military power invading native lands like Vietnam felt more forced and didn't leave as much of an impact on.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that Peter Jackson's remake has a stronger emotional story with more depth but Vogt-Roberts delivers a King Kong movie that is simple, and more unique. Similar to Pacific Rim, the humans serve more as a way for us to explore this world of giant monsters then be emotional centre piece. The movie knows when to inject fun, humour and energy when it needs to and doesn't become too reliant on these characters that can't carry the movie without having a giant monster on screen. I definitely look forward to seeing this new Kong take on Godzilla in 2019. Also I got child-like excitement when I saw the after-credits scene for Godzilla: King of the Monsters."

","Kong: Skull Island We as a class went to watch the movie Kong. and my expectations were blown out of the water with the movie. Everything up to the acting, graphic design, and the whole story line was just on point. In the movie the way they shot some scenes gave the movie a old school monster movie feel to the film.<br/><br/>The movie had amazing acting but the character that stood out the most to me was Preston Packard, which was played by Samuel Jackson. The reason he stood out to me was how dedicated he was to his mission; he didn't want to reason with anybody because of the fact that Kong had killed many of his men.<br/><br/>The story line was amazing and very well put together, in the movie they showed many ""easter eggs"" relating to other monsters in other movies. This made it so that they can tie future movies together. The graphic design was very complex, showing many fights that were visually stunning.<br/><br/>Monster movie connoisseurs, younger generations, sci-fi connoisseurs. and anyone that's really into thrillers. personally i would recommend this movie to anyone.

","""Kong: Skull Island"" delivers on what a B-movie monster flick with an A-movie budget should be: a well paced, action-packed, visually competent, comedic, and an all around fun time. What helps set it apart from forgettable/mediocre monster flicks like 2014's ""Godzilla"" is its large and highly entertaining cast of talented A-listers that include Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, the reuniting of ""Straight Outta Compton's"" Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell, and the box office King himself, Kong.<br/><br/>The standout is John C. Reilly whose introduction breathes new energy into the movie just as things were about to turn dull. His character provides plenty of comic relief, interesting exposition, and a surprise emotional moment. Samuel L. Jackson almost steals the show as a vengeful, trigger-happy and profane army officer who has the only logically-sound motives. Also John Goodman and Corey Hawkins play scientists out to prove the existence of Kong and monsters. Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston have an interesting scene together in the beginning of the film but after that are kinda wasted with no real development. I had trouble remembering their names by the time the end credits rolled, but their charisma and sublime hair were enough to compensate. Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham provided some nice banter that helped put a face on the faceless soldiers. Then there is the real star: Kong! The monster battles were visually delightful as well as inventively awesome -- like when Kong uses a propeller as a morning star. Shout out to the writers for not wasting everyone's time with a rehashed romance between Kong and the blonde damsel in distress. We had enough of that in Peter Jackson's interpretation.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is an entertaining ride from start to finish that will thrill/entertain/amuse those willing to turn their brains off."

","This movie was excellently shot, well acted, brilliantly directed, and surprisingly well executed. I walked into it thinking, ""Seriously?!"" I mean, come on, it's King Kong, the sequel. How good can it be? Well apparently, actually pretty f'ing enjoyable. I am not giving it high marks because it was an Oscar Winner by any stretch, except maybe on the graphics, but I mean, that can be said for most movies these days. No, I am giving it props because I actually enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. It grabs you from the beginning and keeps hold through out. No joke, incredibly shot. Incredible respect for the director, who has apparently not done anything to this scale before far as I can tell. And Tom Hiddleston, if you haven't seen Night Manager, it will change your mind about him as an actor. Yeah, I mean he's got Loki going on, but this and that short Hulu/BBC/AMC collabo truly shows his range beyond the megalomaniac Asgardian. Really, this movie reminds me of Pacific Rim: another movie I went in with NO expectations except monster film, so no dialogue, less plot, worse acting, and somehow less direction, and like that one, I was thoroughly delighted. Maybe low expectations are best in films like this, but that's OK. I am tired of the super hyped CGI fest that promises everything and delivers nothing. Sometimes, a pleasant surprise is just what the doctor ordered, and while some of plot may be predictable, that still does not take away from you caring about the characters and hoping that they manage to survive what should be a no-win scenario, and getting your kicks from a few well placed jump scares, tremendous photography, and, I feel, poignant commentary on the human condition. If you're not into monster films though, this may not be for you. But if you have an inkling for giant impossible beings kicking the crap out of each other and puny humans caught in the middle, you just may want to give this a chance...."

In this day and age of computer animation movie trends, the effects are but standard and sometimes cartoon-like. John Goodman's character is basically not a necessity, besides being the guy who spearheaded the adventure to the Skull Island. Other than the movie is a computer animation upgrade of ""King Kong vs Godzilla"", the overall of the movie is a ""so-so"", basically a popcorn movie.

I don't know what it was but I really really liked her in this movie. Tom Hiddleston was great as well, acting as the lead ""badass"" in the movie. John Goodman, Corey Hawkins were decent as well. I am not blind to the flaws of this movie though. Samuel L. was a character I did not enjoy at all as the film progressed. His character made a lot of stupid decisions that you could not ignore (attacking kong multiple times, not giving up on trying to kill kong, using all the choppers to try to destroy kong). There also wasn't a lot of character development in the movie aside from John C. Reilly's character. Even with these flaws I still fell in love with the film and I'm not sure why. Maybe it was the lovely Brie Larson, or the badass Tom Hiddleston, the really likable John Reilly or just the visual effects of the film. But I definitely give it a 10/10."

","Here's a tip for keeping me at least interested for a B-grade monster movie. When you take off with 4 huey choppers from the deck of your science ship, please don't almost immediately breed them into 8 choppers. I was looking at the deck, going hmmmmm, small load, they're going to need more against kong... but oh, never mind, they just randomly spawned MORE choppers after take off. Oh good....<br/><br/>All eight, plus the other two heavy lift ones, all proceed to get as close as possible to kong's flailing arms, so they can all get crashed. Now, the heavy lift chopper is literally STUFFED with bombs and napalm... yet does not explode when it crashes.<br/><br/>The choppers go in to skull island with speakers blaring. Like the rip off of Apocalypse Now could not be any more blatant. Instead of Ride of the Valkryes though, they play Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid', the ONE highlight of this movie.<br/><br/>Kong is NOT a giant gorilla, like the excellent Jack Black version of King Kong, the best ever done and never to be topped. No, this guy looks more like a squat short legged sasquatch.<br/><br/>This Island should have been called 'The Island of Misfit Monsters', because that's what it was. A gigantic spider with legs designed to look like bamboo??? WHY??? A humongous water buffalo with horns designed to get him stuck in swamps? Tiny bat pterosaurs that can somehow lift a human being and then tear them to pieces in the air? Giant lizards that are missing their back legs?? A random giant squid just hangin' out in a small lake, even though King Kong is clearly only up to his knees in water, and the water is Way to shallow there for a humongous kraken squid, wth, through er in.<br/><br/>Then we have John Reilly. As in well known comedian. From such low brow hilarity as step brothers. And he's in fine form, cracking John Reilly step brother jokes ('I may stab you tonight... just kidding...') His character is completely out of place and completely unbelievable. The skipper from Gilligan's Island would have worked better.<br/><br/>This is a Vietnam war flick with stupid monsters and King Kong. And that's all it is. The soldiers, after tramping over mountains and through swamps all day, magically produce a flame thrower and a .50 cal machine gun in one battle. Anyone tell the director how heavy those things are and why didn't we see them before? At 2 hours this movie CRAWLS, and it feels like 4. The predictable final show down at the end with Kong facing the BIG legless stupid lizard, is boring and cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>Samuel Jackson is also cringe-worthy. A 2D cardboard cut-out character with zero depth, very much played as a Captain Ahab.<br/><br/>I can't recommend you dodge this in the theatres enough. And there was Zero 3D in it."

","""Kong: Skull Island"" doesn't have the charm and sense of fun of Peter Jackson's version, but it's still a first-rate monster movie that I highly recommend. It's got a good script, likable characters and terrific special effects.<br/><br/>Parts of it were actually scary. The first action set-piece is unexpectedly brutal, and there's a sequence with a giant spider that was a little unnerving, too. I was surprised at how the filmmakers here so heavily emphasized the story's action-horror elements.<br/><br/>I had a blast with this, and I'd give it a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>I have a question -- did anyone else notice a reference to ""Jurassic Park"" (1993)? At one point, Samuel Jackson's character tells his companions to ""Hang on to your butts."" Isn't that his character's line in ""Jurassic Park"" when he restores power to the facility, shortly before he gets killed?"

Pong...Kong; the transition is obvious. True enough, some of the lyrics in Frank Black's excellent song don't lend themselves terribly well to the subject at hand, but what do I care. I liked Kong: Skull Island, it was a reasonably satisfying old fashioned monster movie, with a heavy dose of Apocalypse Now and a tiny smidgeon of Predator thrown in for good measure (Mr Jackson didn't say ""if it bleeds, we can kill it"", but he might as well have). However, it serves less well as a 'sequel' to the 2005 film by Peter Jackson. Firstly, In Kong: Skull Island, which is set approximately 50 years after King Kong, the locals seem to have transformed from menacing, woman-kidnapping, human sacrifice-making people into some kind of enlightened Buddist-lite haven of niceness. Secondly, where are the dinosaurs? They were everywhere the first time round, now just 50 years later (they had clearly survived millions upon millions of years there, let's not forget) they've all mysteriously disappeared! Thirdly, in King Kong, Kong appeared to be on his own (we reason this is why he falls for the charms of Naomi Watts?), but in Kong: Skull Island, we find out Kong had a family but they were all killed by the 'skullcrawlers'....er, hold the phone there for a second. Skullcrawlers? Where the hell did they spring from all of a sudden? Is this Skull Island in a parallel dimension or something? It's the same island, but all the inhabitants seem to have fundamentally changed apart from Kong himself! Except even he has changed - it can't be the same Kong we encountered in King Kong, because of course he was killed in New York. We might accept there was a young kong relative (perhaps a son) who was left behind and grew up to replace him, but how is it that an apparently sole ape produced offspring and continued to rule the roost when the aforementioned dinosaurs (of which there were plenty) all failed to keep breeding? Maybe Plato was onto something after all...did I say Plato? I meant Aristotle. Who's this Plato guy anyway? Just as well it wasn't billed as a sequel, then. I have just one other beef with Kong: Skull Island - character development (or, rather, lack thereof). The poor chaplain seemed to exist only to a) get eaten by a skullcrawler, and b) provide a character for the actor doing Kong's motion-capture performance, a la Andy Sirkis in King Kong; Sirkis' sideshow was much the better- written character, I might add. Most of the survivors barely merited their survivor status, which was a pity - perhaps the monsters didn't like the taste of cardboard. John C Riley's character, Hank Marlow (a WWII US pilot who survived crash-landing on the island), is the primary exception. In fact, he is the beating heart of the film, and his promised survival and reconciliation with civilisation, and his family, are what keep us engaged and rooting for them to escape from Skull Island."

Every journey and action scene could have still been scripted by having the characters face issues such as problems navigating the island, injury to members of the party, other challenges that made it difficult for the two separate groups to reconnect.<br/><br/>Some thoughtful ingenuity when writing the scripts in these movies can make a huge difference. But they always revert to humanizing the cast by good, evil, indifferent, and build their whole story-lines around that concept.<br/><br/>What a shame.

","Yet another ""useful"" reboot, also promoted as origin story... because movie buffs haven't surely seen enough of those, yeah? <br/><br/>It doesn't even make much sense to create an origin story for Kong because his movies have always explained the origins... but they did it anyway. For the bigger purpose to add the king ape into the newest Godzilla reboot. <br/><br/>You do remember 2014's mediocre ""Godzilla"", starring Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe et al? You don't? Hopefully you will still like to see the sequel Godzilla: King of Monsters"" coming in 2019 March, where G and Kong will meet finally (again). <br/><br/>Anyway, about the experience at hand. Skull Island"" reaches wide cinema release this weekend. It's probably partially an experiment, to see how early in the year the masses are ready to shell out their hard-earned for run-of-the-mill epics usually more suitable for summer season.<br/><br/>The movie cost 190 million dollars and I am glad to report that the producers have put this for good use. <br/><br/>Everything looks amazing and for a big dumb adventure like this, there's unusually big and varied line of actresses/ actors. Casting team has done a fine job indeed. <br/><br/>We have: <br/><br/>* some always super-solid supporting star players (John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson), <br/><br/>* an acclaimed indie actress offering some feminine beauty (Brie Larson), <br/><br/>* also always-reliable surprise player who can do both drama and comedy (John C. Reilly), <br/><br/>* and a bunch of good likable actors that you are sure you know from somewhere, even if you can't recall the names (such as Tom Hiddleston – Loki from Thor"", Corey Hawkins, John Ortiz, Toby Kebbell – doubling as a motion capture actor for Kong, Shea Whigham et al).<br/><br/>The only odd choice is to criminally underuse China's rising star actress Tian Jing. She's here but can't do much. She's not used to add beauty, she's not gonna offer some kick-ass action scenes as in The Great Wall"" alongside Matt Damon. Why cast her at all if you have no need for her?<br/><br/>What's surprising is that actors are not here just to hold our attention between grand action setpieces. Their performances have heart and persuasiveness which is something of an achievement, considering that much of their acting time was probably spent in front of the empty green canvas. <br/><br/>John C. Reilly is the main man here actually, he has the meatiest character and also the side-mission to act as a comic relief without turning into a joke. <br/><br/>As usual, I love him and what he does with the material. Just the perfect balance between obscure, funny and crazy.<br/><br/>The monsters look awesome as well and meeting them is worth your time and ticket money. I watched Kong: Skull Island"" in IMAX and 3D, and both have actually been put to good use here. But I am sure everything looks good in standard"" 2D as well. <br/><br/>""Skull Island"" sure is a looker, not only monsters and fighting but the locations as well which make everything look truly epic. Filmed in Hawaii, Vietnam and Australia by the way.<br/><br/>The only reason I am not willing to give the result a higher score is the screenplay. It's just a bunch of old tired clichés and, to add insult to the injury, the story has been left to sit uncomfortably between two different chairs in at least two important aspects. <br/><br/>Firstly, the story's is too clichéd and unoriginal to really grab any adult viewer BUT there's too much violence to gladly recommend it as a family thing. Secondly, the plot moves constantly between being very serious and just light-hearted which makes it uneven and sometimes hard to take.<br/><br/>In my mind, they should have modernized soldier characters, right now it feels like anachronism – something from old Kong movies. <br/><br/>The army marches in and just tries to destroy everything which feels pretty disgusting in the enlightened"" times of 21st century. If it wasn't all so serious, at least it could be taken as social commentary or black comedy or something. <br/><br/>Even Jurassic's and Godzilla's latest outings have fresh-er approach to monster movies which involves more than senseless killing.<br/><br/>So you will get an odd combo where mindless destruction alternates with light-hearted adventure. Is it really proper approach for PG-13 family movie? Am I too sensitive here?"

"ironhorse_iv","7","4","7","17 March 2017"," This Viet-Kong Monster Movie is not quite king, but it was entertaining. It could be, a little bit better.
","Sadly, this movie is not as iconic as the first movie. When first released in 1933, 'King Kong' broke all previous box-office records, becoming one of the very first blockbuster in film history. It was a phenomenal, influential landmark film that raised the bar for special effects for many decades. It was so good, that the film was remade, multiply times; most famous in 1976 and 2005, in lesser favor. In 2017, Merian C. Cooper's work was reboot, yet again, this time, very loosely with 'Kong: Skull Island'. While, both movies have the basic plot of a group of explorers going to a remote and exotic location, only to find out that, the island is home to many gigantic beasts, in which they must escape from. The movie directed by Jordan Vogt Roberts goes with a different vibe than the traditional plot of Hollywood filmmakers trying to film a movie. Instead, this film set in 1973, has a group of helicopter squadron pilots and group of scientists going to the island for a survey mission, only to find hell on world. In many ways, Skull Island serves as social commentary about the morals of the Vietnam War, with the American soldiers not quite understanding, who or what they're fighting for or with. Like the war in Vietnam, it's a world of hurt; with dragons like creatures acting like Communist 'Tunnel Rats', and King Kong as giant gorilla moral burden on their backs. Because of this, I felt that this movie is trying to be smarter than it looks, but it's trying too hard to appease to the general audiences with it's over the top, somewhat cartoony action that it lost some viewers, looking for something more sophistical in their B-Movie experience. Nevertheless, the movie still has many subtle sequences of this film, that still kinda work, but it just didn't click for me with, the sillier parts of the movie. Although, some comedy scenes are patch, awkwardly to horror & action. I do have to say, the movie does flow in an enjoyable paced. However, I just wish, the movie had a little more suspense with how they dealt with Kong, as I felt that they were delivering all their cards, way too early. Unlike director Gareth Edwards' 2014's film, 'Godzilla', Vogt-Roberts wastes little time introducing Kong. Much like the last remake, Kong was portrayed via motion capture, specifically by Terry Notary, whom previously did motion cap work on many various movies, including the Planet of the Apes rebooted films, with some assistance from Toby Kebbell whom is also part of the human cast as the character, Jack Chapman. However, Kong was missing a lot of elements that make Kong into a sympathetic tragic character. While, I'm glad, they didn't add the weird awkward love affair, Kong has for human females; I think the movie should had explain more, why a giant gorilla is protecting the tribe from the skull crawlers in the first place. As much, as I hate the originals for its savage portrayal of the island people; at least, those primitive versions have the tribe, do something for Kong; here not so much. Why is Kong allowing these freeloaders to live!? Also, how does an island have a self-containing storm, surrounding it, years long, yet the island hasn't caved in, due to having a hollow earth!? It doesn't add up. Film would, had work, better, without all of the BS science, mucho jumbo. Despite that, the movie was still beautiful shot and the CGI was great. Many of the sequences remind me of 1979's film 'Apocalypse Now"", ranging from a psychedelic, napalm-scented, Helicopter carpet bombing to the 'Heart of Darkness' boat ride from hell. It's clear that the three screenwriters for this film, Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein & Derek Connolly were indeed fans of author Joseph Conrad & director Francis Ford Coppola's works. However, some parts of it, did go a little overboard with the writing, like how they portrayal Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson). I get that, he's sees the fight with Kong as a way to justified his service for his country, due to the failure of the Vietnam War, but by 2017, the ""Crazy Vietnam Veteran"", who was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder is way too much of a common stock character. It felt like Samuel L. Jackson playing as insane Samuel L. Jackson. Still, I had to give him, some credit, he stood out, more than the other characters in the film, like James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) & Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) whom I found forgettable. They weren't even acting right. There was no sense of fear, between these two actors. They encounter several dangerous exotic giant creatures, and they act like they were only minoring annoyed. It was crappy. The rest of the soldiers were a little more developed, but there was a little too many to remember, plus, they were quickly getting eliminated like a bunch of red suits. The only other character that kinda stood out, besides Colonel Packard, was John C. Reilly's character, Hank Marlow, an eccentric but wise and virtuous WWII pilot who spent 28 years stranded on Skull Island. He gave the movie, some of its greatest moments, besides the sound editing and the blood-pumping 1970s rock soundtrack. Even though the movie has no shortage of scary or violent moments, that borderline what PG-13 can show; I was a bit disappointed that there was no scenes in New York City in the second half. It was a bit strange. However, I did like the hints on the future movies, at the end of the post-credits. I can't wait for other Monsterverse, (Kaiju-based Shared Universe) to come out. Overall: Although, it was cheesy, clichés and absolutely terrible at parts. Warner Bros.' newest attempt at bringing back the King was alright. Worth seeing it in IMAX and 3D."

","Kong: Skull Island is as much a competently made thrill ride as it is a wild, haphazardly assembled Frankenstein's monster. It scares, it excites, it occasionally cajoles a laugh or two; it also frustrates and bewilders. Through it all it stays true to the original 1976 version, or at least true-ish enough to its surface level spirit. Wait, you're telling me there was a 1933 version that wasn't as unabashedly splashy? Say it ain't so! Set in 1973, Kong tells the desperate story of a group of scientists, soldiers and inter-governmental flunkies trying to survive a few days on the film's titular island. Initially lined-up as a geology expedition, Lieutenant, Preston Packard (Jackson), Tracker, James Conrad (Hiddleston) and Photographer, Mason Weaver (Larson) lead a pack of expendables through thick vegetation loaded with freakish monsters, defiant locals and John C. Reilly. They of course have plenty of run-ins with the island's solitary king, painting a picture of the giant ape as both a gentle giant and a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Here's the thing about seeing something like this on the big screen...again: We already know there's only so much you can do with a creature like Kong. Taken to the absolute basics, we know the structure of the film is going to be a row of dwindling meat sacks being picked off one-by-one while Kong stops the show to kick some butt and then retreat into the forest to lick his wounds. Admittedly, Skull Island does a better job than most, dressing up what amounts to a final destination gambling pool. But considering the piddly character arcs doled out in this film, we never get as invested in them as we should.<br/><br/>The slow-burning, Peter Jackson King Kong (2005) compensated by turning Kong into an actual living, breathing character. The stop-motion work of Andy Serkis combined with Naomi Watts' Watt-ness, gave the giant ape a child-like innocence that audiences at the time found endearing. This version on the other hand turns Kong into a gritty, unforgiving force of nature motivated by ferocious anger and primordial fear. Thus what we have is a movie that intuitively lacks investment, shoots itself in the foot when it comes to the monster, and leans a bit too heavily on its Vietnam War allegory to carry the day.<br/><br/>So Skull Island basically amounts to being a pit stop on yet another tent pole extended universe. It's awash in intricate world-building detail and inner-movie lore that will no doubt be erased or re-framed as the new installment comes clomping in. Whether you like it or not, you basically running a marathon now."

","Does this movie have problems? Yes, it does. But for me, those problems didn't really take away from my enjoyment of the film. Maybe this movie will fall apart more upon a second viewing, but I had a lot of fun seeing this in IMAX 3D. I recommend definitely checking it out in that format. I went in wanting to see some awesome monster fights, good set-up for 2020's Godzilla vs. King Kong, some great visual effects, and just a fun time at the movies. And I got all of that. For people concerned about Kong in this movie... don't be. I was upset with how much screen time Godzilla got in his own movie, but Kong gets the right amount of time here. He's on just enough to satisfy fans, but is off screen enough to let other elements of the film shine. When Kong fights in this movie, it is absolutely incredible. I don't think there's anything in here that is as iconic as Kong versus the T-Rexes in King Kong, but the fights with the Skull Crawlers and the other creatures were amazing to watch. It was so fun and exhilarating. The visuals in this movie are also stunning. Sometimes, in a movie like this, they can be hit or miss, but they were brilliant here..."

The opening build up was strong and so were the scenes when the characters arrive on Skull Island but you don't get much of an idea about the key characters - that is not the fault of the actors, but rather because the script does't bother to explain much about their motivations. All you get is surface. The film lost energy as the story developed and because of that it felt too long."

","After the complaints of Godzilla's presence being far too scarce in his own movie, you'd think Warner Bros and Legendary Entertainment would have resolved that by making King Kong the center of his own movie, right? Well, that's not entirely the case in Kong: Skull Island.<br/><br/>Originally titled Skull Island, this film feels much more like an exploration into the island itself than it does a King Kong film. With a run-time of 118 minutes, Kong maybe makes up about 25 minutes of that. To be fair, after several repetitive King Kong films, the franchise could use a refreshing take. But if you're going to make a King Kong film, you expect to see the giant ape more than some random humans. So, that's the first major issue.<br/><br/>The second, and perhaps far more important, is that the script is downright awful. Even worse, the tone is all over the place. I expected that this film was going to take itself as seriously as the 2014 Godzilla film did, especially after several trailers that were clearly trying to emulate Apocalypse Now. What we got is more along the lines of the humor from a Fast & Furious movie that tries to veer into the seriousness of a DCEU film. Except, the humor never hits. My theater was packed, and not a single joke granted a crowd- wide laugh.<br/><br/>However, the film is beautifully shot by Larry Fong and the action is impossible to take your eyes away from. Kong has never looked better, and the final fight between him and other creatures is about as impressive of an action sequence as you'll see all year. But Is it really a shock that every second Kong is on-screen is great and every time they cut to a human that you don't care about, the film dull and boring? When you have the likes of Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman, Jason Mitchell, and Toby Kebbell there should be at least one character worth rooting for, right? <br/><br/>Well, as it turns out, John C. Reilly's 'Hank Marlow' is the only redeemable character worth mentioning. Hiddleston is useless, Jackson is way too over-the-top, Kebbell & Mitchell are annoying, and Larson is merely passable. I like all of these actors, but they got stuck with sloppily written characters that are far from fleshed out. Perhaps cutting out 5 or 6 of the leads and giving that screen time to either Kong, or to add depth to the more significant roles.<br/><br/>I'm still invested in this ""monster-verse"" because I, like everyone else in the world, can't wait to see Kong & Godzilla duke it out for the ""King"" title in a few years. But pushing aside the main attraction for some good looking actors isn't what I want from a monster film. The thrills are a little too few and far in between. So for me, Kong: Skull Island is a big letdown.<br/><br/>+Gorgeous to look at<br/><br/>+Kong impresses<br/><br/>-When he's on screen<br/><br/>-Waste of an extremely talented cast<br/><br/>-Awful script<br/><br/>5.7/10"

","Kong is basically a reboot of King Kong but with two main differences:<br/><br/>All the action takes place in Skull Island (where Kong was originally found). <br/><br/>Kong is less humanized than the original. Here he is a big monkey that protects its zone. Still his character is better defined than the rest; which makes sense since he is the real protagonist.<br/><br/>However; as interesting as it looks an island full of monsters, there is not much you can do after a while without being repetitive; so you need to include human conflicts in between (thus the A list cast ) and there is when the movie fails. <br/><br/>Characters are mostly unlikable and all of them under developed characters. <br/><br/>The charismatics Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson have to deal with character that barely written. They are both quite capable so their chemistry works (but not thanks to the script). John C. Reilly, comedy skills and sympathy are wasted with very little opportunity to do anything interesting. <br/><br/>What John Goodman and Toby Kebbell are doing in this movie is almost a mystery. Their characters die pretty quick and nobody really cares. Kebbell also plays Kong; he is not bad but a far cry from Andy Serkis in Peter Jackson version (again it is probably not his fault since here Kong is a beast most of the time). <br/><br/>Samuel Jackson has done nutcase and bad guys before; he is efficient here but has done better in other movies.<br/><br/>Shea Whigham, Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins are the only characters that have a few (seconds of) good moments and interest; sadly the movie did not use them a little more.<br/><br/>In terms of FX and digital images; the quality is superb and some action scenes are really outstanding; but it barely cover half of the movie time (or less).<br/><br/>Making the Kong less human is an artistic decision. The original was, like Beauty and the Beast, a love history here is hinted but no more.<br/><br/>In brief; the movie is entertaining and fills out almost two hours of your time without making your brain work at all. But if you are looking for spectacular images and monsters; see The Great Wall. Is a little less brainless and the images are a work of art. <br/><br/>If you only want to see Kong; see this one but later get the Peter Jackson version and you will see the difference between a work of love and just a Disney mass marketed product."

","Kong: Skull Island (2017)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>A monster hunter (John Goodman) leads an expedition onto Skull Island where they come across various monsters including the mightiest of them all: King Kong.<br/><br/>KONG: SKULL ISLAND is an attempt to get the giant monster back onto the big screen and it was obviously trying to get everything set up for future films. Look, nothing will ever beat the original KING KONG, although I did enjoy the first remake and even films like KING KONG VS. GODZILLA. With that said, I found the Peter Jackson film to be downright terrible and when I walked into this movie I was just hoping for something better than it. Thankfully, KONG: SKULL ISLAND is much better than that as long as you turn your brain off at the door.<br/><br/>I thought for the most part the film worked quite well. For starters, the filmmakers appeared to realize that what movie fans want are giant monsters who battle one another. You don't have to wait too long for the first glimpse of Kong and this here is a major plus. Once we reach the island is when all of the fun starts and it really goes for the throat as there's a very fun adventure on the island. I'm obviously not going to spoil everything that happens but the entire running time takes place on the island and this leads to some very fun monster battles.<br/><br/>There's no question that the best thing about this picture are the monsters including Kong. Yes, the King Kong is CGI but he looks terrific and very realistic. I thought the entire creation was an extremely good one and the film perfectly allows you to believe that what you're seeing is real. The other monsters also look terrific and I thought the filmmakers really nailed the look of the monsters. The battle scenes are certainly a lot of fun and especially the final one where Kong must go up against something much bigger than him.<br/><br/>As far as the cast goes, no one is spectacular but they're at least fun. Tom Hiddleston is a pretty laid back lead but he does fine. John C. Reilly and Samuel L. Jackson are both good, although they're both pretty much playing the type of character we've seen them do countless times before. Goodman is fun when he's on the screen. The only real dud is Brie Larson as the photographer. She's good in the film but I must say it's a pretty bland and boring part and especially coming after winning an Oscar for ROOM.<br/><br/>Technically speaking the film is quite impressive and we've got a rousing score to go with everything. The plot is certainly very simple but I'm actually glad. I mean, I've never believed these types of movies need to clock in at two and a half hours. This one is just under two-hours and that's the perfect time for this type of action movie."
"CJFouraki","4","7","15","9 March 2017"," The movie exists....and that's about it.
","If you want a popcorn flick, then yeah, this is alright. Have fun. I wanted a King Kong movie however and this is where it failed. <br/><br/>The King Kong films are what make up a big part of my childhood. I watched the hell out of them and loved them - being the 1933, 1976 and 2005 versions. When I heard they were making this, I asked ""why so soon?"" and ""what will they ruin?"".<br/><br/>Firstly, here's how I see the other major Kong films. I love the original, it's one of my favorite films. I have a soft spot for the '76 one even though it wasn't as good and I love Peter Jackson's '05 version, which was almost as good as the original and also one of my favorite films. Each film served a masterclass in the visual effects for its time period, being (in order), stop motion, animatronics and CGI.<br/><br/>Now we get to Kong: Skull Island, a movie that really doesn't offer anything new or anything great. It kinda happens and then has a fart of an ending.<br/><br/>Acting - Everyone was good in their roles. Nobody stood out. John C. Reilly was good. S.L.Jackson was good. Tom Hiddleston was good. Brie Larson was good. John Goodman showed up. Nothing fantastic or deserving of applause. They were just people on a screen.<br/><br/>Story - It's a reboot of the franchise, set in the 70s. It's still pretty much the same story of survival and stuff, but nothing to do with romance or capturing Kong. It was bland and is really just there so the popcorn action can happen.<br/><br/>Writing - Nothing special. There were some good lines for S.L.Jackson and John C. Reilly. Everybody else had maybe one okay line but the rest was exposition or nothing interesting. The pace felt off. There were slow moments where nothing was happening (including a lot of missed opportunities to develop some of the other characters) and then it kicked straight into action and then action again and then slow and then 5 seconds of action and then slow. It wasn't a quick 2 hour film. It just felt like it's exact 2 hour run-time. And the ending just happened. I was honestly shocked at how quickly they ended the movie. It was garbage because they couldn't end it well like the other Kong films because they have to leave it open for what will be the abominations known as the Kong vs Godzilla film.<br/><br/>Action/Effects - Yeah, it was pretty good, nothing we haven't seen before in the other recent garbage/average monster movies like Godzilla and Pacific Rim respectively. But just like the story, the action kinda just happens. Most of the characters are barely developed so there's really no tension when people are about to die, especially when you can pin-point who'll make it through to the final action sequences based on screen-time. There's some cool moments where Kong gets to be awesome and become a force of reckoning. The bad monsters are kinda lackluster though except for the final one that actually puts up a fight. There's no choppy editing (and there shouldn't be anyway if nearly everything is CGI) so everything is easy to watch and the action sequences don't get entirely frustrating to follow.<br/><br/>Cinematography - There's a lot of cool shots that really show how massive and intimidating Kong is, especially when shown full size next to humans. There's some good shots utilizing silhouettes. Whenever you see the sun though, it's color and position is that of the sun setting but always seems to return to the middle of the day when it cuts back to the characters which I found distracting/weird.<br/><br/>Music/Sound - It's the early 70's, so when they play songs from the 60's and 70's, it's awesome although they are often drowned out way too quickly to be appreciated. As for the original soundtrack, it's whatever. Barely noticeable. Doesn't even have to be there. Action sequences sound punchy however, which is good, and it all blends together to become this chaotic cacophony of violent sounds.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island was disappointing for me as a massive King Kong fan. It's an average movie at best and not much better as just a blockbuster action film. Out of this and Godzilla (2014), I'd easily say this was better than that pile of turd because even though it's characters/story weren't great, they had a lot of scenes of Kong kicking ass and that was pretty cool. Jokes, like in a Marvel film, were plentiful, and just like in a Marvel film, some were a hit, most were a miss.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're going to watch this film, might as well be on the big screen where it belongs. Otherwise, it'll be pretty crappy on a small screen. I won't be going to watch this again at the cinemas and I won't be going out to buy the DVD to add it to my other Kong films. The movie is okay. It could have been better. <br/><br/>But as for now 6/10. Go watch the other 3, infinitely better versions. Peter Jackson had respect for the original when he made his 2005 version. This was just a cash grab. If they were trying to be respectful of the property in this movie, I didn't see it.<br/><br/>Next stop, putting Kong into a film with a boring Godzilla. Man, I'm sure that's gonna be a blast and totally not bastardize the King Kong name. I couldn't care less about Godzilla, but I really hate that they're dragging Kong into this poop storm again."

","This was huge fun! I immensely enjoyed this movie, as a big fan of the King Kong story, I walked in with great expectations but also with some fear of disappointment....I was wondering: how can such an iconic story be proposed in a way that is still engaging after so many remake? Well, they did it!Great special effect, superb cinematography, super cool music and above all a story that manages to successfully innovate the King Kong story. The movie is action-packed, you have to cling to your seat for the entire movie, it is like a two-hour roller-coaster."
"gtyoshida","10","5","10","30 April 2017"," An Excellent Movie
","""Kong: Skull Island"" roars out with a cast that is strong all down the line. Tom Hiddleston (James Conrad) and Samuel L. Jackson (Preston Packard) were both strong choices, Hiddleston for his star power inability to outshine Jackson or Brie Larson (Mason Weaver)and Samuel L. Jackson who made me hate him. <br/><br/>The story expands in unexpected ways as Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a soldier living on Skull Island since world war two and a group of scientists, Viet-Nam soldiers, a journalist, and a paid guide try to survive in Kong's uncharted world.<br/><br/>The harmony throughout this movie is as breathtaking as the beautiful jungle vistas. Kong feels the blood tie with Mason when she touches her hand to his face, Packard and Conrad use their respective ranks to quietly separate the civilians and the military men, and Kong's battles with the ""Skullcrawlers"" are savage killings.<br/><br/>This movie hits all the high notes with singularity and credit goes to Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts for making a masterful film. I give this movie an unprecedented ten."
"rsockey","1","5","10","16 April 2017"," Worst of the worst
","This movie was so bad it was actually painful to watch. I would have left the theater after the first 10 minutes if I hadn't been with a group of friends. John Goodman didn't act. He simply recited his terrible lines. I think someone taped his eyes open. He was bug eyed throughout the movie. What was that about? Samuel L Jackson should stick to credit card commercials. I kept waiting for him to ask what was in my wallet. As a matter of fact his movie acting is the same as his commercial persona. I cannot understand the good ratings this movie received. Someone must have gotten paid off. The only movie that I think was worse than Skull Island is Noah with Russel Crowe. I think theaters should be required to refund your money if you walk out within the first fifteen minutes. It's only fair."
"xamtaro","9","5","10","10 April 2017"," The King reigns again
","He's big, he's loud, hairy and proud. He is King Kong! This giant ape is to Hollywood what Godzilla is to Japan, having undergone multiple remakes ever since the classic movie from 1933. From the cheesy but fun 1976 version to the fairy tale-like period piece by Peter Jackson of LORD OF THE RINGS fame, to being borrowed by Japan for a couple of movies and facing off against Godzilla himself. Not to mention the deluge of imitators cashing in on the giant ape Monster concept.<br/><br/>Unlike previous attempts by Hollywood, KONG: SKULL ISLAND is not a remake of the classic tragedy. The original movie and its remakes were centred around a tragic ""damsel and Monster"" pseudo romance: people go to a mysterious island, Kong saves damsel in distress, falls for her, gets brought back to America, runs amok, captures damsel, gets killed by aeroplanes. This 2017 movie eschews that tired storyline for an original one set during the closing chapters of the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>Out to prove the existence of ancient mega-sized monsters, Bill Randa and Houston Brooks of the MONARCH organisation tag along with an expedition to a recently discovered island shrouded in storm clouds. With them are photojournalist Mason Weaver, biologist San Li, survivalist Conrad as their guide, Scientists from LANDSAT on a geological survey and a team of soldiers as escort. I loved the pacing of the set up and the plot evokes a sense of nostalgia. It is an exploration into the unknown, a little like Jurassic park with a team of unlikely heroes sent to a mysterious island, tragedy happens and they pull together to survive. The strange colossal creatures are revealed and portrayed in a way similar to the appearance of the first dinosaur in the classic Steven Spielberg movie, with that sense of awe and majesty.<br/><br/>Unlike Jurassic Park however, Kong is not a peaceful herbivore but a fierce protector guarding a dark secret beneath the island. The awe turns to horror as The humans' actions have awoken an ancient menace, angering Kong who decimates the helicopters and scatters the group. Conrad leads half of the group toward an evacuation site while Colonel Packard gathers what remains of men to strike back at Kong for killing his comrades. But the island holds many fearsome secrets and their only hope for defeating a blood thirsty race of predators is Kong.<br/><br/>Right from the get go, the all star cast nails it! Spot on delivery and portrayal of every character, their motivations and quirks completely fleshed out. They are not particularly complex, many of the soldiers fall into the ""typical squad"" mold that we have seen in many other movies featuring squads of soldiers, but the main characters are great. Tom Hiddleston's Conrad oozes badass charm and undergoes an arc that brings him from aloof loner out for himself to someone who puts the date of his teammates before himself. Samuel L Jackson's Packard is my favourite character. His quest for revenge against Kong and his slow descent into madness feels like something out of Apocalypse Now. It is a natural progression of his arc and the best part is that it does not feel contrived. His reasons are noble, having failed his men before and not wanting to fail them again. His relationship wit Kong becomes a sort of Ahab/Moby Dick dynamic which leads to a powerful pro-environmental message about humanity's tendency to destroy what they do not understand or cannot control.<br/><br/>The main attraction however are the giant monsters rendered in CGI using motion capture. The effects are magnificent, rendered primarily by Industrial Lights and Magic (ILM) the studio behind the effects of Transformers and Star Wars. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts brings clear camera-work with wide angles and sweeping shots allowing the action to be beheld in full. The cinematography by Larry Fong is astounding in itself, imbuing Skull Island with a rich atmosphere of unrestrained beauty. The shot near the opening of Kong rising against a setting sun is just one example of the many breathtaking sequences. My only gripe was how Kong's fur was rendered. There seems to be an unexplainable stiffness to the fur which at times looks less natural than 2005's rendition by Weta Digital.<br/><br/>By all counts, KONG: SKULL ISLAND is a rip roaring adventure with a sense of nostalgia accompanied by magnificent visuals, and clear action scenes pushing the boundaries of the giant Monster movie genre. It gives equal focus to both human characters and its titular titan, never getting bogged down in either element. The icing on the cake? KONG: SKULL ISLAND sets up a shared Monster universe, a ""Monsterverse"", and a sequel where the King will face off against a God."
"carry-on-man","10","5","10","8 April 2017"," What did people expect?
","Just got back from seeing this at the cinema, to be fair its only a 6 or 7 out of 10 movie, I only gave it 10 to balance out some of the idiotic reviews on here, 1 out of 10? No way, somebody said they even walked out after an hour, why? It was a King Kong monster movie, made specifically to tie him in to the Godzilla franchise, I don't know what some people were expecting to see. I wasn't expecting a script on a par with The Godfather or acting that wouldn't be out of place in a serious Oscar contender, I was expecting Kong and some other big monsters to fight it out in a totally unrealistic way while an annoying human subplot got in the way for the best part of 2 hours, as is standard practice in good old monsters movies going back to the original Kong via many a Godzilla flick and all the many rip offs in between.<br/><br/>Bottom line is is it as good as the original 1933 film? No, it isn't. Is it as good as the 1970s remake? Yes, it's probably a bit better. Is it as good as Peter Jacksons version? Seeing as how it isn't 3 hours long and as boring as watching paint dry I'd say its a good deal better. Bring on the next Godzilla film so we can get more of the original Toho monsters in on the action before the big two square off!"
"aqib4","2","5","10","26 March 2017"," Nice special effects but that's all
","The special effects were great. Excellent camera work. The plot was awful. It was basically the recent Godzilla movie all over again. King Kong was actually a good guy and he was killing off these other creatures that were really bad. Also the character development was abysmal. I found myself rooting for the lead characters to die. It was 2 hours of my life and $16 I'm never getting back, so hopefully I can save your time and money. Unless you just want to see some cool special effects then by all means go ahead."

Watch this one!!!"
"classicsoncall","9","5","10","22 March 2017"," ""What imaginary monster are you hunting this time?""
","Well I'm a big monkey movie fan from way back, having seen the original ""King Kong"" when I was about nine years old, and even then the picture was already almost three decades old. One might argue that yet another iteration of the mighty Kong is rather unnecessary, but for all that, I was on board to see this flick to see what the latest in story line and technical achievement would bring to the table. I'd have to say I walked away fairly impressed with the epic monster battles the picture had to offer. The technology available today certainly blows away the stop motion photography of the 1930's and adds a dimension of realism that couldn't be captured even a couple decades ago.<br/><br/>Set in the same universe as the 2014 ""Godzilla"" movie, I was gratified to see that we didn't have to wait around a long time to have Kong show up for his first appearance. It's only a few minutes into the set up of the story when we get our first glimpse of the giant gorilla, and from there things set up for a pretty fast pace once the investigation team makes it's initial foray on Skull Island. I can't say that the action of the military crew against Kong was handled very realistically, but after all, movies about huge apes aren't going to be grounded in reality much anyway. The treat here is in the over the top action sequences, like Kong engaging in hand to helicopter combat, satisfying one's expectation for visceral thrills coming at you non-stop.<br/><br/>With an ensemble cast, I didn't get much of a sense that there was one main star here required to carry the picture for the humans. Some of them, like the John Goodman character, came to an unexpectedly quick demise, as the movie gradually revealed an array of fabled prehistoric creatures in battle against the landing party and Kong himself. I don't know that 'skullcrawler' was the best name they could have come up with for those ancient looking giant lizards; the most creative one was probably the walking tree trunk that came to life when one of the explorers gave it a reason to get up and take a stroll. It was clunky looking, but pretty cool at the same time.<br/><br/>A major departure from the original ""King Kong"" and it's subsequent remakes was the absence of a Kong/leading lady dynamic. It was teased to some degree with Kong's saving Brie Larson's character from drowning, but the story line didn't take it in the same direction as prior films did. Nor did the story rely on capturing Kong to show him off as some huge sideshow attraction back in the civilized world. Those elements benefited the story in as much as there will be plenty enough time for Kong to make his mark when he takes on Godzilla on the big screen in a couple more years.<br/><br/>So basically, just go for the gusto with this flick. It's positioned to provide an adrenaline rush for fans of great monster action and outstanding visual effects, enhanced by colorful cinematography in the lush and luxuriant backdrop of present day Hawaii and British Columbia simulating 1973 Vietnam. I'll be seeing it again, because let's face it, I'm just a sucker for these big ape extravaganzas."

"davieo61","10","5","10","20 March 2017"," Badass and tons of fun!
","I really had a blast with this one because it was a different take on King Kong. I'm a big fan of Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong and even the 1976 King Kong movie, but i'm glad the 'It was beauty killed the beast' arc was dropped. I'm one moviegoer who is open to new ideas and this movie didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is pretty simple but in no way dumb. About the script, i think the problem was that this movie was overcast. When you have many big names in one movie, each one of them is expected to shine, have their characters developed, and have some good lines. But i think Jordan Vogt Roberts did a fine job. These criticisms of human characters not being developed is being taken too far. Not all movies have to make you care about all the characters. Just the main characters need development and in this case, the main characters were Kong, Packard, Hank Marlow and Randa. This is a fun B-movie that's sort of like a theme park ride. It is enjoyed best when you sit back and just enjoy the ride without unnecessary nitpicking.<br/><br/>I thought all the actors played their roles well. I couldn't care less if Brie Larson wasn't taking pictures. I was entertained all through. The VFX were awesome. The design of Kong and other creatures on the island was great. We got to see lots of Kong, and boy, was he BADASS. Kong's fights with the soldiers and Skull Crawlers were epic and had me on the edge of my seat. The shots in this film was fantastic thanks to Larry Fong. Its such a beautiful movie to watch. I'm looking forward to more from this Monsterverse.<br/><br/>Overall, i give it a 10/10.

"vasco_cid","4","6","13","23 March 2017"," Kong is not King anymore.
","Whether the world was in a desperate need for another King Kong or not seems immaterial after watching this. The underlying and rather obvious justification is to make way for a future crossover with another tired franchise (hello Godzilla) as money-making scheme - the same way Marvel has been doing for the past decade, revisiting, rebooting and ultimately exhausting Spider Man's and Hulk's properties.<br/><br/>On paper I blamed this reboot, seeing as Peter Jackson's 2005 passion project was both overlong and over-the-top but fun and engaging in equal measure. He provided an ambitious scope, not only on a technical level, to an iconic property rendering a product that is proud and respectful of its legacy but also autonomous on its own.<br/><br/>This 2017's outing however lacks both the same comprehensive talent and commitment and, just 12 years after that last successful adaptation, feels rather soon and unnecessary. For entertainment purposes though, all this reasoning and opposition could be waived if done right - and for a moment, as the first promotional materials started emerging (specially an astounding first trailer), it seem like it was. Nevertheless, Kong: Skull Island is guilty of not only proving those initial fears right, as it is of being utterly pedestrian and cheesy to an annoying degree.<br/><br/>The story (save for the time setting), the functional autopilot characters and the motivations are the same and nothing shows a glimmer of originality or audacity. Don't get me wrong, that is not necessarily a bad thing - some summer blockbusters and recent entertainment tent poles have had the same approach with very enjoying results (Prometheus did that for me, for instance). <br/><br/>I found myself continuously trying to find a saving grace for Kong: Skull Island, because the seamlessly magnificent cinematography and direction (of the action scenes particularly) kept me interested, kept me awed, kept me rooting - all to the point where the film had spiraled out of control into pure formulaic tawdry formula beyond redemption. The film knows it is cheesy and Vogt knows that's its selling point and that's what we came for but the forceful toleration of suspension of disbelief and exaggeration beyond reason implies we have ever cared for any of the human characters or for the central Kong, a misunderstood hero and protector. But no, we have never cared."

","""Kong: Skull Island"" is a big fun Monster movie adventure, IT'S a big budget summer blockbuster film that i enjoyed alot!!!
This is the best King Kong film out there in my opinion.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast was great with Samuel L Jackson (The Hateful Eight) Tom Hiddleston (Thor:Ragnarok)
Brie Larson (Captain Marvel)
John.C.Reilly (Step Brothers)
John Goodman (Arachnophobia) & some other's but these are the main stars & i liked Tom Huddleston playing a posh British mercenary as I've only seen him as the dark gothic evil brother of Thor in the Marvel Connected Universe films but he's good here as a smart & tough guide through the dangerous Skull Island.
Samuel L Jackson is great & intense with a serious strong performance as a troubled Captain fresh from Vietnam as this is set in 1973 just after the Americans pulled out.
I like the period setting of the 70's & it looks fantastic with excellent production design & greats visuals & fantastic cinematography as well as outstanding special fx!!!
Kong looks Amazing.<br/><br/>This is definitely an old fashioned Jungle Adventure film with a group of explorer's & rescuers heading into the strange unknown world of Skull Island that's full of massive creatures that have been hidden from the world.
My favourite of the cast was the hilarious & touching performance from John.C.Reilly who plays a survivor from WW2 who crashed on the island & has been the ever since, he's great fun.
All in all this is great entertainment & full of Awesome monsters & battles & Soldiers fighting creatures & bits of homage to Apocalypse Now & old Explorer Adventure monster movies of the past. Great Fun.
If you like Monster Movies or Creature Features like The Meg, Congo, Jurassic Park films, Godzilla & all those types of fun films then you will definitely enjoy this film, it's the best KING KONG film ever made in my opinion."

","When you can focus on that view from the island plateau, sensing destiny destroying your bridges and still see everlasting beauty, you can accept that some parts could be discarded but still be a part of the whole. 
It relates with KKong. What else?
It's about greed and ambition, yes it is.
As I see it, all those great fights and insects, all that egotistical unsensibility are there to underline the fact that their unique relation was indestructible and meant to be.
Isn't that what's cinema is all about?
I consider the oeuvre more than a remake. 
Technically impecable. A good thing, not a senseless repetition of already made scenes. 
To those who care about cinema should bring some sense of fulfillment."
"spencergrande6","7","3","5","22 April 2017"," Kind of all over the place but distinct enough
","A strange movie. It is kind of all over the place with its themes and influences but it has a distinct enough personality and some solid setpieces.<br/><br/>This is a straight adventure story with giant monsters, and the way it's shot and the hammy dialogue are mostly B-movie and comic book derived (check out those Dutch angles and blistering colors and 10 times too big sun, moon, aurora...).<br/><br/>But there's also a clunky Vietnam metaphor that's a straight-up over the top ""homage"" to Apocalypse Now, et al. The song choices even more so. It makes sense in theory (VietKong anyone?) but I don't think it ever really works and it's just an excuse to make Sam Jackson a bad guy to counterpoint Kong's ""human"" side.<br/><br/>Characters are fine for the most part. They serve their cardboard purposes and that's what's expected. Hiddleston and Larson in particular feel vastly underdeveloped. Everything they say and do fall instantly from memory and their disappearance from the movie all together wouldn't have changed it that much.<br/><br/>But what we want are monsters and we get them. Most of them are wonders to behold (the water buffalo, spider legs, and octo tentacles yum) except the generic Skullcrawers (the scene where Reilly names them is embarrassing - I don't think Larson or Hiddleston had any idea what to do the dialogue is so ferociously dumb. Reilly almost saves it however).<br/><br/>This Kong feels like a very different movie than the new Godzilla. This is very much an entertaining B-movie with strong comic book influences worn loud and proud. It will be interesting to see how these two worlds collide. If any franchises deserve an extended universe, it's these! That's what they're all about."

","No spoilers here. Just want to say this was a great movie and people should really give it a chance. Not a remake of the older versions of Kong but rather an expansion on the story. Have to say I spent two thirds of it wishing death on Samuel L. Jackson's character and two thirds of it marveling at how much I was enjoying John C. Riley whom I normally do not care for. Still after 4 incarnations of the Kong story can't figure out why he's a movie monster. Kong has always been the hero in my eyes"
"andrewcreer","8","3","5","24 March 2017"," This Is EXACTLY What Kong Should Be
","I in all honesty went into Kong with little to no expectations. Usually movies of this genre have the same basic set up: an overly long introduction, a dull process of discovering the ""monster"", different sequences of the monster wrecking havoc, and then dragging out the film until all problems are solved.<br/><br/>The great thing about Skull Island: it does none of those things. The movie starts, throws you through brutal and unexpected death and destruction - and then keeps going. There were multiple moments where I was legitimately shocked how unforgiving this movie was. The best part? It quickly wraps up while you are still completely enthralled in Skull Island. <br/><br/>What Kong lacks in story and character development, it makes up with some of the best action sequences I've ever seen in theaters. In all reality - do we really need more from a King Kong movie?"

","Having previously seen all three versions of King Kong-1933, 1976, and 2005-and knowing of some of the good notices of this particular version, I was very stoked to watch this! My movie theatre-working friend had not yet watched it either so this turned out to be the first time for both of us. In summary: This was quite a different take on Kong and his living quarters on Skull Island with many human characters that we get very much involved in caring about and thrilling in how they resolve to take care of things. And, yes, the fights Kong gets involved in are very exciting to watch. I should note that we watched this in regular screen, not IMAX or 3-D though if we had, it might have been even more thrilling! I really don't want to reveal anymore so I'll just say that me and my friend definitely recommend Kong: Skull Island."

","Kong takes itself far too seriously, with the attempt at one liners not really working.<br/><br/>Samuel Jackson, in my humble opinion, was not the right actor for his character - a grizzled, Vietnam vet, air force colonel out for revenge. Instead he comes across as a middle aged, out of condition, tourist on a fishing or hunting expedition. He just lacks the edge that is required.<br/><br/>The CGI is fantastic, but again, the extremely serious take on what I think should be more of a light hearted romp, detract from the film. <br/><br/>Unrealistically, more helicopters fly of the one small merchant ship than could off a modern day aircraft carrier.<br/><br/>Then when the helicopters attack Kong, they don't circle overhead and shoot at him, but fly low and slow so he can grab them.<br/><br/>The ending reinforces the serious take by flipping to handy cam mode with the end titles, to show the return of one of the veterans, aka Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is an entertaining film, and the cgi fight sequences are amazing.<br/><br/>With the right actors and a lighter script, it could have been IMHO, a fantastic film."
"newnoir","Null","4","8","17 March 2017"," Killa Thrilla Kong!

Reilly, the super cool Tom Hiddleston, the dynamic Brie Larson and her amazing gravity defying breasts and Toby Kebbell as the CGI actor of King Kong himself, yet some may be wicked bummed Andy Serkis didn't return to reprise the role of Kong from the 2005 Peter Jackson film.<br/><br/>This cast of motley characters is sent to investigate the mysterious Skull Island, home to the legendary simian giant King Kong, and they end up bruised, battered and bloody and getting mucho more than they bargained for on the monster filled isle.<br/><br/>Some may say this sequel pales in comparison to the 1930s original King Kong or the 2005 Jackson remake, yet this film's just for kicks and it delivers the goods with a healthy side badassery and a killer stinger scene that promises many more kooky and cool Kong sequels to come."
"Carycomic","10","4","8","15 March 2017"," I went to see this movie twice in a row. Just for the sneaky epilogue!
","As a rule, most movies rarely feel as good when you see them a second time. This film, however, is an exception to that rule. It's like the writers at Warner Brothers and Legendary decided: ""What if we did a sequel to the Jack Black/Naomi Watts remake set during the Vietnam War a la APOCALYPSE NOW?""<br/><br/>Well, it looks like they did. And with the box office take, from Opening Weekend approaching the $73 million mark, I think it's safe to assume that the answer is a resounding ""Yes!""<br/><br/>First off, there's the brilliantly subtle nod to Joseph Conrad, the author of the jungle adventure novel on which APOCALYPSE NOW was loosely based. That happens to be the surname of Tom Hiddleston's character; an ex-captain of the British Special Air Service burnt out from all his military service. Yet, he still resides in Southeast Asia, putting his military expertise to what he'd like to believe is good civilized humanitarian use. Hence, his first name ""Jack"" (derived, I think, from ""Union Jack,"" symbol of steadfast British resolve).<br/><br/>Then, there's the relative newcomer Brie Larson playing Mason Weaver; a tomboyish photojournalist whose coverage of the Vietnam War, on the front lines, did not sway her pacifist beliefs against America's involvement in it, one bit. No moral U-turn for her (unlike, say, David Jansen's journalistic character in THE GREEN BERETS)! And that's why I think, even though I've never heard of her before, Ms. Larson is going to make as big a name for herself, in the near-future, the same way Sigourney Weaver did from 1978 onward.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly, as Lt. Hank Marlow (a U.S. Army Air Forces fighter pilot, stranded on the island since 1944), provides both comedy relief and poignancy at the same time. I mean, one minute you can be laughing at his debate with Lt. Slivko, of the First Air Cavalry, about which music style is superior; Depression-era swing or 1960's rock-and-roll. The next moment, you're almost brought to tears by how much he was able to put aside his initial wartime hatred of fellow cast-away Gunpei Ikari (formerly of the Imperial Japanese Air Force) whom he tragically outlived on the island.<br/><br/>But, Samuel L. Jackson practically steals the show as Colonel Preston Packard.* A decorated hero of the Vietnam War, who even got to shake hands with Lyndon B. Johnson, you get the sense that he probably got his start as a Tuskegee Airman during World War II. Hence, his bitterness about returning to the States from Saigon (remember: the film is set in 1973) without the same kind of clear-cut victory. That, in turn, is why he becomes Captain Ahab to King Kong's Moby Dick.<br/><br/>Now, I've heard that this movie is going to do for Toho Studios' venerable monsters what Marvel Films did for the superheroes of the Avengers. Which is to say...bring them together. Hence, the sneaky epilogue!<br/><br/>Combine that with the vintage music sound track (my favorites were the two Creedence Clearwater classics); and you have one sci-fi action/adventure flick that you just should not miss.<br/><br/>*I can't help feeling that his character's name is an automotive pun on his Marvel Films character. As in, Col. Nick Fury being reminiscent of the Plymouth Fury which came out the same year the quality of Packard cars started going downhill (circa 1955)?"
"vanilla_vintage","4","4","8","15 March 2017"," Never ending plot holes , having high profile actors did not help
","They made a great trailer making me wanted to buy the ticket to see Kong right away. I am a fan of Kong especially the 2005 version. I thought it's awesome that they put the movie direction into more action blockbuster with weird big creatures to destroy like in the game plus the rock music was dope and made you want to embark on the Skull Island Journey with them. <br/><br/>The movie made u laugh from time to time because of being cliché. The Bangkok set is funny as some seller wears a vietnamese hat. I guess they want to portrait Asian vibe but it is not accurate. OK no big deal. <br/><br/>Throughout the film though, I feel I was forced to laugh at the scene that is the comic relief of the soldier joke about mom, food can and then smoking and got almost sad but not likely when they depart the tribe. <br/><br/>The characters also seem to have a flat dimension. Conrad is a good guy and brave. He never gets hurt. He can use samurai sword ( since when, no background) and he is the person who help tracking lost soldier but does he do his job and why he is captain? And when he said Come on Bastard, I laughed so hard at this one liner because Tom Hiddleston cussing. He seems to be aggressively arrogant ex captain then later he is a soft guy who cares for the people and he is always clean cut. I love Tom but being in the jungle you can't look that perfect! ( I love Tom tho)<br/><br/>Samuel's character is also too evil and not reasonable. They also use too much characters who survive in the jungle. <br/><br/>Dear Billy plot can actually turn into a great motive to live on for that army guy but i don't know why that happened to him. There seem like no need to have this character including Tian Jing who joins the team for unknown reason. <br/><br/>The relationship between Brie and Kong is not convinced enough. They met only once or twice but there is lacking development of plot that cannot convince me to believe. If they have some background like Kong longers for his mother? Or Why Brie connects to Kong? <br/><br/>They said they would not tell anyone at the end but why Brie did not throw away the camera? <br/><br/>I praise Randa ,Brie and that long lost soldier who did the best for the roles. This is obvious that this film overuse a bunch of five star actors but ruined it because of the bad script. <br/><br/>It was fun but I want to share this idea since I thought i could have been more badass if they'd worked on the plot. <br/><br/>5/10"
"arnieiam","10","4","8","14 March 2017"," Such a weird film experience that really ended up being fun
","I wanted to see a movie on discount Tuesday and thought to myself why not watch another studio churned cgi mess? This is exactly what it was but somehow managed to be subversive enough in its presentation that I had a lot of fun watching it.<br/><br/>This is supposed to take place in the same universe as the Godzilla film of 2014. That is why King Kong is the size of a 30 story building, in hopes that he can throw down with Godzilla in a crossover film. Unlike Godzilla however, this film didn't shy away with showing as much Kong as possible and it was glorious. The scenes where Kong smashes helicopters and fights monsters had that perfect blend of over-the- top action and just being visceral. And the violence in this film had a degree of macabre, so there were moments I was like gasping and chuckling saying ""Oh my god!"". So many characters get picked off at unexpected moments that it kept the film really suspenseful.<br/><br/>Now this film follows a trend where this is the sophomore film of a director who's debut was a low budget indie film. I think studios do this so that the director is easy to push around and you can cheap out on his share of the budget. And I think the director knew this so he decided to mess around with the audience. There is so much weird dialogue about nothing and I swear the median shot length of the first act was around 1 second because it kept quick cutting. And rather than being annoyed with it, I embraced it and only make me like it more as I placed myself in the directors shoes.<br/><br/>The plot was also weird to say the least especially the setting. Why they wanted the film to be set during the Vietnam War confuses me still. Is it because they wanted to represent a demoralized military force being defeated again by a primitive enemy? Or to push Samuel L Jackson's character as really jaded as he is a Colonel in the US Army. Either way it really worked, because what we ended up getting was a mix of Apocalypse Now, an adventure film, a monster film, a b- movie and Moby Dick.<br/><br/>The characters in this film were a mixed bag. Loki and much of the cast were uninteresting and one dimensional. I don't recall Loki ever going through a character arc and all the blonde girl was characterized as an anti-war shutterbug. The two most interesting characters were played by John C Reilly and Samuel L Jackson. Reilly plays a WW2 pilot who crash landed on the island and had survived off the natives. He was so eccentric and funny and I loved him. Samuel L Jackson though stole the show. As mentioned he plays a very Jaded US Army Colonel who basically becomes the Captain Ahab of the film. I love it when he plays these intense unhinged characters and was so glad he could fit this into his filming schedule. Please keep making movies Sam, I beg you!<br/><br/>So yea, I highly recommend this. Its a very entertaining film that doesn't take itself too seriously unlike Godzilla 2014 did. It has a lot of the generic big budget action tropes but it also manages to mess with your expectations."

Big fan of DC / Marvel, Pacific Rim, etc., even found merit in the last Godzilla film and despite it's critics I even loved Peter Jacksons 2005 remake, so had reasonable expectations for Skull Island. However, was so disappointed. The concept is just silly, it takes itself too seriously, a lot of the performances are either wooden or miscast, even Samuel L Jackson is annoying and doesn't do anything to save the film, quite the opposite.<br/><br/>It's main redeeming feature is it's look. On the whole it looks incredible, some of the effects are truly breathtaking, and there are some iconic frames to behold, the major exception being Kong himself. Gone is the realistic stature and look of Kong from Jackons predecessor film, instead we a very 'ungorilla' like figure that basically looks like a CGI rendition of a guy dressed in a bad suit. <br/><br/>Half way through the film I'd lost interest in the story and cared little for the characters, especially Kong, which is what is at the core of previous Kong films.<br/><br/>I understand that this is the first in probably a line of films opening up the Kong / Godzilla universe, but this just left me flat enough to not really be excited about that prospect at all."

BOTH films are different, Peter Jackson version is more serious tone with tiny at the moment humour, whereas Kong Skull island is more of action comedy. I have to say it was disappointing and hard to sit through. The story was unbalance on to where these ""Skull Crawlers"" came from. Lack of adventure, didn't explore this new fascinating world. Lack of character development so you couldn't care less when characters died. Towards the end it went to typical Hollywood film, big explosion Michael Bay style and typical female character as a damsel in distress. The only thing that kept me watching was Samuel L. Jackson and John Goodman. I've said a lot of harsh words to his film, it is entertaining with some giggles to it, but I felt it didn't need to go that direction. If the next squeal is what I think it is, I don't want to see any jokey moments when it should be a serious fight between the two kings/ gods."

Even though this was another unwanted remake, I was actually looking forward to this movie, but it just let me down big time. <br/><br/>I still don't know why they wanted to go to Skull Island. Just one guy with a sad, weak backstory wanted to go to prove that monsters exist, I guess. And an entire military force just go along with it, 2 days before going home.<br/><br/>When they reach the island, which is very early in the film, the military just fly all their helicopters through this huge storm without hesitation. Which is just ridiculous, but it gets even worse when they start bombing the place to ""see what the ground is made of"" or something..? (Later in the movie we learn that the bombs were actually dropped to call Kong up for a fight). And then when Kong shows up, they all act super dumb and try to take him down instead of just flying in a different direction. <br/><br/>When they all crash as a result (duh), the acting gets really bad. And they want us to care about the people who just died, but honestly we don't, because we didn't get to know any of them. All we know is one soldier has a son and one has a mom, but don't we all? I mean there are too many characters with little backstory, who die all over the place and we're like ""okay, bye"". <br/><br/>And they deserve it cause they make dumb decisions like, shooting at literally everything, walking in open spaces, talking loudly when a creature is just 5 steps away, going to dangerous places when being warned and showing no respect for nature or the animals on the island. I don't even have the energy to talk about Samuel L. Jackson, I usually love him, but this character...just...ugh.<br/><br/>In general the movie is just filled with bad jokes, bad acting, boring characters and ridiculous action scenes.

","Kong: Skull Island follows a scientist who, upon discovering an uncharted island, decides to take a team there to explore it in the hopes of discovering new species or something of that sort. Coincidentally, that's the same island that King Kong lives on, along with multiple other monsters. <br/><br/>The movie basically blows through the whole beginning, introducing the characters and basic motivations. For the most part, I was fine with that, but once they reach the island the characters themselves cease to have character, though they had little before. They're just robots with an objective. When the movie tries to develop two characters' relationship at one point, the conversation is just playful banter that lasts all of 30 seconds. It's a formula for developing characters that has worked to show how well actors can play off each other, but it doesn't work here because of how generic and rushed it is. Furthermore, one particular character gets thrown into the mix way too early. I don't want to spoil his role for those who don't know, but it's John C. Reilly's character. He shows up in the first 30 minutes, and in context it doesn't make sense. <br/><br/>I mostly went to this movie because every review I read or watched said that Kong himself was great, so I figured it'd at least be a fun time at the movies that would be better in a cinema. Sure, Kong was good, for all three of his scenes. Seriously, I started to forget that this was a King Kong movie. And it seemed like the writers forgot too, because he kinda just showed up on occasion to remind the audience what the movie was called. He wasn't even the biggest threat on Skull Island, he was just kind of there. <br/><br/>As far as the exciting parts of this movie go, the action set pieces are great. They set up for something epic and exciting. But the action itself often falls kind of flat. Sure, it's mostly fun, but it's kind of dumb too. And some shots based around these sets don't make sense. There's a point where the characters are looking down at a dip in the land with giant bones in it. Then they go down and it's full of green fog that varies in thickness. So where did the fog come from? How is it that they could see clearly from above, but barely could from within? It just doesn't make sense, and in Kong's opening scene the time of day constantly switches between midday to late evening, and it's so distracting. Sure, it's a pretty shot, but it took me out of the action, and that isn't a good thing. And in addition to that, a lot of the cool monsters you may have seen in the trailers are better in the trailer than in the movie. Lot's of monster fights happen before we can even care about any of the characters, so when people are dying I was simply detached. But the fights proved to be so short-lived that there was no time to really even get excited. Again, the set pieces are great but the action itself is mediocre. <br/><br/>I'm sure most people saw 'The Jungle Book' from 2016 and noticed how great the CGI is. So my question now is, how is it that a whole year later we can get bad CGI? Seriously, there were scenes in this movie where the monsters and the characters were together and it looked horribly fake. It was actually pretty cringe-worthy at times, and I did. A lot. It got to the point where my friend next to me asked if I wanted to leave. I still saw it through, though. But man, it all looked so fake. It looked like a video game, and not one where graphics were the main concern. The monsters themselves were cool, sure, but they just didn't look real. <br/><br/>And on top of that, the tone was all over the place. First the characters are excited, then it's serious, then their laughing and playing records and having fun, then their dying, then they start laughing again. It's like it tried to use comedy sometimes but instead they just destroyed the tone. It was so inconsistent in this way, and again it distances the audience from the movie. It abruptly removes you from where you just were to relocate you to a new box of feelings, and that journey is just awkward and weird. It's like the movie really doesn't know what it is, but it's trying to find itself. <br/><br/>Despite all this, the movie gets better towards the end. By the last half hour, it is where it should have been at the beginning in terms of characters. So there was a level of excitement, and the expected fight with Kong versus big bad monster proves to be a great time, and moreover tends to be rather well shot. <br/><br/>Overall Kong: Skull Island was a movie where the lack of characters made it difficult to get invested, and as such the result was a garbage fire. It's not an enjoyable movie. It's not pretty, it's not interesting, and it's barely even fun. The actors tried their best with what they were given, and I admired how willing the movie was about killing off major characters at points other than the very end, but still there was nothing to save this movie where it was. There is a good movie hidden in here somewhere, I am certain of that, but it isn't this one. In the end I would advise you to avoid this movie and wait for it to come to Netflix if you haven't seen it, like the last Godzilla movie did. Contrary to expectations of excitement, this is a rather boring movie, and the price of admission is simply not worth your hard-earned money."
"CinemaClown","Null","5","11","24 March 2017"," A Wasted Opportunity That Offers Nothing New In Its Retelling Of The Legend of Kong
","After bringing the ""King of Monsters"" back to cinematic life in 2014, Legendary Pictures turns its attention to another behemoth to further solidify its own cinematic universe of super-species but all of it doesn't amount to much in the end, for Kong: Skull Island offers nothing new in its retelling of the legend of the giant ape.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island follows a team of scientists & soldiers who, just before the end of Vietnam War, secure the U.S. government funding for the expedition of an uncharted island in the South Pacific but when they reach there, they encounter a 100-foot tall bipedal ape who destroys their choppers and leaves them dispersed & stranded in the unmapped territory, thus turning the survey job into a survival race.<br/><br/>Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, the first act of Kong: Skull Island is its strongest, for the premise is expertly set up and the efficient handling of its ominous vibe & sense of foreboding evokes keen interest. But once all our characters are on the island and the main plot is set into motion, it loses momentum as Vogt-Roberts fails to juggle multiple subplots properly and is unsure whether to go for a lighthearted, fun-filled extravaganza or a serious & dark monster flick.<br/><br/>Production design team imbues a sense of mystery & danger to the exotic place with its set pieces. Cinematography attempts to duplicate the haunting aura of Apocalypse Now with its radiant colour palette, skillful use of lighting & shadows but succeeds only in bits n pieces. Slow-mo camera-work is finely utilised during the first encounter with Kong but is ultimately overdone in the end. Editing is a mixed bag, VFX has its share of strengths & flaws while Henry Jackman's score is serviceable.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Kong: Skull Island features a talented ensemble in Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman & John C. Reilly, with Terry Notary providing the motion capture work for the eponymous ape. Hiddleston is alright as the mercenary, Larson does nothing but take photographs & act surprised, Goodman is completely wasted in his role, Jackson plays himself while Reilly is mostly annoying, plus the excessive focus on his character was totally unwarranted.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Kong: Skull Island is just as mediocre an entry in Legendary's MonsterVerse as Godzilla but it does feature more monster mayhem, even if those brief battles never manage to be engrossing or emotionally fulfilling. Characterisation takes a backseat, its lame attempts at humour fall flat, most creative choices don't work out in the film's favour and, in addition to all that, there is pretty much nothing in it that we haven't seen before. Falling short on all scales, Kong: Skull Island is a wasted opportunity that neither understood its true potential nor looked up to see what was up for grabs."

"nmechmpin","7","5","11","10 March 2017"," Good Popcorn Movie, But Far From A Classic
","There is a TEASER AFTER-CREDITS SCENE at the end of the movie, so be sure to stick around for it. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the film very much. I liked Peter Jackson's King Kong more, but this was still a good film. The movie plays out like a 20th- century war film, instead of the traditional Beauty and the Beast adventure. Not only was that a wise choice because it makes the movie stand out from previous Kongs, but also because the actual Beauty and the Beast remake will be released this month. (Coincidence?)<br/><br/>My favorite feature wasn't the action, story, or performances. The movie takes place in the mid-1970s. I got the most joy from seeing a bunch of old technology again: record players, phone booths, photo darkrooms, classic cars, etc. It was a trip down memory lane.<br/><br/>However, there was a downside to this. One of the characters was a photojournalist. Her camera seemed to be way too ""advanced."" She took pictures at night, day, motion, near, far, etc. There are 2017 cameras that aren't great under variable conditions. How can she take amazing photos with a 1970s unit? She also seemed to have infinite rolls of film. Throughout the movie, I kept thinking ""Why haven't you run out of film yet?! How many rolls could you possibly have carried in that handbag?!""<br/><br/>The other bad feature of the movie is strictly a personal problem. Corey Hawkins has a supporting role. His movie character is nerdy, inexperienced, slightly clumsy, and wears glasses. The ""problem"" is that Mr Hawkins stars on 24: Legacy. On that television show, he is a confident, experienced, action hero that doesn't wear glasses. Therefore, every time Hawkins came on the screen, I kept getting a wacky Clark Kent feeling. It not at all the actor's fault, but I just couldn't suspend my disbelief properly every time I saw him. LOL<br/><br/>On a positive note, several of the characters didn't wind up falling to the clichés that usually come with this kind of film. That was a very welcomed change. <br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is a decent spring popcorn movie. Solid acting. Interesting creature designs. Great soundtrack. I give the movie a B- grade."
"kermitkid","9","2","3","30 March 2020"," Kong is the King
","Man, oh man, was this movie fun! While I liked Peter Jackson's version, this definetly blows it out of the water! It's totally epic! I'm surprised this wasn't released in the summer, because it's definely got that summer blockbuster feel. One criticism people had with 2014's ""Godzilla"" was that it moved too slowly and took forever for Godzilla to actually show up, and I agree. This fixes that mistake by showing Kong in the opening scene to tide us over, and then doing the buildup. The tone and feel of this movie reminded me of ""Indiana Jones."" It's a fun island survival movie. In my opinion, one thing ""Godzilla"" suffered from was the human characters just weren't that interesting. That was not the case here. The characters are written very well, with clear goals and conflicts. The scale of Kong and the island as a whole are impressively huge. Do not watch this movie on your phone. Watch it on the biggest screen possible with an epic sound system for full immersion. Keep in mind the movie, in my opinion, really pushes the PG-13 rating. Some of the violence and deaths can get really brutal. Yet it still manages to balance it out with humor. (Particularly from John C. Reilly's character.) Godzilla had a very dark, bleak, and overall depressing and hopeless tone. (Although those monster fight sequences were awesome!!!!!) This has an action movie tone and is extremely intense at times. Some of the creatures they came up with for the island are really cool, and definetely not stuff I felt I had seen before. It's impressive that a movie that's been remade and redone again and again and again since the 30's still manages to bring something new to the table, while also retaining that classic feel.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","2","3","8 March 2019"," The best treatment of King Kong in over 80 years.
","Given how incredibly groundbreaking the special effects in the original King Kong (1933) were, I can understand why they keep re-using this character. Of course, while King Kong (1976) was mislabeled as ""original"" in its advertising, the advancements in CGI made King Kong (2005) at least as visually stunning as its 1933 predecessor. Still, the story has remained the same: humans visit Skull Island, humans find Kong, humans bring Kong to New York, Kong climbs the tallest building, and humans kill Kong. Consequently, I didn't have much of an expectation of Kong: Skull Island (2017), since I thought I knew what the plot would be.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that Kong: Skull Island is the best adaptation of this character since 1933. A few choices helped to create an original story that deviated from the norm. Sure, humans go to Skull Island to find Kong, but the other creatures they find there are as fantastical as the gigantic Kong, who appears to be larger than any other version I've seen of him. Aside from the beautiful and artistic cinematography accentuating the intense fight sequences between Kong and his foes (be they human or otherwise), the fact that the film is set in the time shortly after the Vietnam War gave it a vastly different feel than any of the other Kong films in the franchise.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the action was excellent. Additionally, the brief moments of levity interspersed throughout helped to keep the movie moving along at a good pace. I knew going into this film that it was part of a larger cinematic universe which includes Godzilla (2014), so while some characters and elements in Kong: Skull Island felt unused, I am sure they'll become relevant when Godzilla vs. Kong (2020) rolls around. In fact, part of the reason I gave this film my attention was that its predecessor was incredibly entertaining. Of course, I didn't know Kong: Skull Island was a prequel of sorts until the post-credits scene, but that just makes me want to see the next films in the franchise even more.<br/><br/>The best treatment of King Kong in over 80 years, I give Kong: Skull Island 4.5 stars out of 5."

They do justice to their roles but somehow I felt they weren't really the best choices to don them. Samuel Jackson breezes through in a negative role. What I really liked was how many actors in the movie(the two teams that go in to discover the island) get well etched roles with a good dose of humor in the midst of the horror around them. The visuals of the island are beautifully captured and the effects are equally first rate. The good(Tom Hiddleston & team), the bad(Samuel Jackson & team) and the terrible(the beasts of the island) come together and give us our ticket's worth of entertainment(there may be plot holes but who cares?)

","I have seen all of the King Kong movies and I have to say this one knocks them all out. Even the original and that's saying something. Kong: Skull Island is part of Legendary's monster universe, which features the new Godzilla movie that came out in 2014. <br/><br/>The story is as follows, a group of scientists venture to a mysterious hidden island in the south pacific. The scientists are part of the team known as Monarch, a scientific group known to study the unknown and mysterious things of the world. The group has a military escort which is lead by Samuel L Jackson. As they venture into the island they discover it is an ancient world inhabited by ancient beast that man has never seen. Then they meet Kong, a Gigantic ancient species of Primate that's not to be messed with. Kong is the last of his kind, and is fighting a never ending battle with another vicious ancient species. <br/><br/>Out of all the King Kong movies, Kong seemed the most real in this one because of how the CGI looks with him. Peter Jackson's King Kong comes next in line but I felt they focused more on the ape like behavior in that one then just a pure monster. The story was good in this one, the characters, and the overall adventure. It is a story of survival of the fittest, Kong is fighting for his survival against other monsters, but also man too. In the end Kong comes out King, with a awesome battle at the end with another beast. <br/><br/>I liked This King Kong. I also know that this is not the last we see of him. Legendary plans to make a ""Godzilla vs Kong"" movie that is set to come out in 2020, following a ""Godzilla: King of Monsters"" movie in 2019. I for one cannot wait to see these upcoming Legendary monster movies.

"FallonTimberlake2016","6","2","3","22 September 2017"," A fun monster movie but lacks compelling characters.
","Kong: Skull Island is basically exactly what you'd expect it to be, as long as you're not expecting Apocalypse Now 2. Which, ironically, is often what this film is trying to go for. If I walked into the theater for this movie not knowing at all what it was, the first act (very first scene excluded) would make me think that it was a crappy Vietnam war film with way too many A-list actors. In reality, it is an OK monster movie with way too many A-list actors and absolutely no character development.<br/><br/>This film started off pretty badly in all respects, but improved significantly after the actual monster came into the plot. Honestly, the monster and John C. Reilly's character are the only characters that get any real development, which is this movie's biggest problem. There are so many characters in this film, and they are all reduced to stereotypes. Tom Hiddleston is in this film just to be the handsome action hero and Brie Larson is there just to be the sexy main female lead. Larson gets no backstory whatsoever, and Hiddleston is reduced to one line that sounds like it was shoehorned in at the very last second. John Goodman's character has some backstory but he's so annoying it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>All of the acting is mediocre, which is a shame because of the quality of actors put in this film. The only good performances are Samuel L. Jackson because he's Samuel L. Jackson, and John C. Reilly because he's occasionally funny. Other than that, good actors can be reduced to rubbish because of the bad script. <br/><br/>Of course, this movie isn't complete garbage, and that is mostly because of the all the various monsters and explosions. Say what you will about Kong: Skull Island, but it is entertaining as hell. The monster fights are big and mindless, and that's honestly all anybody asked for when going into this film.<br/><br/>If you go into Kong: Skull Island expecting mindless action, then you will most likely love it. However, if you watch it for literally any other reason, then you will find a mediocre monster movie that has been done a million times before.<br/><br/>I give Kong: Skull Island a C+."

The movie jarred me from reality when 5 helicopters dispatched for exploration transforms into an invasion force. I tried to get back into the story yet could not as 1. King Kong was shifting in size at points and always too large for him to relate to humans 2. The indigenous people seemed intriguing yet treated as nothing more than furniture even by a guy who had spent 28 years with them 3. the Colonel turning into a vengeful psycho was not plausible and 4. the real evil monsters struck me as unreal cartoons.

"utgard14","5","2","3","16 August 2017"," ""That was an unconventional encounter.""
","Juvenile, clichÃ©-ridden CGI spectacle. Not a sincere moment in the whole thing. Just action and CGI cartoonery for the sake of it. Set in the 1970s but little effort is made to make it seem authentic to that era. Everything is too clean, too pretty, too modern. Textbook Hollywood polish. Seems like the only reason it's even set back then is to shoehorn in some anti-military angle that is out of tone with the rest of the story. None of the performances resonate. There's the occasional chuckle at some of the characters' lines but that's it. Once John C. Reilly shows up, it practically becomes a full-blown comedy.<br/><br/>Lots of things don't make sense, like a giant squid in what appears to be a few feet of water. The special effects are so-so but nothing that reinvents the wheel. In some places they are outright bad. The designs for the skullcrawler creatures is very unimpressive. The movie advocates the Hollow Earth theory, which amused me to no end mainly because I know how that triggers some people. Another annoying thing is this gag that never works but is used more than once: a person suddenly discovers a part of their natural surroundings is actually a monster. ""Oh don't sit on that log"" and such. It's a pathetic attempt at some kind of jump scare and they use it a few times. Ugh. All that being said, it's entertaining for what it is: dumb action movie with giant creatures. Go into it with that expectation and you'll probably be fine with it. Expect anything remotely intelligent and you'll have a bad two hours."

""Kong: Skull Island"" on the other hand is just a monster flick with Kong in it. Kong doesn't have any personality here nor did i had any feeling towards him - i didn't care if he nor anyone else survived here - and this is the worst part of the movie - so many great actors but there isn't anyone who i would remember, except for John C.

But when that ride has begun, it was done so unfocused, so kinda badly edited that i almost missed when Kong made his entrance - poor pacing and editing. And after that ""Kong: Skull Island"" become very simple, not original, not highly involving monster flick in which i didn't really care about the outcome.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is a big budget monster flick with very good special effects, some nice action scenes, setting but that is pretty much it.

","I suppose this works as entertainment and it fails utterly as something more, although if you look a bit into it, you will see how this island is full with the bones of potential creative richness.<br/><br/>The core concept was the overlapping of two ideas. You have Conrad's metaphor of going up the river, not directly through Conrad but with the Vietnam filter Coppola put on it (his interest was in turn triggered by an abandoned first project by Welles). And you have the obvious exotic lost paradise location full of dangerous otherworldly creatures, who exist in the cinematic world of Jurassic Park, not of the previous Kong films.<br/><br/>The first concept was, i think, a creative choice. The second was a producers requirement. The rest of the film, with the required references, jokes, etc. follows these two guidelines and becomes literally a battle between these two visions, a battle obviously won by the producers vision. We are left with nothing at the end. But it's still fun to try and guess where and how the studio twisted the vision of the writers - not knowing any other work of this director, i don't know on which side he was. Anyway:<br/><br/>-Sam Jackson plays Kurtz, but he channels his Jurassic Park mad performance;<br/><br/>-the boat made of scraps from the crashed planes was the prop with more potential. It's visual, it's interesting, and could work in a Herzog way. Yet it is rendered to near uselessness, because Sam Jackson wants to blow up Kong instead of going down the river (get it?)<br/><br/>-Marlow is merely supporting here. He has lived in the island for 28 years, but calls none of the shots (not even the mad ones). Eventually he leaves the tribe of natives, another nod to Conrad, and goes back to his former world;<br/><br/>-Where they screwed this up the worst, in my opinion, was in how the Hiddleston/Larson characters were handled. He is named ""Conrad"", but She is the photographer/reporter, the one designated writer/storyteller on screen. We even ""see"" many of the photos she takes, get the world through her lenses. SHE should be Conrad, not him. But again the producer's vision prevails, and they needed a ""girl in distress to be saved"" and in the process produce the 2 visually obvious references to the previous Kong films.<br/><br/>Go on, and place here the references that you can find: helicopters against an orange sky, the forced Vietnam bits, the Full Metal Jacket nods, Bowie vs Doors references, and whatever you feel like finding out and filling in. In our age of irony, filtered through nostalgia, i supposed this film will have its place, and the nodding head of Nixon may be read under recent political events in America (although it was most certainly filmed before the last American election). This viewer had fun, but in the end has left the island with nothing more than the memory of a few skulls that could have been kings."

I will go so far as to call it partially very beautifully done, while from the story point of view its probably more or less a loss.<br/><br/>For beautiful images I will give an 8 out of 10 I will not deduct any points for the lack of story (or logic) as I simply had no expectations in this regard in the first place :)"
"MrJRGO","7","1","1","1 June 2020"," Does what it says on the tin.
","Set in the early 1970s, a team of scientists, backed up by armed forces, venture to a newly discovered island in the Pacific. All of them, bar one, think they're going for geological or scientific study but it's not long before they come face to face with the island's bigger inhabitants.<br/><br/>'Kong : Skull Island' does what it says on the tin. It's about a huge monster, with other huge monsters, on a mysterious island containing spectacular and foreboding landscapes, and how human beings who we don't care about, get eaten, squashed, blown up and human beings we do care about manage to escape to tell the fantastical tale to an unsuspecting world.<br/><br/>All of the above is what you go for and all of the above is what you get when you watch this. One criticism is that a little more character development would have been welcome. Some of the cast feel like they're giving lacklustre performances here. The only one who really grabs me is John C. Reilly, playing a Ben Gunn type character who has been marooned away from civilisation for many years. His craziness and openness makes him likable but Reilly also adds the right amount of pathos when his character reveals his thoughts about the wife he left behind and the son that he's never seen.<br/><br/>The special effects are good and I did find myself rooting for Kong in some of the fight scenes, with a self satisfied, smug look on my face when he wins the day (that's not a spoiler because it's a given that Kong will survive and win, he's Kong). The fight scenes are good although I don't think they're quite as good as the ones in the most recent Godzilla.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent effort but I expect better from the next Kong movie."

","It's strange, this mash-up of King Kong, Apocalypse Now and Ice Age 3 (Tom Hiddleston's character is basically Buck the weasel), but it works. After the disappointment of two previous overblown remakes, someone finally seems to have figured out what we want from the story: which is not Freudian symbolism and tragedy but monsters, jungle and - without spoiling it - the potential for a sequel. It manages a few laughs, which doesn't hurt, and isn't entirely brainless: the environmental message of the 70s version is in there somewhere, without spoiling the fun.<br/><br/>In fact I think it's like one of those Doug McClure 'Lost World' films of the 70s - which I used to love - but produced to a much higher standard. I enjoyed it."

","Having already seen GODZILLA (2014) and GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS (2019), the first and third films in Legendary's 'Monsterverse' franchise, I eventually got around to watching second entry KONG: SKULL ISLAND. Liked it, with some minor reservations. Despite being quite different in tone to the other two films, visually it's still recognisably part of the same universe. Legendary clearly took to heart some of the main criticisms made about their initial GODZILLA - namely that it was (i.) too dark and (ii.) didn't feature enough of the title creature - by this time having all but one of the action scenes take place in broad daylight, with Kong debuting in the first five minutes. The human characters play a larger role in the proceedings (loved the moment when Mason shot a flare into The Big One's eye), probably reflecting Kong's lesser status within the Monsterverse: he may be a god on Skull Island, but place him outside in the wider world and Kong is just an oversized ape, whereas Godzilla and his fellow Titans truly are gods and ""the rightful rulers of Earth.""<br/><br/>My one big disappointment with SKULL ISLAND was that it's 1973 setting was ultimately just window dressing. You could replace the Hueys with Blackhawks, update the soldiers' uniforms and equipment, portray them as veterans of the Iraq war or Syrian conflict instead of Vietnam, and tell the exact same story. I was hoping the immediate post-Nam setting would be more relevant."

","This is the best monster verse movie so far. It's truly ridiculous but great fun. Kong is awesome and I quite liked his back story. The saviour of the island rather than mad big ape. The acting is awful and all the characters are so stereotyped from similar movies. Gung ho army guys, mad general, Random hot female photographer and dishy British army officer who does not break sweat ever. The script is proper cheesy. You can't help but kind of like it. It's also a bit of a metaphor for the Vietnam War. Americans going to an Island they are not welcome and starting a war with they shouldn't get involved in. Finally Kong v Godzilla, am defo routing for the ape. Godzilla does not actually give a stuff about humans. He just wades into cities to fight monsters and does not care how much he destroys or how many innocents he kills in the process. He simply does not like anyone challenging his god like status. Kong meanwhile always shows genuine empathy to fellow creatures and tries to defend them. Kong truly is King"
"RhapsodyReviews","6","1","1","16 September 2019"," Entertaining Enough for Multiple Viewings.
","Review:
'Kong: Skull Island' is an American monster film directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts. The film is a reboot of the King Kong franchise, and serves as the second film in Legendary's MonsterVerse. Some people go to the movies to be wowed by the superb acting, heart wrenching and well written story, and overall solid production. This has a good story and good effects. The acting isn't bad, but it isn't award winning.
The story has characters Bill Randa and Houston Brooks (John Goodman and Corey Hawkins) piggybacking on an expedition to an uncharted island to test a theory they've been working on. The first hirer a tracker names James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and assemble a team of highly trained Military professionals lead by Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson). As they enter the island, they start dropping seismic explosives, which create mini earthquakes for them to be able to map out the island. Suddenly, the air unit is attacked by the giant ape, scattering the survivors across the island. Two groups form between the survivors: Conrad, Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) and one of the soldiers gather quickly, while Randa and the rest of the soldiers land a few miles away. Packard goes in search of the transport helicopter piloted by his right-hand man Major Jack Chapman, (Toby Kebbell) intending to use the weapons on board to kill the ape that killed most of his men.
This movie much like Godzilla has some great talent, but it ruined with boring characters. Brie Larson plays a photographer and I have no idea what she is doing there. Anyone of these trained for combat officers could use a camera to document what is happening instead of endangering the life of a civilian. Her character didn't need to be in it and seemed to just be added to have the female character that Kong needs. John C. Reilly plays a surprisingly funny WW2 vet marooned on the island. Other then the actors playing the roles they were given; they are not fleshed out at all. We learn nothing about where they were before we see them in the film or why some of them have the talents they have.
I enjoyed the action in this movie, and Kong looked good, almost all the creatures looked realistic and all the fights between them looked good. Some of the green screen effects, like backgrounds behind characters, were distractingly bad. Ultimately, you get some great stuff out of all the effects if you're not looking too closely.
Overall, this movie is an entertaining story with lots of destruction. It's enjoyable for what it is, a monster movie with lots of action. The characters are lackluster and not all the likeable. You will be going into this for the entertainment factor and not so much the character development.
3/5"

"xmdbx","6","1","1","3 April 2019"," Watch For The Special Effects
","I have a soft spot for Godzilla but I did not expect much of this movie when I started it. I expected bad writing, poor acting and over the top special effects. Well, I got all three of those things but the over the top special effects ended up being what made the movie watchable. The story didn't make much sense and the acting was laughable at times but the special effects were some of the best that I have ever seen. And the fact that they were so over the top made it possible for them to be the main focus of the film. Seriously, whenever I wasn't enjoying a particular scene of dialogue some completely preposterous action scene that was expertly crafted would steal my attention. The explosions, Kong, the MUTOS, everything looked amazing. Other than that the movie was pretty bad but the special effects were so good that it was positive viewing experience. I'm also a sucker for Vera Lynn."
"MovieCeption","6","1","1","17 March 2019"," Solid Creature Feature
","This movie is not nearly as good as Peter Jacksons King Kong back in 2005, but it is also a very enjoyable one. The writer does not give really a damn about the story and the characters. So the ambition of this movie is only to make a very quickly cutted action movie.Comparde to the Godzilla 2014, this movie is much better, beaucse it is a king kong movie. The film is about Kong and so he has much more screentime than Godzilla back in 2014. The action scenes have really good CGI, are very entertaining and good directed. Unfortunately you really see that there are a lot of scenes cut off. So suddenly characters appear that you have not seen in this movie until yet. The tone also changes suddenly to fast. For example, when they arive in the Skull island, you hear paranoid from black sabbath and the suddenly kong appears and you have really dramatic music. The next problem is, that Brie Larson's character has not got a personality. The only two characters that are interestingly written are Samuel l jackson's and John C. Reilly's characters, although John C. Reilly's character has also some needless comic relief scenes. All in all the pacing of this movie is great and despite of the weak plot, it is enjoyable."
"austinfromdahood","5","1","1","2 March 2019"," If the director made a few changes this movie would've been great
","The Godzilla vs Kong movie is coming up soon, and in anticipation I'm going to review Kong: Skull Island. This movie blew my mind when I first saw it, but watching it recently, it doesn't hold up. It is a movie that could've been great if there weren't so many flaws that could've been fixed easily.<br/><br/>Kong Skull Island has a lot of great actors in the movie. Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Reilly and John Goodman star in this film. They are all good in this movie, but they are so bland characters that you can't really rune for. These characters are just people that run away from kong and that's about it. They are blank slates that aren't interesting at all and even if they have good acting, their blandness makes that trait much weaker. There are some very dumb moments that could've been taken out of the film, and some scenes happen and they don't make much sense in terms of how that scene happened. There is also a lot of obvious cgi in the movie and some scenes look very artificial.<br/><br/>The action sequences in this movie are very entertaining and are a big redeeming factor in this movie. King Kong looks like a beast in this movie and so do all the other monsters in this movie. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is watchable and disposable. Dan Gilroy wrote the screenplay for this movie with a bunch of less talented writers, and if it was just Dan Gilroy writing the screenplay for this movie, I'd be okay with that. Middle school Austin really liked this movie, but 9th grade Austin thought this movie was just meh. If they just gave the main characters some backstory with some interest, and if the stupid plot points were removed, this film would've been way more entertaining. I'd give this movie a 5/10."
"samuelrcgerrard","7","1","1","12 February 2019"," Entertaining and enjoyable!!!!
","Overall, this is a good movie. It is a fast paced, enjoyable action movie with fantastic visuals and an absolutely awesome soundtrack. Samuel L Jackson was the perfect choice for Colonel Packard and John C Reilly also gives a great, convincing performance. However, there are couple of points where Kong: Skull Island does not hit the mark of it's 2005 predecessor. Tom Hiddleston's performance is painfully boring and Brie Larson doesn't have much to offer either. I accept that these are both great actors, but, these performances are really forgettable. Also, over the course of the movie, the audience doesn't build any emotional connection or sympathy with Kong. That was one of the 2005 film's most defining aspects. However, overall, these negatives are insignificant when you are presented with a visually stunning fight between King Kong and a viscous skeletal lizard monster! This is deeply enjoyable film that entertains me every time I watch it.<br/><br/>On the verge of greatness!!"
"a_chinn","7","1","1","20 August 2018"," Unabashed popcorn film is enjoyably unpretentious entertainment (Kong smashed real good)
","And unabashed popcorn film, with no deeper meaning or subtext, is delightfully endearing in it's simple (although big budget) adventure story. Set during the waining day of the Vietnam War, John Goodman plays a government agent specializing in the strange and mysterious has discovered an uncharted island and convinces his superiors to give him a detail of soldiers from Vietnam to help him explore the titular island. That island is full to giants monster, mysterious natives, and also a WWII pilot who was shot down 25 years ago and doesn't know the war is over. John C. Reilly really steals the movie as the WWII solider marooned on Skull Island, but he does have competition from Samuel L. Jackson as the commanding officer leading the US soldiers helping Goodman, British airman Tom Hiddleston, and photojournalist Brie Larson. The action is fun, the characters are likable, and Kong smashes things real good. Beside John C. Reilly being awesome, the next most interesting element to the film is that it was set during the Vietnam War and treats the era with a rather light touch and not the usual downbeat tone that typically surrounds Vietnam set war films, which is something I cannot recall seeing in any other major film before (unless you want to count John Wayne's ""The Green Berets""). Throughout the 70s and 80s, most every Vietnam war film was pretty heavy, and even the ones with a lighter touch, like ""The Boys in Company C"" or ""Good Morning, Vietnam,"" still made sure the audience was aware that this was a terrible and horrific war. The version of Vietnam depicted in ""Kong: Skull Island"" has the costumes, musics, and all the other trappings of just about every other memorable Vietnam film you can think of (from ""Apocalypse Now"" to ""Born on the Fourth of July""), but it kind of just blew my mind out uncomplicated this war was presented. World War II has seen a lot of entertaining sci-fi and horror mash-ups, from Michael Mann's ""The Keep"" to Disney's ""Bedknobs & Broomsticks"" as well as lesser underrated films like ""The Final Countdown"" or ""Zone Troopers."" There are so many of this sort of film that there's even an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to it. As for Vietnam, I think filmmakers stayed away from making light of that war because it was such a damaging war to our nation, not just politically and militarily, but culturally. Seeing the Vietnam War portrayed so differently in a blockbuster summer popcorn film made me realize that maybe we've reached a point in history where we've put enough distance between ourselves and that nearly 50-year old war, with three generations (Gen-X, Millenials, and Generation Z) who did not grow up with this war being part of their lives. It reminds me of the old Mark Twain quote, ""Humor is tragedy plus time."" For better or for worst, enough time must have passed now for Vietnam to now be fun. But I digress. Now Kong smashes things real good, fighting giant snakes and all sorts of other made up creatures. The CGI effects are excellent, but I'm a grouchy old man about CGI effects. I really want my giant movie monsters to either be men in monster suits crushing miniature sets or to be stop-motion animation. Computer generated animation takes me out of films and might as well be cartoon animation as far as I'm concerned. CGI works for backgrounds and explosions, but it doesn't work for for living people, animals, or creatures. Still, despite my annoyances with Hollywood's overuse of CGI, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is pretty fun for a number of reasons, but primarily because of it's excellent cast and it's unpretentiously fun action and adventure, which comes off as a nice old fashioned adventure yarn, which is exactly what you need in a retelling of classic monster movie."

","This is one of my favorite Monster movies, This was a true and proper good Monster movie. no more no less. A lot of the complaints for this movie of other people were of the story or the weak characters, but I dont think some people understood what this movie was trying to do, This movie felt like the old black and white Monster movies that used to be made. 
For me the point of the movie was the monsters and the monster action. The designs of the creatures was pretty incredible, all the creatures in this movie were very very cool to see, their size and the detail made on them was really nice to see. 
the Island felt like a great place, felt scary but beautiful. And Kong was just amazing to see, This kong was a lot cooler than the Kong from Jackson's movie. and this movie was a lot more entertaining and engaging. 
I Did like the human characters a lot as well. John C Reily was the greatest thing about the movie, the funniest and most interesting character. He was my favorite character. I really loved Brie Larson and I really liked Tom as well.

"Jona1988","7","1","1","30 March 2018"," One of 2017 most entertaining movies!
","I had no interest in another King Kong movie. Peter Jackson's 2005 remake was a boring rehash. When I first heard there was coming another I was like well they have to drag the franchise out for another try. Several big actors were to be in it but I had never heard of the director. But then the trailer and marketing for it started coming and it looked quite interesting and also and maybe especially it looked different. So eventually I actually went to the cinema to see Kong: Skull Island. Luckily that I did because this is really a movie which should be seen in the cinema.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is the definition of a popcorn movie. Where the 2005 movie was drawn out and almost pretentious this movie wastes no time to get to the action and adventure. The action is outstanding in entertainment. Obviously there is a lot of cgi. However I'm not against computer made effects just for no reason. Some things are hard to do in other ways and as long as it doesn't feel like it's used for laziness sake it's fine. And in this movie it works fine. The action in this movie was among the most exciting I saw last year. Some complained about the characters being thin and while that criticism does have a point I don't think it matters much here. This is a fun action adventure that doesn't need deeply developed characters. They are not what's important. They are just enough for this type of movie. And the performances are good. Samuel L Jackson is the bad*** that he always is and does so well, Tom Hiddleston gives us a glimpse that he could definitely play James Bond, Brie Larson works well with what she's got even if it's not a lot. The best is John C. Reilly, his character is the most interesting and performance the most entertaining. Simple they may be but they do all have some distinct personality. Minor complaints are that many of the quotes that are meant as jokes don't land but for me it wasn't a big issue, the movie is funnier in other ways. Like previously stated I knew nothing about the director who it turns out had only directed one other movie but he totally nailed this one. He gets great performances even if the script probably didn't give much to work with. I love the look of the movie, the style it's done in. The shots of helicopters flying over the island and Kong silhouette against the sun. It could have taken this grim and gloomy look which I'm so glad it didn't. Another thing is the music, while there is tunes that are written for it the movie uses a lot of songs from the era when it is set which works perfectly. Having a lot of well known songs can work greatly in the right kind of movie but not all. <br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island was one of the most surprisingly good movies in 2017. A movie that knows what it is and embraces it. It's campy and over the top and I like it. No one would claim it to be any amazing piece of work but I believe the filmmakers totally know it and all for the better. I have seen a lot of 2017 movies and Kong: Skull Island was while definitely not the best but one of the most thoroughly entertaining. See Kong: Skull Island if you haven't already. I have several times."
"tiernanstevenson","7","1","1","29 March 2018"," Fun dumb action movie
","It's a big dumb action movie that knows what it is and sticks to it. It noticed that the 2003 King Kong was too slow so it doesn't stop for a second.

"Reno-Rangan","6","1","1","4 November 2017"," A new dawn. The King has arrived.
","Seems I'm the only one who did not know it was not a sequel to the 2005 film. The Kong was over a 100 feet tall in this, compared to 25 feet from a decade ago. Being a big fan of that film and Peter Jackson, I hated this idea, especially for totally a fresh cast and crew. So I was not expecting it. Only while watching it, I came to know it was a new version. With a new cinematic, a new set of actors, timeline, completely a different kind of tone for a King Kong film that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>They wanted it to be a badass action film than a value added storyline. That does not mean I loved it. It was average. I only enjoyed the nice action-adventures. But the visuals were a more commercialised. I even confused whether did I watched a Hollywood film or an Rajamouli film. You know those terrible methods used for stunt sequences.<br/><br/>The most boring part of this film was the same old formula, which is a set of people enter in a dangerous enclosure and only a few come back alive. A couple of scientist escorted by a military to a mystery island hidden in the mists of the South Pacific to do some scientific research. Soon they come to realise they are in a dangerous place where giant monsters live. After losing some of the soldiers, now it becomes a survival game. But the general is obsessed with a revenge. How the rest of the story folds were told with a battle of the film.<br/><br/>Basically, this film was created to merge two franchises, the rebooted 'Godzilla' with this one. The post end-credit scene gave some important hint about the future of the franchise. But I thought it was too similar to the comedy flick, 'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island'. Usually spoof films were made out of greatest hit films. But it looks like here a reverse case. Though all the actors were good. Nice direction, visuals, music, particularly the sound effects. This film is simply enjoyable and forgettable.<br/><br/>There are many things I did not like. The Peter Jackson film was so artistic. Every frame was like a classic painting. In this, the Kong standing on his two feet, walking around like a man, totally turned me off. The giant ape did not behave like a real ape. Many sequences were also borrowed from many other films, only replaced with different creatures and recreated with a fresh setting. This is a perfect time pass film to have on a weekend. Particularly, if you are a graphile (graphic+phile), you would have a nice time.<br/><br/>5.5/10"
"jrarichards","8","1","1","21 October 2017"," Enigmatic take on the subject, done with some style
","As with the recent ""Mummy""-genre reboots, Jordan Vogt-Roberts's ""Kong: Skull Island"" obviously has a number of ""King Kong"" predecessors (even extending to the rival ""Mighty Joe Young"" - also out in two versions). <br/><br/>In each of these, the theme of the monumental, potentially-aggressive simian possessed of a conscience, capable of love (even lust) for human females and attacked by an actually-even-more-merciless human species looms large. The 2017 work is no exception, but here the (really) great ape takes more of a back seat than we've ever seen before. Somewhat surprising, given that this is theoretically the hero of the movie! <br/><br/>Ultimately, those electing to watch a ""Kong"" movie do so to imagine an unknown world of wonder still present on our own planet (a la ""Lost World"" or even ""Jurassic Park""), so atmosphere is everything. The idea that Kong is lord of all he surveys, lives alongside somewhat cowed - indeed often terrified (but also at times terrifying) - people who worship him and enjoy his protection are further aspects.<br/><br/>In this instalment (which juggles with all of the above staples, but modifies the balance between them), we have (I think cleverly) moved forward from the early part of the 20th century to the 70s - and hence to the end of the Vietnam War and to the beginning of remote sensing by satellite. Any more-recent reference to lost worlds on our planet would stretch credibility too far, but the 1970s idea works well.<br/><br/>The film has a very strong 'Nam vibe, but also one connected with World War II and the parallels and differences between the two. This is a great success, and indeed the film from the opening sequences (cleverly including speeches from successive US Presidents) through to the arrival at the titular ""Skull Island"" are to my mind exceptionally atmospheric and good. The build-up of tension is palpable, but the military and military-civilian authenticity also wins the viewer over. The same could be said of the moving closing sequence (leaving aside the final, post-film sequence leading us on to the ""thrilling"" next film).<br/><br/>The island itself looks breathtaking, and really and truly filmed in Vietnam, which is a beautiful aspect of the film in and of itself. The wider-ecosystem portrayal here has a touch of class (not least in a sequence that sees helicopter and dragonfly nicely juxtaposed). But dragonflies are the least of our worries as the fauna here is an eclectic mix of giant beasts from past, present and the wilder imagination of the makers. Ecology and animal-behaviour considerations are not absent, though, as there's competition, camouflage and new imagined ecological niches on show. It's quite creepy at times (though cannot top the Jack Black/Adrien Brody film of 2005), and, needless to say, all of these living things are after our interloper-Americans from both the military and big business and the American state (as played, inter alia, by a gorgeous and sympathy-inducing Brie Larson, a sadly-somewhat-absent John Goodman, and a slightly-crazed Samuel L. Jackson - doing his thing as well as ever). There's also a token Brit (actually in many ways the star of the piece) in the shape of SAS-man Captain James Conrad (well-enough portrayed by Tom Hiddleston).<br/><br/>When animal fights human it's impressive (and at times very fast-moving indeed), and there's ultimately also a rather convincing-looking Kong-versus-reptile scene in the arena of a valley surrounded by hills that harks right back to the original ""King Kong"". Kong is again a man in a gorilla suit, and there's no getting away from that fact - hence perhaps the desire to keep Kong a bit in the background for much of the movie? <br/><br/>Overall, the somewhat-untidy effect is for several themes and aims of the movie to be slightly cobbled together. Occasionally it seems underwhelming or over-familiar, but I say this as someone who has 5 decades behind him. Those coming to this kind of thing for the first time will have far added value.<br/><br/>In any case, there are at least some things about ""Skull Island"" that are really praiseworthy, while the rest of the movie more-or-less does the job as intended. An interesting-looking sequel seems to be in the offing as well."

","Some reviews here are spot on regarding the flaws of this movie: the first encounter with Kong and the helicopter detail was toe-curling bad. As if war-seasoned helicopter pilots would fly bluntly and willingly into their end. Ridiculous start of the movie and I almost stopped the movie. However, since I like monster movies I decided to keep watching. It wasn't as bad as ""The Giant Spider"" (which is very overrated) but the story line/plot line is terrible and lacks any form of coherence or suspense build-up. On the other hand, I liked the variety of monsters and the interaction of Kong with the ""good guys"". Given the story line there will certainly a Kong part II or other ""monster chasing spin-off"". If you like monster movies and fantasy and don't expect a top movie (given the cast) then watch this movie (and sit out the ridiculous introduction with Kong trashing the helicopters)."
"guyzradio","5","1","1","23 August 2017"," Mindless but entertaining
","Sometimes, you have to lower your expectations, or just abandon them. Kong: Skull Island is an example. More or less, Kong movies have been remakes along the original theme. In this re-imagined twist, Kong stays on the island, goes ape on helicopters and local creatures alike, and doesn't get the girl. There are liberal helpings of supposedly smart people undone by their own bad decisions and twisted logic. Music and 'copter shots are obvious homages to Apocalypse Now. Anachronisms, bad science, and violations of the laws of physics abound. Most CG seems pretty good, although the water buffalo creature moves like a puppet on strings. Nothing stands out as a redeeming quality, but neither would I run out and warn all my fiends to never see this flick. We've all watched movies we'd categorize as an OK way to blow a couple of hours. Just OK. Somewhere in this less than perfect execution, there is a story line and a heavy-handed moral or two. Don't expect too much and enjoy the photography."

","This is the second movie of the already confirmed ""Monster-verse"", which has Godzilla as the first film (so we can probably have a Kong v Godzilla in a near future ...) which I actually enjoyed. Kong: Skull Island however ... Well, let me point the good stuff first.<br/><br/>The monsters are amazing, not only Kong, but the creatures of this island are beautiful to look at. The fights between Kong and the other monsters are thrilling, extremely well-shot and super entertaining. The detail that goes into those scenes are incredible and I'm sure I'll rewatch them as soon as I can.<br/><br/>However, that's about the only good stuff about the film. The amazing visual quality that portrays the creatures doesn't really show in the rest of the runtime. There are scenes which have a surprisingly horrible and OBVIOUS green-screen and that affected me throughout the film because it wasn't just a single mistake ... There are a bunch of them.<br/><br/>The real problem is the characters. I can't believe that they were able to screw that up with such a top-level cast. Everyone is bland, with no character development whatsoever and they're just there so Kong can play with them and eventually kill them. With the exceptions of Samuel L. Jackson's and John. C. Reilly's characters, I didn't care for any of the protagonists. Each character has ONE scene (and I'm being generous) to tell us why should we care about them and, even if one or two are able to have it, it's not enough.<br/><br/>The script is lazy and just bad. The exposition scenes are constant and even then, the writing doesn't help. With a story with such a simple and good premise plus some interesting sub-plots during the second act, the screenplay ruined the whole thing and what could've been a great movie easily became a ... Meh.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is packed with amazing monsters' fights, a beautiful CGI Kong and well-shot action scenes. However, the bland characters, the lazy script, full of exposition scenes and a surprisingly amount of just bad green-screen throughout the whole film drags what could've been a great blockbuster and turned it into a disappointment.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"Antagonisten","7","1","1","5 August 2017"," Best monster movie I've seen in a long time
","Monster movies are a genre of their own, and common rules don't apply. Plots need to follow certain formulas and the drama is always somewhat predictable. I haven't always been a fan of the genre, not least because there are a lot of big-budget stinkers in the past. This is not one of them.<br/><br/>First of all, breaking the standard plot for a King Kong-movie helps. Another straight remake like the one from Peter Jackson would have been unbearable. Adding a lot of well-known and well-performing actors also help. Of course the movie is packed with special effects, and yet I'm not really bothered by them the way that I often am. Not that they are very life-like or believable, but they are done with a certain flair. Also, the ape itself is just the right amount of human.<br/><br/>When it comes to popcorn-movies, this is the real deal. Running a very reasonable two hours (instead of the insane three hours these movies tend to run), I was never bored. Good entertainment."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","1","31 July 2017"," ""Skull Island"" claims Kong for blockbuster, chaos-seeking moviegoers
","King Kong holds the honor of being among Hollywood's first movie monsters, but ""monster"" has never been as relevant a label for the colossal ape as it is for his latest incarnation in ""Kong: Skull Island."" Whereas most people think of Kong as a misunderstood beast who falls for the beautiful Anne Darrow, in this film he possesses those instincts, but he's also an easy-to-anger killing machine.<br/><br/>Despite the character's history in films with action elements but more poetic flourishes, ""Skull Island"" works to build Kong into an action hero capable of raking in blockbuster-level cash. The story and screenplay, which represents the combined work of John Gatins and Dan Giloy (""Real Steel""), Derek Connolly (""Jurassic World"") and Max Borenstein (whose ""Godzilla"" launched this monster universe for Warner Bros) does not completely strip Kong of his humanity, but he's a relentless force of nature in a film that pushes the boundaries of PG-13 violence.<br/><br/>These writers have structured the story as a '90s monster movie: an expedition team including a researcher (John Goodman), geologist (Corey Hawkins), wilderness guide (Tom Hiddleston), photographer (Brie Larson) and a platoon of disappointed Vietnam vets (led by Samuel L. Jackson) fly through a storm to the mysterious Skull Island, where they're greeted by angry ape and encounter countless other larger-than-life creatures bent on killing/eating them.<br/><br/>Though he be new to the big-budget filmmaking game, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts (""The Kings of Summer"") takes this solidly written albeit predictable story and does just enough stylistically to keep us on our toes the entire time. Once it becomes clear that characters' lives are not sacred in this movie, the thrill becomes waiting to see what unexpected and frankly shocking ways the story (and Vogt-Roberts) will remove them. Vogt-Roberts seems particularly adept at finding a balance between brutal/visceral violence and leaving some of that up to the imagination for full effect. He applies non-traditional angles and refreshing perspectives that ""Skull Island' gravitates between B- movie thrills and creative action filmmaking.<br/><br/>The story leans on some classic archetypes that do enough to fuel the story in thoughtful ways. The characters get more interesting when John C. Reilly's Hank Marlow enters. Marlow is a World War II pilot who has been trapped on the island for 30 years and helps explain to the other characters that Kong is the good guy and a key cog in the island's ecosystem; he's the only one who can kill the island's giant man- eating lizards. This information leads to a schism: half the group wants to kill Kong and the others want to save him – familiar but effective.<br/><br/>Goodman, Hiddleston and Larson are obviously all too good for this movie, but ""Skull Island"" is better for them. And absolutely nothing is surprising about Jackon's involvement or role, and that's its own kind of legitimacy. His Preston Packard character actually has the most complexity, whereas Hiddleston and Larson serve to make their two-dimensional characters appear to be deep and interesting, which they do well enough. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the characters provide an assortment of victims and heroes for a ruthless jungle-set monster movie. Those with a thirst for that kind of mayhem will find ""Skull Island"" a gleeful adventure, but those looking to be moved -- or heaven forbid show it to their kids in hopes of a family-friendly outing – are bound to encounter disappointment if not outrage. <br/><br/>""Skull Island"" reclaims King Kong's fearsome, creature-crushing side in glorious fashion, though it pretty exclusively plays to those tastes.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"bob the moo","Null","1","1","30 July 2017"," Enjoyably distracting monster movie
","Looking back at old movies, the effects date quickly and they become rather cheesy in their simple pleasures. Someday I will do that with this film, because essentially it is a creature feature, albeit one that happens to be being delivered with the biggest stars, biggest budget, and state-of-the-art effects. And the thing is, despite all this superficial polish, the film is essentially big monsters and spectacle.<br/><br/>On this front it is enjoyable though; it has plenty of action, lots to look at, and a reasonably successful mix of humor and drama. I say reasonably, because the plot isn't up to much, and different characters seem to be in different films depending on who they are. This is matched by the performances which range from the silly fun (Reilly) to the stupidly OTT (Jackson) to the starry but bland (Hiddleston, Larson); the film doesn't seem to have a handle on what it wants to do, and the mix that it produces is not always successful, and it relies on big moments of action and noise to try and cover it. Perhaps at some point there was some smart commentary about US foreign policy in there, but that is lost in the mix too.<br/><br/>Still, it works as a monster movie with great effects and lots of polish, so enjoy it for that even if there is not too much beyond that."
"TxMike","Null","1","1","30 July 2017"," Not exactly a ""remake"", but contains much of the premise of finding Kong.
","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay, and of course the picture and sound are flawless. Not only the direct sound and the ample surround sounds, but also great use of a deep bass subwoofer track. Saw it again October 2018 and enjoyed it as much the second time.<br/><br/>This Kong movie deviates quite far from the 1933 ""King Kong"" which culminates in Manhattan with Kong climbing the Empire State building. In this version modern (1973) satellite images discover a previously unknown island, they called it Skull Island. A small group of explorers convince a Senator to fund a trip so that a competing country doesn't get there before a USA expedition.<br/><br/>The mission includes military men and Army helicopters and their first encounter with this giant of an ape doesn't go very well. With all helicopters downed and many killed, those on the ground must find a way to get to a prearranged rescue spot on the north side of the island.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad was recruited for his fighting skills. Samuel L. Jackson is the hard-nosed officer Preston Packard. Pretty Brie Larson is in the movie as eye candy, as experienced correspondent photographer Mason Weaver. She was using an authentic period Leica camera and really was taking photos during filming.<br/><br/>As they are moving through the forest of the island they encounter John C. Reilly as Hank Marlow, a soldier who had been on the island for 28 years, since WW2, and knew nothing about the outside world but became their key to escape the island.<br/><br/>There are many battles with giant prehistoric beasts of various sorts that have survived on the island, Kong actually is the one who keeps them in check, keeps them from overcoming the world. It was filmed in some really exotic, beautiful areas of Vietnam.<br/><br/>An interesting and entertaining take on the Kong story."

"CarterCats","9","1","1","26 July 2017"," An enjoyable and easy to follow watch
","An enjoyable, easy-to-follow and exciting film. From the very beginning, it was easy to understand the plot and not too complicated, there were many surprises (which is always good) and twists. Maybe Samuel L.Jacksons character is too abrasive and may I say, American? (Quote ""die, motherf*cker"") For once, there was no subplot of lazy and unneeded romance. They're fighting a gorilla, not looking for love. Many of the character deaths were either a yes or a no. I think we all saw Billy's father dying from that first letter, some emotional heartfelt letter to the family he'll never see again. Although, you could tell that a character was simply saved from the first dramatic helicopter conflict, just to die later on from being impaled by a spider or burnt alive. The characters were well-written although a little more background and screen-time would've be helpful and made each and every one of them more interesting and likable. For example, some delving into Weaver, the photographer, would've helped the audience understand why she chose a geological mission over the Time cover. She also seems a little silent, when reaching out to touch a 10 foot gorilla, there are no words spoken. Yes, she is speechless, but after more contact with the gorilla, still, nothing. We should learn more of each army man, from the young, confused boy wanting to go home to the best friend of Chapman, who takes the letters and presumably gives them to Billy, or the mysterious leader, picked from a bunch, who is this Conrad and why? If there is a sequel, some character info would be necessary to make it a worthwhile watch. Although, I did appreciate the CGI and effects. The scenery was always very pretty with the added neon gasses that floated about, creating some kind of 70s effect in a 21st century film based in the 70s. I like it."
"nogodnomasters","10","1","1","23 July 2017"," That was an unconventional encounter
","This film takes place in the early 1970's complete with era music. John Goodman revives his role from ""Cloverfield 10"" as an alternate reality type of guy. He convinces a senator to give his expedition backing and a military escort to the recently discovered Skull Island, before the Russians get there. He is aided by tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and a military escort lead by Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson). Brie Larson tags along as a photographer and contrast to other Kong film leading ladies.<br/><br/>This film is not a beauty and the beast film as was the original. The island is an opening to an underworld with prehistoric animals as you soon find out. The film does include the expected cage match between Kong and the uglier Samuel L. Jackson. Set in the Vietnam withdraw era, there is a universal theme associated with the film of ""cut and run"" vs invading someone's home. Jackson provides us with typical Jackson lines without the swearing, such as ""I am the cavalry"" a watered down version of what I would normally expect. In fact I thought there was going to be no swearing in the film until the likable John C. Reilly slips a fast one near the end...""big effing ants."" Good film to relax the brain and break out the popcorn. No need to think about non-linear time and what happens inside a black hole.<br/><br/>Guide: No sex or nudity. 1 F-word."

Which this was to some extent, but they did break away from the mold a noticeable amount. Which is a big part of what made it tolerable where others are not I had fun watching this movie. I thought it was pretty well done. By far the best King Kong since the old B&W version from 1933. The CGI was mostly plausible. Only a couple of moments of broken physics. The characters where about as well developed as they needed to be. Plot was pretty hole free.<br/><br/>Its not 10/10 stuff, but its not trying to be either. They got this one just right.<br/><br/>Normally I couldn't watch something in this genre all the way to the end.

","This is a version of Kong that some people wanted and some others didn't. I knew before watching it that i was going to be your typical summer blockbuster and I was so hyped to see it, we haven't had a Kong film since 2005. I was kind of disappointed, but not a lot since I put low expectations into it. <br/><br/>Right off the bat, the fact that no one knew this planet existed is BS, I don't care how they try to explain it, it's just not plausible, it seemed juvenile. There was also some dumb things that the soldiers did that I couldn't understand. Like turning around Kong with their helicopters until each one of them falls. Are they this stupid ? Can't they just fly higher, or further than Kong's wingspan ? After they all crash, they also decide to go for the weapon supply, ON FOOT. Seriously ? Another dumb thing I want to address but I didn't see anyone mentioning it was the fact that the "" Big one "" was able to know that the guy holding the frags was a trap but Kong couldn't know that Preston Peckard (Samuel L Jackson) was setting a trap on him, which was pretty obvious. That means that the directors think that the "" Big one "" is smarter than Kong. Nice joke. <br/><br/>But as I said, that was to be expected from this kind of film. A lot of fans wanted explosions and a lot of creatures (I also wanted to see a lot of variety in the eco-system, but the species they used are so unrealistic and bad. Peter Jackson's species were much better) and Kong destroying everything : they got what they wanted. <br/><br/>Now is this movie good ? It was entertaining, that is for sure. But it wasn't as deep and no way near as memorable as some other Kong movies (notice I only said SOME, not all). It seemed like the directors were limited because they needed to make sure it would be a good prequel to Godzilla vs Kong. I don't like this. A standalone Kong movie that has nothing do with the upcoming movie would have been better. Final Verdict : Good Blockbuster movie with some flaws : 7/10."

","Gimme a 'K'; gimme an 'O' gimme an 'N', 'G'.........well half a chant is better than no chant at all. This is not the case with movies. We went based on reviews, primarily the ABC brekkie show. Thanks for that, ABC brekkie reviewer guy. <br/><br/>The story is set at the end of the Vietnam War. Satellites have found an island that generates it's own weather and has therefore remained obscured from prying eyes.<br/><br/>It is called Skull Island but I don't know why unless someone had identified it as such in a Rorschach test. Me? I thought it looked a bit like a blood eagle. In my defence I've been watching 'Vikings'.<br/><br/>The Americans put together a team to go and drop bombs on the island. No surprises there. The team is headed by Sammy Jackson, who is so devoid of compassion that he'd happily groom kiddies for a lifetime gambling addiction resulting in abject poverty and eventual suicide by advertising an online betting site.<br/><br/>He has a team of hard-as-nails cavalry-helicopter types and he recruits The Night Manager to take this hard-as-nailness to the next level. He's an expert tracker although why you'd need an expert tracker to find a 90 foot ape is beyond me. He isn't even a very good tracker and at one stage loses the river they were following. In any case the Kongster isn't very good at hiding.<br/><br/>It starts off OK after the 'how we got here' preamble. An apocalypse of helicopters flies to the island and starts dropping their bombs. Kong doesn't take kindly to his island being Cambodianised and decides that the helicopters need swatting and swat like a crazy thing he does. He is a fine swatter! There is death and destruction. Paranoid, the Sabbath classic, is an excellent choice to accompany the swatting.<br/><br/>Inevitably, and somewhat sadly, there are survivors. And these survivors headed by Jacko swear vengeance upon the copter-swatter. Jacko loves war and killing stuff. He is an American. He is a hunter. But Kong is no Bambi.......<br/><br/>There are giant lizards and they do sterling work in thinning out the cast. There is a tribe of mutes, a WWII survivor and lots of miscellany who don't seem to have a reason for being there at all before (mostly) joining the ranks of the thinned. There are lizard birds too. They are unlikely to be first choice as pets, or kiddie-playmates.<br/><br/>Kong is shot and napalmed and has a death match with the mother of all lizards. Yes, echoes of 'The Great Wall'. Me? I'd like to see a haircut death match between the Trumpster and Kim Jong-un. Then I'd like to see Sean Spicer report it. Such are the dreams of ordinary men.....<br/><br/>The music is pretty good and we knew most of it. We got to meet Kong's parents. Well sort of.<br/><br/>Without wanting to ruin it for folk, a sequel is likely. We are unlikely to waste a Seniors Discount on it.<br/><br/>If your tastes run to death-and-destruction jungle movies with monsters, 'Predator' is a better choice. Even when he was being napalmed and shot and being bit by a ginormous lizard we didn't care very much. There were no sighs of 'poor Kong'. No moist eyes. Just a feeling of satisfaction that my bladder was not quite full when it ended.<br/><br/>On a par with 'The Great Wall'. Better than 'Interstellar'."

Here we have a super sized King Kong, a walking thing the size of a sky scrapper, the biggest Kong, I have seen, he would have put a Blue Whale which can grow to 110 feet and apparently the biggest living creature the world has ever seen to shame in the size stakes, smashing helicopters out of the sky, knocking the crap out of a small army special forces soldiers at the near beginning of the movie. A B grade monster movie with an uncountable amount of humans being killed and gored by monsters ranging from dinosaur like creatures to giant ants made on a mega budget with cardboard actors and characters. It seems Hollywood is churning out more of the ""bigger is better"" type movies when a lot of them are not better but stink like offal like this movie does. I would like the movie moguls in Hollywood to make more sensible movies with realistic plots instead of these quick cash grab mega churners, this is a movie made to make a quick grab of the money cashing in on ""larger than the Universe"" type monsters, it's about as stupid as Superman flying around in outer space with his cape blowing and breathing air when there is no air in space..it's a vacuum...so is this movie, a vacuum for your mind.

","I was ecstatic 12 years ago when Peter Jackson revived the King Kong franchise with his remake. A feeling, sadly, that quickly faded and left me with a bad taste in my mouth upon actually viewing the film. A three hour movie about a giant ape and more than an hour and a half in you still haven't seen said ape?! Grrr. So, it was with muted expectations, fingers crossed, hoping for the best and fearing the worse I ventured to check out Jordan Vogt-Roberts latest installment of Kong.<br/><br/>Boy am I glad I did. Everything I hated about the last Kong movie starting with being halfway through the film and still not having a Kong sighting has been addressed and how. Vogt-Roberts and company waste no time setting up and getting to the crux of the story. Namely, Kong. After all, that's what made me want to see the movie.<br/><br/>And Kong: Skull Island is quite the movie. Part Apocalypse Now, part Heart of Darkness with a dash of Moby Dick beautifully blended with an A rate movie version of the classic B rated monster movie, Kong thrills, entertains, wows, and triumphs.<br/><br/>The star studded cast lead by the incomparable Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, and John C. Reilly, Brie Larson, and Tom Hiddleston ground this well written fantasy in reality and keep it riveting. While set in the past, this Kong is fresh and current. The characters are more than mere backdrops for the beast and are nuanced and three dimensional.<br/><br/>The directing and cinematography is beautiful. The music on point and serves the story well. The action and CGI work is stellar. CGI Kong is such a far cry from the slow, lumbering Kong of the past. The subtle expressions and emotions are and additional layer of delight.<br/><br/>Have a couple of hours? Take a trip to Skull Island, you won't be disappointed. I'm giving Kong a solid 9 so don't miss it on the big screen. Also, make sure you stay through the credits. Yes, after the complete credit roll things go to black for a few seconds, then more is revealed."
"JamiroBontes","5","4","9","12 March 2017"," Pretty disappointing
","It is a shame that Kong Skull Island is not even okay. The movie starts with John Goodman who want to go to this place called Skull Island. The person he asks it to doesn't want him to go at first but 2 minutes later after John ask 1 more time he suddenly does it without a good reason so that's why they go.<br/><br/>The special effects look sometimes really good and sometimes really really bad. The movie doesn't focus on Kong all that much. Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are the two leading actors I would say, the acting is decent but these characters are really paper thin. If you're characters aren't that good just make the movie about Kong and not these characters we don't care about.<br/><br/>Kong Skull Island is a pretty bad movie and I am sad to say so because I really looked forward to this movie. What a shame."

","Quite a few issues I had with it, but overall I enjoyed it. LOVED the shots, the imagery, cgi for the creatures and Kong. Sam L. Jackson and John C. are American treasures. Enjoyed most of the characters, surprisingly except for Loki and Captain Marvel. Really took me out of it at times, those two. No spoilers but I love who we discover who the true antagonist is. Also, don't leave. In classic Marvel fashion, post- credits scene, DO NOT LEAVE. The editing - really annoyed me as well. And the humor. Jackson and John C. both had only one moment that made me actually laugh, and I feel like both lines they delivered were ad libbed. The many many slow-mo action shots got under my skin as well. I noticed this film also borrowed a few shots, classic pieces of imagery from Jurassic Park. The many many slow-mo action shots got under my skin as well. The bad writing and line delivery, and Hiddleston, Kebbel, and Larson's characters were just bad."

To be honest, I didn't feel anyone was a standout performance but they were all notable and entertaining. If I could choose any standouts it would be John C.

"RLTerry1","7","4","9","10 March 2017"," Full body KONG with just a hint of story
","""Hold onto your butts;"" Warner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment's KONG: Skull Island is full body KONG with just a hint of story. Wait. Isn't that a line from Jurassic Park??? Sure is. And guess who delivers it? None other than Samuel L. Jackson himself--reprising his famous line from one of the most iconic films in the American cinema library. It's rather fitting since there are many shared elements between KONG and the Jurassic Park franchise. Both take place on an island and deal with science vs. nature and pit man against ancient creatures. King Kong is no stranger to most people, considering he's been a fixture in the cinema and theme park universes respectively for many decades. From silver screen to Universal Studios, he remains an icon to which few ""monster"" movies compare. Although the previous KONG films followed a very similar narrative, this newest incarnation of the king of Skull Island takes a modified route to the classic story. It shares many of the same elements or themes with its predecessors, but through the echoes of the past comes a reimagined story. Diegetically, the film certainly suffers; furthermore, it attempts to integrate social commentary on war, Captain Ahab allegory, and conservation, but none of those themes are effectively carried out. Due to the enormous ""King Kong"" sized cast, there lacks any real connection to any of the characters and development is certainly obscure, if any at all. Films such as this one can sometimes run into the danger of waxing nostalgic too often and forgetting that audiences want a new movie (i.e. Star Wars: the Force Awakens); and like the aforementioned, Jordan Vogt-Roberts' KONG: Skull Island provides audiences with connections to past King Kong movies in a new approach, but ultimately crafts generic experience.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this movie accomplishes what it set out to do: revive Kong, thrill people for a couple hours, and setup KONG v. Godzilla. Action-adventure films are typically not expected to contain brilliant writing, character development, and strategically placed themed and subtext. What I respect about this movie is that is unashamedly pretends not to be anything other than a larger than life adventure centered around one of cinema's most iconic ""monsters."" Clearly, there are attempts in the movie to include some deeper themes such as anti-war, nature/conservation, and even a little Moby Dick; but those themes appear to have been great thoughts that were not fully executed. That being said, there is clearly a Captain Ahab figure in the film and there are many similarities between King Kong and Moby Dick--size just being one of them. For fans of Jurassic Park you'll appreciate not only Jackson's ""hold onto your butts"" line at the beginning of the film, but also several similar scenes, camera angels, and even the helicopter entry onto the island. Lots of nostalgia, but not so much that it feels like you've seen it all before.<br/><br/>In many ways, Kong is bigger than ever, but hardly better than previous Kong films. Ironically, this same thing can be said about the former Kongfrontation attraction at Universal Studios Florida. Much like the new attraction Skull Island: Reign of Kong at Universal feels far more generic than its predecessor, today's Kong lacks the magic and innovation that the original Kong did in 1933. Despite an attempt to successfully launch a series of ""creature features,"" the script and human characters certainly suffer. Little can be said about the dialog except that occasionally there are lines that move the story along instead of stating the obvious or predictable. The dialog is cumbersome and never seems to remain focused very long. Of course, that is hard to do considering that Kong boasts an extremely large ensemble cast. At the forefront of the cast are Hiddleston, Larson, Jackson, Goodman, and Reilly's respective characters. Of all the characters, John C. Reilly's Hank Marlow steels the screen about as often as Kong does. One might even be able to say that this is as much a John C. Reilly film as it is a Kong movie. Part of the magic of the previous Kong films, the 1933 version to be more specific, is the setting and characters themselves. Much like the new KONG attraction at Universal took physical sets, animatronics, real fire, etc and crafted a virtual 3D experience, the special effects artists and set designers did the same thing in KONG: Skull Island. The film comes across as less Kong and more Pacific Rim. In other words: generic.<br/><br/>KONG: Skull Island will certainly keep you entertained the whole time as action-adventure films are supposed to do. You'll enjoy the fight scenes and the whole ""creature feature"" approach this film takes. If you're looking for moments taken right out of the previous Kong movies, then you'll mostly be satisfied. There are few scenes taken directly from the previous movies, but there are certainly allusions and nods to classic moments. You won't spend much time with the natives nor will you get to witness the famous Empire State Building scene, but you'll likely enjoy the film nevertheless. Just because a film takes a reimagined approach to a classic character that ultimately plays off as generic, doesn't mean that there isn't anything to enjoy. For action junkies, there is plenty to grab your attention and hold it for the duration of the movie.<br/><br/>Written by R.L. Terry<br/><br/>Edited by J.M. Wead"
"coreyjdenford","6","4","9","9 March 2017"," He's back...only just
","This review of Kong: Skull Island is spoiler free <br/><br/>*** (3/5) <br/><br/>LIKE HIS Japanese counterpart, King Kong has entered the world of cinema, left it and been resurrected an uncanny amount of times, however only a few of them explored the inner reaches of his uncharted home the mythical Skull Island. But it's been over a decade since he was last brought to life, and although 2005s King Kong did go to the island it didn't explore it the way we would have liked, it had the plot to find Kong and capture him to show him to the world and then he raided New York, you know it. In Kong: Skull Island we explore the inner reaches of the island, and are constantly threatened by the giant beast, for which Samuel L. Jackson's war-hammered soldier here asks ""How big is it? How fast is it? And what it do?"" <br/><br/>Of course how big he is and how he is, is obvious to those who are familiar with the monster, his speeds vary through different films. Yet with the advantages of CGI only coming in before 2005s version he went as fast as the computer would take him, although in that version he was played by Andy Serkis in motion capture. Here he's only seen in CGI visuals roaring from sound effects, and looking more dazzlingly like an ape than ever. His facial features looking more real, and his height even more terrifying here he's about the size of other monsters beside him.<br/><br/>This is the second film in Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse series; the first was 2014s Godzilla directed by Gareth Edwards, who thanks to his special effects team made the beast look more real than it ever did, but also gave him extra height, it's too hard to imagine how big they'll in their next fight. Although now Kong is noticeably smaller (at around 104 meters) but he's still growing as the film tells us but he can still pack one hell of a punch when he needs to. Were as Godzilla is full sized, he probably has the advantage over the giant ape but we won't know until the next film Godzilla: The King of Monsters comes out. But for now Kong: Skull Island makes its debut reigning supreme on his home turf, where it's dangerous by day but even more dangerous by night, as a lot of the island's inhabitants are there to kill its human invaders. Some more terrifying than others.<br/><br/>Next to Kong, on the island there are some horrific looking beasts with nasty teeth, really quite dinosaur looking, some can fly, some have horns and giant some are creepy crawlers, as the humans soon find out. However they don't help Kong, he isn't the most dangerous, and he's the protector of the island's native human inhabitants. There is something trying to kill him, in addition there is emotional heft to this story, too when it explains that Kong is the last of his kind proving to Jackson's hardened soldier that animals, even giant ones have feelings too, and he has the feeling of anger when the unwanted guests try to destroy his home, there is a gorgeous shot of the primate's fist colliding with the helicopters that he's scared of. Of course he has to be scared of something.<br/><br/>On land, the human invaders recover from the attack here Jackson angrier than ever, decides that Kong is the threat and wants to fight against him, but others try to get him change his mind about the war. The group of men and women include: Tom Huddleston's hardened tracker James Conrad, who hired by Bill Randa (Goodman) explores the island in search for evidence as to why evolution comes to an end, he lists the ways they are going to die on an uncharted island leaving one specific note (the giant monsters). Brie Larson's anti-war photographer Mason Weaver she takes an immediate liking to Kong and wonders why the other creatures want to kill him, and end the human territories on the island. Later, they meet with Hank Marlow (Reilly), a World War II soldier who's been stranded on the island since 1944 he steals the show from the rest of the players. Unfortunately he's the only one with character in the film, the rest of the characters are bland, even a talented actor like Hiddleston is wasted here. Sure he makes a decent impact with his bad-ass moments in a bar fight and sword swinging through dinosaur birds but it's not much.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the main flaw of the film, granted it looks gorgeous but the characters are dreary with a non-characterizing screenplay, yes there are flaws but there goodness here, too, the action is stunning it's the monsters that have the bigger impact, or in Kong's case has the bigger punch. When goes to punch helicopter of the sky it looks gorgeous as he's surrounded by smoke and fire. In the third act the action hits its peak, when he has to fight a giant creature that matches him to save the humans. Despite the horrendous flaws, like the bland screenplay Kong: Skull Island is a jaunty film with goodness and although it's not the best monster film it's still enjoyable, let's see how far he'll go in the future.<br/><br/>VERDICT: King Kong is alive again! Only just, in this derivative, dumb but consistently fun latest addition to the MonsterVerse series. It's just about over the line of Godzilla's strength, but not by much."

","This film is abysmal. I watched it on a plane so it was free but I still feel robbed.<br/><br/>Kong himself is ace. Top CGI. But he interacts with these two dimensional human actors; who are phoning it in so much they probably had to pay international dial rates. The humans are awful. The characters'arcs are pretty much non existent. There's a white woman who photographs everything and everyone likes it's a Conde Naste shoot. Especially galling are the scenes of her teaching the indigenous tribes people (who are straight up composites of every National Geographic photoset ever) how to do peace signs, obviously they nail it first time. But that nausea-inducing scene gets a close run for its money when the soldiers lower their guns only for her to raise her camera. It's really schmaltzy stuff. But she is not alone.<br/><br/>The English guy with the cheekbones has some lines I had to rewind to check I'd heard right (I had). He was terrible. Lots of very strong arm movements and at one point he runs through a cloud of toxic gas chopping up flying killer birds with a borrowed Japanese officers sword. He nails them every single time. Thankfully they all fly straight at him rather than from multiple angles. It's the kinda scene where you roll your eyes and wonder what the story board session was like.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson is alright. Not sure why his character is so unhinged. I think he's meant to have PTSD. It doesn't really work. His guys are just fodder for the CGI beasts. You don't get to care about any of them so they go from humans to splats or get munched and you just shrug. Which is an odd part of the film: there is a lot of gore. Like really gruesome deaths. Interspersed with some physics defying actions by the humans. I did chuckle that the CGI appeared more rooted in physical reality than the actors.<br/><br/>Then there is the boat made from old aeroplanes. I'm gonna leave that out there. Cos it's batshit crazy.<br/><br/>If you skip the dialogue and watch the CGI you have a watchable short film. But as a feature? Nope. It's terrible."

","The skull island is the birthplace of dozens of dangerous creatures of gigantic proportions; Huge spiders, giant killer ants, ridiculously large cows, monstrous 80 meter long lizards and of course King Kong.<br/><br/>I come to review this movie as a fan of the action and giant monsters, since I have admired every detail in the fiction of giant Japanese and American monsters, of course, the king of kings in this case is Godzilla, but the title of king who Kong carries on his behalf is not just by coincidence.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, this giant monkey is ready for all kinds of fantastic combat with unique scenes in the giant monster cinema.<br/><br/>Unlike Godzilla of 2014, Skull Island has lots of monsters fighting scenes and many little details of how huge the Monsterverse is looming at us. Enter the cinema very excited about this movie and I must admit that I love King Kong.<br/><br/>But not every movie is free from sin. What I do not like is the fact of the not-so-special script and the not-so-good performances from two great actors who wait a lot more, Jackson and Goodman. Their names are supposed to mean ""incredible scenes of script and pure acting"" but I think this was not their case with Skull Island, because of these errors, sometimes the film became too predictable and even childish at certain times , But even so, if you want entertainment, this is just right.<br/><br/>A deserved 7 for Kong."

","I could not get enough of King Kong! He had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. This movie introduced a new benchmark for all monster- type movies.<br/><br/>The story was simple. A group of scientists alongside a military escort went to Skull Island to investigate the hypothesis that monsters do exist. But they did not know what the monsters were. As a result, they were poorly prepared for what was awaiting their arrival. The military escort did not know what ""that"" was when first spotted, and it resulted in complete and total destruction. Their air crafts had no chance against King Kong's massive size and strength. I enjoyed that there was a good balance between King Kong's screen time versus the survivors trying to make it off the deadly island before it was too late.<br/><br/>Preston Packard, played by Samuel L. Jackson, was absolutely annoying. He was arrogant, and he kept on putting his own personal gain over his team's survival. His objective was to kill King Kong. He did not care how many of his men and women he would lose; he wanted King Kong dead. He did not care about the skull crushers (giant lizard things) either, and they were the real threat on Skull Island. But despite Packard knowing this, he still did not care. It was selfish and illogical for him to do that.<br/><br/>Kank Marlow, played by John C. Reilly, was too funny. He had me laughing because his sense of humor when facing death was on point.<br/><br/>The end credits left us with a scene for an upcoming sequel. But this sequel will be with none other, Godzilla!

","Kong Skull Island primarily takes place in the 1970's or more specific right after the US leaves Vietnam. A crew is sent on an expedition to survey the area for resources, but the real reason is to find proof of King Kong. <br/><br/>Typically with the US movies we see a love story ensue with the blond and the beast as well as some money making side show. That is for the most part disregarded and instead we get a good monster fighting movie. The action was great and well shot especially during the last 20 minutes or so. That period of time really sold the movie for me. Prior to that point I was on the fence if I was really liking what I was seeing. <br/><br/>Kong was once again the sympathetic beast audiences can root for and will continue to root for if this whole planned monster Universe goes as planned (fingers crossed). The other characters are not fully fleshed out but that is excusable since the great monster movies do not need character development. The character that was talked about the most was the comic relief and he had a great story and well timed jokes. There was certainly never a dull moment watching this as monsters just kept coming and the crew just had to survive. Speaking of the characters, Hiddleston and Larson had their moments as well. There wasn't much but there was enough to get attached to them. They had kind of a... well I don't what you call it but they reminded me a lot of Nathan Drake and Elena from Uncharted. If you don't play video games then look them up as that relationship is the best example I could give.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>The big thing that annoyed me was the overly clichéd character of Samuel L Jackson I am not going to say anything about the direction his character takes but it was dumb and has been done better. <br/><br/>Some of the action...no wait just the scene when they arrived on the helicopters yes that one. That went on too long to remain enjoyable if they cut that sequence by half I would have enjoyed it a whole lot more. <br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>This was a very good monster movie.I am semi excited what the next one will be given the movies success. I would recommend this if you liked the Toho movies as I believe they helped a little in making this movie. If you just like giant monsters fighting then you can't go wrong with this movie."

And if you did, you then come and complain about it even though by your own admission you didn't see all of it?<br/><br/>They continue: After seeing the trailer for this film, I clicked on this title optimistically. I then saw Samuel. L Jackson was part of the cast and then my doubt began. -Basically you're saying you saw him in the trailer, but didn't connect the dots, an then you go on to base your review on one actor?<br/><br/>It goes on: For me, any film which includes animals has to do their research and this was another reason as to why I switched off.

","It's got clichéd characters, every Viet Nam war movie cliché including the stock Viet Nam movie soundtrack, I mean, you can almost predict the songs, some bad casting and dumb decisions of course, where you really couldn't care less if they all die.<br/><br/>The worst cast character is the tough tracker played by Tom Hiddleston, who I don't buy as a tough guy in this or any other universe. We see him kick some butt at the beginning and it doesn't ring true in any sense, total Hollywood hokum. He has the tough guy grimace across his face the entire movie and it's laughable, he's not tough at all. But his hair is. Nary a hair is out of the place the entire movie.<br/><br/>There's just dumb stuff throughout. Samuel Jackson HAS to kill Kong because Kong killed some of his men - never mind it means never getting off the island. The main guy and girl all of a sudden are on Kong's side because of a two minute meeting where Kong's face is right up against them, she pets him and now they're all buddies. Now they're going to risk their lives to save him. And there's tons of dumb things because of bad writing in the movie, but the dumbest is the boat floating down the river hoping to get to the meeting point without getting eaten or killed by monsters, blasting rock music so every creature on the island knows exactly where they are. Mindbogglingly stupid.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly has been on the island for 28 years, finally gets home and not only has his wife barely aged and isn't married, his boy who was born the day he ended up on the island, has reversed aged and is about 22 and still living at home with his young single mom.<br/><br/>But there is good stuff. This isn't one of those annoying movies with the monster's name in the title and the monster is in about five minutes of the movie. Nope, Kong is in this a lot. And that's a good thing because this is a good Kong. He's more of a monster, than a silver-back like Jackson's version. He's bigger and you need bigger if he's supposed to face Godzilla. I liked the Kong a lot and I like his badassness.<br/><br/>I'm unclear on how they were supposed to keep it all a secret as they claimed they were when a bunch of people died. In reality, the military would reign down on that island a week later and kill everything. There's plot holes galore so go in knowing that and just enjoy a good Kong. The original Kong is one of my all time favorite movies and I even like the other two versions - but the one thing I hate and I never watch is the end because he dies. In this one he does not die.

","Hero or foe? Beauty or beast? Poor King Kong and his monstrous cronies have spent decades of hopping back and forth on the morality spectrum, swayed by the ideological whims of their times. But this, to paraphrase the Canadian Prime Minister, is 2017. And lo - our Kong is a benevolent God, leaving no prayer unanswered. Take, for example, those volumes of prayers uttered (with varying degrees of accompanying profanity) after Kong's scaly cousin reared his irradiated head for a grand total of twelve minutes in 2014's dour, insultingly underwhelming Godzilla. Too little monster mash? Too much jingoistic military pandering? And, more than anything, too gosh darn dark, self-important, and serious? Kong, your God, has heard your prayers. And Skull Island is indeed a place where dreams come true. <br/><br/>If you're looking for the most evocative translation of a comic book to screen in years, you won't find it in any superhero flick. Instead, indie maverick Jordan Vogt-Roberts fearlessly plunges his directorial hand into the hornet's nest of Kong's pop art potential, and shakes it for all it's worth. Enough striking, stylized candy-coloured panoramas to put Zack Snyder to shame? Check. A smorgasbord of pop culture references, aping (HA!) everything from Platoon to Jurassic Park, Aliens and more, with a playlist vying Guardians of the Galaxy for jukebox infectiousness? Yep. A cabal of established actors as cardboard cutouts running by green screens and gleefully chewing scenery? Definitely. And, most importantly, a f*ck-ton of big monsters smashing into one another? Ohhhh baby, yes. Welcome to your monthly periodical of big-budget pulp. And it is gloriously unapologetic. <br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island may not have lofty ambitions, but it accomplishes them with furious gusto. Peter Jackson's 2005 love letter to the eighth wonder of the world devoted almost an hour to pre-island backstory and character developments. Vogt-Roberts jettisons plot in favour of momentum, ramming a comparable amount of preamble into roughly fifteen minutes, largely composed of John Goodman (the right blend of grave and twinkling, but criminally underused) booming out expositional word bubbles that almost serve to gloss over the film's scientific hokum. If 2014's Godzilla felt like a surly military recruitment video, 70s-set Skull Island is its pop-punk cousin - Apocalypse Now's Vietnam critique cut with the obnoxious zippiness of Top Gun. And audiences have to patiently bide their time for a whopping three minutes before the titular behemoth triumphantly crashes onto the scene. If you listen carefully over the ensuing spontaneous rounds of cheering, you might just hear Gareth Edwards face- palming from the back of the cinema. <br/><br/>As for the ""let them fight"" factor? Let's just say that no one could argue Vogt-Roberts squandered his $185 million, as he seldom makes audiences wait through an entire scene without dangling a new show-stopping creature feature in front of them. Painstakingly etched with impressively credible CGI, his monsters don't crawl out of the woodwork - they ARE the woodwork, a menagerie of rapturously inventive, Miyazaki-inspired giant insects, implausibly antlered behemoths, skulking krakens, frenzied pterosaurs, and the monster-du-jour ""Skullcrawlers,"" who are fearfully unique enough to not feel callously expendable. Oh, and that Kong guy? Never cooler. From his unprecedentedly imposing stature to each strand of fur and dribble of spit rendered with impeccable care, Kong. Is. King. And these monsters don't just fight - they FIGHT, thrashing each other with phenomenal energy, menace, and ingenuity, with no nearby foliage or debris safe from being thrown into the fray, as Henry Jackman's thunderously kitschy score provides a delightfully melodramatic backdrop. Most importantly? No infuriating pieces of foreground set c*ck-blocking the fun. And yet, for a movie so assuredly dumb, Skull Island is surprisingly beautiful, with more boundless, lush natural panoramas, craggy cliffs, and dazzling, Life of Pi-riffing Aurora Borealis than you can shake a stomped cephalopod at. This visual feast may be more of a all-you-can-eat buffet of spectacle gluttony, but it's money deliriously well-spent. <br/><br/>And the actual humans who occasionally, irksomely, pop up? Well, it's here that tolerance for Vogt-Roberts' commitment to B-movie storytelling is really tested. Jubilantly one-note and generally obstinately committed to ludicrous character motivations (one ""Let's go save Kong!"" reversal reduced our cinema to outright unsolicited chuckles), the cast are gamely committed to taking the silliness seriously. Tom Hiddleston may smoulder like a pro, but his generic action hunk is so superfluous he could be lopped out of the film without affecting the plot in the slightest. And hey - that'd leave more breathing room for poor Oscar winner Brie Larson, trying her best to flex her jaunty charisma amidst the din. Still, din requires shouters, and, therein, none compare to Samuel L. Jackson, who outdoes his propensity to never let daft material clip his wings, spitting out an obsessive, antagonistic bent to his volcanic magnetism, complete with one of the best seething glowers in cinema history. Though toeing the line of too many characters, Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Toby Kebbell, and Shea Wingham all breathe enough energy and personality into their requisite grunts to avoid being expendable monster fodder. Still, we're all waiting for the indescribably hilarious John C. Reilly to breeze in and waltz away with the picture as a stranded, samurai sword-brandishing WWII vet/goldmine of bug-eyed goofiness, side-splitting non- sequiturs (""Hey, did we win the war?""), and actual, unexpected, emotional arc. He's an almost questionably Looney Tunes addition, but Reilly's confident zaniness is almost as worth it as Kong himself.<br/><br/>If Legendary is priming their own monstrous Avengers, Kong: Skull Island is its Captain America: The First Avenger - period-set, and bursting with irreverent, bombastic nostalgic fun. And hey - if he beckons in an era of equally rambunctious, unapologetic B-movie blockbusters that don't skimp on quality, Kong is a kind and fair God indeed. Place your gladiatorial bets for 2020 - and eat it, Batman v. Superman! <br/><br/>-8/10"

","Kong: Skull Island is about some guy having a hollow Earth theory with monster running around rampant. He enlists a few people to travel with him and they discover the place. They soon discover a great threat that they are outmatched by.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is set after the Vietnam War. Americans were pulling out, but a guy wants to explore Skull Island. He gets some S-Class military people, some scientists, and a photographer to help him.<br/><br/>The bad<br/><br/>Characters: You had some soldiers that were practically frat boys and the comedic relief. I actually liked them, but they were stereotypical. You had some loner white guy that's entitled. He thinks that just because he's strong, he doesn't have to pay for anything. What a prick! His obvious love interest in the journalist woman. Nothing new there. You have the dorky smart man, that's black, and his love interest, an Asian woman. You have the general, Samuel Jackson, that's unlikable and crazy for revenge. Next is the guy that's been on the island for a while, who's also the comedic relief and voice of reason. The characters are stereotypes and unlikable, but the movie manages to be good in spite of this.<br/><br/>The action is very good and well paced. There is never a dull moment and it does what an action movie is supposed to do. You even have the revenge seeking guy, Samuel Jackson, who was willing to get himself and his men killed just to exact revenge on King Kong. When they asked him what he'll do about the lizards killing everyone, he just said he'll kill him too. How? You used most resources to kill King Kong, and he didn't even die. Y'all got whooped by the babies, how will you kill the mother? King Kong himself was originally the enemy, until the old WWII soldier explained that Kong protects the people from the skull lizards. Kong was just angry that they bombed the place (seriously, it's not cool to bomb new territory) and woke up the lizards. At the end, we get an epic battle of King Kong vs the biggest skull lizard and it was epic. <br/><br/>You even have sad moments with neither of the deaths going in vain and you feel the island people's pain when the WWII soldier leave. <br/><br/>Unlikely alliances are formed because of the situation. The WWII American soldier worked with the WWII Japanese soldier in order to survive. The people aligned with King Kong when a bigger threat presented itself.<br/><br/>It's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone. Those two hours go by fast with great moments and action."

"rs403404","8","3","6","13 March 2017"," Kong Roars in Skull Island
","King Kong is one of those movies that periodically gets remade. The same theme is central to every King Kong film: beauty tames the savage beast. However, that aspect is just subtext in this movie; the main story and themes differ completely from previous variations. The reason for this change is because ""Kong: Skull Island"" is not another King Kong remake at all. It's a completely different beast that just happens to have King Kong in it (although a Kong that is far larger than your average iteration).<br/><br/>Due to this freedom, ""Kong: Skull Island"" pursues far more relevant themes than previous Kong movies. The film takes place at the end of the Vietnam war and takes full advantage of that traumatizing time. Within this vehicle, there's subtext on nation building that's fascinating, but the core ideas that this movie explores are the role of the warrior when there is no war, particularly, when they come home defeated. For the most part, the majority are just happy to go home to their families, but far more disturbingly is the soldier looking for the next war.<br/><br/>Into this vacuum steps Samuel L Jackson's Preston Packard. In a movie with lots of solid acting, Jackson standouts. He is a man driven by rage, however, he never acts unreasonably. It's easy to see why he would command a unit and why men follow him. Focused and determined, he pursues his next victory at any cost. At face value, most of his ideas appear insane, but when he speaks his ideas and motivations never seem entirely outlandish. Through this, the movie explores the ideas of what war does to its warriors.<br/><br/>Unabashedly, the movie never neglects the concept that big monsters giving each other a thrashing is awesome. Despite the serious themes this movie explores, it never forgets that it's just a fun monster versus monster beat-em-up B movie. Fortunately, unlike the American ""Godzilla"" from a couple of years ago, the audience experiences as much action as it could handle. Further, the effects are simply spectacular. None of ""The Great Wall""'s green dogs here, more comparable would be the effects from last year's ""The Jungle Book"". Most the creatures and especially Kong himself look very real.<br/><br/>Sure, there are times where I feel like editing skipped minor story points occasionally making the audience wonder how some characters got from point A to point D, but this is an infrequent occurrence. Also, outside of Preston Packard and Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly is the other big standout in the cast) all the characters are rather underdeveloped. Still all in all, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is a film far better than it has any right to be."
"paulijcalderon","6","3","6","13 March 2017"," Entertaining, but lacked a sense of awe and mystery
","It was OK. I expected more from it, but what worked was the re-introduction of King Kong. The way he was handled was all right. I did overall liked this portrayal of Kong, he was more fierce and visceral. Even though I would have liked the movie to develop him more, since almost all of his scenes are about him doing action stuff. The very few moments when he calms down and lives normally were nice. But there wasn't enough for me to really buy into it and understand him. Because the other ""King Kong"" films do a good job of humanizing Kong so he doesn't become a generic evil monster. What makes him different compared to a lot of movie monsters is that he has a heart and some kind of emotional connection. This film would have needed to showcase more of that aspect of Kong's personality.<br/><br/>They went the safe route with the story. I's pretty standard and predictable. It bugged me a bit because I wished they would go in a different direction. Well, they did go in a different direction... With the visual style and the tone. It's a fun and colorfully energized type of movie that doesn't take itself seriously often. I liked the few times it actually toned down and got more serious. Because a big thing this film lacked was a sense of awe and mystery. They show off Kong early on, so there's no time to build up the reveal. I like the Peter Jackson version a lot more because there's eeriness and mystery surrounding Skull Island. Just hearing about the legends of the creatures and exploring the mythology was something that I could get invested in. They leave nothing a mystery in this new film because there's much exposition on what's going on with Kong, his backstory and the different creatures on the island. Instead of gradually exploring it or having the audience realize things along the way, they spell it all out by talking about everything and not showing. Towards the final half they have some mysterious moments, but by then it was already too late for that. It spends more time trying to be retro and looking for moments to play songs from the 70's, rather than giving us a good story. The best character was John C. Reilly. I liked his story line, it was nice. Everyone else was just there basically playing themselves. Many actors were wasted. I'm looking at you Toby Kebbel. You are better than this.<br/><br/>There is a Post-credit scene. It was OK, but underwhelming. It does promise a lot for the future and I hope they don't mess up anything they are hinting at, because it has huge potential. ""Kong: Skull Island"" is just an entertaining popcorn movie, don't expect much more. I'm happy that King Kong is back, but he deserves a better movie next time."
"mz-37866","6","3","6","12 March 2017"," A visual spectacle with bland hollow characters.
","6/10 Overall Kong: Skull Island is a visual spectacle with bland hollow characters. The cinematography of the island is very pretty and with the exception of few scenes look very real. Yet, all the characters, with the exception of Samuel L. Jackson and John C Reilly, are fairly basic. Brie Larson doesn't get much to do which is a shame and Tom Hiddleston has a cool action scene but have no depth as a character. Some of the decisions made by the characters made little sense and had me and my friends puzzled and laughing at some stupid moments. I like the island and all the different monsters, especially Kong. Kong is the best part of the film, and every scene with him is very good. Though they hardly go into the ""humanity"" of Kong which previous versions, Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong particularly, did very well. Overall I enjoyed the film, but wish there was more in the character department for me to connect with. Bring the popcorn and stay to the end of the credits."
"regula1","7","3","6","11 March 2017"," Great monster fights, very dull humans. The (almost) perfect monster movie.
","A 15-story ape throws a palm tree like a dart through the windshield of a Vietnam-era Huey with Creedence Clearwater Revival playing in the background.<br/><br/>And that's just the first thing Kong does.<br/><br/>If all you want is more stuff like that, plus some amazing monster on monster battles, then this is the movie for you. If you're looking for compelling human characters to go with those fights, then you walked into the wrong auditorium.<br/><br/>Kong:Skull Island is the second film in the still-forming Monsterverse, the first being 2014's Godzilla. As such, there are several threads to tie these two films together. Don't worry, there are no real spoilers here.<br/><br/>Of course, the main point of this film is to see King Kong fight some monsters, but the story before that involves John Goodman's character, an agent of Monarch, the monster organization from Godzilla, lead an expedition to Skull Island. Ostensibly, they are there to survey an uncharted island that's been inaccessible for centuries, but as the humans soon discover there's more to the mission than first thought.<br/><br/>To qualify the opening statement, this film is really not about any of the people shown. As such, no character is given any real development or subtext except for John C. Reilly's character, a stranded World War II fighter pilot named Marlow (read as reference to Apocalypse Now, which this film clearly emulates, down to its Vietnam-era setting and themes.) At times, the human characters get their brief hints at deep moments, dragging the scenes out too long, until some are inevitably killed by one creature or another.<br/><br/>However, by far the best parts of this film are the creatures. Obviously Kong is the main creature, and the CGI work on him is incredibly detailed. But the other creatures as well, such as a giant water buffalo, giant spiders, and especially the lizard-like Skullcrawlers, are all entertaining to look at whether the humans are (trying) to kill them or Kong is bashing them apart.<br/><br/>This film is really about the monsters, as well it should be. All of the great monster movies of old followed the same basic set-up. Some human story that gets characters to go on some vaguely-defined mission that quickly falls out of importance in favor of epic battle scenes between two or more monsters, broken up every so often by more human scenes which serve only as a rest break for the audience between battle scenes.<br/><br/>This film follows that model to a tee, and in a sense is a response to criticism of 2014's Godzilla which had hardly any great battle scenes between Godzilla and the MUTOs, and too much human interaction with characters we didn't necessarily care about.<br/><br/>The humans do indeed take more of a back seat in Kong, and there are way more creature battles and action scenes. However, the humans still have slightly too much screen time, and at these times the movie plods.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film is worth it for the creature battles alone, and the end credit scene which reveals so much tantalizing promise for the future."

","Inspired by many movies Jordan Vogt-Roberts has brought Kong: Skull Island. Though the largest ape to ever live (At least in movies) was so popular in Hollywood and appeared time to time on the screens was last seen in 2005 with Peter Jackson behind the script. Jordan has given some new colors to the original Kong with a modulated script.<br/><br/>Unlike other Kong movies or monster movie you don't have to wait long to meet Kong instead he shows up in the first scene itself. Though Kong's screen presence is reduced, still he impresses us whenever he shows up. The fights between Kong and the other monsters are a treat to watch.<br/><br/>Since frame one the movie is on the script. The character introductions are crisp and fast. We land in Skull Island within the first 15 minutes into the movie. The enchanting visuals keep the audience hooked. Jordan along with Larry Fong has captured the island with some appealing visuals. The slow motion effect adds up to the excitement.<br/><br/>The monsters that pop up time to time enthralls and we could here wows now and then in the theatre. The final battle between Kong and the Skull Crawler is the top notch. Apart from all the background score is the best thing I enjoyed about the movie. The songs like Jefferson Airplane (""White Rabbit""), Black Sabbath (""Paranoid""), Creedence Clearwater Revival (""Bad Moon Rising"") and David Bowie (""Ziggy Stardust"") were used to perfection.<br/><br/>Lags: Though the movie is great up to some extend it does have many down falls. The story doesn't fall in line and the editing adds up to the misery. Few forced scenes might raise our doubt over the perfection of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a strong cast, but except Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reily no one has much to offer (Only for marketing). Apart from all Kong is not so emotional this time which is rather unlikely in Kong movies. He just shares a brief moment with Brie where she touches him, but that isn't emotional.<br/><br/>At times some funny one liners are thrown in but fades before it settles down. The slow motion effect is good, but a little too much.<br/><br/>Final words: Lags apart Kong: Skull Island is a must watch if you love monster movies. Children would love it and are advised to watch it with parent – The movie is violent (A little). The post credits show that more monster movies are to follow and next time it would be a fight between Godzilla and the Kong."

","A team of scientists are chaperoned by a war veteran to an uncharted island in the Pacific, however, things go awry and they must fight to escape the primal island. <br/><br/>The effects are impressive and director Jordan Vogt-Roberts skilfully creates a great sense of scale. What's refreshing is that the handful of writers don't rehash the King Kong story of a screaming female, the giant ape falling in love and being taken to civilisation only to die. This take on the 1933 landmark film is reminiscent of Conan Doyle's The Lost World (1960), Jurassic Park: The Lost World (1997) and the 'monster verses' moments of Kong films to name a few. <br/><br/>The period Platoon-like (1986) soundtrack sells the 70's setting along with Henry Jackman's score complimenting the action setups. The cast are adequate including the likes of Tom Hiddleston and John C. Reilly. Samuel L. Jackson looks really infuriated throughout, and rightly so as Kong wipes out the majorly of his team. But to be honest it's a good thing as I'd pay good money to see Jackson's badassery (is that a word?) over CGI monsters any day. Hiddleston is surprising as tracker Conrad especially in his fight driven introduction. Brie Larson as photographer Weaver is sadly given very little to do. There's a little confrontation dynamic between the parties when they find out that Kong is essential in keeping the equilibrium of the Island. Along with Conrad's followers, Hank Marlow (Reilly) who has been stranded on the island since 1944, go against Jackson's hardened vet' Preston Packard who wants Kong dead.<br/><br/>Notable are underused John Goodman and Toby Kebbell as solider Jack. Kebbell no stranger to motion capture (Koba, Planet of the Apes) advises Terry Notary who is excellent as Kong. Regardless of how much is actually Notary's performance, the completed monster design is impressive especially when Kong battles giant ancient creatures. The humour is largely hit and miss due to the dark tone and post Vietnam War backdrop. With hints of Apocalypse Now (1979) it's more visually striking than Godzilla (2014), but it's not as tonally consistent. Skull Island feels one-dimensional in comparison. Vogt-Roberts offers some stage interesting napalm moments, reflecting on sunglasses and exploding silhouette giant beasts. Stay for the after the credits as it teases a showdown with another aforementioned giant monster.<br/><br/>Stripped of effects it's B movie stuff with a A list cast and budget. Most teenagers will no doubt love it, but Kong:Skull Island's mishmash tone may leave others feeling underwhelmed."

","I saw ""Kong:Skull Island"", starring Tom Hiddleston-Loki in the Thor movies, I saw the Light; Samuel L. Jackson-The XXX movies, Star Wars:Episode 3_Revenge of the Sith; Brie Larson-Trainwreck, 13 Going on 30, Oh yeah, she is going to play Captain Marvel in 2019; John Goodman- Patriots Day, Evan Almighty and John C. Reilly-Guardians of the Galaxy.<br/><br/>This is a reboot of the King Kong franchise and I think it's the best King Kong movie ever. The original one was in 1933, then they had a remake in 1976 and another in 2005. I have heard that the 2014 Godzilla was the beginning of a resurgence, with Godzilla:King of the Monsters in 2019 being the next one and then Godzilla vs King Kong in 2020. Anyway, this one is different from previous Kong movies-it takes place solely on Skull Island, with no New York skyscrapers in sight. It starts in 1944 with two pilots crash landing on an island-guess where? Then things shift to 1973, during the Vietnam war. John is a scientist getting a team together to explore an uncharted island in the Pacific-it's kind of like a Bermuda Triangle type area, where planes and ships have disappeared. Tom is hired as tracker and Brie is the journalist along to photograph their discoveries. Samuel is a colonel in the Army that is in charge of security. When they arrive on the island, they come across all sorts of giant behemoths; lizard type creatures, spiders, birds and even Kong, who fights some of them in glorious battles. You also find John, who was one of those pilots from 1944 that crashed on the island. You will also see Kong's parents. The fights and effects are fantastic. The music is pretty good, too, if you like rock. I remember hearing Jefferson Airplane, CCR, The Stooges, The Hollies and Black Sabbath, just to name a few. Make sure you stay until after the end credits because there is a scene and it has some bearing on future movies. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi violence and action and some language and has a running time of 2 hours. Like I said earlier, I think this is the best King Kong movie I've ever seen and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

","Why on earth would you want to remake the 1933 classic King Kong? It came out during the Golden years of Hollywood Horror, with such films as Frankenstein (1931), Dracula (1931), Dr. Jekly & Mr. Hyde (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), etc. To this date those classics (mostly from Universal) remain the best of breed. Attempts to re-make the classic Kong in 1976 (Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange) and 2005 Jack Black, Naomi Watts) both failed. <br/><br/>In the original, the cast (Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong), the director (Merian Cooper), producer (David O Selznick) and the animation (Willis O'Brian) are all first rate. (FWIW – Willis was the mentor to Ray Harryhausen who is perhaps even better known for his work on stop-action animation) Kong has been in several other films, mostly Japanese including King Kong vs Godzilla (1962) and King Kong Escapes (1967). There was even a ""Son of Kong"" released just a few months after the original, re- starring Robert Armstrong but absent Fay Wray. <br/><br/>The current film has a large cast (Samuel Jacklson, John Goodman, John C Riley, Tom Hiddleston).Uniformly they do a good job, especially Riley and Jackson. The director is virtually unknown but the writer Dan Gilroy has done some good projects like Real Steel (2011), The Bourne Legacy (2012) and Nightcrawler (2014). Photography is excellent.<br/><br/>This 2017 version is clearly superior to the other versions, except for the original. The anti-war ecology theme is a bit heavy handed, but the real problem is the ""monsters"" who are done very poorly, and even Kong gives us very little more than the 1933 version did. In fact, I'm going to say, even less. Also, we're missing the romance."

It is not natural and something which screamed laziness by the director. Now the pinnacle moment in which I grabbed the remote was when it was quite clear the anger fuelled Samuel L Jackson's character was developing a vendetta towards the animal he has just tried to slaughter with ammunition.

","Quit Monkeying Around ""Kong: On Skull Island"" seems to be comfortable with being pure unneeded-childish fun. The 2017 Action/Adventure film was a letdown to Kong enthusiasts who have followed his legacy since his first appearance in media in 1933. As I got ready to come see this movie, I looked into the Director, Jordan Vogt-Roberts, who won the Narrative Feature Audience Award. That got my hopes up along with waiting so anxiously to see the next side of Kong. With opening weekend sold 61,015,000 tickets I couldn't wait any longer. I could have waited longer; with good intentions of a back story to Kong's legacy the plot was quick to get to the guns firing and vicious action. I found it very hard to relate to any of the characters throughout its entirety. If you looked closer to the details the movie holds handfuls of factual errors. From the uniforms the soldiers were wearing in the movie. In the 1970's the breast pockets were not sloped. Or when Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) refers to James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) as ""Captain"" however his collar was bronze and had the oak leaf symbol which was instead rank of Major in the Army. The helicopters in flight during the movie were CH53E Super Stallions didn't begins flight till 1974 and didn't fly in fleet until 1981. These are some, but not all of the little differences that occurred that distract from the movie itself if the audience catches on to the guns in different positions during every cut back to each person. In the words of Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly) ""But you don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs, unless you're picking a fight."" Which pretty much grasps this movie as a whole. It was too quick to violence and gun fair there was no inclination of characters moral development as the movie progresses to exploring the uncharted island. There was no change in character development in any advance to keep the audience engaged in more than the dropping of overly exaggerated destructive bombs. This movie was the movie to see if one was looking for what to do in a sandbox near you."

","'KONG: SKULL ISLAND': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A reboot to the popular monster movie franchise, which began in 1933. It's also the second film in Legendary's new monster universe franchise, called MonsterVerse, following 2014's 'GODZILLA' and leading up to a planned crossover film (in 2020) titled 'GODZILLA VS. KONG'. The story deals with a couple of government agents, and their military escorts, investigating an uncharted island, in the Pacific Ocean, where they're attacked by a giant monster known as Kong. The movie was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts (who also helmed the 2013 indie coming-of-age flick 'THE KINGS OF SUMMER') and it was written by Dan Gilroy and Max Borenstein. The film stars Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Thomas Mann, Shea Whigham, Tobby Kebbell, John Ortiz, Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell. It's been a huge hit at the Box Office, and it's also gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I really enjoyed it as well.<br/><br/>A government agent, named Bill Randa (Goodman), and a seismologist, named Houston Brooks (Hawkins), lead an expedition to map out an uncharted island, in the Pacific Ocean, known as 'Skull Island'. They hire the Sky Devils Helicopter squadron, lead by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Jackson), and a former British Special Air Service Captain, named James Conrad (Hiddleston), to escort them. A photojournalist, named Mason Weaver (Larson), who thinks the expedition has sinister motives, also joins the team. Once they reach the island, the group realizes there's a very large creature there, known as Kong, that is unhappy with their presence.<br/><br/>The movie is action-packed, and a lot of fun. I love monster flicks, and this is definitely a really well made one. It's not as epic as Peter Jackson's 2005 remake, or the 1933 original, but it's still a more than decent installment in the long running series. It's also definitely a lot better than the 2014 'GODZILLA' reboot. I look forward to the upcoming crossover flick (with both classic movie monsters in it), and more entries in the new MonsterVerse franchise!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b6j-_hcq7Wo"

","I went into this movie with low expectations, expecting a lot of action with some token story and character development that could be thrown aside. I was completely correct.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is a beautiful film to look at, there is some excellent CGI here that warrants a cinema viewing. Sadly, that is about all I can say for the movie, since it really does have nothing else. The cast is severely underused, therefore I had no connection with any of the characters whatsoever. The writing is BAD, seriously bad. Almost all of the dialogue was either painfully obvious exposition or simply unnecessary quips that would even feel out of place in a terrible late-night B movie. The main creatures (aside from Kong) feel very uninspired and the species that Kong frequently fights becomes very boring to look at almost immediately.<br/><br/>If you're looking for some mindless entertainment with pretty visuals then Kong might be it, but don't expect anything more than that."

Sounds doomed to fail, right?<br/><br/>Not quite. The team behind this movie don't at any point pretend to bring anything new to the table - in fact, they are seemingly revelling in being able to do just the opposite. It's hammy, it's cheesy, it's predictable, it's trite - but for the best part, it's a lot of fun, albeit about 20 minutes too long.<br/><br/>The visual effects by ILM are as per exceptional, and this is the really what you're paying the ticket price for (the final sequence being the 'money shot'); it's a firework display in that you know what will happen, you've seen it before but yet you gladly hand over your money for that fleeting, dazzling light show - and this is no exception.<br/><br/>Sure, there are some vague references to the horror of war and the importance of humanity leaving the planet alone - but in reality, this flick is about leaving your brain at the door, taking the kids (who will love it), and forgetting about the serious stuff for a couple of hours.

","Peter Jackson's King Kong was a bloated mess of a movie. The last Godzilla, outside of the first 20 minutes with Walter White, was a monster disappointment. So why did I even consider going to see skull island? It was the only movie playing in a 2 hour time frame I have before my Wednesday night softball game.<br/><br/>To my great surprise this is the best monster movie I think I've ever seen in my 46 years. The action and pacing is breathless. Kong looks insane. The acting, especially the great John C Reilly, is awesome. The movie also manages to be funny and fun. If you like this kind of movie at all this is a must see on the big screen."
"The-Sarkologist","4","3","7","13 March 2017"," Let's remake the monkey movie
","It seems that like Godzilla, every ten years or so another movie comes along to once again flog this age old concept to death. Okay, when it comes to big monsters stomping around the place, King Kong is just one of the many movies that seem to hit our screens year in and year out, but the big monkey seems to be one of those creatures that always draws the crowds, if the number of people in the cinema is anything to go by (and considering that this is Salisbury Cinemas then a crowded cinema does say something, though they are refurbishing half of their screens anyway). The other interesting thing, as picked up by some internet blogger, is that every time King Kong is reborn he seems to get bigger and bigger. Personally I'm in no real position to compare since I don't go out of my way to see King Kong movies and the only reason I saw this one was because I thought my brother would like it.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is set in the early 1970s and the space race and satellite imaging has revealed an island in the south pacific that nobody knew anything about. Actually, people do know about it because it turns out that it has been a graveyard for ships and airplanes for decades, namely because it is surrounded by a perpetual storm and anybody going into the storm generally doesn't come out. However, there are rumours that there are monsters on this island, so this government organisation that is on the verge of having its funding cut, manages to convince congress to approve one last bill, and off they go on a good old monster hunt.<br/><br/>The thing that caught my attention to this movie is that while it is more than just a movie about a giant monkey (and the thing is that monkies, or at least apes, don't actually live in the South Pacific), but rather about even nastier monsters that the giant ape is keeping under control. Mind you, all of the iterations of the King Kong movie has been about people who have gone out of their way to capture an ape from an island in the South Pacific even though this ape isn't actually harming anybody, and then finding out that it has escaped, has grabbed some woman, and climbed to the top of the Empire State Building. Okay, this one follows a slightly different plot in that the entire movie (with the exception of the introduction) is set on the island, but it isn't much different to your typical monster movie.<br/><br/>One thing about this movie is that it is typical Hollywood criticism of how the various departments in the United States government play games of secret squirrel with each other, how the military are basically used as grunts to push forward the government's world dominating agenda, and how the only thing that battle hardened soldiers know is how to do is fight in battle. Oh, and there is also a comment on how the eco-system is a finely balanced machine that if it is tipped too far in the wrong direction then really really bad things would happen. However, movies like these aren't subtle in their execution, and coupled with bad acting, there rather blatant used of eye-candy (which shows them up as hypocrites), and the fact that it is a monster movie disguised as a morality tale, really rubs me up the wrong way. Sure, they may be making some good points, but the way they go about it is more like a sledge hammer, which in some cases is probably what is needed, but not where I am concerned."
"nzswanny","5","3","7","11 March 2017"," Great special effects with no decent story makes Kong; Skull Island a dull movie.
","Spoiler free!<br/><br/>Let me start off first by saying that I didn't actually like the look of this film in the first place. It looked like cheap garbage, even if the action scenes looked good. It looked as if it was going to be something like the Clash Of The Titans remake. I scrolled down to the comments of the trailer on YouTube, and I was actually surprised to see the positive feedback for the film. I said, ""Oh, alright,"" because I could semi-understand that there was a particular taste toward the type of film they were going for in the trailer. I didn't think it looked that great, because it wasn't my cup of tea. I thought that a loud movie with loud guns was not good enough for my standard of a good film. I think the big point of why that was such a strong opinion for me though is because the 1933 King Kong movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. Same goes to the 2005 one, which was a loud film with loud guns and in a different style with the original, but the director still knew how to keep it as a stable good film, letting it flow well with great pacing and good acting, along with memorable scenes that weren't in the 1933 one. Kong: Skull Island, however, felt that it would be rushed and rather cliché, and not really my idea of a good film.<br/><br/>I watched the film, and I have to say, it just wasn't my taste. It seemed too loud and unoriginal, with forced humor that didn't get even a snicker out of me. The audience I was in the cinema with, however, found the film to be very pleasing, and laughed along with the forced humor, so maybe I just wasn't getting the film? It had no memorable scenes, no good direction for where it was going, and ended up as another cliché blockbuster action movie in my opinion. Of course, as I can clearly see, most people like that sort of film, so I can clearly classify myself as no sheep, and admit that even if it isn't my taste, it's plenty of other people's taste.<br/><br/>So, I found it to be a dull movie with nothing new. If you, like me, only like loud movies with loud guns if they have a substance to it, then I'd say you'd dislike this film. If you are the normal person who loves movies with big, epic action scenes with tons of CGI and loud blockbuster music, then this should be right up your alley. Overall, I rate this a 5.4/10 for the average rating, however, if it were my personal opinion to rate, I'd rate the film a 3.9/10. If you loved the look of the trailer, though, you'll get exactly what you expect, and probably have a good time."

There's a lot of nonsensical stuff happening all around, that leaves you wondering when did it happen. There's a lot of unnecessary drama that the slow motion simply makes it even worse. Uninteresting characters which have a slight hint of where they are going, but they don't have enough development to actually get somewhere (a few super bad jokes, the typical ""awkward"" scene that now movies love to have but really just appear in the worst moments). Special effects aren't all that good really (not bad, but not amazing). There's not even enough killing/terrorizing! pretty much all the deaths are of people you barely see nor remember their names, the ones that are supposed to be relevant characters have funny/dumb deaths that end up being for nothing, which only deepens how irrelevant they where because of how bland they were! They show some natives of skull island but since they try so hard to make them all serious and respectable they leave them just as objects with a face that stares at the camera. I think the writers also try to make a statement about unnecessary wars and/or US imperialism but its sustained on like two or three lines and a few bad scenes, so even that is lost. Along with all of that the movie is super long so it makes you wonder where did all that time go inside the movie. Overall, a super bad movie by all standards, it tries so hard to be so serious but it's just plain bad."
"Coventry","7","2","4","22 November 2019"," Tour of Duty makes an excursion to Skull Island
","I usually don't comment on massively budgeted blockbusters, but ""Kong: Skull Island"" is such a joyfully tongue-in-cheek homage to giant monster B-movie cinema that I simply had to make an exception! This is a tremendously over-the-top and silly creature-feature, but the undemanding popcorn-entertainment value is just irresistible. The original King Kong, from 1933 already, is a monumental piece of cinema and still very powerful today. The more recent (2005) and expensive Peter Jackson remake was, at least in my humble opinion, a very boring and overlong romantic drama. ""Kong: Skull Island"" nicely falls right between these two extremes. By no means, it's great cinema, but at least it provides thrills, chuckles and adrenaline rushes from start to finish. The intro and scene-setting are already incredibly dumb, but oh so fun! We're supposed to believe that there exists a secret government agency (yes, another one) named Monarch, and their area of expertise is searching around the world for monsters and oversize animals. In 1973, The agency's CEO (an energetic John Goodman) benefices from the US-army's retreat out of Vietnam to recover soldiers and assets for a mission to the secretive Skull Island; a place where - and I quote - God left his creation unfinished.<br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" certainly doesn't waste any time! The helicopters have barely begun circling over the island, and there already emerges the humongous ape King Kong to slap them out of the sky like tiny ping-pong balls! The few remaining soldiers, led by the frustrated platoon leader Samuel L. Jackson, continue on foot and swear to destroy King Kong, but they soon learn that the island homes lots of other giant and unspeakably evil monstrous creations, and that Kong isn't even such a bad fella. It's a mission impossible to take this film seriously, but with the right mindset (and perhaps a few six-packs of beer) you'll have a great time. Seeing the story takes place in 1973 and has an abundantly clear Vietnam collection, it also somewhat feels like a long-feature ""Tour of Duty"" movie with a downright awesome 70s soundtrack. The special effects are cheesy and exaggerated, the dialogues are deliciously tacky (""hm, a mushroom...that means there must a river nearby!"") and the casting is perfect. I already mentioned John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson, but there's also John C. Reilly as the bewildered WWII veteran who's been stuck on the island since 1942."

One of the best scenes was with the giant arachnid(spider) amongst the bamboo bush.<br/><br/>The story is preposterous and somewhat implausible. It takes place in the 1970s, '73 or '74 during the waning days of the Vietnam War, but gives us a back story of some 20 to 30 minutes where we see two pilots, during the 1950s Korean War, parachute on Skull Island after a dog fight and knife fight before Kong makes an appearance. Back to the 1970s and John Goodman and Sam Jackson put together a team or expedtion of assorted characters and fly by military helicopters to the island.<br/><br/>CRAZY
What Island off of Vietnam would be uncharted in the 1970s?,this is what I asked of Gilligan's Island with the castaways on an uncharted island. WW2 had been fought out there, every inch was charted.

This version of Kong and his fellow monsters made me think of and rewatch the 1975 film THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT based on Edgar Rice Burroughs novel. The two films are quite similar in storyline. Indeed the original Kong in 33 may have been influenced by Rice Burroughs's book as well as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's THE LOST WORLD.<br/><br/>All in all good entertainment, I give it half-n-half, a positive for the ok CGI effect, a negative for the wacky story that insults one's intelligence."

"mukool-hastak","8","2","4","24 June 2017"," Not as bad or as good as some other reviews say, but definitely worth a watch !!
","Good lord, i get so frustrated when i see people give bad reviews to movies like this because there are 'plot holes' or the 'characters behave stupidly'. It's a movie about a giant gorilla.....a giant gorilla. The name says as much. So, if you could not wrap your head around that premise and went in expecting a 'grounded-in-reality' plot line, then you're the one being stupid.<br/><br/>And as far as realism and coherent storytelling go, it is still far better than Peter Jackson's version from 2005 (Sorry, Peter, love your other work i.e LotR).<br/><br/>At the same time it is also not good enough to warrant a 10 on IMDb from me, primarily because it ultimately lacks a certain 'wow' factor which you need to have if you're trying to reboot a franchise for the 3rd or 4th time.<br/><br/>So what's good about it ?<br/><br/>Well, it's entertaining, for sure ! You have all the regular capers that you would expect from a giant monster flick such as a 'tall-as-a-building' Kong swatting down military helicopters like they are flies, thumping his chest while roaring and a few other monsters thrown into the mix for Kong to fight (which makes for a few excellently shot set pieces in the film).<br/><br/>The acting ? Well, not Tom Hiddleston's best work, somehow i cant see him as an action hero, but he delivers a solid performance nonetheless. Brie Larson's character is thankfully not your typical damsel in distress that you would expect, although her character is saved from death a couple of times in the movie. However a diversion from the regular plot where Kong is supposed to kidnap the most good looking girl who eventually falls for him is a welcome one. Sam Jackson basically plays Sam Jackson who is furious at Kong for pwning his helicopter squadron and is on a 'Captain Ahab' type revenge quest; and he does it well. John C Riley's character was a pleasant surprise and they have given his character some good closure at the end.<br/><br/>And the plot itself ? All i'll say is that it's a basic plot, good enough for a monster movie and actually quite coherently played out on the screen. Like i said before, don't go in expecting realism from a giant monkey movie.<br/><br/>So what's bad about it ? Well, only that it ultimately does not have enough new material to be a ground-breaking reboot.<br/><br/>So, all-in-all.... Definitely worth a watch! Not only entertaining enough on it's own but also a solid start to what will hopefully go on to become a very cool 'Monster-verse'.<br/><br/>Oh yes, what about the 'Monster-verse' ?! Well, be sure to watch the post-credits scene :-) :-)"

"jimjo1216","Null","2","4","22 June 2017"," For action and excitement, KONG does not disappoint
","Merian C. Cooper and company tapped into something special with the original KING KONG (1933), captivating audiences with a fairly simple adventure fantasy (humans explore an undocumented island full of giant prehistoric monsters, and then bring one of the creatures back to modern civilization) and state-of-the-art cinematic special effects. But the story continues to resonate with moviegoers, through updates and retellings, out of a sympathy for Kong, the wild animal who fights dinosaurs at home, but is out of his depths in man's world.<br/><br/>The 1976 remake of KING KONG set the familiar events in the (then-)modern world, with shady oil corporations and environmentalists. In 2005, LORD OF THE RINGS helmer Peter Jackson retold Kong's story using the latest special effects technology, setting the three-hour epic during the original 1930s time period (and especially emphasizing Kong's emotional connection with Naomi Watts's would-be damsel in distress).<br/><br/>Over a decade later, KONG: SKULL ISLAND (2017) brings the giant gorilla back to the screen for a new generation, and a new blockbuster franchise. As the title suggests, the film is all about Kong's homeland of Skull Island. The film doesn't follow in the footsteps of prior iterations, as it positions Kong as a character who can appear in future sequels and spin-offs (facing off against other giant movie monsters from the Godzilla family of films).<br/><br/>Like the 1976 film, SKULL ISLAND updates the Kong story from the old-timey 1930s, placing the events in the retro 1970s. Specifically 1973, at the close of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Exploring the unexplored island is John Goodman, a monster hunter supposedly (and secretly) working on behalf of the U.S. government's Cold War interests (find the monster before the Russians do!) and accompanied by Samuel L. Jackson's helicopter squadron, fresh off their tour in Vietnam and ready to head home. Also along for the ride are Tom Hiddleston, an expert tracker to get the team through the jungle; Brie Larson, an anti-war photojournalist; and assorted scientists and technicians.<br/><br/>There's tension among the crew even before they encounter the skyscraper-sized gorilla. Military man Jackson and anti-war Larson don't see eye to eye, the scientists stick their noses up at the soldiers, and Goodman's urgency to find his monster puts him at odds with the better judgment of those who'd abort the expedition due to hellacious weather conditions. Once he witnesses Kong's destruction, Jackson, bitter about the outcome in Vietnam (a war that wasn't ""lost"", but ""abandoned""), focuses his entire being on destroying his hairy nemesis (an unpopular agenda among survivors keen on escaping the island with lives and limbs intact).<br/><br/>Worries of the sympathetic creature in Peter Jackson's 2005 film having been truly recast as a hellish ""monster"", a terrible force of nature, may persist after the horror of Kong's first encounter with the helicopter squadron. But, new direction and all, SKULL ISLAND makes sure to hit upon the beats of the winning King Kong formula.<br/><br/>As is tradition, a tribe of natives inhabits the island. But this time there are no ritualistic sacrifices at the altar of Kong. In this version, the natives worship Kong as their protector, for it is the great Kong who keeps the nasty ""skull-walker"" reptiles at bay and fights off the other Skull Island beasties. John C. Reilly plays a marooned WWII pilot who's been living among the Skull Islanders for twenty-eight years and can explain things to the wandering survivors.<br/><br/>In this way, Kong is softened a little. He's merely protecting his territory from invaders. And in the grand scheme of things, Kong fights on the humans' side, or at least provides necessary opposition to the man-eating terrors that await in the jungles of Skull Island. Kong is no real threat unless provoked, and the humans need Kong on their side if they hope to survive.<br/><br/>There's even a hint of Kong's famous weakness for pretty girls, in a scene where the savage Kong is tamed, if only for a second, by the beauty and kindness of Brie Larson. SKULL ISLAND eschews the damsel-in-distress story-line, but pays homage to the connection between ""beauty"" and ""the beast"".<br/><br/>SKULL ISLAND is packed with action and terror. Besides Kong batting helicopters out of the air and stomping on fleeing personnel, there are the giant bone-chomping reptiles, vicious pterosaurs, towering spiders, and other unknown dangers threatening the scattered crew. Viewers never know what might happen. People die in a multitude of horrible ways. Survival until the final credits is certainly not assured, and the film builds on its tension with some clever match cuts.<br/><br/>One particularly tense scene makes inventive use of a malfunctioning camera flash to track a creature through the fog, and another scene subverts an expected act of heroism. The action scenes throughout the film are exciting, and make for a fun trip to the movies.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is scary as a slightly unhinged general hell-bent on avenging the deaths of his men. John C. Reilly steals the show as only he can, combining his signature brand of crazy with the film's moral center. Hiddleston and Larson are good, too, but despite little character moments, the main soldiers remain forgettable monster fodder.<br/><br/>The quasi-modern update is welcome and refreshing dressing for the bones of the adventure plot, with the Vietnam conflict right in the rear-view mirror and the Cold War context. The technology is modern-ish, but pre-digital (to keep things interesting), and the period rock music played by the soldiers is still popular today.<br/><br/>King Kong purists may miss the Empire State Building, but for the purposes of the new Kong-Godzilla shared movie franchise, SKULL ISLAND's narrower focus seems appropriate, and this latest version of Kong manages to take a new approach to the mythos while honoring its legacy. This new Kong is still Kong, and maybe audiences will soon get to see this protector of mankind step in against other famous larger-than-life creatures."

","This is very thrilling movies its to be a nice storyYou know exactly what to expect from this film before walking into it and it doesn't let you down. Given the genre, it's no surprise that this monster movie is immensely formulaic but in its defence, it doesn't have one dull moment. Fast-paced and gripping, this reboot of the franchise is a taut survival drama that gives you the chills.<br/><br/>Sadly, no matter how talented, since Kong is the king, he renders the A- list cast redundant. His only competition is the monstrous lizards aka skull crawlers and the two giants pretty much rule the roost and hog the screen space, literally and figuratively.<br/><br/>Despite being clichéd, you enjoy the two species slugging it out in the jungle as the humans run helter-skelter, becoming the mere spectators. The CGI-fuelled action in 3D keeps you on the edge of your seat. Watching Kong smash a fleet of helicopters to the ground as we tend to crush mosquitoes is oddly entertaining. The witty repartee between characters makes up for the lack of depth and drama in the screenplay"
"MaximumMadness","6","2","4","25 May 2017"," ""Kong: Skull Island""- A trashy B-movie with a $180 million budget and an A-list cast. Whether that's for better or for worse is up to you to decide.
","Since the critical and commercial success of 2014's American ""Godzilla"" reboot, there have been consistent murmurings of a ""MonsterVerse"" courtesy production company Legendary Entertainment. The goal? Bring together various properties based on massive city-stomping creatures and remake them for modern audiences. And here, just a few short years later, we have the long-awaited second chapter in this expanding franchise- 2017's hammy and quirky, but fairly entertaining ""Kong: Skull Island"", based of course on the classic character King Kong of cinematic royalty.<br/><br/>Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, the film is very much a sort-of throwback feature, taking notes and inspiration from various trashy B monster-movies of the 60's, 70's and 80's and giving them a modern day spit-and-polish with top-notch CGI and A-list on-screen talent. The result is a troubled but fun little excursion into the unknown, with all the old tropes and clichés that we know and (maybe) love and plenty of contemporary action and effects. Really, the film is your basic creature feature and your enjoyment will be heavily reliant on your love for the old stereotypes contained within. If you can have fun with the material and look past its faults and occasional over- reliance on what's come before, you'll have a fun time. If not? Well, you best steer clear.<br/><br/>We follow a motley crew of characters in the 1970's from all walks of life... researchers, soldiers, a magazine photographer and a no- holds-barred anti-hero animal tracker- as they travel to the mythical ""Skull Island"", seemingly on a mission map out the only recently discovered landmass before the Russians. However, upon arrival, things take an interesting turn when it is discovered that the island is home to not only a local tribe of natives, but massive creatures of all types- including a great ape known as ""Kong."" Teaming up with a marooned World War II veteran, the group is forced into a fight to escape... but at the same time, a nefarious and over-the-edge Colonel amongst their numbers has his sights set on Kong for his own dark reasons...<br/><br/>To get it out of the way, the cast is great for the most part. There's a lot of really solid performers here. From the likes of cinematic icons such as Samuel L. Jackson and John Goodman to modern day superstars like Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston... to comedy powerhouses like John C. Reilly, everyone is on point and giving it their all. While I do think some of the minor supporting characters and performances come up short (Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham in particular both being shockingly flat in comparison to their other work as soldiers along for the mission), all the lead players do very good work here and are a joy to watch. Terry Notary and Toby Kebbell (who also plays one of the soldiers) provide the various motion capture techniques that bring Kong to life, and to be fair, Kong and their combined performances are quite stunning. While his screen time is limited, Kong feels like a real living, breathing being and you do get some real emotion from his character. While I could nit-pick and argue that I preferred the character as he was portrayed in the previous 2005 reboot... Kong is definitely in good hands in the MonsterVerse.<br/><br/>And when the film reaches its stride, it's just consistently fun and completely engaging. Director Vogt-Roberts delivers some wonderful visual powerhouse sequences of Kong and the other monsters of Skull Island going at it, and a few genuinely eerie moments as the characters struggle to survive. A stand-out scene involving a 10-story spider was among my favorite moments, as was a chilling bone-year chase sequence as our heroes must evade enormous underground creeps known as ""Skull Crawlers."" It's when the action picks up that the film started to win me over big-time, and I'm thankful that this point is reached relatively early on. <br/><br/>However, the film is not perfect by a long stretch, and looking over the other reviews, I can definitely see the problems. In striving to make such a fun throw-back feature, the creative minds behind ""Kong"" do shoot themselves in the foot more than once. We've seen this story before. We know these types of characters. And we've all witnessed these very same dialog exchanges and bar-room brawls and epic battles many times before. It can make the film a chore in its earlier scenes, and rob some of the suspense because we know what's coming much of the time. It can be fun in how archetypal it all is... but it can also be quite frustrating. In addition, the writing for the bulk of the supporting roles is pretty abysmal, with the many side-characters feeling vapid and interchangeable, which lessens the impact of the film. The intent is noble, but the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired at times.<br/><br/>Still, I had a decent time. The effects are outstanding, the performers likable and the monster battles completely and utterly glorious in their scale. ""Kong: Skull Island"" isn't the best film starring the massive monkey (I know he's not really a monkey)... but it's serviceable enough and sets the stage for other monsters to join in on the fun. It's a fun time at the movies. Nothing more. Nothing less. And so, I give it an about-average 6 out of 10."
"Jadamwood","7","2","4","7 May 2017"," A entertaining dumb monster movie, like it should be
","King Kong has more or less always been about a big monster ape who smashes things. However, this years Kong: Skull Island is so much overkill on that genre it's almost funny. Peter Jackson had a reasonably sized ape in the early 2000's KING KONG. This Kong is literally the size of the empire state building. It can palm throw a black hawk helicopter like a Hot Wheel. Does it make for great entertainment? Absolutely! If you want something that is similar to the newest Godzilla, some monster on monster fights, this is the movie for you. If you enjoyed the bit in Forest Gump where he goes to war in Vietnam, you'll feel right at home. Not much substance for thought, but a very good monster type adventure movie."
"and-charalambous","7","2","4","20 April 2017"," I had a good surprise when I went to watch this!
","I only saw one trailer before going so I had no spoiled scenes and I hadn't read any reviews like the low-starred ones that are probably going to be below my post and I am SO thankful I didn't do those things. Why? Kong Skull Island was an AMAZING monster movie, if not the best monster movie I have ever seen. Awesome visuals and music, good cast and OK story but the monster action in this movie was the BEST! Unlike Godzilla which takes like 1hr to be shown in the 2014 film, we get a look at Kong early on but also throughout the entire movie. In short, I loved it, my friends did as well. It might lack a bit of logic but to be honest, look at ANY action/adventure movie from Hollywood and you won't see any logic in it. So the people saying that in reviews in here are total hypocrites. People who enjoy movies like Fast and Furious would most likely like the movie. (I don't personally like the F&F franchise because it's TOO illogical and the performances kinda annoying)."
"The_Film_Anorak","5","2","4","6 April 2017"," A mediocre cover version of other films
","Kong: Skull Island is an updated version of the King Kong story, set in the 70s as the Vietnam War is coming to a close. It makes no reference to any other Kong incidents or story lines, with no continuity from the original King Kong or either of the remakes. The premise is that advances in satellite photography have revealed something interesting on a previously uncharted island in the Pacific, and a scientific expedition with military support sets off to discover its secrets. The era and location in which the film is set draw inspiration from Vietnam films, especially Apocalypse now, alongside Western and Asian monster movies. These inspirations and the look and sound of the film suggest it wants to evoke the atmosphere and mood of the 70s, and of the power of the modern world facing up to the awesome power of the natural world. None of these promises are delivered in the finished film, which only manages to be an average-quality blockbuster with impressive effects and nothing else to commend it.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that every theme and visual image has been done before, fairly extensively, as has every character and plot trope. This is at minimum the tenth Kong-related film unleashed on the public, along with countless pop-culture references to giant apes swiping at aircraft. Effects movies featuring giant creatures are standard fare for modern audiences, from Jurassic Park onward - and various plot lines from the Jurassic Park sequels show up here. That's not necessarily a problem, as most films these days do their fair share of recycling, but to stand out from the rest a film with such familiar content needs some sort of new element or fresh perspective. Kong: Skull Island simply doesn't have that.<br/><br/>The mediocre end result is all the more noticeable because it makes reference to a number of ideas that could have been interesting if they'd been explored more fully or given any kind of new twist. There are two different groups of scientists with different reasons for being there, and a sceptical government not sure of the value of being there. The military contingent on the expedition has different motivations and responds differently to events on the Island. There are references to the Cold War and Vietnam, and a couple of points about human impact on the environment and the need to look harder at what is the real danger they are facing. But none of it goes any further than a couple of quick references to establish the plot, in the same way that it gives you short bursts of various songs of the era before cutting them off.<br/><br/>The film also fails to do anything with its characters and the potential for conflict or drama between tired veterans of the Vietnam War, an anti- war photographer who might be seen as unpopular with the soldiers, and scientists with various agendas. Tom Hiddleston's character is a great example of how the cast is pretty much left hanging once they've been introduced. He is used pretty much as the theme park guide to shepherd the characters from Act 1 through to Act 3, and otherwise has nothing to do except look buff and stern while all hell breaks loose. It couldn't be more obvious that it's all an excuse for various large computer-generated images to bash seven shades out of other computer-generated images. The rest is just window dressing, an attempt to resonate with other, better films which makes it suffer by comparison. That makes the film a perfectly acceptable way to spend two hours, but no more than that. It will be forgotten long before the films it imitates because it doesn't give you anything or anyone to care about.<br/><br/>There are good things in the film, to be fair. The various action scenes are well-staged, with some lively creature battles and shocks and thrills. The third act is genuinely gripping, and Kong himself is very well- realised. The director makes good use of the locations and produces some striking visuals, albeit mostly referencing other films. Although they are mostly poorly-served by the finished script (Samuel L Jackson and John Goodman have particularly thankless tasks), the actors are all very watchable and make the most of any opportunity they get to shine. Brie Larson does a good job, and it can at least be said that the female characters are no more lacking in depth than their male counterparts. (The film does however conspicuously fail the Bechdel test). Perhaps the best thing in the film is John C. Reilly, who has the job of Basil Exposition filling in the gaps in the story while also providing a quirky charm and emotional core to the film. For all the film's weaknesses, it's reasonably entertaining overall and chugs along at a decent pace; it's certainly not a *bad* film, in the way that Batman vs Superman or the sequels to Transformers were bad. None of which gets past the fact this has all been done before, and better.<br/><br/>With the people involved, behind and in front of the camera, it had the potential to be a lot better than this. In the end the studio seems to have made sure no real individuality or originality was allowed to get in the way of their desire to sell popcorn and put some hollow spectacle on screen for a few weeks. They apparently hope to use this as a launch pad for more creature movies; they are presumably counting on box office returns rather than any real audience enthusiasm to support their plan."

","Jordan Vogt-Roberts (of the Sundance breakout The Kings of Summer previously) delivered a fresh, new experience that honours the essential elements of the iconic character and provides big, monster movie matinée for an epic fun-time. Written by Dan Gilroy (Nightcrawler), Max Borenstein (2014's Godzilla), and Derek Connolly (Jurassic World), the movie follows a team of scientists, soldiers, and adventurers on a journey to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific, as dangerous as it is beautiful.<br/><br/>If it was only spectacle and size that defined a great genre movie then 'Kong: Skull Island' would have had it all- unfortunately that's not the case. Size does matter, but not over and above aspects of story-telling and technicalities other than CGI, that help make a movie experience more real and involving. The representation of Kong as protector to the native tribesmen , other dwarfed inhabitants and aggressor to the bunched -up rest who puts his survival in peril, is also not clearly drawn. How does Kong differentiate between one human and the next, especially when they all come from the same group who invaded his island and made an attempt on his life? That's a question left unanswered.<br/><br/>Although none of that should bother you.<br/><br/>It's hard to hate on a movie that wants nothing more than to take you on a ride, and that's precisely what Kong: Skull Island does. With some truly jaw-dropping visuals from director of photography Larry Fong (of Watchmen, Lost, Super 8, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice), a colourful cast of thin but endearing characters, and some of the most bad-ass Kong action committed to the screen, Kong: Skull Island is a solidly entertaining entry in the ape's ever-expanding lore.

"Camelot_2000","8","0","0","4 July 2020"," A Misunderstood Ape
","I admit I've always liked King Kong, from that roaring 1933 B&W version to the man in the ape costume in the 1976 version. The ultimate portrayal though was in Peter Jackson's 2005 depiction of the monstrous primate. Naomi Watts was outstanding in her portrayal of the blond heroine who ""liked"" Kong and saw in him what nobody else could, that there was more to him than just a raging beast. He had a heart underneath and simply wanted to have the one he liked and who gave him enjoyment to be around.<br/><br/>I remember the 1976 version touched on Kong's sensitive and caring side when he placed Jessica Lange down as the planes were attacking him on top of The World Trade Centre and she screamed at him to pick her back up again to avoid the onslaught of fire power. I got teary eyed when I saw that scene at the theater as a kid, but after viewing it a couple of years ago on the movie channel with adult eyes, it's laughable now.<br/><br/>The ultimate version though has to be Peter Jackson's 2005 depiction. The Kong I liked was perfectly captured in CGI and was so well done that you can actually feel the emotions for that primitive and misunderstood creature. His ordeal on top of the Empire State Building strongly showed how much he cared for his blonde human and she for him.<br/><br/>Well, along comes this version and Kong this time is depicted as a raging and roaring ape on his home turf who seems dangerous and menacing at first, but is gradually looked upon as a savior of sorts. He's HUGE and appears to reach the upper heights of the atmosphere at times. He's also not one to mess around with when attacked by the bombs of military helicopters. This is also a pleasing version of him. He's seen as a dangerous threat at first to the Vietnam War crew from the 1970s who went there to discover an unknown realm of the world, but they grow to learn that he was just acting in self defense for their aggressive bombing of his island.<br/><br/>The one who truly stands for me though is John C. Reilly as A World War II Vet who had been stranded on Skull island for 29 years and who wanted to one day see his pregnant wife again. He also knew the true facts about Kong and how he could be a savior to those on the island, such as that native tribe he became a strong part of.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is indeed a pleasing movie though Samuel L. Jackson's part as an arrogant and ignorant Lieutenant Colonel bent on discovering the site of fallen comrades and ignoring all advice about the dangers of the island, gets tiring and annoying after awhile. Brutes like him have been portrayed much too often in war films.<br/><br/>Kong does spend a lot of time though looking majestically huge and angrily roaring, but his depiction in this version does bring overtones of Peter Jackson's 2005 Kong, though in a less humanly way. Kong is always in a rage and looks vicious to boot, but it fits the atmosphere of the story. Skull Island is not the most pleasant place to be. It's definitely not a tropical paradise like Hawaii, but it does carry about it a mysterious and intriguing element that is always captivating. I mean, who doesn't like mysterious lands where creatures out of the ordinary roam?<br/><br/>I do recommend this version of the gigantic ape though it's far from being the best version. Peter Jackson's 'King Kong"" is far the best out of them all, but don't hesitate to give this one a try. It's pleasing to watch and entertaining as well. It carries on the tradition of depicting Kong as not all bad, that there's more to him than just being a primitive and destructive ape. He has feelings too."

Like I said, I found this movie fun, entertaining, and a fast-paced ride. The cast was good and played their roles adequately. I also enjoyed some of the humor to the movie as well. Though, I have to admit I would like to see more of Tom Hiddleston's and Brie Larson's characters. Hopefully they are in a sequel. I thought the film made Kong out to be more of a protective guardian type which was alright with me. I liked to see a few more of the secondary character live. But, all in all, I enjoyed it. I guess if I had a complaint it would have been the lack of other prehistoric monsters in it. But, otherwise this is pure mindless, entertaining fun and should be viewed as such. Is it perfect no, but it is entertaining. The last time I listened to a critic about a movie I was bored out of my mind. So, if you want serious, critically acclaimed drama, this is not for you.

Unlike the many previous incarnations of the famous titular gorilla, this film introduced the idea to general audiences about Kong being a skyscraper-sized god-figure instead of an abnormally large jungle beast, akin to something along the lines of a wasei daikaiju eiga (translated into English as ""Japanese giant-monster movie"").<br/><br/>Knowing full well the film was going to be interconnected with Gareth Edwards' Godzilla (2014), I feared this would be yet another dull snooze-fest with no fun to be had. But luckily for me I was wrong, as Legendary Entertainment seemed to go out of their way to make this the complete polar-opposite to that boring trite (meaning we can now actually see the monster battles this time around as they occur onscreen during the daylight hours and overall, there's more of a focus placed on having naturally-flowing humorous levity which was much welcomed by me as it felt organic to the situations and not forced-in). I'd say the film as a whole has a pretty good level of satire, which works well in its favour.<br/><br/>Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts really managed to evoke a very strong sense of just how powerful this great ape actually is, which was effectively demonstrated by his presence alone (and he sure wasn't ashamed to embrace all the weird monster mayhem!). Another way of making this Kong standout from the rest is that they ever so slightly reinvented his beastly character to act more as the island's noble guardian who protects its native tribe of inland villagers from many nasty predatory monstrosities (while still staying true to the spirit of the original character).<br/><br/>Something I really admire about Kong: Skull Island is that, for the most part, it manages to avoid many of the typical cliche-plagued trappings you'd often see these modern, big-budget Hollywood blockbusters fall into nowadays, like a character heroically sacrificing himself to save the lives of his friends (only for his plan to backfire horribly on this occasion). And it even pokes fun at a few of these overplayed tropes, like when Brie Larson's monologue is abruptly interrupted by Samuel L. Jackson (whose character is consumed by feelings of revenge against Kong, in a scenario similar to that of Captain Ahab & Moby-Dick), or when the soldiers run away from the approaching danger by going straight ahead instead of doing the sensible thing and moving off to the side. Another good example is when John C. Reilly (this film's best character!) is spouting out a bunch of expositional dialogue that's supposed to explain the island's bizarre inhabitants to the team of scientists and instead of it just simply being one monotonously static scene, they kept the moment visually interesting by cutting away to different scenes of Kong going about his daily routine, casually jumping from mountain to mountain whilst keeping a watchful eye out for any oncoming trouble.<br/><br/>As for the movie's main antagonistic kaiju threat, the ominous boney-headed Skullcrawlers are a constant sinister presence stalking and devouring our disposable group of soldier side-characters around the island, with the nightmarish appearance and attributes of a ferociously menacing ambush killer. And most of the island's other terrifying yet majestic creatures, collectively known as ""flora-fauna"" (exotic animal-plant hybrid organisms), which are featured in the final cut are also creative enough to be memorable in their respective scenes.<br/><br/>Back when this came out, it was the first film in a good while that made me feel like I was actually being taken on a real thrilling adventure (probably helps that I went to see it in IMAX 3D). A big part of why I think it's so captivating to watch is the fact it was mostly shot on location and not entirely on a green-screen set, which then in turn adds an extra layer of grit and plausibility to the audience's mindset of this being a fantastical epic that's somewhat grounded in realism (also, the compositing of CGI into certain shots felt almost seamlessly done to perfection). And although composer Henry Jackman's musical score might not be all that great for listening to on its own when isolated from the movie on a soundtrack, it does manage to work very efficiently within the visual context of its accompanying sequences (however, all the licensed songs they acquired were some awsome choices).<br/><br/>Now, I don't really want to give away any major spoilers for the ending here, but all I'm going to say is that this movie's big finale has the most dynamically animalistic monster fight I honestly believe I've ever seen be put in a kaiju film (and with the addition of some explicit gory violence, it has to be the messiest monster brawl in recent kaiju history)."

","A team of military and scientists land on the uncharted Skull Island and run into giant ape King Kong, as well as a host of other huge, mainly unfriendly creatures.
Pretty dumb popcorn entry into the Kong series, this is an insult to the original. However 21st Century kids will more likely enjoy it for the non stop CGI mash up, as for me give me physical effects any day. Set in 1973 there is an attempt at making it cool by including a pretty impressive soundtrack. Mr cool himself, Samuel L Jackson, doesn't seem quite at home in this one, certainly not one of the better movies on his CV that's for sure. Going back to the effects personally I didn't find the CGI very impressive and the onslaught wore thin rather quickly.
There is a post credits sequence that suggests a sequel, I for one won't be holding my breath!"

","A triumph of CGI spectacle over plot and characterisation that seeks to draw parallels between Samuel L. jackson's megalomaniac desire to destroy Kong and US intervention in foreign conflicts.

"Matt345","Null","0","0","24 June 2019"," Bad script, mediocre director genuinely trying
","The first (new) King Kong by Peter Jackson wasn't exactly a ""cerebral"" or highly intelligent movie. However, it had a special something and even invented a kind of film-language for this little universe, which after all this movie is trying to follow for the most part. And it had some inventive visuals which I must say right away top this movie by many miles (no matter how unlikely that may sound). Even many critics found it quite alright and interesting, despite it being a monstrosity in every possible sense.
This movie on the other hand (and despite the caveats about the previous movie) has an ordinary dumb action blockbuster script that automatically makes it fail. One notices the director is genuinely trying to make the whole thing visually appealing and fun to watch, however he still lacks a ""special something"", which by the way I only acknolwedge Peter Jackson has in direct comparison to others, without me really liking his style nor thinking highly of all his choices. (Which I think found some of their worst excesses in the Hobbit-trilogy, almost making me doubt saying anything positive again, if there still weren't this direct comparison of Kong movies)."

The photography and vfx truly stunning. The story is what you'd expect from a Kong film with a lot of the usual Kong clichÃ©s, but it wouldn't be a Kong film without them.
It has a very contemporary message about the the insanity of the conflict between humanity and nature,to whom the earth really belongs.
Kong himself is magnificent, and the film style is something like a cross between Jurassic Park and the early Tomb Raider games. It is far better than the 2005 Peter Jackson version.

I've gotta say the 1st Act until the midpoint was extremely well crafted concerning the storyboards and building mysteries that sadly didn't work out in the end. Besides some very insightful comments on humans and the Vietnam war, some amazing artwork, good acting and very well crafted epic camerawork, the story sadly flattens out when it gets close to the end revealing that the film build mostly on secrets and mystery and when they disappear when we get into the crises of the story the screenwriting failed to lay a good unpredictable suspense so no more than action, some amazing VfX Work and the Resolution remains. That on its own was sadly a little bit unsatisfying. But as I sad: Glad that I watched it! Good to learn from, 2!"

","Well, if you are thinking about watching Kong: Skull Island, you probably have a pretty good idea of what to expect. And except one thing (no, they don't go to New York and climb skyscrapers - that is pretty obvious from the start) you are probably right.<br/><br/>You get one really big ape, a lot of other really big animals, a few monsters that come straight out of some other horror movie (they are really familiar - but for the life of me I cannot recall from where). And you get a dozen or so misplaced (regular sized (well except some egos maybe)) human beings with a lot of guns. The humans are misplaced because they are really out of their depth here and don't know what they are doing (except Hank Marlow (John C Rielly) but noone really listens to him anyway). Of course some one comes up with the great idea to kill Kong, and the hunt is on. And you probably already know how that goes as well.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is not for those who wants thrills in surprises. If you know a little about Kong lore, you probably can tell most of the story before watching. On the other hand, it doesn't disappoint those expectations either. It delivers exactly what is promised. This is certainly no masterpiece, but it is an entertaining ride for the full two hours. One thing should be said though, a lot of people die in a lot of gruesome ways, I actually expected a ""horror"" tag thrown in as a sub-genre. It wasn't but wouldn't be misplaced. Be warned if you dislike such scenes.<br/><br/>A few mentions about the actors. Samuel L Jackson is like the rest of the movie, as advertised. He has made his own niche (and does it good) and plays it once again. John C Rielly, mostly seen in comedies actually does a good role of the long lost/trapped flyer Marlow. It started out shaky with Rielly pulling some bad joke in his first scene, and I was afraid that he was about to be the designated comic sidekick (which had been quite out of place in the movie) that would have ruined the movie. But the character shaped up and became something much more and Rielly performed well. Fun to see Hiddleston not being Loke, this was a role that fit him well. Hope to see more of him in the future. And the same of Brie Larson (which is almost guaranteed as she is cast as Captain Marvel).<br/><br/>You shouldn't think or analyze these movies too much, but there is one big question that bothers me. Why, if you have helicopters with range weapons (guns), why do you not stay out of reach of the giant ape? Well, we seen it before and we will see it again."

","Anyone who watches this movie to find the atmosphere and the suspence of the first Kong will be deluded. The magic of Peter Jackson's Skull Iland is nowere to be found. First quarter of the movie create a good setup, but until they arrive at the iland it's just random things happening and incostincences. They tried to impress with dimensions and odd creatures, but in the end, the lack of caraterization and many messed up things makes this movie just as those old black and white movies with giant monsters fighting, done with colours and cgi.

"TheMovieDiorama","6","0","0","24 February 2018"," Kong: Skull Island is simply a mindless effects-driven popcorn blockbuster.
","All the mythos from 'King Kong', the setting of 'Apocalypse Now' and the character depth of 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. As part of Legendary's ""Gods & Monsters"" universe, we encounter Kong himself...without the Empire State Building. A group of soldiers, explorers, photographers, geologists, biologists and every other ""ologist"" venture forth to Skull Island. Uncharted territory, unique creatures and full of mysterious enigmas. What do they do? Drop seismic bombs. What the actual flip!? No scientist in their right mind would drop a barrage of bombs to determine the island's activity. It's unfortunate this occurs right at the start, it left a sour taste throughout the entire film. Which is a shame because the action, cinematography, sound effects and pacing were all decent. Watching Kong, in all his CGI glory, wreck through a fleet of helicopters by javelining trees, stomping on soldiers and just generally making a mess felt satisfying. Serves them right! You hurt nature, well...nature is just going to bite back, using a gargantuan primate's teeth. Really adored the cinematography and colour palette, embedding various micro slow motion shots to enhance the action. Green, red, blue...it's extremely colourful and vibrant. Unfortunately though, the characters are lifeless and wasted. I literally did not care for any of them...no wait, John C Reilly's character was likeable. That's about it. Eat them, shoot them, explode them, drown them, stomp on them, slap them onto mountain sides...I don't care. Which, in turn, makes the story all that much boring as well. What I admired about 'Godzilla' was that less is more. We see Kong in the first five minutes so there is no mystery or intrigue. It sounds like I'm being too harsh, I did enjoy this. The visual effects were splendid, action was well filmed and everything looked aesthetically pleasing. As I've said before in various reviews, style without substance does not make a great film. Kong versus Godzilla best be better."
"robertmaybeth","7","0","0","7 February 2018"," Starts off with much promise, then sinks
","I was impressed with the first hour of this... we are thrust into the world of a US Army unit busily packing up for the US exit from Vietnam in 1973. Commanded by Sam Jackson this unit gets redirected into a mission to assist a science team to plant ""seismic charges"" on a remote island. So far, so good, for the first hour this movie has exactly the perfect touch, all the required soldier talk deftly navigating away from the mawkish claptrap we've come to expect from movies of this genre. Jackson's Huey's fearlessly negotiate a truly scary unexplained storm only to find the team landed, crash or otherwise, on a mysterious, primordial island... the same game plan as every other kong movie of the last 30 years really but done much more watchably then most. We meet up with the John C. Reilly character (a truly talented actor who's all but wasted here, as he had plenty of scenes where he could have made the character a scene stealer but he's never let off the leash to do it.) a lost character who has been hanging out on the island far too long. <br/><br/>And with Reilly's character comes the rapid nose-dive of the movie. A whole bunch of way-too-convenient things fall into place just in time for the characters (some long-abandoned makeshift motorboats happen to start right up when the characters need them to, never mind they've been sitting idle since WW2) and the list goes on.<br/><br/>This was an unusual movie as most stinkers start out that way and get worse as they go, with plenty of warning to avoid wasting your time or entertainment dollar. This seems to almost be TWO movies, the one that is and the one that it should have been. That said, might be worth a look if your expectations are kept low - but I for one found the rapid-descent-into-crap a bit unnerving and not to mention, totally gratuitous, unnecessary and baffling... when you have 60 minutes of grade A material, why allow your production to junk the last half of the movie?"

","The initial plot of the movie sets right on spot since it is an unknown island which goes south within 2 minutes after entering the island.
Action is a non-stop with maybe brief pauses to get the story better and know the characters, which is a perfect pace for this kind of movie.
I also have to say that cgi, makeups, details of the enviroments from beginning to the end is one of the best.
There is few movies like this, and the only one to think about with such great details is no other than previous King Kong....this one also has lady-monster moments which is definitively a KingKong reference....nothing else to add or substract. 10/10"

","Well, Kong: Skull Island is as generic as they come. It's not exciting at all, but somewhat enjoyable and competent. No twists, no turns, it is what it is, also, it's Godzilla, except Kong.<br/><br/>Hiddleston money shot was kind of ridiculous; him demanding Reilly's sword, then the weird and badly executed slow motion through the ""toxic gas"", that didn't seem all that toxic, at all... Leaving Reilly without a weapon while those pterosaur's fly all over the place. That scene was just so transparent.<br/><br/>Another transparent, badly executed and forgettable scene was Shea's character sacrificing himself for the group... Just to have that ""skull-crawler"" inexplicably hit him with its tale instead of eating him. The movie straight cut to the next scene immediately afterwards, and nobody mourned and celebrated the poor sod.<br/><br/>The interaction/rapport between Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham was again so obvious in its failed attempt and Brie and Tom's chemistry was lacking.<br/><br/>The CGI wasn't bad, it was pretty good actually, and Skull Island (the CGI'd island itself) was quite satisfying... Though, why was there one of every animal, especially that gigantic insect with legs that look like the trees they were walking through? It was by far the most interesting threat, and when Reilly mentioned ""killer ants"", I thought he meant that creature, but, nothing came of that comment.<br/><br/>Also, Reilly said; ""You don't want to be out here at night"" in a very cautionary fashion, then, we never shown why the night is so dangerous.<br/><br/>Then the not so thrilling easter egg... Where I have a feeling Kong vs Godzilla is going to be just as dry as its origin build ups.<br/><br/>Oh well, like I said, generic, but somewhat enjoyable. 5.8/10."

The movie had some good POV shots and some Moments that surprised me in a good way.
The cinematography was Brilliant and The movie has so many fun and captivating scenes in it.I loved the scenes where we got to see king Kong fighting creatures, all of those scenes were very entertaining and the movie was very fast paced and Action packed.The Ending fight with King kong V.S the Main creature Was Great, the Fight was Epic and i was cheering for king kong to kick the creatures Ass.Despite being action packed the movie was still able to tell a good story at the same time.<br/><br/>It was interesting to see Tom Hiddleston as a good guy for once and I liked him in the movie and I thought his acting was pretty good.I also liked Brie Larson's character she was a fun and interesting character who had charisma.
I like Samuel L Jackson and John Goodman and it was nice to see them in the movie, they also played their parts well.
John C. Reilly was Great in his role too and it was nice to see him play a serious role instead of a comedy role.I thought he was the real stand out of the movie especially in the Emotional scenes, his character was very likeable and Fun to watch.

"gavinp9","5","0","0","2 January 2018"," Not horrible, but adds nothing to the King Kong mythology
","With almost no plot - island is hidden by a ""perpetual storm""!?! - not sure why this version of King Kong is set in 1973? At least it's not a direct re-make, but rather a sort of re-imagining. It has a good soundtrack - Stooges, Sabbath, Creedence, Bowie - and a few pretty good action/fight scenes. It's spends 30min introducing most of the characters and seeding a plot, but it seems pointless, since you hardly learn anyone's name. And as for the plot - not sure how it took three people to write this screenplay!<br/><br/>There seem to be a lot of shots that were made just for the trailer - zooming into Kong's eyes; Kong in front of giant sun/moon (how can you see either setting, if there's a perpetual storm?); 12 helicopters flying into the storm/sun; Kong slow-mo chest thumping. Kong's obviously not the bad guy, but he's not the star either - probably with less than 30min screen time, as he fights giant lizards. I'm not sure if Packard (Jackson) or Conrad (Hiddleston) is either, since no-one's the hero or has that much to do. Larson is OK, Goodman's wasted, but Marlow (Reilly) saves the day with some almost-humour. At least some of it was filmed in Queensland, although you can tell the bits that were filmed in Hawaii, as it looks like 'Jurassic Park'!<br/><br/>Of the three King Kong films I've seen (1933, 2005, 2017), this is probably my least favourite - they seem to be on a slowly-deteriorating scale. Also, what's up with Jackson's right eye near the end? It seems about 75% bigger than his left eye in a few shots! Anyway, predictable ending, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Hard to get too attached to Kong when we have such well-developed CGI characters in the current 'Planet of the Apes' series."

","A passable enough action film if you just want to plug into some decent battles between giant monsters, but be forewarned, I think even an action junkie will have to overlook quite a bit to love this film. I'm open-minded about sequels and imagine that Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack (directors of the outstanding 1933 original) would have loved to have the technology that went into this film available to them, but for me, ultimately 'Kong: Skull Island' wasn't all that satisfying. Unfortunately, far more effort was put into the CGI, battle scenes, and setting itself up for sequels than there was in the script, creating what are more than one-dimensional characters, and giving those characters motivations that made sense. It's too bad that the creativity used to create cool monsters wasn't used to avoid plot holes and clichés. Taken in the right spirit or with the right people (e.g. friends who can laugh at the silliness or maybe a young teen), there is some entertainment value here, but one can't help but wish the film was a complete package."

Where Godzilla was handsomely made, but ultimately dull and unsatisfying, Skull Island gives us more of the sorts of throw-downs we naturally would expect from this genre. It tries--not always successfully--to marry this to some deeper themes and allegory than it has the trunk space to carry, but it puts just enough meat on its bones to give it some heft. The cast is better than the characters they play, but the real star here is Kong anyway, and he's rendered exceptionally well.<br/><br/>Ultimately there are a number of commendable elements here, but when it was all over I couldn't help but feel that the whole was a tad less than the sum of its parts."

Cause visually it's breathtaking awesome, especially in big screen. And that's it. Film is not take itself too seriously at all and don't want to be anything more than an announcement King Kong in The MonsterVerse.<br/><br/>Everyone probably known that this film is part of The MonsterVerse (centered on a series of monster films featuring Godzilla and King Kong). The next film to be released will be Godzilla II, followed by Godzilla vs. Kong (2020). <br/><br/>I have one doubt only. Characters of Brie Larson and Tom Hiddlestone were superfluous in this film. Seems like they were called only for loud names in title. Probably they will play main roles in future films, but this bringing another question with time-frame. Story of Godzilla (2004) happens in nowadays, Kong in 1973. We don't know Kong's lifespan. But we know there will be film Godzilla vs. Kong. So, if these characters will back to franchise how old they will be?"

","I'll start by saying I feel compelled to leave my opinion on this film here because of all the overwhelmingly negative reviews pasted to this site. I genuinely believe the majority of these film-goers did not watch this film with proper expectations. How you can be disappointed with this movie boggles the mind. Perhaps I connected with the film due to my childhood love for monster movies, having grown up on renting Godzilla, Gamera, King Kong, and other VHSes. <br/><br/>At its core Kong:Skull Island is a classic B-movie monster flick. We have a cast of colorful characters marooned on an island of deadly beasts. What follows the brief setup of why they're there is a good- time monster romp full of non-stop action and gorgeous visuals. Its a bloody good time, pg-13 violence aside.<br/><br/>The setup is pretty cool, giving us the origins of a monster-hunting agency out to find Kaiju after reports flood in of mysterious run- ins with legendary beasts. Goodman is as always spot-on, if a bit under-utilized, as the enigmatic leader of Monarch. He syncs up with Samuel L. Jackson, who does a dazzling job as the leader of his ragtag group of Vietnam vets. The group of soldiers all do great in their own right, but their inevitable deaths are never felt by the audience because we all know they're really there to be monster- fodder. Hiddleston and Larson are passable as the dynamic, handsome leading couple (of sorts, they never spark much of an on screen connection and the movie bypasses any stereotypical love plot) but are honestly never given much to do. Larson in particular is used poorly, and isn't given much of a chance to shine in the boy's club of a cast. This aside, the absolute standout of the cast is John C. Reilly. He seems to truly be at home and having a blast playing a WW2 pilot who crash-landed on the island and has been stranded there for 30 years. Reilly is at once comic relief and exposition, giving his experience on the island to other characters and helping explain the environment they are as well stranded in. The jokes are great and never fall flat. <br/><br/>As soon as the cast arrives on the island, things kick into immediate overdrive. Kong shows up very quickly and causes all sorts of hell for the helicopter squadron. From there, it's non-stop thrills and chills as the team is split up and taken out one-by-one. <br/><br/>The visuals are spectacular, from the special effects to the cinematography. A lot of care went into this production and the results absolutely shine. Its a gorgeous film, with endless eye candy. <br/><br/>Now before you think I'm judging this film on just its style over its substance, I believe it handled the concept of Kong in an new and refreshing way. The monsters inhabiting the island are reminiscent of the pre-historic world themes the original classic utilized, but remain fresh in their design. The ""Skull Crawlers"" are stand-out monster villains and are given a creepy and cool design that puts them above the pack of average CGI monsters. <br/><br/>The background is rife with detail, particularly in the village of the local residents of Skull Island. They live in the burnt out wreckage of ships that have run-aground on the isle and the design of the village is very interesting. <br/><br/>The film also runs with the theme that 2014's Godzilla had (which now is a shared cinematic universe with Kong, call me excited), in that Kong is a great equalizer. He exists to ensure that other creatures like the Skull Crawlers don't take over the habitat of the island. I think this adds a regal nature to his character and elevates him above his ""misunderstood beast"" persona that has been explored in the three previous renditions of Kong. <br/><br/>That leaves me with my final praise for the film, Kong himself. He's never looked better, and his size adds a formidable power that a smaller Kong lacks. You could argue this removes any subtlety to the character, but if you were paying attention you'd see I enjoy this film for its loud, proud presentation of a classic character. <br/><br/>Kong:Skull Island is a good time that doesn't require a lot of thought, nor does it ever ask that much from you. If you can appreciate b- movie cinema, give this one an absolute look. It's an absolute blast."
"rolfesam","5","0","0","14 August 2017"," Not the Great Ape's finest hour but not his worst
","Kong: Skull Island is a decent movie, not a great one but is enjoyable enough to enjoy. Tom Hiddleston plays the main character who is pretty bland unfortunately as is John Goodman's role in the flick. really if you have seen a modern American monster movie then you have seen these two characters over and over again to the point that it really isn't the enjoyable portion of the movie. Really I can say the same for Sam Jackson's role in the movie but since it is Sam Jackson in the role he automatically makes the role more enjoyable than it has much of a right to be. Really the only really interesting character is that of John C. Rielly who is the focus of the easily best scenes of the movie which makes the movie much more enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>But you didn't come to this movie for characters did you? You came for a monster and for a monster fight didn't you? Well lucky for you the special effects are actually really good. better than I thought a movie like this would actually have. The fights themselves are decent enough but they feel like they kind of come out of nowhere with very little build up from the film. <br/><br/>Really I'm not convinced that I want to recommend because if you want to watch a good modern monster fight then there's Pacific Rim, if you wanted a monster flick with better character there's Monster, and really if you want a better King Kong movie there's the original so I really couldn't recommend this as freely as I feel I should be able to."

","So I wasn't aware that black Sabbath performed paranoid in 1973? Apparently these Vietnam vets blast future music while bombing islands.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson has over stayed his welcome. I can't be the only person tired of seeing him in every freaking movie.

"mickeymouse-03411","9","0","0","10 August 2017"," Slow starter that finished with a pace hotter than Usain Bolt
","I bought this film because I love Tom Hiddleston, but wasn't really sure whether it would be any good. It started slowly and looked like it might follow a repeat course of many of the other King Kong films, but I was extremely pleasantly surprised that this really picked up the pace and turned into a real corker of a film. It is all about the action with not enough investment in character back stories although that may or may not be remedied in the not too distant future. If you are after a good old fashioned action romp with some nice twists to the story lines to keep the kids and yourself entertained then this is more than worth watching."

","I was a fan of this movie and the people who were chosen as the main characters. The director has a brilliant mind for adventure and made Kong: Skull Island in his artistic vision the best way he could. However, who can live up to the original? When I left the theater, I felt that I watched 2014 Godzilla, 2016 Independence Day: Resurgent and 2016 The Legend of Tarzan all in one movie. All outdoor based, all adventure based and all Action/ Sci-Fi based. If you are a fan of any of these three movies or genre's, You will enjoy Kong: Skull Island."
"templar77099","6","0","0","7 August 2017"," Good popcorn Cinema
","Cool, neat, stylish, but not much more. It certainly fell a bit short, specially considering the source material it had to work upon. Visually it is quite interesting, though sometimes a bit oversaturated in colour. With that said, half of its scenes were a bit overdone and overstylized and its no good. I mean, most of the characters scenes seemed like this - ""Oh, we're cool, lets make badass poses to the slow-mo"". And its just that, for almost two hours. To make it justice, it does feauture an awesome soundtrack - but its the 70s, how could they go wrong? . Its a fun decent blockbuster but it ends there. Kong was the great attraction of it - they didn't hide him, just put him in the open and that was a very good decision. The mega-fights are also quite entertaining and give you a big sense of scale and intensity."

"danspam-65136","9","0","0","30 July 2017"," Would have been better with more beasts
","I don't take the time to review a lot of movies, but I did this one because it was really good, I thought. For what it was, you have to go in with the expectations that this is a King Kong movie. A read several negative reviewers who seems to somehow miss this. Like they thought they were going to a beer tasting event and were all surprised when it wasn't whiskey.<br/><br/>What I liked the most about this, was that there were several encounters with ""Kong"" sized beasts. My only complaint there would be that I would like to have seen more.<br/><br/>I thought the battle scenes were great. Regardless of the reason that brought them to the island, it's all really secondary. This is a movie about a giant gorilla. While the surrounding story matters some, it's little. People who actually want to see a King Kong movie, are interesting in the anomaly and mystique of a giant gorilla and other animals who far surpass their natural / normal size, and what it would be like to experience that. I thought this movie really delivered visually on that, and again the fight scenes were very entertaining.<br/><br/>SPOILER: The King Kong in this movie is kind towards humans (unless they are trying to kill him), and I think this is solved by the fact they are similar in design (primarily bipedal, arms, legs, etc), which he finds something about that worth protecting. I really would have liked to have seen Kong locate others still alive, with which he would reproduce. There is not evidence that is the case in this one, since all his family was killed. Perhaps room for another movie since the island was not explored fully.<br/><br/>The thing that made the least sense, you might say, is how this ""skull crawler"" was relatively easy for Kong, considering his various handicaps at times, yet this ""big one"" was supposedly responsible for killing all the other giant gorillas? I'm not sure how that was supposed to work or why they were so easily overpowered to have killed all of them. That made the story not make a lot of sense to me, in a logical way."

","In 1973, Bill Randa (John Goodman) convinces a US Senator to fund and supply military escorts to an Island recently discovered that may prove to be of geological significance and the United States should get there before Russia. <br/><br/>This is, by far, the best King Kong movie ever. The Island is perpetually surrounded by very fierce storms and when you see the storms from the approaching ship that house the helicopters to ferry everyone to the Island, you won't believe people would actually decide to go thru this kind of vicious storm. Cringing from my couch I couldn't believe it either. (Hey, it's only a movie) <br/><br/>It doesn't take long for Kong to make his presence known. And it doesn't take long to discover the real reason Bill Randa wanted to go back to this island. He knows what is there. <br/><br/>We get to meet Lt Hank Marlowe (John C. Reilly) who was shot down during WWII. The movie opens with a Japanese and American parachuting from their shot-up planes confronting each other ready to kill but are interrupted by King Kong. <br/><br/>We see that Marlowe has lived among the natives there who fear the giant lizards (among other things) who live beneath the Earth. King Kong protects the natives from the Lizards. The military led by Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) wants to kill Kong for what he (Kong) unleased on Packard's men flying in with their helicopters. Those scenes are simply breathtaking and you will come to believe you are there. Scary? Yes. <br/><br/>The CGI is so spectacular there are no words to do it justice. Kudos! Kudos! Kudos! The photography and cinematography are also spectacular. More Kudos. Acting all around is very good too. <br/><br/>Brie Larson as Mason Weaver is an ""antiwar"" photographer (her words) and she constantly takes pictures. I was amazed she never ran out of film using something like an Argus C3 or C4 but with an added viewer. (Hey, it's a movie and like a dream anything is possible so there is no running out of film or anything )<br/><br/>The group encounters giant spiders, and lizards who look upon the group as food. Once the group knows the real reason Bill Randa wanted to go to this island, the focus now is on getting off the Island. The rest of the movie has the group facing other lizards and trying to get to the North part of the Island where helicopters will ferry them to the ship. The last big dramatic scene has King Kong fighting the very BIG Lizard. Again, these scenes are so good you believe they are truly real. More Kudos. <br/><br/>Okay, okay we all remember Fay Wray with King Kong in another Kong movie. Do we think we will see this Kong protect our limitless film photographer Mason Weaver? Stay tuned.<br/><br/>And stay tuned after the credits run as there is more movie to see. I couldn't believe all the people involved in making this movie and you won't either. But stay and see the last scenes to the movie and here you will come to believe there will be a Kong 2. Can't wait. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes, Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Brief soft stuff only. Should small children watch? Only if you think they can handle it. Sometimes frightening and scary as I can attest to it being so. Hey, I cringed and jumped at times. <br/><br/>Rating: A"

"alanpgini","8","0","0","18 July 2017"," Same Kong, but maybe a different future
","What elevated this for me from a seven to an eight for, was that at the end of the final credits, we had a scene that leads you to believe there will be a sequel. And not the standard sequel that would normally follow the island chapter of King Kong. Overall, this Kong is the same formula as all the Kongs, with only cosmetic changes in motivations, Villagers, visitors, beastly antagonists, island, the same large monkey. There were tweaks, with a military aspect on the island, as well as a castaway, that helped to broaden its framework. Ever sine 76, we have had Kong remakes that have accelerated and condensed into smaller and smaller time frames between Kongs. I don't get this. Is Hollywood really that stupid? Maybe. But this time, there is at least a hope for something different in the future. If you keep remaking the wheel, its going to go flat eventually. If what I see is true, then there are possibilities here. The acting was good as you would expect from a block-buster. Huddleston was good, as was Larson and Jackson. and Goodman was as good as he usually is, this time with less to flesh out his character as well. The flick is worth the watch. Lets hope the sequels don't disappoint."
"tomgillespie2002","6","0","0","11 July 2017"," It certainly entertains
","The title of this latest movie to feature cinema's most famous giant ape, King Kong, refers to the beast's misty and unexplored home in Indonesia, or the Pacific Ocean, or the Indian Ocean, depending on which incarnation you happen to be watching. It's a world known to movie fans to be full of prehistoric or unnaturally gigantic monsters, and things are very much the same in Jordan Vogt-Roberts' entertaining big-budget update. Anyone fearing a retread of the story told back in 1933 and never bettered since can relax, as Kong: Skull Island is less interested in exploring the incredibly fragile relationship between man and nature than it is with smashing helicopters to pieces in front of a gorgeous sunset.<br/><br/>Both a follow-up to 2014's Godzilla and a build-up to the upcoming smack-down cross-over between two of the big screen's most famous abominations, Kong carries on the tone by making its human characters infinitely less interesting than the big guy we all came to see. Early trailers and posters before the film's release teased a tone akin to the great Vietnam War , especially Apocalypse Now, but there are little similarities other than the famous shot from Coppola's movie of helicopters flying by a setting sun and the 1973 setting. This is big, dumb fun, and little more, but that is by no means a bad thing. Peter Jackson tried earnestly back in 2005 to tell the traditional story with a mixture of heart and spectacle, with mixed results. It climaxed with the ape's relocation to the mainland and his tragic end at the top of the Empire State Building, but here, once government agents/scientists Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) seal the required funds and hit the island, we never leave.<br/><br/>At just shy of 2 hours, Skull Island struggles to handle the unnecessarily expansive cast of characters, and boy are they bland. Tom Hiddleston's British Special Forces captain James Conrad (an obvious nod to Heart of Darkness author Joseph Conrad) is the closest thing we have to a lead, but this is only because he is handsome and warns the others of danger. They are escorted by Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard, a Lieutenant Colonel in charge of a helicopter squadron called the Sky Devils whose idea of scientific study is to bomb the s**t out of the island upon arrival. Among the rag-tag bunch of monkey-food soldiers are the grizzled Cole (Shea Whigham), and Jack Chapman (Toby Kebbell, who also performs the motion-capture for Kong), an eager-to-please young buck with a questionable American accent. In a somewhat baffling move, they also invite photojournalist Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) on a mission you would expect the Army to want to keep quiet.<br/><br/>At one point, I counted three concurrent story lines. Supporting characters such as John Ortiz's Nieves and Tian Jing's San are played by familiar faces but serve absolutely no purpose, and only John C. Reilly's stranded World War II veteran Hank Marlow brings any heart and soul to the story. Yet, Roberts knows how to make carnage look incredibly cool, and this is the meanest, leanest and biggest Kong to date. Helicopters are torn to shreds, a giant octopus (living in fresh water?) is brutally devoured, and soldiers are swallowed whole - Kong doesn't have time to share a tender moment with a beautiful woman lying in his palm. When the action shifts away from the puny humans and to the titular powerhouse, the film is so damn exciting that you can, for a short time, forgive the film's many misgivings and clichés. It's unlikely that the 1933 original will ever be topped, so it's pleasing that Kong: Skull Island at least makes an attempt to try something a little different. For a B-movie dressed up as an A-movie with only one memorable character who isn't simian, it certainly entertains."

","Kong: Skull Island<br/><br/>The most exciting aspect of finding a giant monkey is all the cosmetic testing you can conduct on it.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the simian in this adventure picture isn't wearing any mascara yet.<br/><br/>Dispatched by the military to map out Skull Island, Lt.

One of its major problems was the villain lizard thingy in the movie which for the whole entire movie concentrated on.

"AnishMisra","7","0","0","2 July 2017"," Kong Skull Island Review
","Kong Skull Island is a film directed by Jordan Vogt Roberts. Now i have only seen the 2005 King Kong version. And from just the trailers, I guessed that it would be actually a sin to compare that film with this film. But I wasn't entirely disappointed either with the film. Yes, it has some flaws but it is a good film.<br/><br/>Plot: Billy Randa leads a team of people into the uncharted area of Skull Island.<br/><br/>Story and direction: I judged this film being independent of the other King Kong films that have been out. The story basically has nothing new to it. The film heavily relied on VFX to tell the story which I think is not good. Also the emotional content of the film is very much missing. The most part of the film has been concentrating on action. Action is OK, but there should be something to make you glue to that screen of yours. At times, it kept me glued. But at times, not. Even some of the characters are not built properly. Like Weaver's character. I don't understand why a photographer needed to go on this expedition. And when you are running for your life you will click photos!!! Come on, be serious. Even Conrad wasn't portrayed well in terms of character. Now since I watched this as an action film, I wasn't much disappointed. At the end, this was basically a franchise building film since we have a post credit sequence too for the upcoming films in the MonsterVerse.<br/><br/>Acting: Tom Hiddleston was the macho person in the entire group. Loved him. Brie Larson had nothing much to do which was disappointing. Sam Jackson was being himself. I had a shock from John Reily. He delivered some what a good performance. John Goodman was good too.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: The climatic battle between Kong and the lizard type creature was awesome. My jaw dropped in that scene. The VFX too was excellent in that scene.<br/><br/>Verdict: Do watch this as a pure action film. It is not the best King Kong film (of course) but not even that bad too.<br/><br/>I am giving it a 7.5/10."

","So here comes second one in the monsterverse universe and it's quite good. This king is more about action, blood and violence. The film is only enjoyable on big screen as a pure popcorn entertainment filled with all kind of cheesy filmaking techniques but Kong do stand as the king in this movie. It's a full on visual spectacle of it's own kind. Don't except stellar story and sharp script. The movie is not so great in art of filmmaking but is hell of an entertaining ride. Although nowhere near the 2005 version which even won Oscar for special effects and had a love story at it's heart but in this there is no love story and no Empire State so it's not exactly superb but it did one thing right.

"SteveResin","8","0","0","25 June 2017"," Skull Candy
","I thoroughly enjoyed Kong: Skull Island, for a few simple reasons. There's no obligatory romance distracting from the action, the visuals are absolutely stunning, the action is frantic, the characters are likable and the acting is first class. It was such a relief to see an action movie without long, drawn out scenes of pointless exposition or tired romantic tropes. Skull Island just gets down to business from the opening scene and doesn't let up until it's over.<br/><br/>The story is simple and not drawn out or blown up into tedious proportions. At the end of the Vietnam War a secret division of the US Government called Monarch discover the location of a mythical island and decide to investigate and map it before the ""Commies"" get a chance to after the war ends. After breaking through an almost impenetrable storm that surrounds the place all hell breaks loose, as Kong arrives and wreaks havoc. With limited time until a possible extraction the survivors of the team have to make it to the far end of the island within 3 days, through a perilous jungle of prehistoric and mythical creatures. It's like Jurassic Park on steroids.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson's character is interesting, at first sight he seems despondent that the Vietnam War is ending. The truth is he doesn't want war to end, he's become obsessed with war and is determined to die a soldier, so his later decision to abandon all sense and hunt Kong down to the detriment of an escape plan fits perfectly with the little we know of him. Tom Hiddleston is great as the tracker, Brie Larson and John Goodman have fun with their roles but the star of the show (Kong aside) is John C Reilly as a WWII pilot marooned on the island since 1945. He's a little stir crazy shall we say, and has some fun quips and an entertaining personality. Even the supporting cast are quite memorable and thankfully not one of them was annoying or incredulous. <br/><br/>The SFX are phenomenal. Kong has never looked better. The other creatures are inventive and interesting. It has a fun Vietnam-era soundtrack, and includes a great scene where they fly into the Island Apocalypse Now style with Paranoid by Black Sabbath blasting out of the speakers. That alone tells you this movie is not to be taking seriously, it's just a fun monster movie in the classic Kong and Godzilla mode, sit back and enjoy the fireworks and leave the pathos and hand wringing to other mediums. <br/><br/>8 out of 10 bananas."

Jackson), his right Major Jack Chapman (Toby Kebbell) and Captain Earl Cole (Shea Whigham), and the Vietnam War veteran helicopter squadron, the Sky Devils, to escort them to the island, they are also joined by pacifist photojournalist Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). Arriving on Skull Island, besides Conrad's objections, the men drop explosives developed by seismologist Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins), to determine if the ground is hollow. Suddenly the helicopters are attacked by a 100 foot-tall bipedal ape, most are destroyed, the survivors escape those that crash, they know their only hope is that a resupply team will meet them at the island's northern end in three days time. They split into two groups, Packard confronts Randa, holding him at gunpoint for an explanation, Randa reveals he is part of a secret government organisation called Monarch, and the real purpose of the expedition is to acquire proof of the existence of forgotten monsters, Randa also mentions seeing a monster attack a Navy ship himself. The dead comrades are buried by Packard and his men, they begin searching for the missing members of the expedition, including Chapman, they encounter a giant spider-like creature that attacks them. While Conrad, Weaver, Brooks, biologist San Lin (Tian Jing), soldier Reg Slivko (Thomas Mann), Landsat employee Victor Nieves (John Ortiz) and others encounter the local Iwi natives, and they meet American pilot Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), who crashed on the island in 1944, during World War II. Marlow reveals that the giant ape, known as Kong, is worshipped as a god by the natives, he is the last of his kind, and he is the island's guardian, protecting the people from reptilian underground monsters, called Skullcrawlers, the creatures killed Japanese pilot Gunpei Ikari (Miyavi), who also landed on the island with Marlow. Marlow explains that Kong only attacked the helicopters to stop the bombs waking the ""Big One"", meanwhile, miles away, Chapman is alive, he witnesses Kong wrestling and defeating a giant octopus, Chapman flees to the woods, he encounters a giant stick insect, before being eaten by a Skullcrawler. Weaver is awed by the compassion of Kong after the ape saves her from an encounter with a giant sker buffalo, following this Conrad's group set off in a boat down, built by Marlow and the now-deceased Ikari, built from parts of their crashed planes. Following an attack by pterosaur-like creatures called Leafwings, and Nieves being killed, the survivors connect with Packard, he insists on continuing the search for Chapman, Marlow reluctantly leads the team to the Forbidden Zone, a forgotten battleground between Kong's ancestors and the Skullcrawlers. The same Skullcrawler that killed Chapman devours Randa and massacres many soldier, it is killed by Weaver triggering an explosion, a vengeful Packard blames Kong for the deaths of his men, he plans to trap and kill Kong, while Conrad will lead the non-military personnel back to northern end to rendezvous with the resupply team. While scouting the path ahead, Conrad and Weaver encounter Kong up-close and personal, they and Marlow resolve to save him, Packard's trap incapacitates Kong and he wants the men to set explosives around the ape. Before Packard can kill Kong, Conrad's group intervenes, Conrad and Weaver convince the other soldiers to spare Kong, but Packard is consumed with lust for revenge and refuses to back down, then suddenly ""the big one"" appears, an enormous alpha Skullcrawler, all but Packard flee when it attacks. An injured Kong recovers and crushes Packard to death, Kong is overpowered by the Skullcrawler, the survivors are chased towards the shore, Cole fails to kill the Skullcrawler in a suicidal strike, the humans are cornered, but Kong returns and successfully kills the creature, ripping its guts out through its mouth. In the end, Kong allows the surviving humans to leave, but more helicopters are approaching the island, Kong awaits their arrival, it is unclear what will happen next, also sometime later Marlow returns home to his family, his wife and now grown up son, who have not seen him since the war. In the post-credits sequence, there is a reference to the existence of other monsters, including Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah, the roar of Godzilla hints that maybe there will be a follow-up where Kong and Godzilla will meet. Also starring Jason Mitchell as Mills, Marc Evan Jackson as Landsat Steve, Richard Jenkins as Senator Willis and Robert Taylor as Athena Captain. The cast all do their parts well, the story is nice and simple, obviously this reboot is different as Kong never goes to New York or to the top of the Empire State Building, but it doesn't matter, there are plenty of exciting sequences, and the brilliant special effects bring to life the gigantic gorilla and many nasty creatures in the one location, a worthwhile return to the franchise, a terrific fantasy action adventure, It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Very good!"

","Seldom you will find me writing a review here, but I am so angry after watching this tripe that I need to let my frustration out :This hollywooddisaster called Kong : Skull Island, shows exactly what is wrong with hollywood ( notice the small letters, because they are for a long time not big anymore) I dearly remember the original King Kong movie, back in former age : perhaps the animation etc was not up to standards we now know, but we could BELIEVE in the characters portrayed, we COULD FEEL empathy with them, We could live happily in the fantasy story. Look at this rip off of ripoffs ; nothing of the former noted. Hollywood has become a special effects machine, mostly filled with a lot of violence (but no boobies because that supposedly by these producers could be offensive (?!!!) ) Violence, action, no story, no acting needed anymore these last ten years or so. this garbage is a perfect example how hollywood nowadays denies their roots, and just complies by what they think is what moviegoers nowadays want to see. I will not go into all the stupid inaddequasies in the movie, as many, thank Kong !, already did before me, we, movielovers are surely not taken seriously sad sad sad, the cinema screen now belongs to violent, and/or bloody action movies, not to watch a well written, well acted, well produced story, alas ; but we still have Europeen Cinema !"

"davideo-2","4","3","8","11 April 2017"," Flat, soulless addition to the Kong staple
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>It is 1973, the Vietnam war is coming to an end and a couple of scientists, headed by Dr. Bill Randa (John Goodman) persuade congress to fund a trip to a far off island to examine some environmental effects (or something.) They assemble a crack team of experts, including Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), and head off, but what they don't expect to encounter is an undiscovered tribe of natives, and an island inhabited by monsters, most notably, the massive, mighty Kong. Things get heated when men are killed and Colonel Packard turns hostile.<br/><br/>It's pretty safe to say that Kong is one of the most enduring franchises in film history. Since his first outing in the early thirties, he has been re-adapted for the screen several times, with varying degrees of success, but it's probably retained a lot of its appeal by sticking to a period time frame, at least in the 2005 version I saw, while I'm not really sure about the lambasted 1976 version that I didn't. By never branching out into present day and keeping a nostalgic sense of times gone by to give it a distinctive touch. And so this new addition has rolled by, but in spite of some awesome special effects, it's a totally underwhelming spectacle compared to the ones that have gone before.<br/><br/>Another device the previous instalments of Kong employed was to build up a great sense of mystery and awe before the great beast unveiled himself on the screen, creating a sense of foreboding and tension before he is seen, yet in Jordan Vogt-Roberts's flat imagining, he appears almost immediately upon arrival at Skull Island and it just gets more derivative from there. Not that you'll care about the fate of anyone, as an all star cast manage to portray a selection of the most bland, stalemate characters you could ever imagine, compered with an implausible non-entity of a plot.<br/><br/>The effects are as awesome as ever, but this just doesn't have anything else going for it to justify such a lengthy running time. **"

Some may say....well maybe it was just the movie Theatre I went to NOPE I actually refused to believe that a movie could be done in this poor of a quality.

","Kong is a great movie that, with a lot of especial effects, take us to an imaginary world. This film is excellent to a person that likes action and adventure.

"samyoung-82648","8","3","8","14 March 2017"," A hark back to movies from a few decades ago!!
","Most movies today completely rewrite history. Both in terms of events and behaviours of characters. A great example of this is Rose in Titanic who sprouts off a love of Freud and Picasso. This movie harks back a few decades and does an extremely good job at portraying the genders from the 70s in an honest and realistic fashion. This will most probably infuriate sexist people like feminists as it contradicts almost everything they say. In particular, I enjoyed the sass of the female photographer (you know, when women were supposedly obedient little zombies, which they -never- have been..)<br/><br/>The movie is a combination of old school war movie and action flick. I'm not a big fan of most war movies, however, they played this one well. You get some semblance of testosterone but it's fairly tame compared to movies like Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>What this movie does that's unique is that there are male characters with a spine (very rare in movies today - see the new Star Wars movies as an example of modern propaganda). They don't behave in a particularly sexist or idiotic fashion (again, rare for today's standards, but was very common to see decent male characters up until a few years ago. Now ""revisionism"" is the norm thanks to feminism).<br/><br/>The special effects are very well done. The scale of the digital effects is impressive. It is reminiscent of films like BFG and Hugo. It gives you a great appreciation for just how big some of these creatures are.<br/><br/>The acting on the whole is solid. In fact, i'm hard pressed to think of a character who is a let down. The weakest of the characters is probably Jing Tian who feels out of place.<br/><br/>if you're looking for something very fresh (and retro) from Hollywood (especially if you're sick of EVERY movie having an over- aggressive female lead and all-male idiot cast) then this is the movie for you. If you're a feminist, I strongly suggest you avoid this one as you will be highly offended that all males aren't weak, sexist idiots.<br/><br/>I'd most probably suggest the movie as being suitable for 12 years and over. There is some violence and plenty of scenes to get the adrenaline flowing.<br/><br/>Well done Hollywood. This shows that you can make a movie without extreme sexism, even if it's only occasionally.<br/><br/>+Sexism Free, Realistic Portrayal of genders from the 70s, Very good digital effects<br/><br/>-Nothing exceptional other than its lack of sexism (which is rare)"
"paulspencer-90394","6","3","8","9 March 2017"," If you are a writer, this is an interesting film to watch.
","What do I mean by the summary? Essentially the film is not quite the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>Lets start with what every writer knows you need for a good story - beginning, middle and end. The film starts with a quick flashback to ww2, then moves through the decades until we get to the 70's. People want to go to skull island. And a group of people go there. But I was never sure of the exact reason why everyone was going. This was because there were too many characters. The script should have got rid of half of them, or merged them into one person, otherwise they clogged the story.<br/><br/>But maybe someone said that the more people who land on the island, the more ways you have to kill them, so they stayed in the script. And what we get is an hour of people being killed. The only characters that you have any interest in a Samuel Jackson's and John C. Reilly's. They are great in their respective roles. One wants to kill Kong, the other wants to save him. And if you had two hours of that it would have been a great film. But instead there is the ticking clock of trying to get off the island before the rescue team leave, and the threat of being eaten by the baddie creatures.<br/><br/>The end was weak. I found it interesting that they showed what happened to Reilly's character as the epilogue, again probably because he was the star of the show.<br/><br/>The cinematography was good, and the special effects were as well. Tom Hiddlestones acting was weak, but that might be because his character was badly written. Like many of the others, he had no character arc, and merely said a few lines ever couple of minutes.<br/><br/>The music was good, but that maybe an age thing (and could it also be the reason why I liked the two older actors the best?) I went with my son, and he thought it was OK, but would have liked more jokes.<br/><br/>Maybe that it the issue with the film as a whole. No one wants to make a 150 million special effects comedy; you don't want to fall into the Jurassic Park camp of throwing kids onto the island and watch them try to escape. You want the option of making a film good enough to stand on its own, but with enough avenues to create a series.<br/><br/>There were times when I sat watching it, thinking how I would have written it. So is it worth watching? Yes, but only on the big screen, and only once."

Terrible Dialogue 5.One shred of redemption <br/><br/>1. With the first line that John Goodman says I knew the acting was sub par. It sounded like Goodman just showed up and was reading off a cue card. Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L.

Everything in between could have been written by a 5 year old 3. At no point of this movie did I care if the main characters themselves were killed off. I had 0 emotional attachment to this film or any of the characters. 4. Dialoague. Good god. The jokes were so bad not a soul in the theater laughed because most didn't even know their was a joke happening. 5. John C. Reily did not have a great character written for him. But he delivered it pretty well."
"Rawal_Afzal","10","3","9","18 March 2017"," Two hours of intense terror!!!!
","What a cracking time I'd yesterday watching this in 3D! Two hours of intense terror, thriller and entertainment that I'm unlikely to forget for some time. What a giant animal, wow! The best visuals that captures how big he's is the one 'he' stands tall with the sun in the background, which's also the poster of this film. A weapon of mass destruction is Kong!<br/><br/>The scene where they fly into Kong's territory with helicopters will go down as amongst the greatest scenes I've ever seen at the big screen. It involves you so much as a viewer that at times it gets to the point of causing you dizziness. Simply unbeatable, the way he crashes, crushes and dismisses helicopters from his presence. I couldn't help but compare that to us humans dismissing flies away from our presence, and I'm sure the thought process behind that particular scene must've been the same for the film-makers.<br/><br/>Samuel Jackson was very good here as the colonel, a role most suited to him and especially his so expressive eyes. The scene where immediately after the aforementioned scene he stands there and, instead of escaping from the destruction, looks Kong into the eyes is an awesome scene. It looked as if we're set for an epic war between the egos of two relentless personalities.<br/><br/>But then the film drifts a bit, but the action remains. Monsters after monsters they come across, which only adds to the excitement, ultimately. Then, when the team stands against the colonel to prevent him from killing Kong, I feared that we're in for a disappointing, action-less ending, but then very intelligently the war re-ignites but against a different but yet another unrelenting creature. So the ending was worth it, especially the unbelievable scene where Kong rescues the girl from the other monster's gut. That was just wow!<br/><br/>The questions asked by that soldier from World War Two, who stayed stranded on the island for 28, provided the much needed comic relief. Some of his questions about the years gone by were really funny, especially the one about the Cold War. ""Do they take the summer off?"" Hilarious!<br/><br/>Lastly, although I haven't watched the previous King Kong films, but I did watch the one from 2005. I understand the progress made from that time to now in terms of the technology and the equipment available now, but that wasn't my main issue with that film. My problem was with the over three hours of length and the plot itself. King Kong going mad for the girl and wanting to take her with him looked so odd. That was depicted better here, as just the friendship or love that can exist between a human and an animal.<br/><br/>So then, 'Kong: Skull Island' is one of the greatest monsters films that I've watched, giving the Jurassic Park and the Aliens series a good competition. 'aliens' 1986 still wins the race though, any day."

","They made a great trailer. Shame about the movie.<br/><br/>'Kong skull island' does seem to me at least to be better than the other two currently extant films in the monsterverse: the underdone 'Godzilla' and the overwrought 'Godzilla king of the monsters'.....how its monster conceivably fits with the same cinematic universe as the monsters depicted in those two films is a stark question that the next film in the sequence will be detailed to answer.<br/><br/>As a sci-fi/fantasy adventure monster film this has enough cool set piece silly season monster violence to make a fine trailer but the paucity of supporting quality from any facet of the film leaves it threadbare at feature film length. Unless you are attached to a certain era of American Vietnam anti-war films beyond rational sane levels.<br/><br/>Definitely don't take any human characters or behaviours or situations or interactions to heart.....which is a shame because that's exactly what those vaunted aforementioned American movies that this film intensively references were trying at.<br/><br/>As a King Kong movie (which is probably an unfair, even invalid way of evaluating it in all honesty.) it is superficial and lacking in a full sense of humanity in the representation of Kong even when bringing into the equation the complete skeletal remains of both Kong's parents and a flashback (noble) death scenario.<br/><br/>As the second part of the putative monsterverse it kinda opens questions that might give 2020's 'Godzilla vs Kong' a lot of problems......but if the film makers involved in charting this franchise have good answers to these questions.....it might make for a better film than this or either of the Godzilla prep fight films.<br/><br/>Overall I rate this a watchable 4/10 and I would rather watch this than either of the Godzilla instalments because I think that this film at least develops a style in it's visual storytelling that gives it a more memorable distinctiveness.

"TheMovieDoctorful","2","2","5","14 February 2019"," We Deserved Better
","If one film could possibly represent everything that I fervently hate about the entire medium, it would be Jordan Vogt-Roberts Kong: Skull Island. While I initially found it enjoyable as a sort of ""so bad, it's good"" disaster, my opinions on its impact, its implications, its themes and its ambition (Or lack thereof) have become increasingly more negative over time. In many ways, King Kong represents one of the most enduring and iconic figures of old Hollywood. More people would be likely to recognize the soulful 25-foot gorilla than they would Errol Flynn's Robin Hood or Orson Welles Charles Kane. So to see a film show such disrespect, such carelessness, such lack of effort in a film centered on him absolutely breaks my heart.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly's Hank Marlowe marks the film's only likable or interesting character. Reilly's comedic presence wasn't nearly as forced as I previously worried and I found myself genuinely rooting for him to get off the island and get reunited with the family he had lost hope of ever seeing again. His return home to his shocked and emotional family is the only moment of any genuine pathos in the entire movie. Kong: Skull Island makes an attempt at developing Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard, and Jackson is at least trying his best, but there really is nothing to this character. He's a watered down cross between Captain Ahab and The Lost World: Jurassic Park's Roland Tembo and nothing more. The film can occasionally veer into the direction of unintentional comedy. Tom Hiddleston cutting down giant bats in slow-mo with a katana in a fog of toxic gas straight-up feels like something out of an Uwe Boll video game adaptation and the film deciding to rip off Jurassic Park III of all things during an encounter with the Skull Crawlers (Where we can see and hear the flash of a camera from an unlucky victim its just eaten...Through a fog of smoke in the distance, no less.) is almost surreal to witness.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is every bit a committee film made in reactionary response to the criticisms against Gareth Edward's (underrated) Godzilla movie. You can see the pandering attempts to address every problem people had with that film in every frame of Skull Island. Too much human drama? Make all the human characters even less developed and interesting than the side characters of an MCU film that only exist to drop one-liners. Too long of a wait to see Godzilla? Show Kong as soon as possible with no sense of spectacle or buildup at all and continue to show him over and over again until he loses all weight and power as a monster. Tone too dark and serious? Shove as much comedy into the film as possible until it comes out of your ears. Rinse and repeat with nearly every criticism that Godzilla was accused of. This is not a film, it's a lazily slapped together product made on a checklist.<br/><br/>Apart from Jackson and Reilly, the cast couldn't be more obvious in how little they're invested in their roles. It's almost not worth it to distinguish between the performance of Tom Hiddleston or Brie Larson or even the tremendously talented John Goodman because all their performances are practically the same. They showed up, read their lines and that's it. There are no interesting acting choices, no memorable moments from their performances, nothing. This is the kind of acting I almost hate most of all because it gives me nothing to say other than that they were clearly phoning it in.<br/><br/>It says a lot about this film's characters when it spends a significant amount of time building up Toby Kebbell trying to make it back to his son and then kills him before the halfway point with no resolution. Don't even get me started on Kong himself, he is a joke in this film. His ""emotional bonding"" scene with Brie Larson is one of the worst things I've seen in a Hollywood blockbuster in recent years. It's so forced and comes so far out of nowhere that it almost feels like a parody of a King Kong film. It'd be laughable if it weren't so pathetic.<br/><br/>Whether intentional or not, the reversal of the environmentalist themes of Godzilla (2014) may be the worst aspect of all to be found in Skull Island (And that is a feat given how incompetent and terrible this film is.) Within minutes of arriving on the island, our ""heroes"" immediately start recklessly dropping bombs to piss of Kong, killing numerous animals and peaceful wildlife living there. It's treated as this heroic, ""badass"" moment for them, full of smiles and quips, like the untold death and destruction they're wrecking is somehow a game. The only reason they regret their actions later on is because it put their lives in danger, but they wouldn't even be in this mess if they hadn't been indiscriminately blowing up everything they see like a 14 year playing Gary's Mod.<br/><br/>If you're a serious, hardcore Kaiju fan who went into Kong: Skull Island loving Godzilla (2014) and you think this is a great movie, I'm not going to say you're wrong. Hell, I wish I loved the damn thing. I'm going to say that you deserved better. You deserved better when it came to the first King Kong film in your major Hollywood shared MonsterVerse, you're dedicated, loyal fans who didn't have to settle for generic and dumb. Honestly, my heart goes out to you most of all. Because if anyone was owed a proper King Kong movie, it was you. And you know what? You still do."
"span-82449","8","2","5","6 January 2019"," AWESOME KONG REMAKE WITH BREATHTAKING ACTION AND VISUAL EFFECTS!!! WORTH WATCHING MOVIE WITH EPIC CINEMATOGRAPGHY!!! EVERY FRAME FEELS LIKE A PAINTING WORTH SITTING IN!!!
","A lot of good filmakers have made a movie regarding Kong, but few of them have reached the height of the inense action and good visual effects that Jordan Vogt-Roberts created with ""Kong: Skull Island"". I rate it 8/10, for I liked it far more than I expected, but that doesn't mean it is perfect. At the end of the day, ""Kong: Skull Islnad"" can't decide what kind of movie it wants to be. The attention to detail in fight scenes, where every weapon, lightbulb, and slick patch of ground is accounted for, doesn't translate to an ending that seems powerful, but ultimately says little of substance.<br/><br/>The two main advantages of this movie are the following: Fist of all, it does it's work and duty as a remake very well, for it is almost totally different than it's also awesome premake, ""King Kong"" by Peter Jackson. Both movies are awesome but in a different way and this makes more interesting watching the second one, for most possibly you have already seen the first one, since you are reading this review and you want to see more of Kong. So as Jackson focuses on the quote ""It wasn't the airplanes that got him, it was beauty killed the beast"", so emphasizes director Roberts on quotes such as ""We're all going to die together out here"". Also, it takes place during the Vietnam War in 1973, while ""King Kong"" in year 1933 and this change in the setting differs the whole atmosphere of the films. Secondly, as I mentioned before the action and the visuals are very good and about the visual effects oscar nomination, I have to say that it was whorth it.<br/><br/>However, there are of course some disadvantages that I will mention quickly in bullett points: -Brie Larson's annoying preformance, which isn't a great deal, thanks to Tom Hiddleston's great acting skills.
-Very, very few obvious plot holes (actually I remember only one, so again there isn't any problem nor with that one).
-And of course the this one word ""Helicopters"", a scene that isn't realistic and from the one side makes the soldiers look foolish, only to show from the other side Kong's great power.<br/><br/>To sum up it is a worth watching movie with epic cinematography.

","I watched the original KK, the 1970-something remake, the 2005 remake, and ... This. Oh, dear. What can I add to the many other cries of dismay?p<br/><br/>In this latest Hollywood excrement they don't even bother to build up your excitement and expectation. I suppose the writers must have thought, ""Oh, what the heck. By now, everybody knows the protagonists are to stumble into a ginormous monkey. Let's start blowing things up from the get-go instead."" So KK blasts on the screen (and in your face) barely 15 minutes after the opening credits (in a two-hour film).<br/><br/>It barrels south from there. Cartoonish, made-in-Japan-like creatures, tons of gooey, revolting gore, silly people, sillier situations. Oh, and did I mention aurora borealis ... In the middle of the South Pacific? Did they leave any cliché out? Nope. Everything is there, right down to the assertive, macho-like, snarky female photographer, who's capable of lifting a helicopter that not even a huge, prehistoric water buffalo could dislodge. Does our Kong fall for the gutsy photographer? Perish the thought! This is the new millennium. Nobody, not eve big apes objectify women. Can't have that. No, once Kong slaps the chopper off the water buffalo's back, he spots the photographer, gives her a regally disdainful look, turns around and walks away. The only part in the film I felt like clapping.<br/><br/>As others have pointed out, the dialogue is so bad it makes you cringe even more than the revoltingly gory scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, I think it's high time Hollywood was sent to pasture on some Skull Island somewhere far away. I mean, what could go wrong? The Hollywoodians would be devoured by the local fauna. Well, what of it? The film taught us that the critters are prone to regurgitating their lunch. Maybe they'll turn vegetarian. Wouldn't that be adorably politically correct?"

We could reboot the King Kong franchise.""<br/><br/>""But there are already seven different King Kong movies.""<br/><br/>""That doesn't matter.

It could take place towards the end of the Vietnam War.""<br/><br/>""Why would we chose the Vietnam War?""<br/><br/>""Even the most uneducated audience has already heard of the Vietnam War.

Two wars are better than one!""<br/><br/>""Do you have any ideas for precise locations?""<br/><br/>""Geography is too complex for our audience. Let's just invent a fictional island. An island where any nonsense could happen. Let's include other monsters. Giant lizards, giant oxes and giant spiders! And dinosaurs!

A couple of people want to discover an island and must fight monsters. King Kong turns out to be nice and helps them. That's it.""<br/><br/>""Do you have any ideas for our characters?""<br/><br/>""People like simple contrasts. Good and evil. Heroes and villains. Pacifists and warmongers.

We will have to overpay them to make sure they participate in this nonsense but it will pay off. Imagine a name like Samuel L. Jackson! People will read his name and just watch the movie because of him! Anyway, we will put the biggest part of our budget in the special effects.

","Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts<br/><br/>Starring Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson and John C Reilly<br/><br/>​ Plot Overview: Scientists, soldiers and adventurers unite to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean. Cut off from everything they know, they venture into the domain of the mighty Kong, igniting the ultimate battle between man and nature. As their mission of discovery soon becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape from a primal world where humanity does not belong.<br/><br/>This movie is dull, its lazy, it's poorly acted and written and lacks any real charm or true enjoyment value that excuses these flaws. While it does contain some interesting and inventive action, that small amount of satisfaction doesn't clean the slate of everything that came before it. You don't care about any of the characters and the movie just lacks a certain charm that makes it truly enjoyable. Vogt-Roberts does a decent job with the giant, climactic battle esc shots but fails at anything to do with talking or whatnot. Personally, I don't think you'll get your moneys worth with this movie and I can't see many people enjoying it that much. <br/><br/>There is no real story here and anything even related to it is quickly pushed aside. The 'plot' was just an excuse to get 'big things' fighting but even that is kept at a bare minimum and could have been done better.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston was FINE as James Conrad but you can tell he was phoning it in. Brie Larson was very weak as Mason Weaver and the man who is everything(Samuel L Jackon) was also really poor. Both of their characters didn't flow in one straight arc and neither of them really needed to exist. Both John C Reily and John Goodman were fine as John Marlow and Bill Randa respectively. The main issue with this movie is that none of the characters are likable and every attempt to make them appear human or relatable was so blatantly forced in. You may argue that this is KONG's movie but then why not make him the complete priority and not focus on any of the humans.<br/><br/>Vogt-Roberts does a great job at shooting the huge scenes to do with Kong in this movie but fails drastically at any scenes that try to involve human emotion or contact or happiness. To this movie's credit, however, all the effects were pretty good(even if I feel they could have been a little more creative at points).<br/><br/>This movie's main strength is the cool and inventive action. While this is well done, it's so short lived and the setup to it doesn't live up to the climax. I understand that it would probably get repetitive if the whole movie was just Kong fighting but they could have either added more or made the actual climax feel more powerful. Any and all attempts at humour in this movie backfired. This movie's primary directive would have been to properly introduce Kong to this Monster-verse and to younger audiences. I personally feel that it failed at this goal and could have been handled so much better and so much more creatively. <br/><br/>On a side note, the final scene of this movie were John Goodman goes home is shot like it's genuine footage and if the text 'Based on a True Story' popped on screen at that moment in time, I would have gave this movie a perfect score because that would have been amazing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is dull, the characters are boring and the climax doesn't live up to the hype set up by the movie. I don't feel like this movie is worth any money and is just not worth watching.<br/><br/>4/10<br/><br/>Wouldn't Recommend"
"stevenrotherforth","6","2","5","6 May 2017"," A Kong sized turd of a movie but like all good turds there's enjoyment to be had.
","Kong: Skull Island<br/><br/>""Quick somebody pen a new King Kong movie so we can have him and Godzilla kick the crap out of each other!""
You can almost hear the studio execs at Warner Brothers shriek those very words down the corridors of their HQ.
First things first. We need to give Kong his own standalone movie before he goes toe to claw with the Zilla. So this is what we end up with.<br/><br/>'Skull Island' Is a painting by numbers run of the mill Monster B movie but with a mega budget.
Shame none of that budget seems to have gone on a decent script!
It's not as a if the talent involved here was bad. Far from it. The problem is that nothing in this movie is memorable.
I couldn't tell you what any of the characters were called. In fact the only character of any substance was that of John C Reilly's.
Tom Hiddleston is unconvincing as the butch hero. Too fine featured to carry off the macho man persona. The next James Bond? I don't think so! Samuel L Jackson is just, well err, Samuel L Jackson. Brie Larson doesn't need to waste her time in this sort of tosh and John Goodman? Please man go back to Roseanne! As for the rest of the cast. I can't remember any them.<br/><br/>The story tells of an undiscovered island surrounded by stormy weather. Rumour has it that this island harbours some pretty terrifying creatures so a crew of soldiers and scientists go off to get eaten and stood on. On arrival the twentyteen helicopters are one by one trashed by one big irritated monkey!
I say twentyteen because it may as well be a made up number since I think about only four helicopters set off from the battleship. Then they miraculously multiplied as they went through the storm clouds. Hardly anything in this movie makes sense. Why would helicopters keep flying really close to a giant ape after witnessing it smash one up with what looked like a giant pineapple?
After crash landing Sam Jackson is rather upset that Kong has killed his buddies and goes on a mission to bring the big hairy beast down. Absolutely ridiculous! All of a sudden he's now capable of taking on a one hundred foot ape with a few rifles and a vexed expression. While he's off trying to bring down the beast the rest of the crew just want to get off the island as one by one they are picked off by giant spiders and all sorts of terrible monsters. This movie could have been great! The special effects are top notch but the whole movie seems like a rushed project in order to get to the Kong vs Godzilla movie. Trust me Kong my boy you need to do some serious growing before you go trash talking to that big Lizard.
Other positives are that we do see Kong right from the beginning unlike 2005's King Kong where we had to sit through an hour of character building before someone cried
""Show me the monkey!""<br/><br/>Also comparing this film to its Monsterverse sharing Godzilla.
In that movie we basically just saw a giant foot for most part of the movie. At least here we do get some serious monster mayhem.
'Kong: Skull Island ""is somewhat of a disappointment but despite all my complaining after revisiting this movie several times it is a guilty pleasure and gets better when you ignore the many illogical plot holes.
It also looks and sounds fabulous on Blu-ray.
It's one of those movies that you know is utter tripe but you find yourself being drawn in by it. That is what pure entertainment is all about.
Anyway who cares what I think?
'Kong: Skull Island' will still make a Gazillions dollars. All the actors will be paid handsomely and there will be an inevitable equally crap but entertaining sequel.<br/><br/>Bring it on!"
"zink-paul","4","2","5","25 April 2017"," Hackneyed, Clichéd, Boring.
","Rarely have I found such a gaping chasm between the enthusiastic reviews and the disappointing on-screen reality as with this film. Since everyone knows the basic story of KIng Kong, there is, of course, no suspense and none is to be expected except in the details of the characters' various predicaments (and of course, which of the cast of characters will be killed in a nasty and/or surprising manner). So, that leaves the story and the cast to carry the movie, as well as the special effects we expect.<br/><br/>The director said that he was strongly influenced by video games, and it clearly shows. This is a film for an audience satisfied by ""big monsters"" and lots of automatic weapons. The acting is workmanlike and professional, as you'd expect from the talented lead actors, but you can see they're sleep-walking through their roles: Oh look, Samuel L. Jackson playing a military hard-ass Tom Hiddleston playing a reserved British ex-soldier with hidden mental and character strengths John C. O'Reilly playing a lovable oddball eccentric Wake me when the director has an actor playing against type, please.<br/><br/>Big insects and lizards: check. Angry huge gorilla: check. Spectacular and wild scenery and location: check. Mysterious natives: check. Soldiers trying to kill huge creatures with small arms and being crushed when the creatures and insects just won't die: check. Obvious references to other films (armed boat going down a river in Vietnam-war era, manned by soldiers, with rock music blasting—hmm,let me think) and the Joseph Conrad novella: check.<br/><br/>Compared to the outstanding and nuanced 2005 Peter Jackson film, this one looks like it was scripted and directed by a nine-year old sitting in front of his PlayStation, and aimed at a similar audience."

","I had it firm in my mind this was going to be a cartoonish fiasco similar to Peter Berg's sci-fi bomb 'Battleship' released in 2012 which was designed for teenage gamers and pretty much nobody else.<br/><br/>'Kong' has far more sophistication than that. Instead of a comic book we get a well designed production more on the level of the graphic novel.<br/><br/>Attention to period detail (1973) is nearly 100 percent, from wrist watches, military uniforms and weapons, tactical gear, radios, tape recorders, record players, cameras, aircraft, automobiles, scientific equipment, most of it checks out as authentic.<br/><br/>The only thing I spotted as incorrect was a brief view of an animated color computer graphic that wouldn't have been possible for at least another twenty years, but that's all.<br/><br/>The CGI goes without saying. The use of it to make the most disgusting creatures come to life is as good as it can get. Kong battles away with these many monsters with great dramatic flair. <br/><br/>One is an eighty foot tall spider that really gave me the creeps. Anachriods are not my thing, and the movie didn't help me with that at all.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, the military/science team meet up with a mute indigenous people who have lived on the island for thousands of years. Again, attention to detail is immaculate.<br/><br/>You would have no problem believing this was an actual race completely cut off from the rest of the civilized world had you ever met them.<br/><br/>However, there were a couple of unbelievable and ridiculous scenarios that threatened my suspension of dis-belief. <br/><br/>First, there is no such thing as an island with it's own savage storm system that keeps it hidden and nearly impenetrable. If you have a scientific mind at all, you'll find this idea laughable.<br/><br/>Second, the military blundering that occurs when the helicopter pilots first encounter the giant ape, which gets everybody stranded in the first place, is overwhelmingly dumb and hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Instead of retreating, all the pilots simply fly mindlessly straight at Kong who bats them all out of the sky one by one. Duh.<br/><br/>But it is an action movie, and that's what you get, regardless of the lack of logic or reason here and there.<br/><br/>Great fun for all ages.<br/><br/>Your teenage boys will love it. Your teenage girls will probably not.<br/><br/>Oh, and Samuel Jackson doesn't drop a single F-bomb through the whole movie.<br/><br/>I found that refreshing."

","Some people go to the movies to be wowed by the superb acting, heart wrenching and well written story, and overall solid production. This is an all out creature feature...It is called Skull Island because that's where the action takes place with all the neat creatures. There is a LOT of screen time devoted to Kong and the monsters. Kong: Skull Island is the perfect monster movie. It's an epic display of what a popcorn movie should be.<br/><br/>In 1944, in the midst of World War II, two fighter pilots – an American soldier named Hank Marlow and a Japanese soldier named Gunpei Ikari – parachute onto an island in the South Pacific after a dogfight. They both engage in close combat, with Ikari gaining the upper hand, but the fight is interrupted by a behemoth ape known as Kong.<br/><br/>In 1973, U.S. government agent Bill Randa hires former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad, a skilled tracker, to guide an expedition to map out an island known as ""Skull Island"" and with a Vietnam War helicopter squadron led by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard and his subordinates, Major Jack Chapman and Captain Earl Cole. Upon arrival at Skull Island, Packard's men begin dropping explosives developed by seismologist Houston Brooks to map out the island. However, the air unit is attacked by Kong, who kills a number of military personnel and scatters the others across the island.<br/><br/>After being confronted by Packard, Randa reveals his affiliation to the secret government organization Monarch, which was trying to prove the existence of monsters and determine their threat to humanity. The other survivors (Conrad, Weaver, Brooks, biologist San Lin, soldier Reg Slivko, and Landsat employee Victor Nieves) try to get to a rendezvous point to meet a resupply team arriving in three days' time. They encounter the local Iwi natives and an older Marlow. He reveals that Kong is the island's guardian, worshiped as a god by the natives for protecting the island's inhabitants from many predators, including reptilian underground monsters dubbed ""Skullcrawlers"". They have killed Kong's ancestors, leaving him as the last of his kind, and that one of the Skullcrawlers killed Ikari.<br/><br/>Packard's group begins making their way to Chapman, whose helicopter crash-landed elsewhere. Meanwhile, Chapman is ambushed and eaten by a Skullcrawler. Jame Conrad's group helps Marlow complete a boat built from parts scavenged from Marlow and Ikari's downed planes. They ride the boat down the river, and manage to secure communication with Packard's group, but the boat is attacked by pterosaur-like creatures which kill Nieves. They regroup with Packard, who insists on searching for Chapman, though his true objective is to find and kill Kong.<br/><br/>There, the same Skullcrawler that devoured Chapman attacks the group, killing Randa and many soldiers before dying in a flammable gas explosion triggered by Weaver. Learning about Chapman's death, a vengeful Packard blames Kong for the deaths of his men and becomes determined to kill Kong. The two groups part ways, with Packard's group laying a trap for Kong, while the non-military personnel head back to the boat. <br/><br/>As Conrad and Weaver encounter Kong, Packard's group triggers napalm explosions to lure him in. Kong charges to the lake, where they manage to incapacitate him with ignited gasoline, though Woodward is killed. Conrad's group arrives and persuades the other soldiers to spare Kong, but Packard refuses to stand down. Then, a massive Skullcrawler. Emerges from the lake. Packard is crushed to death by a recovering Kong. The Skullcrawler overpowers Kong in a brief battle and then chases the survivors. Kong returns to rescue the others and with help from the humans, kills the beast by ripping out its innards. He saves Weaver from drowning, and allows the surviving humans to leave the island.<br/><br/>During the credits, Marlow returns home, reuniting with his wife, meeting his son for the first time, and watching a Chicago Cubs game on television. In a post-credits scene, Conrad and Weaver are detained by Monarch and informed by Brooks and Lin that Kong is not the only monster to roam the world. As proof, they are shown archive footage of cave paintings depicting Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah."

","It's kinda what happens when a studio wants to make a Marvel movie that wants to be better than a Marvel movie (on the complete opposite end of what DC is doing). The movie isn't all bad. There were some action scenes I liked. The cinematography was mostly decent. That's about it really. It's very cluttered and jumpy. Half the time it wants to be a fun B-movie, the other half wants to be a big budget action blockbuster. Also the first 20 minutes are criminally boring and muddled. Nobody gives a good performance cuz no one has any direction or characterization. This movie is the definition of excess. The color palette 90% of the time is orange or yellow which gets very tiring on the eyes fast. The effects are OK (mostly) but there's always so much CG on screen it starts to look artificial (also the one night scene has worse green-screen sky than a laptop screensaver). The editing is probably the worst part of the movie since it's so sporadic and nonsensical that it actually hurts what decent visuals are on screen. The skull crawler designs were also pretty lazy and dull. And it ended pretty anti-climactically with us not even seeing the humans leave the island. But there were some mildly entertaining action set pieces so I have no problem if you enjoyed it. Side Note: this movie is so graphic and bloody for a PG-13 that it might as well have been rated R."

In fact, the only thing this one has is a ton of CGI. King Kong doesn't look real; it looks like a man in a bad monkey suit. And what were those monsters he fought? They looked like Pterodactyls. In other words, they were not frightening.<br/><br/>The cast managed to sleepwalk their way through the film. The only saving grace was John Ryan, even though there was not that much to his character. Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal of the ""bad guy"" was caricature-ish and unbelievable.

"jimbo-53-186511","6","2","5","27 March 2017"," A mostly enjoyable spectacle, but with some flaws
","A diverse team (including scientists, army personnel, researchers, and an ex special forces operative) join forces to explore an uncharted island in the South Pacific. Researchers believe that mythical beasts may inhabit the island, but these beasts turn out to be truly terrifying; none more so then the god of the skull island himself King Kong.<br/><br/>With Kong: Skull Island you're essentially getting a reworking of the King Kong story rather than a direct remake and once I realised that this wasn't a remake I was looking forward to what the writers would serve up here. For the most part it is a good film which remains fairly enjoyable, but there are problems along the way...<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is set in 1973 and the team's visit to Skull Island coincides with the end of the war in Vietnam. In some ways this isn't a bad way to set the story up, but to me it felt like the writers had a bit of an agenda and got a little heavy-handed with their war politics early on - we're told on a number of occasions that America withdrew their troops from Vietnam and Samuel L Jackson gives a speech to this effect. This sort of thing is OK in a war film or possibly even in a war-related drama, but in a monster blockbuster film it doesn't sit right and felt really out of place.<br/><br/>The film is called Kong: Skull Island so I think it's reasonable for the film to have Kong and or Skull Island as its focus, but the truth is that it doesn't. The film doesn't show enough of Kong and nor does it show enough of the mythical Skull Island. Aside from the team arriving on the island and the epic final showdown, Kong himself is given very little to do and it's this very reason that the film occasionally lacks intensity and edge-of-your-seat thrills. I think part of the reason that the film doesn't always work so well when Kong isn't around is down to the characters themselves; the truth is that nearly every single character here is either dull or a total cliché. I hoped that the writers would use their differing backgrounds to create some quirky dynamics, but this never happens and for that reason I never felt that there was much of a sense of teamwork. Hiddleston is the lead actor here, but he's rather stiff and wooden and has all the charisma of a cabbage. The rest of the supporting cast are OK, but again nearly all of them are uninteresting people with no real depth. Some of the army characters are fun, but a lot of them are fairly clichéd war characters with all of the inherent cheesy war dialogue.<br/><br/>The picture does become more fun when we're introduced to John C Reilly's character; although believing that his character has managed to survive on the island for 28 years really stretches one's suspension of disbelief and depicting him as some kind of tribal god was dumb beyond words. Having said that though he was at least fun and was a breath of fresh air in comparison to some of the other characters.<br/><br/>Still despite some of the problems, it remains a mostly enjoyable film that to its credit is watchable and is never boring and the final showdown is excellent and does make it all worthwhile (watching it on the big screen does help to be honest). Worth a watch for its action sequences and its epic showdown, but the picture does suffer slightly when Kong isn't around."

And it was set in some mythical, post-racial and totally non-sexist 70s where hardly anybody smoked anything, not even tobacco.<br/><br/>That said - the island settings convinced, there were some good laughs, and the monsters and the US military were so scary you were soon rooting for Kong to sort them both out.

","I believe this movie was very average overall. I didn't like it, but I didn't hate it. Parts of it where actually really good but there are also a lot of bad things as well that overall ruin the movie. The first part of the movie kept throwing the audience around different places and throwing a lot of characters and exposition in your face. The first few scenes annoyed me a lot because of this reason. Also, the moment before the intro was very short and didn't have much time to introduce itself. I found most of the movie quite boring because of the lack of action. Don't get me wrong, story is a very important part of the movie, but most of the movie was people walking around and saying stuff to each other, and then maybe encountering maybe one or two monsters along the way. Some of the characters were fairly decent, case in point Samuel L Jackson and John C Reilly, but some of the characters and subplots where extremely predictable and sometimes even dull. Also, not to mention the amount of music cuts and then jump-scares for god's sake. This movie was okay but it didn't SUCK. I liked parts of it but not a lot of it. That's just my opinion though.﻿"

","This movie had no shortage of familiar faces: Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell from Straight Outta Compton, Shea Wigham from Boardwalk Empire, Toby Kebbell from Black Mirror (excellent Netflix program), John C. Reilly from Talladega Nights and a host of other things, and John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson who both need no introduction.<br/><br/>The Kong story has been done time and again, most recently in 2005 with Jack Black. This version was a lot less drama and more action. They didn't dink around in this movie with delaying the unveiling of Kong, rather they gave us a glimpse early so as to not keep us in rapt anticipation like the '05 version. In that respect, they did well. But, the one consistent trope that is a constant bummer for me is the damsel in distress that Kong is enamored with. They downplayed that dynamic this time around so that the quasi-love affair/love triangle wasn't the story but it still had a part. I'm just not moved by the beast being tamed by the delicate white woman.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island offered a lot of ooh and aah moments, some obligatory humor and a strong anti-war message. I had no problems with any of it although they made Preston Packard (Sam Jackson) so over the top with his dogged pursuit of military action as the answer that it detracted from the movie. <br/><br/>I liked this version better than the '05 one and I can't remember the '76 version that well. With reference to Kong as a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object (M.U.T.O.) we can probably expect him to have an eventual showdown (or tag team effort) with Godzilla. That is a battle I'd pay to see."

But get more than they bargained for when they have to deal with the giant gorilla named Kong, and a bigger unknown threat.<br/><br/>Not a bad adventure film, everybody here comes alive very well, the actors never get overshadowed by the effects. Tom Hiddleston was good, so was John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson. But Brie Larson performance feels like she is in a different movie. Kong was awesome too. And yes stay after the credits."

","The movie Kong begins with two people fighting it out in an deserted island after landing from a parachute and the first look of the massive structure. The story begins with an exploration team trying to discover the skull island, somewhere in the south east near Vietnam. The place is dangerous and mysterious and the team is headed by Samuel Jackson. The 3D effects are fully enjoyable and worth watching. All the creatures shown are extremely dangerous and reminds you of Avatar. Story is good and takes u back to the old saying which says man is more dangerous to nature and if you invade others territory, they will try to protect in whatever way they can. The crash scenes and full fledged introduction of Kong is simply outstanding and proves man as a mere toy in the hands of all the animals. Not to forget the funny moments and dialogues between Cole and his friend. Music is progressive and gives a feel of the movie in a grand way. Lastly the island is definitely not a place you would try to enter."
"Kingslaay","Null","2","5","15 March 2017"," Quite entertaining but doubtful it will stand the test of time
","Kong Skull Island is enjoyable to watch. From an easy plot, interesting characters to the allure of the mighty Kong himself this film should satisfy. If you've had a long day and just want to watch a movie this would be the right choice. However it appears quite forgettable in terms of the other Kong movies and other films in general. <br/><br/>King Kong has been a cinematic classic for a long time. The different story line sadly was not better than the original. The ancient people who inhabit the island and live in Kong's protection pales in comparison to the classic Kong being transported to New York and climbing to a skyscraper with the female he's fallen for as he battles planes. Peter Jackson's remake and the 1933 original are better in plot. The unusual romance was so grand and remarkable to watch. <br/><br/>The CGI and special effects for Kong were interesting. The mythical creature closely resembled an erect male which questioned its realism. Jackson was more realistic in his portrayal of an actual beast like Kong and 1933 cannot be cited so much because special effects were limited to what they are now. In 2017 it was surprisingly unimpressive, I have a feeling that in years to come this Kong might be used as an example of how limited the effects were in the past and how far they have later come. In all these respects it definitely will be forgettable and its rating on this site might drop over time."

I'd actually give this movie a 6.5 but since I can't choose halves nudged it up to 7.<br/><br/>anyways, it is definitely entertaining and does not start off slow which is nice. would have found it more entertaining if they would have explored the hollow earth theory more than wasting time on a love story and a useless leading actress. really, what was her point? without her the story would have been fine and pretty much the same. does every movie just have to have a leading actress and leading actor? get a grip Hollywood. the answer is no. at least in the original (I think) and the '76 movie there was an actual point to having the leading actress. this time around it's just a waste of time and film. so is the love interest angle. I mean she's a photographer who ends up learning and deciding she shouldn't use her photographs. *smh* note to Hollywood, Godzilla and Kong do NOT need love stories, love interests, anything of that nature, or leading actresses unless they serve a purpose like having useful information or are some story element expert. (let me state to be more clear, the love story angle took up only a small part of the movie, it just was pointless and unnecessary) note to future Godzilla movie makers, INCLUDE FREAKING GODZILLA IN THE MOVIE the way THIS movie included Kong. morons.<br/><br/>my other logic rants is whoever designed Kong doesn't appear to have any knowledge of gorilla anatomy what so ever. sure Kong won't be exactly like an overgrown gorilla but his chest looked terribly disproportionate to his head.<br/><br/>uh, why didn't the helicopters disperse and fly away from Kong or HIGHER? this part of the movie made no sense.<br/><br/>why didn't ANYONE tell Jackson's character about Kong protecting the world from skullhead lizards sooner? AND ACTUALLY EXPLAIN the fact that his team was creating holes with the explosives is why Kong reacted how he did? oh, that's right because logic messes up the need for the dumb story plot to work. you know, if they had at least explained the reasoning and Jackson's character still acted like a crazy moron I'd have felt better.<br/><br/>positives were the fact we actually get to see plenty of Kong! kudos. the stranded soldier was an excellent story element. the hollow earth theory. sounded very cool. the story of how there was more giant gorillas and Kong's parents, very cool to! so many cool stories just told but not actually seen in the movie. *sigh* overall an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>how about a movie about his parents and them falling prey to the skullheads and Kong escaping to protect the day? you know minus any useless love story gunk other than between Kong's parents maybe.<br/><br/>edit: after seeing the trailer a couple of more times it reminded me there was one other ridiculous scene some of you might want to pay attention to. it's one of those forced scene done just to do that would have been better without the first part. without being able to pause an actual theatre movie I have no idea how Kong ended up under and then entangled in the chains. save money on the effects guys, especially when they are ridiculous. movies are better without them.<br/><br/>edit (03/19/17): so the 2005 Kong just aired on TV after I typed my review. had not watched it since seeing it at the movies. basically watching this reminded me why I haven't seen it since then. the Egyptian really? cartwheels? juggling? at least the girl in this new version doesn't do the Egyptian, cartwheels, or juggling and at least Kong is NOT just an oversized regular gorilla (right down to munching oversized bamboo). it's like they went crazy with the special effects because they got a 2 for 1 deal or something. oh, and the dinosaur scene? just wow! as in wow, can't believe how unbelievably BAD that was and dinosaurs were the least unbelievable unrealistic thing about the whole scene.<br/><br/>what I'm saying is the new Kong here is definitely better than the 2005 one and even with the ridiculous chain scene it is less ridiculous and more logical."

","I really cannot believe the in depth and wordy reviews praising this movie .... seriously it is average .... not awful, but average. Samuel L Jackson plays a very strange, almost Apocalypse Now type of character, that tries to add some comedy and fails miserably. Tom Hiddleston, despite being an excellent actors, just doesn't carry off the action hero roles very well, which is why he wouldn't make a good Bond. Brie Larson adds some eye candy, but is a much better actress than this role allows her to be. Don't get me wrong, if you put the obvious flaws to one side, and just watch for a bit of uncomplicated 'monster centered' entertainment then you'll be fine, but don't go thinking that you will have some cerebral experience because you will be disappointed.....just as an example of its flaws, and not really a spoiler, but there is a scene where helicopter are taking off from a boat - the boat is big enough to accommodate around 3 helicopters yet suddenly there are around a dozen in the air????"

","After seeing the first set of trailers for the film months beforehand, I was actually excited about it. It displayed some interesting imagery and colouring that made me think that the film was going to be unique.<br/><br/>In its own way, it was, but not in a way that I had anticipated. It features multiple first person shots of the characters holding a weapon, which disorientates the viewer and doesn't look too pleasing anyway. In addition, I felt like there were far too many characters in this film, and I lost track of their story lines. For example, when the group was being chased in one of the final moments of the film, one of the characters decided he would kill himself (after showing no indications of it in the rest of the film) by detonating some grenades at the pursuer which didn't even work, so he was comically batted away into a cliff face.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I didn't enjoy the film, I believe it wasted some good acting talent such as John Goodman, and it just wasn't too interesting. However, there were some entertaining fighting scenes, and the post credit scene is worth staying around for. Other than that, its getting a 4/10."

","I watched Kong in IMAX and it was fun. This resulted in images projected by Dual Projectors on the Giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand each time Kong growls and pounds his chest!<br/><br/>The sole purpose is to set-up a supposed Kong vs. Godzilla film in the coming years, otherwise, the script is too weak, on the same sidelines of Jurassic World. No care was taken for character development. Also, it's not clear whether the focus is on the the ape or on the island itself. There is quite a bit of humor that is attempted here, but most of it comes out of nowhere and seems desperate. Samuel Jackson strikes the right tone of crazy amid the chaos, otherwise, if we check the rest of the casting crew, the acting is almost one-dimensional. The action and visuals are dazzling and immersive. Neither a sequel nor prequel, but the SFX are better, especially with Kong's CGI' close-ups. And there is no love-dove like the Naomi Watts- Kong relationship. There is some fun to be had and it's not a bad film in any way, but a film like this could have been so much better. In a nutshell, Kong: Skull Island is disposable popcorn mumbo-jumbo fare. My significant digit score: 6.4/10"

","How many times can they really do King Kong? King Kong 76'? OK. King Kong 05' with Peter Jackson? I can dig that. Kong: Skull Island is pushing it. This might be the flimsiest King Kong film to date. It reinvents nothing. Sure, there isn't a blonde woman being kidnapped, and sure there isn't a scene where Kong climes up a skyscraper.. but not relying on the tropes of the series doesn't excuse the unimaginative storyline here. It's aesthetic is a Vietnam war film. CCR blasts the soundtrack. You know where this is going. The characters are wooden. The only thing they've got going for them is their star power. John Goodman does a good job as always. John C. Reilly is a treat to see. However, Samuel L. Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson.. again. Also, the jumps scares.. why? Why is Hollywood still relying on jump scares in the horror/sci-fy genre? I'm sick of it. The sound dies down and BOOM a creature pops out. This happens a dozen times here. Enough. The effects in Kong are as good as they should be, but it's certainly not a standout. The new Planet of the Apes series is truly wowing with realistic looking apes. This film could've learned a thing or two. Also, just in case you're wondering about what I think of the post-credits surprise.. here's my answer: Sorry, Warner Bros. I'm not interested."
"burlesonjesse5","5","2","5","13 March 2017"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Kong: Skull Island
","Kong: Skull Island is a big budget movie that likes to show off. It's got Richard M. Nixon bobble-heads, Sam Jackson making another silly speech, and John C. Reilly playing a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan. Being a die hard White Sox fan myself, my question is this: Did ""Skull"" really need to be made in the first place? No. But hey, all Hollywood execs gotta corral a buck.<br/><br/>In Kong: Skull Island, King Kong as usual, beats his chest and roars. In Kong: Skull Island, King Kong the monster is the protagonist once again. In Kong: Skull Island, the story minus time line constraints, involves a bunch of eager beavers venturing into forbidden Skull Island not knowing the dangers that await them. In Kong: Skull Island, the only thing missing is Kong scaling the Empire State Building. So OK, Kong: Skull Island at a cost of $185 million, is my latest review.<br/><br/>A large cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, John Goodman, and Brie Larson, gets lost in the shuffle via ""Skull"". And as the eighth film in the King Kong franchise, ""Skull"" also suffers from pacing that's a little off, a lack of cinematic freshness, and some real patchy editing.<br/><br/>So all right, what's left to admire during Kong: Skull Island's two- hour running time? Well it's the special effects and capable cinematography courtesy of Hawaii and Australia.<br/><br/>Now if you decide to view ""Skull"", you'll probably reminisce about Colonel Kurtz, Martin Sheen, mangoes, and good old ""Charlie"". Let me explain.<br/><br/>Call it a hunch but I think director Jordan Vogt-Roberts viewed 1979's Apocalypse Now before even making ""Skull"". I mean how else do you explain the presence of colored smoke grenades, patrol boats going upriver, rampant palm trees, slow motion sounds of helicopter rotor blades, and a similar movie poster depicting Earth's huge, tucked away sun. Yeah Kong: Skull Island bleeds nostalgia for Coppola's drawn- out vision of the Vietnam War. Too bad it's not nearly as epic. Sigh.<br/><br/>Wistful candor and fledgling choppers aside, ""Skull"" has decent visual effects shots and a scorched look. However, it possesses these traits in nothing but standard fashion. Peter Jackson did more twelve years ago with 2005's vaguely titled, King Kong. Of course Jackson's film is bloated at three hours long. And yes, it also contains the same structural miscues as Kong: Skull Island. Nevertheless, 2005's ""Kong"" is more eye candy than ""Skull"" will ever be.<br/><br/>With King Kong, Jackson inserted some real nasty CGI creatures in the form of giant bugs, ""Scorpio-pedes"", and ""Piranhadon"". Vogt- Roberts instead, goes the military route giving us an overly violent PG-13 flick that just gets by. Bottom line: I'm a sucker for 60's/70's rock tunes and ""Skull"" has that kind of a soundtrack (better yet, it's obsessed with said soundtrack). Also, King Kong is a character that in any one of his movies, will never just go away. Nonetheless, I can't quite give Kong: Skull Island a true recommendation. No need to rush out and visit this ""island"" any time soon. Rating: 2 stars."
"alindsay-al","5","2","5","13 March 2017"," An average monster film
","So after the decent Godzilla film in 2014 this is the second film in this monster universe and unfortunately this film just doesn't hit the high levels I wanted even though there is good stuff in this film. The premise of this film is set in the 1970's as a team of military personal and scientists go to a mysterious island where they encounter creatures and Kong. Tom hiddelston plays the main hero in this film and unfortunately I found him very bland and dull in this film. I feel maybe he was miscast in the role but mainly it was just the fact that his character had no depth and was very wooden. However, the character of Kong is awesome in this film, unlike Godzilla Kong is given plenty of screen time in this film and I thought he was possibly the most interesting character in this film. Samuel l Jackson plays the military commander in this film and he is great in this film, he has a legitimate reason for going against Kong and you buy him as he develops throughout the film with his men. John Goodman plays the head scientist in this film and I liked him in his role, I thought his dynamic with Jackson in the film was good even though I maybe would have liked to have seen a bit more of him. John c Reilly plays a man who has been on the island longer then the rest and I actually liked his character. I was worried that his added humour would go against the film but I thought he had the best lines and I ended up caring about his character. Brie Larson plays a photographer in this film that goes along for the journey and similar to hiddleston that I found her pretty boring and bland in the role. The story in this film has some nice personal moments especially involving the soldiers and morality. But it is very by the numbers and unfortunately everything to do with Kong is very similar to what they did with Godzilla and it just comes across as repetitive and not unique for his character. The script in this film is just pretty awful, the humour in this film comes across as incredibly forced except for some of Reilly's lines. Also the drama never really hits the levels that it should. The style of this film has some brilliant action scenes, seeing Kong throw down is awesome to see and you get quite a bit of it in this film that I was highly entertained by. However, this film has some tone issues, it is highly inconsistent moving from dramatic to humorous without any segway really which was jarring. Overall this is an average film that doesn't really do Kong justice."

","It seems that you can't keep a giant ape down and this is at least the fourth Kong movie that I've seen following the versions of ""King Kong"" released in 1933, 1976 and 2005. What makes this one different? It channels ""Apocalypse Now"" big time, setting the action just after the Vietnam War and deploying a group of GIs from that conflict led by a bombastic lieutenant colonel who insists ""This is one war we're not gonna lose"" (yeh). <br/><br/>Stupidly they start by carpet bombing Skull Island in the same way that the Americans did Vietnam with the same effect, except that this time it's not the Vietcong who are enraged but ugly, giant reptiles. I suppose another difference is that special effects have moved on, even in the decade since the last Kong movie, and there are some striking visuals and impressive CGI, but this effort is nowhere near as effective as Peter Jackson's 2005 blockbuster.<br/><br/>The plot is minimal and the script often dire. Kong appears far too early and is not characterised as well as the three other films. And there is a massive waste of cinematic talent with the likes of John Goodman, John C Reilly, Tom Huddleston and Samuel L Jackson under-utilised and/or under- stretched, no more so than with the one female role where the talents of Brie Larson - recent Academy Award winner for ""Room"" - are squandered. <br/><br/>If you sit through endless credits, you'll see a clip which appears to be setting up a sequel in which Kong faces off with Godzilla (apparently in a 2020 release).

The plot is about a scientist getting a military unit to come check out an island which lots of disappearances have occurred. They get there and realized why the disappearances have been happening and try to escape. There were a couple things that bothered me about the film and one of them was character development. The characters names were mentioned once and never again. There should not be a movie were I leave and not know at least one characters name. However Tom Hiddleston's character is very likable and his acting is just real good, as well for Brie Larson. Kong was real awesome he has a lot of action when he's on screen and it makes up for the lack of character development. How does it compare to the 2005 version? Its less dynamic and feels like its dragged a little too long because other than the 2 leads you don't care about anyone else. 05's was very well developed and most characters actually fitted well to plot, while here I think they had to many and very little to say about them.

Their mission becomes one of survival.<br/><br/>The references to other films are pretty obvious. There's a good 60's Rock 'n' Roll soundtrack that makes a strong reference to 'Apocalypse Now'. The cinematography is good and makes a strong reference to 'Jurassic Park'. Tracking Kong sequences makes a strong reference to 'Predator'.<br/><br/>Stay until after the rolling end credits, approx. 10 minutes (there's a lot of people involved) to see a scene that introduces the next film in the franchise – 'Godzilla vs. Kong' reboot.<br/><br/>The plot and dialog were mundane but Kong was always going to be just mindless entertainment. None-the-less an all-round fun film."

"ryanberrisford2001","7","2","5","9 March 2017"," A Fun Kong Film, but doesn't Live up to Godzilla (2014)
","Just to say, Godzilla (2014) is my favorite film in the world to be honest, I loved the characterization and the build up to one of the most epic third acts in movie history, people may say it had little Godzilla and too much character. So the creators of Kong: Skull Island listened.<br/><br/>Kong Skull Island is pack with great sequences... when Kong is in the picture, its so much fun seeing him kick more monster butt on the big screen again, and the characters John C Reilly and Samuel Jackson are both great and shine in this film, and personally I thought Tom Hiddleston was a cool bad-ass who had little characterization, but lived up with his tricks.<br/><br/>The problems are, them three I mentioned were the only ones with characterization, maybe Toby Kebball but I didn't care. The Characters are lame and bore me, I just wanted Kong, I wanted to love these characters like in Godzilla, that's why it never bored me. Another problem is, as I loved how Godzilla (2014) teased you from the beginning of a big fight but never showed adding anticipation, which is why the final battle is so AMAZING, due to its build up, if we already earlier on saw Godzilla fight, we would think ""well... I've already seen this"" But in this it shows too much Kong kicking ass that it ruined the final battle, don't worry I loved the scenes, its just that I didn't recognize that near the end, that this was a final battle as it was just the same as the earlier scenes, so it didn't wow me.<br/><br/>But that end credits scene.... IS WORTH SPENDING ALL YOUR MONEY TO SEE Overall, it was okay and fun at points, just with big mistakes I hope they learn from it, as they seemed to listen to the Godzilla feedback. I rate this a 7/10"

","This was by far the best movie of the year! The action was amazing, the characters were interesting the plot had depth and was fleshed out, and the creatures were creative. Kong was awesome. His CGI was perfect. You could see every pore in his skin. The CGI on the lizard creatures was also great. This movie also had a great pace to it. It felt like 2 hours of pure excitement! It was cool seeing Kong fight giant squids and lizard creatures. The CGI on the bamboo spider wasn't as good as on the other creatures, and that's a shame, because the filmmakers did put a lot of work into making the other monsters. All in all, I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone to see!"

","How many times will Hollywood rehash a story, try to put a twist on it and pretend it can be interesting? This was a painful watch. Nearly all the action fell flat and looked desultory as the characters ran from one side to the other for no reason. Samuel Jackson is years overdue for retirement. Dare I say it the female Chinese characters made me chuckle a couple of times - everyone knows that since studios were bought by the Chinese directors must have at least one Chinese character (See Star Wars Rogue One, Independence Day Resurrection, etc. etc.) but she has absolutely no acting ability or reason to be there, maybe that makes me sexist or racist? A truly cringe-worthy performance. On a positive note - sounds like there won't be sequel! Who am I kidding?"
"DannyDnB","5","2","6","16 March 2017"," Weak-but-entertaining monster movie.
","Since this movie was released last Friday, it has garnered a fairly positive reception. Seeing it being talked about so positively aroused an eager interest, mostly due to my love of the King Kong character, which led me to see it a few days ago. Do I think that it lived up to the hype? No. I do not.<br/><br/>Now, that does not mean to say that I did not derive any enjoyment from the picture, because I did, but boy, this movie has issues.<br/><br/>The movie begins by introducing us to the various characters who are brought together by John Goodman and Corey Hawkins' characters, two men who are leading an expedition to an uncharted island. Once there they inevitably run into the famous ape, as well as some other scary creatures. <br/><br/>This is an extremely formulaic plot present in every King Kong movie. However, the problem I had with this film wasn't necessarily over the simple structure, but more so the poor execution of said structure.<br/><br/>The human characters feel paper thin and lazily written. The dialogue they are given is even worse. Tom Hiddlestone and Brie Larsson are two particular characters who are given no development whatsoever, yet the movie puts them in situations where it feels like we are supposed to care for them. The only two characters that were given any kind of development were John C. Reilly and Samual L. Jackson. Everyone else felt like they were part of a B-movie.<br/><br/>Now, negative out of the way, I must say that Kong and the other creatures on the island are the high-points of the film for me. Everyone one of them feels realistic, with personality. Their movements flow and add weight, particularly with Kong himself. I found myself wanting the monsters on screen whenever they weren't, and I wasn't let down on that end.<br/><br/>It's a pity the weak characters take away from the greatness of the titular beast, but it's safe to say that anyone who wants to see King Kong beating the crap out of mysterious monsters will not be disappointed. Just don't expect to remember the movie two weeks down the line."
"aidanlad","6","2","6","15 March 2017"," Great action and special effects, but suffered in acting and storyline.
","The film unfortunately did not reach my expectations - having seen the adverts, which looked promising. I felt from the very beginning the movie was a bit pacey and progressed too fast into the adventure and exploration of the island. There were some parts that were intriguing, especially the special effects, leading into the arrival into the island. <br/><br/>However, the film did massively lack in acting, script and general sense of story line. I felt the acting wasn't convincing, and lacked emotion, and did not evoke much emotion within me. The only thing I felt the film had going for it was the incredible special effects, which is why I gave this film a 6 star rating. There were some really great scenes of action, shock and surprise. <br/><br/>I believe this film is worth watching, but I wouldn't consider it a personal favourite. Definitely worth a watch though!"
"richardchatten","3","2","6","12 March 2017"," A Lengthy Trail for the Main Bout Yet to Come
","Anyone who's ever seen 'Dr Strangelove' will have to admire the sheer chutzpah of appropriating Vera Lynn singing 'We'll Meet Again' to conclude this brash new upstart. But as the song now implies, it isn't quite the conclusion; and there then follows the by now ritual post-credits epilogue, which reveals ancient cave drawings of Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra and Ghidarah, ready and waiting to kick ass three years from now in the sequel for which this film has basically been just an appetiser. Since 'Kong: Skull Island' is set in 1973, the main bout may already have taken place by now, but I don't recall hearing anything about it on the news.<br/><br/>Despite - or perhaps because of - his more authentically gorilla-like features, the new streamlined Kong looks pretty realistic but utterly lacks the charisma of his great grandpappy. He seems to have only two expressions: suspicious and cross; and modern CGI technology still isn't able to make Kong move convincingly like a gorilla (he still glides about as if he's wading through water, usually photographed from below in close up like the giants in 'Land of the Giants'). In a nod to the 1933 original, Kong sees off a helicopter squadron and an ugly looking prehistoric monster described as a ""skullcrawler"", as well as interacting fleetingly a couple of times with heroine Brie Larson before heading off towards the horizon like Shane. CGI being expensive, Kong actually spends much of the film offscreen, while we instead have to listen to a lot of talk from a collection of bores who make occasional perfunctory attempts at wit, menace and pathos; with someone suddenly getting messily killed off now and again in order to remind us what an inhospitable place Skull Island is. Their efforts to get to safety owe more to 'The Lost World' than the original 'King Kong', with Samuel L. Jackson making a nuisance of himself with his Ahab-like grudge against Kong for having given as good as he got when shot at by the new arrivals.<br/><br/>Skull Island itself has a hot climate that encourages the growth of huge primates, arachnids and other monsters (although the vegetation, mosquitos and human population remain normal-sized), and is yet near enough to the South Pole for it to be possible to view the Aurora Australis."
"yinkbling","7","2","6","10 March 2017"," Very Entertaining, great CGI but nothing out of the ordinary
","OK I would go straight to the point here, Kong was action filled coupled with very good acting as I did expect, however the story-line & dialogue at some point could be likened to that of a 12-year old, very weak & lacks purpose. Without the fighting / action scenes I probably would have rated the movie 4/10 as the other scenes were very boring. At some stage, I couldn't understand what the mission was because it got very confusing and plain. Looking at the positives though, CGI was totally top notch, Kong was scary, powerful and his engagements with other creatures were very interesting. Acting was also OK, Tom Hiddleston & Samuel L Jackson delivered, the other actors weren't bad either. To round it all up, the movie is still a very good watch if you not expecting so much but for decent action scenes and good brawls."
"Neil-M09","6","2","6","10 March 2017"," An entertaining and thrilling movie in several scenes, and a promising ending
","It isn't like the classic version of King Kong, it is only focused on action, there is no city, much less the Empire State, only an unexplored island. Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) is hired as a guide for the expedition, as well as Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackaon) and his platoon, photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) and other members to join the expedition. A few minutes from being in air territory, the helicopters are shot down by King Kong and the survival of the characters begins. In the course of history will be revealed the true intentions of certain members of the expedition causing more setbacks. Despite this they find another ally, Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a pilot lost for years who survived within the tribe of the island.<br/><br/>Considering that the cast contains an acclaimed British actor, an Oscar winner actress and two actors nominated to the same, I must say that in terms of performance was just acceptable but not beyond that. The script has as pro, to be divided in several events due to the separation of the expedition but not beyond this, the rest will be to escape of the island and to survive the beasts inside the same.<br/><br/>As a recommendation, wait for the credits, where it is shown that this movie is just the prelude to a bigger project."
"AlexFalzon","7","2","6","10 March 2017"," Review - Kong: Skull Island - Surprisingly enjoyable.
","Man, the tone in this film is all over the place and I mean that in the best way possible. It never stops feeling strange, but it also never feels wrong, either. We'll be enjoying a light-hearted scene set to the tune of a '70s rock song. Suddenly, gruesomely, fatally, we have a terrifying encounter with an enormous monster. Then we're back with another '70s hit over a montage as our protagonists journey to their next obstacle. It's bizarre, and it works.<br/><br/>If you're expecting to see that same Kong story with which you are familiar, alter those expectations radically. Kong never leaves Skull Island, never kidnaps a blonde, and is around five times larger than you've ever seen him before (unless you saw Japan's 1962 film King Kong vs. Godzilla). Unlike the original film, Skull Island is set in 1973, immediately after Nixon pulls out of Vietnam, and, oh, boy, do the filmmakers have fun with this. As well as the aforementioned soundtrack, the score, cinematography, even the film's posters all channel the era, with nods to Apocalypse Now sometimes taking up entire scenes.<br/><br/>This isn't to take away too much from the creativity of the film. The excellent cinematography is the work of Larry Fong, who's done a bunch of Zack Snyder films, and the CGI is phenomenal, with a couple of very small exceptions with regard to the small(er) animals that drifted just a little too far into the uncanny.<br/><br/>Our characters (a helicopter squadron and a group of scientists, neatly separated by colour, as well as a tracker, a photographer, and three members of the mysterious organisation ""Monarch"", which you may remember from 2014's Godzilla) head to the strange island after picking it up for the first time via satellite (what if something good's there and the Russians get it!?). After Kong, they also meet the other denizens of the island – enormous buffaloes and spiders, new, fictional monstrosities, and good old human natives. At this point the objectives of the characters divide; some want to flee the island, some want to hide and wait for rescue, others still enter Ahab territory and are resolved to take down the big gorilla himself.<br/><br/>The screenplay has obviously gone over a couple of drastic revisions. Characters say things like ""this happened in '72"", which is a little weird, because the film is set in '73. Why not just say ""last year""? I can only guess that the year in which the film is set changed during pre/production.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston and John Goodman are solid. Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson somehow manage to deliver excellent performances in a very silly (but fun!) movie. John C. Reilly is great, blending that great sense of humour and timing with just the right dosage of sobering heartbreak that comes with being stranded on an island for thirty years; he crashed during World War II.<br/><br/>Many cute references are sprinkled throughout the film, and done so in a charmingly subtle way; ""Hold onto your butts"" says Jackson's character. I breathed a sigh of relief when they elected not to actually play Ride of the Valkyries during an already extremely Apocalypse-Nowy sequence. It's actually a pretty clever movie, and I was very pleasantly surprised."
"btkb","10","1","2","22 March 2020"," Reviews about ALL of the King Kong Movies!
","Kong: Skull Island (2017) - You have three great actors/actress in this film: Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston, and Samuel Jackson. The three characters from Marvel movies. This movie was awesome! Of course, it is better than the original and the remake of King Kong (2005). The CGI in this was terrific. Can't wait to see King Kong vs. Godzilla! This is worth the watch!<br/><br/>King Kong (2005) - This was really good! Surprisingly, Jack Black was in it. The movie did really good with special effects and all. King Kong looked great! I feel like this remake was better than the first remake. It is worth the watch!<br/><br/>King Kong Lives (1986) - It was pretty good. Surprised to see the lady who played Sarah Connor in this movie. You get to see King Kong and Female Kong escaping, along with having Baby Kong in this movie. The movie is pretty great. The ending was sad.<br/><br/>King Kong (1976) - It was not bad, but it was a bit different. I liked it since it is not animation anymore, and they have improved in making King Kong look real. It is not that bad. It is different, but it is still worth the watch.<br/><br/>King Kong Escapes (1968) - Surprised to see King Kong fighting with his Cyborg King Kong! It was not that bad. Worth the watch!<br/><br/>King Kong vs. Godzilla (1963) - It was pretty cool. King Kong fighting with Godzilla was awesome! You might tell some of them are fake when it comes to vehicles and trains getting stomped or destroyed. At the same time, it is pretty cool and great to watch! Can't wait to see the remake of this movie!<br/><br/>Son of Kong Son of Kong (1933) - I did not expect King Kong to have a son! This was pretty good. King Kong's son looked shorter, but he looked pretty cool. Same animation like they did with King Kong in the first movie. It's pretty cool to see what it was like before CGI existed. Great movie!<br/><br/>King Kong (1933) - Not bad! The animation of King Kong looked great! Of course, CGI wasn't there in the 30s, but it was still a great movie!"
"thekarmicnomad","7","1","2","5 November 2019"," Not as clever as a signing gorilla but very entertaining
","This starts off with opposing World War 2 airmen having a fight on a deserted Pacific island.
What leaps out straight away is that apparently our Japanese pilot was flying around in his single seat fighter with a goddamn samurai sword strapped to his belt.<br/><br/>This is a blatant telegraph from the director to say ""this film is dumb. If you want clever this isn't it! Go away!""<br/><br/>Once you are on board the train of stupidity you can sit back and relax.<br/><br/>Flash forward to the early 1970's
For some dumb reason a bunch of dumb arse U.S soldiers are diverted from the Vietnam evacuation to take some equally dumb scientists and boffins to what is clearly Death-Trap island.<br/><br/>Once on Murder-Island we are treated to monsters and helicopter fights and giant insects and raging storms and of course a very big monkey.<br/><br/>The scenes and characters are big and brash and dumb and so very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The story is too moronic for me to repeat - but in a good way.<br/><br/>This is quite graphic in places and squeamish children may get nightmares.
Apart from that just lock and load and watch a bunch of dumb-dumbs get their arses handed to them.<br/><br/>Stick around for the obligatory after credits scene."

"Floated2","5","1","2","21 July 2019"," Good visuals lack of story
","As with the most of these monster King Kong or Godzilla films, the main interest is in regards to the special effects, and visuals and the story or its characters are the least concern. Although this movie has great visuals, well scenery and Kong looks visually stunning, it's story or most of its main characters just aren't interesting enough.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston is a solid actor but he's dull as a leading action hero. Samuel L. Jackson plays his typical angry character and Brie Larson is okay. Though it's John C. Riley's character who steals the scenes abs comes out most memorable.<br/><br/>Some decent action scenes and some nice looking kills from the monsters but not enough excitement or joy. We didn't care much for the lesser characters when they died. With a predictable outcome and a plot that doesn't quite reach its full potential, this movie isn't that great as it could have been. Perhaps it was too watered down and family friendly."

"Martinito_08183","4","1","2","20 June 2019"," Unsatisfied by this new interpretation of the legendary monster.
","Kong: Skull Island is enjoyable, but that doesn't mean it's enough to be considered as a good film. It features a fair amount of action sequences and unfortunately not so much interesting stuff in it. The story, characters, acting and music are the weakest aspects, that hurts the film and drags the score down for me. The positives can still be found very easily, but of course they can be considered also as negatives at the same time. John C. Reilly is the only one, who gives a good performance and his character (while very stereotypical) is the one, that everybody will very easily connect to and having a closer for him was very nice. The visual effects are very mixed for me - they look good and very unimpressive at the same time; good cinematography, but huge percent of it can be found in other films; the scenes with Kong are good, but very short and he's not in it so much and then the huge positive is the impressive sound. If you want to see a good King Kong film, go and watch the older versions of the legendary monster."
"bregund","3","1","2","10 June 2019"," Maybe they should have added more bad actors
","I'm not sure what to make of Brie Larson. Did she make a deal with the devil? Her monotone voice, flat delivery, expressionless face, and inability to convey emotion should be working against her, but strangely, people keep throwing acting roles at her. Is there anyone in the world who is excited to see a film because Brie Larson's name is attached to it? If so, I would like to meet these people and ask them: What is your deal? As bad as she is, there are even worse actors in this dud, namely John Ortiz, whose acting skills are simply dreadful. Samuel L. Jackson's natural intensity might have saved this film, but he's a machine gun firing off his mouth over every little thing, trying to pump some life into into a plot that makes less sense the more you think about it. The only saving grace is John C. Reilly, who understands his role inside and out; he is the only human being in the film."
"ConnorMacleodoftheClanMacleod","9","1","2","3 June 2019"," Let's get ready to rumble...
","Let's start off with addressing all the negative reviews... what did you expect from a film about a mutated giant ape? Did you expect it to start spouting Shakespeare as it danced through the jungle? Get a grip of yourselves, this film provides exactly what it was meant to! An introduction to Monarch, an introduction to to the Titans and and introduction to the inevitable Kong vs Godzilla! On top of that we get the luxury of seeing top class actors, brilliant cinematography and class special effects.<br/><br/>The film starts by throwing us into action, two WW2 planes come crashing down onto a picturesque island, the pilots jump out and immediately start to try and kill the other, their battle through the jungle sees them a top a cliff just about to kill one another when Kong's appearance prevents any death. Brilliant! This is exactly what we want, within the first few minutes we've been introduced to the big guy.<br/><br/>Fast forward 30 odd years and we meet John Goodman playing a Monarch representative attempting to coerce the US government to assist him with discovering Skull Island. John Goodman, great actor and huge screen presence. I'm already thinking brilliant. We then meet Samuel Jackson as a stern no nonsense Colonel Packard, I've always been a huge fan of Mr Jackson so I'm already happy with this, then we meet Tom Hiddleston who is another brilliant actor playing a retired SAS Captain our for hire. Other noted actors in this production are Toby Kebbel, Brie Larson etc.<br/><br/>The director wastes no time in getting to Skull Island and throwing us into the action. A typical American method of blowing things up and asking questions later is what sees Kong come back into our screens. Monarch decide to drop bombs on the island to establish whether it is a hollow earth or not, this in turn sees Kong appear again exact his form of retribution, I mean it is his home after all. From then on out it because a story of survival and getting off the island, the introduction of John C Reilly later on in the film brings the comedic side as as well as a little historical knowledge to Kong and what he's all about... and that is a protector of the world we know against the creatures that lurk in the ground below.<br/><br/>Huge battle scenes between Kong and the humans, the humans and deadly Skull Island Creatures And Kong And Skull Island Creatures gives the viewers exactly what they wanted. Throughout the whole of this film you're thinking that we're just building up to the inevitable Kong vs Godzilla!<br/><br/>I personally and loving the direction that the monster verse is going at the moment and can't wait to see me. I enjoyed this film and think others will too. For those on the fence just go into it thinking, hey this is a film about a giant mutated ape smashing stuff up."

""Dragged a little, early on"".
""Not many creatures"".<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>Hey guys, so after travelling to Italy in the world of cider, and travelling to Worthing and Yarmouth recently. P.s All available on my blog reaseadotorg,
I am now travelling into a magical world in the Pacific. A world unlike anything my senses have ever witnessed. Prepare for THE Kong: Skull island movie review !!!<br/><br/>A 2017 Fantasy Sci-fi, with lots of action and massive creatures worth a watch ?<br/><br/>You bet son...<br/><br/>Yeah, I mean the film was cool. Good music, good characters, good scenery. There were quite a few weaknesses but none that a mountain-sized gorilla couldn't cover up ... See more below:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Storyline<br/><br/>The storyline, without giving too much away, was understandable for all the family. It was frustratingly basic for the Uber intelligent though. Yes it had action, pretty good effects and graphics, and a few key events with different settings. Beyond this though, there was something missing. I'm guessing it wasn't a mountain-sized ape, but more likely, stuff which could've happened that wasn't made so predictable.<br/><br/>Part of the blame lies with the script here.
For example, If you say:
""When I go to the park, there will be a kid on a swing"".
Then go to the park, and when you get there and Ryan is indeed (on the swing), that discovery isn't particularly dramatic. It doesn't say ...
BOOM !!
like a surprise.
More
""Oh right, yeah"".<br/><br/>The rest of the blame, lies with the actual events that happened, not having enough going on. Maybe a few more creatures or natural events would've compensated for this ...<br/><br/>Fortunately, the scenery was changed regularly. With characters travelling quite a bit. This was a good touch, and certainly made things more entertaining.<br/><br/>
Genre<br/><br/>As for a Sci-fi/fantasy, the film was good. All characters had excellent graphics and effects. The genre was only let down by the number of characters that existed. There certainly could have been quite a lot more. This would have made the fantasy even more fantastic. I would say, this would be better categorised as an action/fantasy rather than Sci-fi, because despite some scientists being involved, there is very little science actually in the film. At least compared to the level of action.<br/><br/>
Characters<br/><br/>The lead roles had good diversity and plenty of character personalities, with ideas coming to light throughout. The interactions were insightful enough to regret characters being harmed, yet were slightly basic.
I'd suggest a few less characters, to improve the emotional connection to their roles.
Despite this ...
The costume variety only enhanced this aspect of the film, and with a few big names, the characters were on the whole well-played.<br/><br/>Music<br/><br/>The music was applied where necessary, to compensate for less action. With restraint at times, where other sounds were more significant to the impact of the scene. This is an area frequently underperformed, but for this film, the balance of when music was played, and it's type, was effectively incorporated.<br/><br/>
Summary<br/><br/>An action-packed, travelling fantasy film, with plenty of costume and scenery effects to leave you satisfied."
"Hyliannoyed","8","1","2","10 March 2019"," Interesting New King Kong Film with a Couple Weak Spots
","A mostly enjoyable monster-romp, Kong: Skull Island is a fun and unique film for the 80+-year-old ape franchise. There's a lot to like, with some wild creature encounters and a very different plot than we've seen before. However, the cast is very crowded, and most don't really get time to shine. Still, they mostly do well with what they are given. That being said, the only real disappointment is Brie Larson, who's character brings nothing to the table. It's also a little bit gory in places, compared to the usual building-wrecking and explosions we've come to expect from giant monster films. Still, though, it's worth a watch for any monster-movie fan."
"mitchell5954","8","1","2","10 February 2019"," A Very Fun Ride
","Kong Skull Island is a summer blockbuster at its finest. It's a great looking spectacle with fun action, and an all-around entertaining flick. There isn't much to it beyond that, but it's not trying to be anything more either. For what the film is it works fine, though could have been improved in some areas. I was cautiously optimistic about seeing this film as it's supposed to be in the same universe as Godzilla 2014, which was one of the biggest letdowns in recent memory, in my opinion. Also, I am not a big fan of Peter Jackson's King Kong. It's good, but not really my cup of tea. It was a great looking film with some good action, but it was far too long, and got really boring in places for me. Thankfully, this film definitely more entertaining than Godzilla or King Kong (2005), but does have some of the same issues as the former.<br/><br/>The story is very simple. A new island is discovered via satellite and is dubbed Skull Island. A team is sent to the island to study the geography and wildlife. They then get attacked by King Kong, as well as other giant creatures that call the island home. Now our main characters must survive and find a way to get off the island.<br/><br/>What this film definitely has going for it is the spectacle. The film looks great, from the cinematography to the score, to the special effects. Unlike Godzilla 2014, which only showed Godzilla full-on for maybe two scenes that only last a few seconds, this film shows us Kong in his full glory very early on and we do see quite a bit of him throughout the movie. Though, I wish we could've seen him more. Also unlike Godzilla 2014 where all the Godzilla action is in the background, when we see Kong in action it's in the forefront and it is very pleasing to watch. All of the action was well-done I thought. If you want to see giant monster action like I did you will get your money's worth. If nothing else, this is an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The movie has good pacing too. It wastes almost no time in getting to what the audience came to see the movie for.<br/><br/>The characters aren't the strongest. This was one of the things that killed the Godzilla movie for me. Not only was there barely any Godzilla in favor of the humans, but the characters were some of the blandest I've ever seen. A block of wood is less bland than they were.<br/><br/>I think the main issue in this film is that there are too many characters, and many of them get lost in the shuffle. Some characters you forget are even in the film like John Goodman's. Though, the cast here is better than Godzilla because of the actors. Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, John C. Reilly, and John Goodman all do a good job performance-wise, though the script lets them down a little. Samuel L. Jackson's character goes through an arc in this film that I did not entirely like and the film could've done without.<br/><br/>The characters here are definitely more fun here than Godzilla, despite my issues with them. I was with them enough where I wasn't bored with the movie, which is something. The movie does attempt to be more fun, unlike Godzilla which was entirely joyless. However, while some of the jokes land others fall flat. Some of the humor comes off as quite awkward and conflicts with the tone of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Kong Skull Island was a fun experience. If you're looking for a fun monster movie you should have a good time. If you want anything more you might be disappointed. It has great monster action and is a beautiful looking film. The human characters aren't the most interesting, but are still pretty fun to watch. It certainly did not kill the movie for me like it did Godzilla."
"tabuno","7","1","2","11 January 2019"," A Flashy Reimagined Kong With Flaw
","21 March 2017. With shades of the classic war movies Good Morning Vietnam (1987) and Apocalypse Now (1979) and perhaps even the monster epic Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959) and perhaps Jurassic Park 1993), this reimagined Kong movie begins with both a measured surprise and a quite different Kong movie that shows a lot of promise. Nevertheless, the script eventually falls flat in places as the plot points become more important than the realistic strategic or authentic flow from scene to scene. A huge example of the manipulation of a screen stretched to the breaking point in order to maintain the director's or producer's intended rational for a scene later in the movie is the first gigantic encounter between man and beast and it's pretty much an overkill and unbelievable disaster for man. And at almost regular intervals thereafter there are humans that seem to fall prey in order to show off some special effect cuteness that really doesn't do much for the movie and with little rationale except attempt to justify the cost of the movie. This sort of demise is repeated over and over again just in order to perhaps reduce the number of characters to manageable proportions and extend the time of the movie. A lot of editing and cutting would probably have made the pacing of this adventure action movie much more palpable. Nevertheless, the plot outline of this Kong version is very distinctive and admirable in concept and there are some great individual scenes and photographic images that boggle the mind. The ending credits film images also is a plus along with the outstanding presence of John C. Reilly almost carries the show."

"obettiffy","5","1","2","5 August 2018"," Excellent Animation but the story was meh.
","Having seen the film, the animations and visual effects were superb! However, the story line for this sequel wasn't as good as I expected. Here are my opinions why:<br/><br/>1) What triggered me the most was the Photographer character who didn't really have a role in the movie and was just documenting the events. She wasn't any help to other characters and for somewhat a 'main' character, she was quite boring and wasn't necessary for the film. The director probably wanted to keep the ""there should be a woman involved in King Kong sequel"" trend, but he could have done it better.<br/><br/>2) Other characters relating to this is Tom's character and the Asian scientist. Tom's character as a Captain didn't really show as much - Captains known for their leadership, bravery and intelligence. Yes, he showed leadership and took care of the other characters but without him, the others could have survived through instinct especially there wasn't a lot going on during their scene. Harsh to say but I think the director used Tom to hide the fact that the story isn't that good. As for the Asian scientist, she was as useless as the photographer.<br/><br/>3) I wasn't surprised to see Samuel Jackson (again) - knowing he's literally been in every movie nowadays. His character was ok but I think they should have taken more time to improve his character. Instead of him wanting to kill Kong for revenge and that ""people or children shouldn't grow up knowing there's a 'monster' on a mysterious island"", his role could have been, maybe, a traitor or a hunter, knowing that if he kills Kong, he'll earn a lot of money. This can be a sequel from the previous movie of when Kong was captured for entertainment - some thing like that.<br/><br/>4) The only part of the story that I liked was when John Reilly discussed the history of Kong and what could happen next. That made the movie. I think they should have placed in a scene of Kong's history - how these creatures exist, what was their purpose."
"Hitchcoc","5","1","2","29 June 2018"," Stupid People on a Stupid Mission
","I can't contribute much here because most of the nay-sayers have already said ""Nay."" First of all, we have no real idea why the government would ante up for this ludicrous venture. Once the Senator decides to go along with it, a truly idiotic array of cannon fodder and expensive helicopters head off, not knowing a thing about their reason for doing so. The early scene of Kong destroying the copters is asinine. Once he grabbed the first chopper, the rest of the pilots should have backed off and figured things out. Kong's arms are long but about 30 feet would have put them out of harm's way. There is so much that goes unexplained in this thing and so many plot holes, it's hard to get into it. Sam Jackson plays the same part he has played about sixteen times (were there any snakes in those helicopters?). The rest of the stiff acting company does nothing to develop any sort of connection for us. Even the hero guy is about as boring as one can be. I could go on, but others have already poked holes in it enough."

","So I watched Kong Skull Island strictly because I like Tom Hiddleston (I'll be honest) and I was shockingly impressed by this movie.<br/><br/>The writing and directions is surprisingly good, especially in the action scenes.

Nothing earth shattering, but they do their jobs. The characters aren't that interesting and would have probably fallen flat without the actors doing all the work to carry them. But they aren't bad or anything.<br/><br/>The special effects look phenomenal. And the soundtrack works really well to make it feel like a war time movie. Like it has this weirdly nostalgic feel to it. Like if it wasn't for the modern special effects, I would have this weird sense memory of having watched this movie as a kid (and not just cause its a reboot).<br/><br/>If I had to describe it, it is like Jurassic Park meets Saving Private Ryan.

"joebloggscity","7","1","2","17 February 2018"," Big Bash monsters - but it's different and works well
","Kong: Skull Island - More monster bashing - but a nice change in storyline.<br/><br/>Okay another big monster bashing movie, yet this one feels different. The action as always is centre stage, and CGI of the big monsters has little ever been done better. The Kong CGI was exceptionally good, and you actually felt a lot of empathy towards the character which was incredible instead of seeing it alone as some big graphic.<br/><br/>The film though is carried by our leads and the storyline. Tom Hiddleston & Samuel L Jackson are excellent as hero & villain respectively on the little island with big beasties. They are given a better story than usual with a change, and it worked very well. It kept me engrossed, and any rehash of the original King Kongs etc would simply have bored me despite the action on the screen.<br/><br/>However, there is no getting away that we've all seen too many big monster bashes in recent years. The Mavel & DC films are full of them, and as two of our leads here come from the Marvel stable, it feels like you are revising their old world. One sequence even reminded me of 300 with the slow motion hacking/slashing action scenes. That aside the rest was fine, you got to admire that they allowed it to be an adult aimed film rather than having a Disney-fied movie.<br/><br/>As a big budget monster movie, it was good, and deserves more credit than it seems to have got so far. It's a great stab and different to the rest. If you find it to watch, give it a go."
"cutesd","2","1","2","4 February 2018"," What a mess
","This film can't decide what it is. <br/><br/>First it wants to be Aliens: send a bunch of badass military dudes to rid the world of horrible monsters. Then it tries to be Jurassic Park: scientists dealing with out of control ancient species. And then it goes all Heart of Darknessy/Apocolypse Now with Samuel L. losing his sh**. And by the end it's Predator: human against alien species revenge for killing his men flick. But it doesn't do any of them well and the entire thing ends up feeling completely unnecessary. <br/><br/>They go to the island (which has been actively avoided since the beginning of time) to protect the world from the ""monsters"" who live there. What? The things never leave the island ... nobody's ever seen them ... but we need to destroy them before they destroy us. Right ... <br/><br/>Then the first thing they do once they reach this pristine untouched wilderness is drop a bunch of bombs on it. And when Kong comes out to defend the island he's branded a ""monster"" and they go immediately to ""KILL IT!"" Which in the end gets a lot of men killed ... oh but that's Kong's fault. Hey genius, how bout you turn the choppers around when the big monster comes ... run away ... save more men. But no ... Kong is the bad one.<br/><br/>Then they encounter a huge spider thing who's just strolling along and minding its own business ... it accidentally skewers a dude with one of its legs ... and instead of running away or hiding ... no they start shooting and hacking its legs off. So it defends itself ... kills more guys ... and they wind up butchering the poor thing ... probably the only one of its kind in the world.<br/><br/>So the military just stomps through destroying land and killing endangered species and calling themselves the good guys. And the Colonel gets WAY more guys killed going on his revenge mission than would've if he'd actually thought about the health and safety of his men. So is this supposed to be an anti-war film?<br/><br/>And then the film segues to a soldier who dropped there in WW2 and a strange mute civilization that worships Kong and then evil skull crusher lizards. So now you're really on Kong's team cuz he's like the protector of the people. Which is all just gearing up for the big showdown between Kong and head lizard which Kong wins of course. <br/><br/>And then there's the eyeroll-worthy push for the freaking ""monster-universe"" at the end ... gag.

If this is supposed to be a precursor to ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" (Lol) then why does this story take it place so long in the past? ""Apocalypse Now"" feel throughout, while fighting some pretty ugly creatures and fantastically enough, there are a tribe of people on this island along with a MIA soldier. Kong is their protector along with protecting the whole island itself from meaner things taking over. Here comes a man with a gun and an attitude thinking he will bring the mighty Kong down and alas, it does not happen. How this got an Oscar nom for its visuals is not really hard to see why, but still they are not as genuine as they SHOULD have been. Story and overdone plot along with the acting are just terrible and not believable, of course Jackson plays with the same attitude as he does in every other movie he has been in. Seems he only took one class and quitting acting school. How this got a ""PG-13"" rating is beyond me with the mid-air dismemberment of one unlucky soldier and various other gross scenes including the regurgitation of human bones from the ""Skull"" creatures. If you haven't seen this flick do yourself a favor and just watch Peter Jacksons' ""King Kong"". You will leave a happier viewer. This? No. No to all of it."

"LightningB","2","1","2","26 November 2017"," Thinnest characters ever\Plot holes galore
","WARNING: Tons of spoilers!!!!!<br/><br/>What did I miss? How did this flick get those solid reviews? This was incredibly lazy storytelling at its best. They very quickly establish every character as cliché so they get can the movie going. Hiddleston is that travelling, adventurous loner which we get in about 8 seconds after seeing him. Larson is that journalist whose ethics are so pure, she quickly brushes off a dream assignment because you know, she doesn't do it for the money. Actually not sure why her character is there at all other than there just had to be some sort of damsel in distress. Every soldier is instantly showcased as stereotype, Vietnam-film guys. We know that because there is also very stereotype Vietnam, 70s rock music that goes with them. Goodman is weird in that he feels very cliché but I'm just not sure which one. I think they wanted to mix in multiple clichés that he became unidentifiable. Still he feels like the most likable character to some extent because there is no one else to like. Then he gets snuffed out for what feels like no reason. It wasn't that huge impactful moment of a main character leaving like Goose or Gandalf. But it's clear the film thinks of his death that way. It was dumb and unnecessary. Kebbel is that aww- shucks, do-gooder who just wants to get back to his family but before we can even remotely care about him, he's snuffed out very abruptly. It's clear the film thinks they've done enough to set him up enough we should be sad and horrified when he's taken out. Barely knew him. John Ortiz is the corporate mongrel because we just had to have one. He's there to make the typical, dumb decisions for no good reason whatsoever. His death though, is the worst. It's just there. It happens and your like, did we need that? Not sure why it happened when and how it did. Uhh okay. I guess Reilly is likable because at least there's nothing dumb about him at least. Still you would think for a guy who is seeing his wife after 20-some odd years and meeting his son for first time, they would spend more than 8 seconds during end credits on that moment. It's just so hard to care with such lazy, thinly written characters. It's an insult to barely establish these guys and then act like we are supposed to care about them so much when tragedy happens. Problem is there isn't enough to care about.<br/><br/>So where do we start with the logic gaps? Despite flying through what they believe is some fierce thunderstorm\hurricane type clouds, there is no worry about them falling out the side of the open helos.<br/><br/>Why does Jackson bear so much vengeance that even though the bad monster is bearing down on him, he strangely only focuses on killing Kong even though it abundantly clear Kong is needed to ward off the bad monster?<br/><br/>While running from bad monster one soldier suddenly stops because out of nowhere he's just worn out and can't do it anymore. That would've been fine if he had shown any signs of feeling beaten down leading up to it. So he then decides to go out a hero. The moment builds up and the SWAT! Monster flicks him aside and he dies. What? What was the point?<br/><br/>Of course the worst one, when Kong starts taking out the helos, how come not one of them, you know, FLIES AWAY FROM KONG?!!! You know like a safe distance away or something even crazier like HIGHER!<br/><br/>What a waste. I mean what a tremendous, pointless use of resources. There is talent galore with the actors involved but terrible writing and going-through-the-motions directing leave this film painfully shallow. They got to get different writers and directors for future Kong films because he deserves a ton better."

They were wrong.<br/><br/>The ironic thing about this movie is that the original King Kong used stop-animation to bring the ape to life; this movie used the grossly overused and immensely irritating stop-action-so-you-can-look-at-the-cool-shot cliché to drop this steamer of a movie on us. It just goes to show that making movies doesn't require brains or talent, just money.<br/><br/>Giving this a ""2"" seems generous because it is ""awful"", but it's not Event Horizon awful."

True, most people will pay movie admission only once, but my experience with film at least, is that in many cases my opinion of a film changes with additional viewings. Having said that, as a fan of Peter Jackson's King Kong--one of my favorites films--I was disappointed when I watched Skull Island (on DVD only). I found the story not particularly engaging, nor the characters particularly likable (except Reilly). However, the monster aspect was great, and that probably is what attracts me to these movies in the first place. I would give those monster encounters a 10, and the rest of the movie a 5, hence a 7.

"makleen2","6","1","2","27 September 2017"," A Monstrous Popcorn Flick
","Samuel L Jackson fights CGI monsters in this nostalgia-driven reboot of the 1933 classic King Kong. This is the third remake/reboot of King Kong. Though essential elements of the original remain, Kong: Skull Island (2017) is set in 1973, at the end of the Vietnam War. It is replete with counter-culture references and music from the period, with the addition of a marooned WW2 vet to appeal to Baby Boomers and their parents alike. Nostalgia is the only explanation I have for why this film has gotten such good reviews. The dialog, acting, plot, and CGI are all mediocre. Its only redeeming quality is the ending fight scene between Kong and a giant skullcrawler called Ramarak.<br/><br/>The plot is straightforward. Bill Randa (John Goodman), a monster-hunter, attains funding to travel to an uncharted Pacific island under the guise of a geologic mapping expedition. He enlists the help of former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), and ""antiwar"" photojournalist Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), alongside various Landsat employees.<br/><br/>Once over the island, they encounter Kong, who smashes their helicopters. The survivors find a primitive tribe living on the island, alongside a stranded WW2 fighter pilot, Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly). From there, they must cross the island to safety while avoiding over-sized creatures and carnivorous skullcrawlers.<br/><br/>While the 2005 Peter Jackson remake staring Jack Black wasn't great either, I preferred that version of Kong. He was essentially just a giant silver-back gorilla, with complex emotions and mannerisms copied from real life. In contrast, this Kong was as tall as a skyscraper, walked upright, and had two emotional states: pensive and roaring loudly. He's also somehow impervious to .30 cal machine gun bullets, fire, and razor-sharp teeth.<br/><br/>1973 was an interesting setting for a Kong movie. In many ways this hearkens back to the 1976 remake, which also takes place in the '70s and features a helicopter battle with the monster. The settings, music, props, and cinematography all carefully reflect that period. In this time line, Bill Randa is eager to reach the island before newly launched U.S. satellites can map it, revealing its secrets. Randa sees President Richard Nixon announce troop withdrawal from Vietnam, and determines he must attain funding for his expedition before the war ends and Congress tightens its budget. Historically, the Earth Resources Technology Satellite was launched on July 23, 1972. It wasn't called Landsat until 1975–a minor discrepancy.<br/><br/>Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard comes close to being the film's primary antagonist. As commander of an air cavalry squadron, the Sky Devils, Packard is the arch-typical ""warrior without a war."" ""We didn't lose the war,"" he tells Mason Weaver, ""we abandoned it."" He relishes the chance to go on one final mission. When Kong ravages his squadron, destroys his helicopters, and kills his men, Packard becomes obsessed with revenge. He refuses to leave any man behind, taking his remaining troops on what seems like a suicide mission to recover Major Jack Chapman (Toby Kebbell). When Chapman dies, he persists with his determination to kill Kong.<br/><br/>While Packard is supposed to the bad guy, he's the only character whose motivations make sense. After Hank Marlow explains Kong has been protecting the tribesmen from skullcrawlers, James Conrad tells Packard that Kong was ""just defending his territory"" when he attacked their helicopters. Uh, OK? Unlike Conrad, who has no emotional ties to any other character, Packard has served with these men in war, presumably for years. He has an obligation to protect his men and recover them if they go missing. Can you blame him for being a little angry when he sees them butchered by a giant ape? Something else bothered me. Throughout the film, the main characters are covered in bile, muck, mud, dirt, blood, smoke, and scorched by flames, yet remain relatively unscathed. Mason Weaver and biologist San Lin (Tian Jing)'s hair and makeup are perfect. <br/><br/>They also barely react to their environment. In one scene, they stumble on a boneyard with the skeletons of Kong's parents, killed by skullcrawlers. ""Do you smell that?"" Marlow asks. ""That's death."" Yet no character reacts to the smell at all, probably because they're standing in front of a green screen. Later, Weaver and Conrad stand face-to-face with Kong, again with no reaction. I'm betting a giant gorilla that eats squid smells pretty bad. At least in the 1976 version, Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange's characters are dirty, wet, and their clothes are torn in the jungle.<br/><br/>The movie credits photojournalists like Mason Weaver for ending the Vietnam War, using photographs of war's horrors to stoke antiwar sentiment back home. Likewise, Bill Randa hopes to use photography to prove the existence of monsters on Skull Island. On several occasions, the audience sees the exotic creatures and settings through Weaver's camera lens. In one scene, a skullcrawler swallows Randa and his camera. The camera flash reveals its location in the smoke to the other characters, allowing them to escape. I thought this theme, the power of cameras and photography, was one interesting aspect of this film.<br/><br/>Overall, Kong: Skull Island wasn't as bad as its predecessors, but fell short in many critical areas. John C. Reilly, and Samuel L Jackson to some extent (in the vein of Snakes on a Plane and Deep Blue Sea), was there for comic relief, but the jokes fell flat. John Goodman is also traditionally a comedic actor, and Brie Larson is mostly known for playing Natalie ""Envy"" Adams in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. So I wasn't sure whether this was supposed to be a campy, fun monster movie, a commentary on the Vietnam War, or an action-packed adventure film. Whatever it was supposed to be, it never rose above the level of a typical popcorn flick."

"Hey_Sweden","6","1","2","15 September 2017"," Some decent monster madness in this one.
","Not really connected to other ""King Kong"" films in terms of story or characters, this is a reboot for the new century, telling the familiar apes' story for a new generation. A bunch of dreamers / monster chasers led by Bill Randa (John Goodman) are accompanied by a military escort as they set out to explore a newfound South Pacific island. They'll find that the main occupant is an ENORMOUS gorilla (this may be the hugest Kong on record) - but there is absolutely no shortage of formidable creatures on the island. Leading the military is an officer (Samuel L. Jackson) who is a bitter warrior in need of a new enemy. Hired to guide this bunch of dummies is a British tracker named Conrad (Tom Hiddleston).<br/><br/>You do have to be pretty undemanding to get into ""Kong: Skull Island"". The script is rubbish, with far too many ridiculous characters and far too much awful dialogue. It's also in the mold of a lot of modern Hollywood product, with the filmmakers seemingly hellbent on making sure that their audience is not bored. To that end, there's quite a bit of good monster action, as Kong is joined by a spider with VERY tall legs, giant wildebeest type things, a giant fresh water squid, and a menagerie of lizard type animals dubbed ""skull crawlers"". The movie is never more entertaining than when it focuses on Kong and his battles with his fellow island dwellers.<br/><br/>As for these people who are foolish enough to invade Kongs' domain, who really cares? Some of the actors - Hiddleston, Goodman, the gorgeous Brie Larson - manage to survive with some dignity intact. John C. Reilly adds a fair amount of the comedy relief with his role as a soldier who's been stuck on the island since the second World War. Jackson actually delivers a performance instead of just being a personality, but his character is one of the most absurd.<br/><br/>This does benefit from some lovely Hawaiian scenery, effectively shot in widescreen. And the CGI is actually some of the best that this viewer has seen; it doesn't look overly cartoonish. Kong is performed capably through the motion capture technique by Terry Notary and Toby Kebbell (the latter also plays the soldier Jack Chapman).<br/><br/>This viewer can understand why some people would be unimpressed, but was able to take the bad with the good, and have a reasonably fun time with this.<br/><br/>The use of all the rock songs got to be annoying. I didn't need *that* many reminders that this story takes place in 1973.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

","There are a lot of positive things about this movie. The CGI is good, the sets look great, the cast is adequate, and the story is fun. The film has a lot of beautiful shots and the colors are vibrant. I especially liked the northern lights. The costumes were decent and I enjoyed watching a big ape smash things. The fight scenes for Kong were great. They didn't get boring. He's dangerous to our characters and the story shows how he's needed to protect the island. The things that got in the way were continuity issues of time frame and the paper thin characters. The worst are played by Brie Larson, Tian Jing, and Tobby Kebbel. It's not the actors fault. They were given three characters we're supposed to care about but offer nothing to the story. While Jing and Kebbel's characters are not foremost in the story, Larson's character really wastes a lot of time to be the cute chick who's in the action. She's supposed to be the strong woman version of past damsels in the Kong Series. Problem is, those women were much stronger and more interesting than she ever was. First, they don't start off as the ""bad ass"" anti-war photographer. They start off as normal women in an dangerous situation. These women learn to survive with a massive animal who's probably going to eat them. They earn the animal's trust and establish boundaries (not well maintained mind you) which keeps the animal protecting them while they find a way to get out of their situation. Brie Larson's version is just a lame chick who cannot fight, looks pretty, and has little to no real reason to be Kong's interest (the other women were offered up to Kong which is why he's interested). It would have been better had Larson's and Jing's Character been combined. Jing's character was overshadowed and turned into another useless chick. That sucks because the two characters put into one would have been better than having two sub-par characters with little to no purpose. Honestly, why does anyone need a photographer on this adventure? Especially when you have characters like Randa and Brooks who already have cameras and a history of documenting research? At least Jing's Character could have had more screen time to explain her expertise and drive the story. But that doesn't matter. The film was still very entertaining."
"Mike_Devine","3","1","2","12 August 2017"," 'Kong' collapses under its own weight
","2005's 'King Kong' was a big budget blockbuster that was met with mixed reviews and arguably underperformed at the box office. Despite this lackluster track record, WB took a gamble with green lighting 2017's follow-up effort 'Kong: Skull Island.' While the film is equally bloated from a budget standpoint, it takes a step backward even further in terms of quality.<br/><br/>'Skull Island' follows a somewhat intriguing premise of following monster chasers (John Goodman and Corey Hawkins) and a post-Vietnam military escort (headed up by trigger-happy Samuel L. Jackson) as they explore an uncharted island in the Pacific. On paper, this all sounds fine and good, but as we get deeper into the film, it's clear director Jordan Vogt-Roberts is presiding over just a tired old formula of ""pick them off one-by-one."" From an acting standpoint, the roles are written very stereotypically, so even though there are some strong actors cast (Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly), they are not done any favors. Whether an antiwar idealistic photo journalist, meek scientists or a jaded yet-adventure-hungry former British special opps agent, all of these characters are just wooden and hollow.<br/><br/>As for the actual events of the film, there are a few scenes that are kind of new and different, but the vast majority feels like it's a rehash of many other films we've seen before, including 'Jurassic Park,' 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and others. Sure, it's pretty standard to see Hollywood recycle things here and there, but when the majority of a film feels like deja vu, that definitely works against it. As for the CGI, it's good but not spectacular, and so there are next to no good aspects of 'Skull Island.'<br/><br/>Sure, there are some who will be entertained by 'Kong: Skull Island' due to its action sequences and formulaic flow. But that doesn't change the fact that it's pretty flawed and generally a mess of a movie."

","This King Kong story has the big guy never leaving Skull Island. But with Brie Larson along the big guy still has an eye for the ladies though he never becomes obsessed like he was with Fay Wray. <br/><br/>It's the end of the Vietnam War, but John Goodman who's a Frank Buck type hunter and explorer with some Capitol Hill influence has gotten the government to underwrite an expedition to a newly discovered uncharted island. He's even gotten the cooperation of the government in this endeavor. An airborne squadron of paratroopers headed by Colonel Samuel L. Jackson are to give him support. These troops ain't real happy as their going stateside is being delayed.<br/><br/>This island has all kinds of strange monsters, prehistoric hunter/gatherers. and a big ape who watches over the people and the walled stockade they've built to prevent them from being the lunch special for the monsters. They will need all that military firepower to stay alive and as you can gather very few make it out alive.<br/><br/>One thing though, this ain't Jurassic Park where a lot of plant eating dinosaurs are around. Everybody here is a flesh eater. No wonder that vegetation is so lush and so treacherous.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island I suspect will get a nomination or two in the technical categories next year. It's your old fashioned action/adventure saga where everyone looks like they're having a good time making it. The acting sure shows it."

","I won't waste too much time on this nonsense of a film, just warn the dear reader to save their money and wait to see it for free on it's 'network premier'.<br/><br/>The story is about Americans finding something unusual - sometimes it's aliens but this time just very big animals - and doing what comes naturally to them when they find such things - try to destroy them. My family tried to decide which of our intrepid explorers would buy the farm first - we all guessed wrongly, which was the only surprise of the night.<br/><br/>A film about giant herbivores and giant carnivores on an island - sound familiar? Yes, I thought it would. The corny dialogue will sound familiar too. If you're still wondering whether or not to see this film, just remember it's a couple of hours of your life you'll never get back and life is precious.

This movie would have scared me as a child, you may say a child should not see this until a certain age but my mother took me to see Jaws when I was only 4 and we live very close to the Gulf of Mexico and warm shark water and I still do not go in water I can not see the bottom. OK, back to Kong, really not that bad, some parts were just as good as any Jurassic Park movie, if you like those movies with huge CGI monsters than this will be your cup of tea. I like the fact that they still stuck with the idea that Kong is a good guy and only bad men want to kill me. If you are still a child at heart, not a bad rent at all. 7/10"

","Warning, spoilers.<br/><br/>This movie is nowhere in the same league as the Peter Jackson/Jack Black film. Does not even come close to comparing.<br/><br/>I do like the Vietnam war era setting. But when the expedition arrives in their helicopters, they decide to let the giant ape take them all down rather than, oh, flying higher up or flying away? Hey, as long as the special effects are legit, right? And I think they made Kong look TOO big in this film. There was VERY minimal special bond between Kong and any of the characters, which is a huge aspect of the past films. No friendship was really made that led to trust and respect. And the characters died so randomly, rather than heroically, especially John Goodman's character. I thought he was a main character and he died so suddenly with no build up to it. This felt more like the 6th Final Destination movie. This movie seemed to care more about making giant monsters look cool, rather than the story line. And the ending of the film was so sudden and bizarre. Kong defeats the giant lizard thing then it really just ends and we do not see how the characters interact with Kong or go home aside from the WW2 pilot., even with the post- credits scene that hinted more crappy movies are yet to come. So aside from the action, special effects and visuals, not a good movie or story line at all!"
"niaz_islam","3","1","2","13 July 2017"," Severe Lack Awe And Fear
","One can easily name this movie 'How To Ruin A Classic' and it will make no difference. <br/><br/>The story is okay and the plot is average. But the acting and the directing was terrible. I am not saying that the cast was not good, it was their performance in the movie which was a huge let down. The most lame scene was when, after few decades John C. Reilly saw people from the outside world and there was no real enthusiasm in his reaction. Not to mention the excellent condition of his outfit after so many years.<br/><br/>Now about acting. Throughout the film, seeing the amazing creatures for the first time in their life, there was no actual awe or fear in the actors' or actresses' eyes or even in their body language. It was as if every day they watch this sort of animals in the street. And even when they tried to interact with these animals, their behavior was unrealistic as if they are staring at a wall. They should have practice acting using green screen before the actual shooting. Only then they could have given a better performance than this, which frankly looked like they were interacting with wall without any real emotion. They should watch and learn from the film Okja to learn how to act with a imaginary animal. If a little child could perform so nicely then it should be easier for them.<br/><br/>Director also have to take the blame for their performance because he failed to bring out the realistic performance out from them because he didn't provide them the necessary motivation, persuasion or even the feeling of real life environment of the scenes in the set. <br/><br/>The movie has great CGI though. So if you like those kind of effects then you might even enjoy the film. But performance-wise there is nothing to see really.<br/><br/>Not Recommended."

","It appears that the majority of those who reviewed this movie have the same opinion as I do.<br/><br/>This is the worse King Kong remake I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Not because of the acting but because of the pretty dismal direction, script and special effects. My criticism of the special effects is that with the SFX technology available today they could have been much, much better.<br/><br/>Also the stupid things that did, or didn't occur were laughable.<br/><br/>For example: When the ship carrying everyone to Skull Island was seen on an overhead shot there were 3 helicopters on the deck but when the flight launched to penetrate the weather front surrounding the island there were about 2 dozen choppers.<br/><br/>The ship could never have carried that many helicopters because it was simply too small to carry that many and even if there was room how could they have gotten the others on deck in order to launch them because there was no lift to bring the aircraft onto the deck? Another gaff was when a number of 'toxic' gas canisters exploded and the gas was spread over a wide area and enveloped those still alive. Only one put his gas mask on but all the others just carried on without the slightest problem, not even a small cough.<br/><br/>It is such a pity that this movie was let down by such poor direction and continuity because it had the makings of a great remake."
"peterp-450-298716","7","1","2","28 June 2017"," This is a clash of a lot of titans.
","""I call them skull crawlers. Why? Cause it sounds unique.""<br/><br/>Is there really nobody else wondering why the actresses in a King Kong movie are so attracted to this giant ape? Honestly, I'm always asking myself the same question. Is it because Kong ""King of all places he appears in"" is such an impressive appearance, radiating power and protection? Or is it its primitive nature? No idea! But that monkey has good taste in my opinion. In every movie he's looking full of desire at the lady in distress who crossed his path yet again. Now, these are always women who'll drive that primitive monkey bananas (how appropriate). Also in this new Kong movie, the lady who's being helped by the dreaded monkey, looks breathtaking and appetizing.<br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" contains a number of successful facets I was quite enthusiastic about. Personally I thought that the soundtrack was superb. The action scenes are really masterful at times. And Brie ""The Gambler"" Larson walking around the whole movie in an undershirt, was a brilliant idea. Onslow in ""Keeping up appearances"" also wears it all the time, but isn't really a treat for the eyes. But looking at Brie Larson wearing such a piece of nothing, makes you forget there's also a giant monkey on the island. The rest isn't so impressive though. The story is quite superficial and simple. It merely serves as a steppingstone for an actionable monster story full of breathtaking graphic violence. Some ridiculous situations are of a laughable level and some scenes look as if they were copied from ""Apocalypse now"" (A kind of homage apparently). Even on the helicopters you'll see an identical sound system that spews deafening music from the 1970's, as in the mentioned milestone.<br/><br/>Who cares? I don't. There's only one thing I expect when watching a new King Kong movie. An impressive and frightening creature. Certainly the moment he produces that famous primal roar. And to be honest, this is the first time I was wondering if it wasn't a real primate. Because it looks so lifelike. If they had made an intellectually story full of meaningful dialogues and scientific gibberish, it probably wouldn't be good either. Just compare the last ""Godzilla"" movie and this one. How many percent of screen time did Kong have in this picture compared to that other monster? In my view, it's remarkably more. You don't have to wait long for his appearance. After the entertaining second world war scene, with two rivals ending up on this cursed island (apparently there was no apocalyptic storm there at that time), you'll soon see those penetrating eyes of the giant monkey.<br/><br/>It's the sophisticated special effects that will cause you to quickly forget about the imperfections in the story. For example, the first confrontation between Kong and the impending battalion of combat helicopters was portrayed phenomenally. But on the other hand it was so obnoxiously stupid. They are witnessing how a giant monkey destroys one helicopter after the other. Smashing every single aircraft into millions of pieces. And yet, there's no pilot who concludes that it might be better to send his heli into another direction. Away from the furious monster. Too much psychedelic music and hallucinogens during their tour in Vietnam might have something to do with it. When Brie Larson wants to lift a crashed heli just by herself so she could free a giant water buffalo, like a real animal activist, I almost choked in my popcorn.<br/><br/>You can call most of the human characters caricatural. But in a way, they fit perfectly in this movie. Especially Samuel L. Jackson who crosses the island looking for retaliation and who's determined to kill Kong. The psychotic tirades of him with hollow expressions such as ""This is one war, we're not gonna loose"", sometimes seem pretty lame. But actually I enjoyed these silly rants. The same goes for John Goodman's character. A so-called scientist who has set up this expedition for other reasons than he initially explained. And then there's the Robinson Crusoe on duty, John C. Reilly, who has been on this island for years now and sees a possibility to escape from this hellhole (most funny personage). Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are actually the most normal characters. One of them rolling with his muscles as a professional tracker. The other displaying some other muscles as an anti-war photographer.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is not that important eventually. They only serve as props and are being used as bait to the colorful collection of giant monsters. So expect a series of flying, sliced and crushed victims. But despite the thin story and the fact that human fellow actors only serve as decorative pieces, this monster film is a true spectacle. As a monster movie lover, you must admit that the battle between Kong and the giant octopus is nevertheless outstanding and fantastic enough to give you the heebie-jeebies. The teaser in the end predicts a sequel (Well,money still makes the world go round). It isn't something I'm looking forward to. But the terrifying confrontation between those two opponents, Kong and Godzilla, could use a reboot. Apparently we have to wait for that until 2020. Bring it on, for all I care.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc"

During the silly battle, the backdrop seems to switch from Dusk/Sunset to perfectly clear daylight, this happens a number of times by the way.<br/><br/>The clichés start drooping out like diarrhea with Samual L Jackson at the forefront of crappy acting (seems like he's just putting his hand up for any script thrown at him). Anyway, Mr Jackson is hell-bent at killing this massive monster because ""it killed his men"" so he stubbornly goes against the team's pleas to stop despite the threats of even more dangerous creatures around.<br/><br/>I won't go in anymore detail, but the goofiest scene was when the Photographer girl tries to lift a downed chopper (you read that right) to help a dying buffalo/bison. The fact that she tried to move a Chopper with her bare hands was mind-numbing, however, she also didn't notice the 100ft ape approach to help or feel the ground shake but was surprised in awe when the chopper began to rise and realised Kong is helping. <br/><br/>Finally, there was a token Chinese girl in the movie who's supposed to be a biologist, she was as useful as a tree in the background, said nothing/did nothing, must have been a requirement for the funding."

","Jordan Vogt-Robert's version of Kong is a film where style towers over screenplay and characters. Previously reported to be helmed by Neil Marshall, it took nearly 11-12 years to reboot the franchise, and this film will be regarded as the second entry in Legendary's Monster- verse and is expected to converge with the Godzilla series in the near future, following the pathway of the MCU & DCEU and Universal's Darkverse.<br/><br/>While Kong: Skull Island is not a bad film by a long shot, one is left to wonder why reboots/remakes still seem to be the primary agenda of Hollywood when there are plenty of original stories to be told. Leaving that question aside, how does Kong fare as a standalone flick? It's an engrossing ride for sure, with a couple of interesting characters thrown in, such as John C Reilly's Lt. Hank Marlow who has been living in an unmapped island for close to three decades, and Samuel Jackson's Col. Packard who wants to get revenge on Kong for taking down his men, and doesn't flinch a facial muscle when he comes face-to-face with the behemoth ape. The lead pair of Hiddleston-Larson don't really come across as astounding. While the initial hour lays out plenty of casualties and takes on a rather formidable outlook, the comic relief is brought about through the introduction of Reilly's character. Performances are pretty even, but none of the characters really stood out (hardly a memorable moment for any of them!).<br/><br/>The film is mind-blowingly dazzling to look at..by all means a visual treat. Cinematographer Larry Fong (of 300, BvS and Now You See Me) captures the locales quite remarkably. The color tones applied are appropriate and lend a distinctive facade to each frame. The VFX is close to flawless, and Kong's battles with the other monstrous entities of the island are choreographed phenomenally well(although the practicality of it remains questionable!). This film's fairly low emphasis on its human characters (and the effects of their invasive deeds) almost gives the viewer a notion that it needs to be treated as nothing beyond a popcorn summer blockbuster..the expectation it does fulfill, while there's not much to ponder over when you witness the quintessential 'happy-ending'. Hint: Kong saves the woman (who inadvertently saves Kong) yet again!<br/><br/>Post-credits ensure the crossover with Godzilla and co. in the next few years. While that's not something I'm highly looking forward to seeing, it would indeed spark a fair bit of interest as time progresses, given the kind of writing/directing/acting talent on board for all the upcoming films."

"lesleyharris30","8","1","2","17 April 2017"," Stellar Character Development, Average Kong,
","Kong: Skull Island is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a top notch cast. The best part about this film for me is without a doubt the characters. They are all very well developed and the relationships between them are established brilliantly, all meeting each other for the first time at the beginning, and we get to see it grow as the plot progresses, with everyone having to rely on each other. These characters intrigued me far more than any movie monster would. <br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the poorest part of this film for me was actually King Kong himself. While he is beautifully rendered through CGI, he held the plot back. The characters could have been putting in to a much dire, exciting situations if a giant gorilla did not have to be there main threat, when there are easily scarier monsters out there in this universe. I honestly think it would have been a lot better if it was not a King Kong movie. <br/><br/>The performances are stellar, each cast member having great chemistry with one another and bringing this world to life. Tom Hiddleston brings great charisma to his part, Brie Larson is charming, John Goodman is mysterious and Samuel L. Jackson is as intimidating as ever. However, the highlight for me was John C. Reilly, he is both the funniest and the most layered character, bring great depth to Hank Marlow, and his scene at the end is very heartwarming. <br/><br/>It has very engaging characters, which for me, is why its worth watching. Well acted and development, Kong: Skull Island is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good adventure film. <br/><br/>A group of scientists and soldiers are sent on a journey to Skull Island, an uncharted island that may hide some never before seen creatures.<br/><br/>Best Performance: John C. Reilly"
"djangozelf-12351","7","1","2","8 April 2017"," Kong:Skull island,clear title delivers what it promises.
","I found Kong to be great in this movie and Skull Island was an interesting and beautiful place where Kong is king and they don't shy away of showing him in full glory and very early on in the film. The first action scene with Kong kind of surprised me because of the intensity of some shock effects (and this is rated 12 and up) of people falling and body's smashing into helicopter blades. All the action with Kong felt exciting and really added to the layers his character goes thru in this movie from presumed bad guy to a godlike savior for the islands inhabitants against even greater foe's that lurk on the island.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot about the actors and the lack of depth in there character in this movie but I never felt annoyed by their performance and took it more as characters on a comic book level so maybe a little exaggerated. Also the movie feels like it is playing with comic book rules in terms of people dying and even more so people surviving the impossible.<br/><br/>Now for the real kicker as much as I like this movie I really got a problem with where this is going. I did not like Godzilla,he was portrayed weak in that movie especially anything action related that I don't see how they gonna rime that version with what we got now with Kong Skull Island.<br/><br/>Also the end credit scene was one of the cheesiest ever and makes me fear the worst with where they're going with this franchise. If they don't connect the dots well I might choose to not go see the next one. This popcorn Kong movie would have been better as a standalone and not trying so hard to build a franchise on a somewhat shaky premise that could land either way.<br/><br/>This was set up as an action/adventure movie and I found it entertaining as such, it has some realistic and comedic notes that feel odd in the movie and that somewhat diminished the entertainment value but not in any way to tip the scale negatively.<br/><br/>Also a movie I can see more than once and I recommend you at least go see it once if your into creature features or monster movies.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","""Kong; Skull Island"" was a very entertaining popcorn movie; it kept my interest throughout, and never really slowed down much. I thought it was a good idea to place it in the time frame of the 1970's. Kong the ape was front and center and King Kong really was a king this time. The story was a good one--in another movie John C. Reilly's Robinson Curuso-type character would have stolen the show. But in this one each of the actors share screen time almost equally. The sound track features snippets of some of the best rock music ever recorded, and I liked the references to ""Heart of Darkness"" and the influences of Francis Ford Coppolla's ""Apocalypse Now""."
"mikemcmillan2002","7","1","2","12 March 2017"," Great entertainment, not a love story.
","This was a good movie and totally re-watchable. Think ""Kong meets Jurassic Park"". One of the endearing qualities of the old King Kong movies is in the relationship that develops between Kong and the damsel. This is touched on but not explored enough in this version. Same goes for most of the characters. There are some really great sub plots that could be developed for Goodman, Jackson, and Hiddleston but the story never quite goes far enough there. Action and graphics for there own sake just don't do it for me. John C Reilly played an awesome part and had me chuckling throughout."

"LloydBayer","7","2","7","10 March 2017"," Skull Island isn't impressively intelligent but it is overwhelmingly gorgeous and a kickass spectacle worthy of the big screen.
","Right from its opening scene - a cheesy montage that would come into play during the second half of the film - Kong: Skull Island is a reiteration that size matters at the movies. If BIG is what you want, then that's exactly what you get – big budget, big effects and an ape, much, much bigger than his cinematic forefathers from the 1933 classic to the 2005 epic from Peter Jackson. But unlike Jackson's bitter-sweet romanticization of beauty and the beast (which has always been at the heart of a King Kong film) Skull Island is neither a prequel nor a sequel in Kong's storyline. It isn't entirely a reboot either because none of the characters from the previous films are brought back in this film. Instead, this version feels like a pilot episode in its own cinematic universe. <br/><br/>Set in 1973 and just after US forces have all but accepted defeat in Vietnam, we follow a group of explorers and American GIs who set out to geo-map the titular but unchartered island. Their grand entrance into the storm shrouded island is the first of a series of kickass spectacles and essentially why you would want to watch this film on the biggest screen possible. It's also the new Kong's awesome introduction in all his colossal gloryand fury. After their Hueys are extended the same welcome as annoying mosquitoes, the group is divided into two teams in an increasingly hostile environment. One team is led by John Goodman's government agent posing as a scientist along with Samuel L. Jackson in a cakewalk role as a vengeful Vietnam veteran. Led by Tom Hiddleston as a tracker and Brie Larson as a war photographer (who serves no real purpose except the tradition that Kong has a thing for blondes), the second team makes an interesting discovery – a stranded WWII pilot (John C. Reilly) is just as eager to leave the island as they are.<br/><br/>What sets this film apart from previous Kong lore is the instantly noticeable visual splendour, an aesthetic that seems like a very obvious love letter to Apocalypse Now (1979) but mixed with the cheese and chowder of a Jurassic Park adventure. This in turn wreaks havoc on the tone of the film, resulting in constant shifts between bombastic action, dead-eye terror, pop culture, political and ecological allegories, and whimsy humour including show stealing levity from Reilly. Add to that a stellar cast stuck with stereotypical roles in a telegraphed screenplay and you get an old school monster movie mash with teeth bigger than its bite. But then, who are we kidding? Anyone paying to watch this film will expect their money's worth of copious eye candy and that's precisely what Skull Island promises in return.<br/><br/>Despite being a novice behind the lens, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts can be credited with the creation of a tentpole film that is overwhelmingly gorgeous even if it isn't impressively intelligent. Spectacular action, photorealistic CGI, surreal cinematography, and era specific soundtrack will keep you entertained but it's the deliberate tease at the end that will leave you wanting more. If not New York, maybe Japan? Come 2020, we'll know for sure."
"hotohori_z","7","2","7","10 March 2017"," Kong is fun but don't expect too much!
","Going into this film I had low expectations. But I was pleasantly surprised coming out of the theater that this movie kept my attention for as long as it did.<br/><br/>The cast of this film: Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman and John C. Reilly all do adequate jobs here. I describe it as adequate because no one's performance was mind-blowing or terrible they just did the job and went about the movie. Does this make you hate the characters? Not really but Sam L. was channeling Captain Ahab from Moby Dick thru parts of this movie.But does it make you care about them? Not really either.<br/><br/>Overall the plot is really nothing special, SURVIVE is basically it. The action thru the parts of the film are exciting to watch but it does suffer from some slower moments which seemed like they wanted to build up tension but never really surfaced. Deaths came off a bit jump-scary but nothing too crazy bad but you can tell by the end they are setting up and world building to something bigger. Fun for the for the older kids with a bit of scares here and there. 7/10 -- Definitely could watch while doing house work in the background."

I would agree with most of the fellow reviewers that movie is purely colored action entertainment and expecting else might be not cool.<br/><br/>I watched the Hindi dubbed version and found the following things. I liked Tom hiddleston in positive role. Brie Larson was definitely not a good pick (beauty) for our beast if that was our case. I most liked John C. Reilly with his broken language.<br/><br/>There is some part of movie still coming out, after the end credits and in my opinion that should have been included before end credits. That ending however raises only below average expectations for the sequels.<br/><br/>Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The storm, flora and fauna, the green atmosphere, the petroleum absorbed surfaces, aurora borealis, the native people and their appearance, all were fantastic. The negative entities were all carved in ugly appearance, giving one the horror feel required.<br/><br/>Tone: Tone was the action between the positives and the negatives and it was carved well.

","In 1944, during World War II, two fighter pilots—an American named Hank Marlow and a Japanese named Gunpei Ikari—parachute onto an island in the South Pacific after a dogfight. They both engage in close combat, with Ikari gaining the upper hand. A large behemoth creature suddenly interrupts the fight, causing both soldiers to stare in shock and flee.<br/><br/>29 years later, in 1973, former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad, a skilled tracker is hired by U.S. government agent Bill Randa to guide an expedition to map out an island known as ""Skull Island"". Randa also recruits the Sky Devils, a Vietnam War veteran helicopter squadron led by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard and prominently made up of his right-hand, Major Jack Chapman and Captain Earl Cole to escort them to the island. The group is soon joined by pacifist photojournalist Mason Weaver, who plans to expose it, believing it's a secret military operation with dark purposes.<br/><br/>Arriving on Skull Island, Packard's men begin dropping explosives developed by seismologist Houston Brooks to determine if the ground is hollow, despite Conrad's objections. The helicopters are suddenly attacked by a 100 foot-tall bipedal ape known as Kong, and many are destroyed, with the survivors split into two groups. The survivors' only hope for rescue is a resupply team that will meet them at the island's northern end in three days time. Randa reveals his affiliation to the secret government organization Monarch to Packard and the expedition's real purpose: to acquire proof of the existence of forgotten monsters, fearing that they may soon return to take back the world from humanity. Randa also explains that he himself once served on a U.S. Navy ship that was destroyed by one of those monsters.<br/><br/>Packard and his remaining men bury their dead comrades and begin searching for the missing members of the expedition, including Chapman. On the way they encounter a giant spider-like creature, known as ""Mother Long-legs"", that kills one man and nearly eats another before they manage to slay it. Meanwhile, Conrad, Weaver, Brooks, biologist San Lin, soldier Reg Slivko and Landsat employee Victor Nieves, among others, encounter the local Iwi natives and meet Hank Marlow, the American pilot who crashed on the island all those years ago. Marlow reveals that Kong is the island's guardian and is worshipped as a god by the natives for protecting them from Skullcrawlers, reptilian underground monsters who have slaughtered Kong's ancestors, leaving him as the last of his kind. He also mentions that a Skullcrawler killed the Japanese pilot he landed on the island with and became friends with. Marlow reveals Kong only attacked the helicopters to prevent the bombs from awakening the ""Big One"", thus protecting the locals from it. Miles away from them, Chapman witnesses Kong wrestle and defeat a large octopus, causing him to flee into the woods, where he encounters a giant stick insect. Soon afterwards, he is eaten by a Skullcrawler.<br/><br/>Weaver encounters a giant sker buffalo, trapped under a fallen helicopter. She tries to rescue it until Kong comes and saves the creature, before leaving Weaver, who is awed by his compassion."

","[8/10] - ""Exceeded expectations""<br/><br/>Kong was surprisingly good. Not amazing, not something I think everyone should watch at least once (or I'd have given it 9 stars), it doesn't speak to me in an extremely personal way (or I'd have given it 10), but it is very good. I would recommend it for any monster movie fan and any fan of Vietnam War movies.<br/><br/>It wasn't really doing the standard King Kong story. Much of the ""Kong protecting a blonde lady from dinosaurs"" plot is left out completely, though smaller story elements remain. The new elements they added to replace the old story cast the original story elements which remain in a fruitful new light. It ultimately isn't much like the 30s film or Peter Jackson's remake at all. Instead, it was more like the 70s monster movie stylistically. However, in terms of its themes, it is a clear student of *Apocalypse Now*. In all seriousness, you will definitely enjoy this movie more if *Apocalypse Now* is in your recent memory.<br/><br/>The movie takes place immediately after the retreat from Vietnam. As such, the moral status of that war linger in the subtext throughout the movie. As a direct result, this movie's interpretation of the Skull Island natives is much more charitable than any other version. They are thoroughly sympathetic characters rather than the almost farcically mindless ""savages"" from Jackson's version. The filmmakers also don't project a fetish for whiteness onto them like the 30s version does.<br/><br/>Vietnam figures into the film in a second, more important, way. In the wake of our defeat (by a less ""civilized"" enemy), the American military's masculinity has been wounded and humiliated. Their attempt to destroy Kong in order to prove to themselves that their ""civilization"" is still powerful is the film's heart. I was worried, from the trailers, that the movie would just be a hyper-masculine contest between ""Man"" and ""Kong,"" but it instead completely re-frames this in a more self-aware and critical light.<br/><br/>In the 30s, when industry and civilization seem to have conquered nature, it was appropriate for King Kong to be a story of the tragic defeat of natural force at the hand of machines. But after Vietnam, it is appropriate for the story to have significantly more doubt about our own control over the world. This movie turns this doubt into a legitimately compelling anti-colonial allegory."

","Kong: Skull Island is a big let-down as far as I'm concerned. I don't care that this isn't the classic King Kong narrative we're used to-the entire point of a remake is, after all, to build off of or change the original in some way.<br/><br/>What I do care about is that this is a monster movie that fails in a number of regards. The biggest problem is that this movie doesn't know if it wants to be a weird kaiju-centric remake of Moby Dick, an environmentalist film or a cheeseball monster movie. So Jordan Vordt-Roberts said ""**** it, let's do all of them"". The result has all of the tonal whiplash you'd expect, plus the complete inability to do any of those ideas justice. I didn't even mention the utterly godawful script and bizarre shifts in style.<br/><br/>The '5' then is for at least delivering some cool monster-fighting, CGI and general braindead entertainment. In fact the only improvement over 2014's Godzilla (the first MonsterVerse film) is that this one is better at showing off the main character. Kong has immediate presence where Godzilla was hidden by darkness, dust, more darkness and that movie's editor. Godzilla, on the other hand, knew what it wanted to be, and did that fairly well.

","SKULL ISLAND isn't a terrible movie. It's just lame.<br/><br/>This depiction of another adventure for King Kong, involving modern day military and civilians, along with a WWII castaway, has many problems, but it boils down to two main ones that affect any possible enjoyment of this action adventure.<br/><br/>First, there is not one piece of credible motivation other than some running from monsters. Not one character is believable, particularly the one played by Samuel Jackson. For the actors, this has to be a huge embarrassment.<br/><br/>Fans will claim it's meant to be just dumb fun, but it isn't ""fun"" when it alienates the viewer the way this movie does. The ""likable"" character has to be from Chicago, which is just another of the three big cities (the other two being NYC and LA) that alienate everyone else. There has never been a likable character from the three cities of self righteous superiority complex beings, and only the geeks keep them in power.<br/><br/>Aside from a few bits of running and fear, nothing is credible. And so there is nothing any person can relate to.<br/><br/>Which leads to the second problem. The movie abounds with the usual ho hum overuse of action shots that just deaden the air. The people who make this ignorance and the people who enjoy it are apparently the people who try to eat an entire wedding cake in one bite. Aside from those people, this movie alienates everyone else.<br/><br/>The problem is obviously that it is maintained first by ""storyboard"" first, with story second. This failure is the result of that philosophy. There is no inspiration, which leads to no credible character motivation. <br/><br/>Best example is the ""storyboard"" depiction of Sam Jackson glaring at carnage. It looks more like a comic book artist at work, not an inspired writer. People whose hands can make pictures don't necessarily have inspiration, as we see here.

","The fact that many people rated this film more than 1 star baffles me. Actually, no, it worries me.<br/><br/>This film has it all: a never-ending list of plot holes, a lineup of dialogues so awful it makes your brain scream with despair, 2D characters so poorly conceived no one cares what happens to them and unoriginal monsters so badly imagined that the island seems to be populated by rejects from Peter Jackson's King Kong. Furthermore, it is overloaded with useless clichés and the CGI is at times terrible. <br/><br/>It is not fun, not cool and not smart. In short, it is an insult to the average person's intelligence.<br/><br/>Some examples of blatant inconsistencies : 1. In the beginning, we learn that Landsat satellites have imaged the island from above and we even see these images. Yet none of the massive man-made structures are spotted by the imaging specialists - no massive wall seen, no villages spotted, no agricultural areas detected, no giant huts revealed, etc... Makes you wonder why did they bother taking pictures if they're not going to actually examine them in detail. <br/><br/>2. Five or six helicopters are seen taking off from a big shipping vessel (some in unrealistic locations such as the back of the bridge), yet when they arrive at the island, there have multiplied and we now have almost ten helicopters. Does the director believe that we can't even count anymore?<br/><br/>3. Let's fly ALL the helicopters in tight formation through the mother of all storms shaking them in all manners (with no one getting wet/sick/hurt) while the captain of the shipping vessel (inherently more stable than a helicopter) refuses point blank to get close to the storm for safety reasons. <br/><br/>4. Let's land on one end of the unexplored island and decide that the pickup point is located at the other end of the island in three days time. This makes no rational sense whatsoever. <br/><br/>5. The 'science' team lands and sets up instruments to track the seismic activity. Instead of looking around amazed at the unexplored and virgin ecosystem, the female biologist decides to watch the screens showing the seismic activity, which the geologist is already actively monitoring. No wild plants to investigate? No animals to observe through binoculars? No no.... let's just waste precious time (3 days remember) to duplicate work that is irrelevant to her own field of work. <br/><br/>6. As the helicopters fly inside the island dropping bombs, a giant ape, Kong, arrives on the scene and destroys some of them that pass close to it. Instead of breaking formation and regrouping at a location that doesn't include the hostile primate, the helicopters decide to continuously fly at arm's length of Kong which leads of course to their inevitable destruction. <br/><br/>7. The ecology on this island is unrealistic: A giant spider with legs that look like bamboo and impales people? Really? A giant squid that hunts in shallow waters making it easily detected by apex predators like Kong (Btw, why didn't Kong see the squid before sitting in the water since it was so shallow?). The huge buffalo/deer thing should be in a herd like the behavior of most unprotected herbivore species. Yet every time we see one, it is alone. <br/><br/>8. Next to the giant wooden wall (how did the locals build this thing?), the woman photographer sees one of those buffalo/deer things trapped under a crashed helicopter. Does she check if someone in the helicopter is still alive and needs medical attention? No. The buffalo/deer thing is far more important. Are bodies of the poor passengers lying around? No. Then surely the locals must have picked them up. Doesn't seem like it. Where are they? No one cares. Does she check if there are any signs of danger after hearing about what awful monsters lurk on the island (which could be the reason why no human bodies are present)? No. Does she ask the locals to help out? No. They were there just a moment ago as she was teaching them how to pose (!) while she took pictures. And now she is all alone. Where have they all gone? Oh well. She doesn't seem to care so why should we... Does she try alone to push the helicopter trapping the buffalo/deer thing which wasn't strong enough to move it by himself (and is obviously many time more massive than her)? Yes. Unsurprisingly she fails. Does she try again? Absolutely. Does she hear/feel the vibrations of Kong's steps stopping a few meters away from her? No. Kong appearing out of nowhere takes the broken helicopter and frees the trapped animal. He looks at the woman then throws away the helicopter (no need to feel sorry for any wounded passengers still trapped inside) and walks away like a hero in the sunset (a celestial event which by the way appears to occur many times during the day on this island). <br/><br/>And it goes on and on and on... One ridiculous scene after another. I could also give examples of the poor dialogues and awful characters but I have a life. Why would a grown adult want to subject himself/herself to such rubbish is beyond me. <br/><br/>Save yourself some neurons and avoid this film at all costs."

","Details make a film good, so here's a small list: 1. The geological landscape is more central China limestone than south Pacific island volcanism. 2. The animal species do not fit the landscape, but rather everywhere else on Earth - all at one time. 3. The biggest animals on Earth are buoyed by water for a reason - there's a gravity defined limit to weight and supportive structures. Kong at 1/10 his size would have exceeded it. 4. Helis approaching within arm's reach of Kong - dumb. No reason for the gunfire initially, but makes good action film. Why do fairly large caliber weapons used throughout have surprisingly little effect? 5. Where did the natives get the machinery to make their finely woven, consistently dyed cloth? And their steel bladed weapons? 6. Military portrayal was way over the top not real, especially the belligerent Colonel. Came across as more humorous than villainous. Very fakey insubordination scenes. 7. Why do male leads in action movies almost always have the tight, ultra-short sleeve t-shirt muscle look - feelings of compensatory inadequacy, narcissism? Obvious they are about as athletic as a wet noodle, anyway. 8. OK, Kong's parents dead, but where are the thousands more needed to genetically maintain this kind? Would like to know who Kong's dentist is with such perfect white teeth. 9. Just as Kong would be gravity squished on Earth so in a similar way those critters (usual many sharpy teeth, and doesn't make sense two limbs) coming from deep inside Earth would have been baked by the rapidly increasing temps as you go down, even just part of a mile."

","I can't believe that I actually gave this movie dumpster fire a 4 star rating! First off, Samuel Jackson's angry black man character is really getting old. All he does is yell and threaten others in this movie, kind of like he does in all of his other movie roles. The no name supporting actors acting abilities are a joke, and outside of having real life people in this awful movie, the whole thing is CGI. This movie is geared towards teenagers, glad I didn't waste my time and money to see it in the theatre. I was actually glad when it ended. Hollywood has tanked. I can't remember the last movie that Hollywood made that I liked. Even the recent Star Wars movies have been let downs, Kong is a bust."

","In 1933 a classic was born. Using now archaic equipment and techniques, over the top 1930's acting and a particularly humanoid stop-motion ""giant"" gorilla Radio Pictures brought us a ground breaking movie that inspired monster movies for years to come.<br/><br/>I love King Kong.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2005 (let's forget the mostly terrible off-shoots and 1976 remake) and enter Peter Jackson who did with King Kong what he seems to do best...take an old well loved tale, re-tell it with bang up to date special effects and then stretch it to it's enth degree. Despite the 2005 remake being far too long, I still loved King Kong<br/><br/>Then this.......I dunno even what insult to throw at it.<br/><br/>In the previous films you cared about the characters, like 'em or loathe 'em you cared, you had emotions about them and you wanted Kong to survive, even though you knew that the combination of Carl Denholm's greed and Ann Darrow's beauty would be his undoing, long before the planes got to him.<br/><br/>Did I care about any of the characters in Kong :Skull Island? Well, I kinda hoped Hank Marlow (John C Reilly) got home and he was the most charismatic character in there, but then...he was a bit nuts. I kinda wanted Col. Packard (Sam L Jackson) to get squished and I did kinda hope Kong got through it without dying but....I really couldn't have cared less if none of those things happened. Tom Hiddleston was verrry British as ex-SAS man, James Conrad and...there were some other people too but...well...who cares?<br/><br/>The CGI isn't what it could be, the story bears all the hallmarks of having been written by a ten year old and good actors give performances that are memorable only for how unconvincing they are (not that it's necessarily their fault, one cannot make a silk purse from a sow's ear). The whole movie is merely a vehicle to set-up ""King Kong vs Godzilla"" which, given the mediocrity of both this and the Godzilla movie, I can only imagine how dreadful that will be.<br/><br/>The kids might like it, but if they're over the age of 12 and have any intelligence, I doubt it.

","In the last couple of years, action (and/or fantasy) movies have become longer and longer. Don't understand why, probably to display the great special effect studios can produce these days. However, this generally doesn't help the story. And this movie is a high action, low story one. All cliché characters are there, explorers/scientists blind to all danger, the war-veteran waiting to get his revenge at all costs and mostly red- shirt cannon-fodder. The effects are great for sure, but hide the thin story-line. It's classic King Kong with a twist. People find monkey. Monkey kills people but likes tiny girl. (Why?) People try to kill monkey. Monkey tries to kill lizards. Lizards try to kill everyone. Monkey turns out to be the good guy. (Monkey should be ape technically.) Few survive. In end credits it is revealed there will be more p.o.s. movies coming in the next years. Can't wait ~cough~.<br/><br/>At some point halfway through the movie I just wished everybody would die so it would be over. It didn't bother me anymore if the ""bad lizards"" won or the ""good guys"" + monkey. It kept dragging along without end. Not recommended."

On islands the wildlife is small. Birds, fish, mammals... everything is smaller on an island, i guess you could argue it's a big island, only they hike over the entire island in a couple of days by foot.<br/><br/>Lots of characters, all of them tired stereotypes, but not in a fun caricature way, non are developed enough for me to care about anything that's going on.<br/><br/>The photography is really weird, at one point a gun gets POV, to no effect or reason.<br/><br/>Supposedly the main draw is to see some cool monsters, and there is a couple of cool ones.<br/><br/>So many questions: Why does the helicopters keep flying towards the deadly monster?

I won't spoil anything, but you get to see a massive gorilla beat the pants off of a wide range of well-animated monsters and machines, in a very skillfully choreographed way.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were excellent. Very visceral, very well-shot and animated, and felt overall very satisfying and impressive. There were segments without any monsters that felt like a bit of a step down, but they didn't last especially long.<br/><br/>I understand the characters were flat enough to fit under a door (maybe with the exception of John C. Reilly), and the environmental message was present (and really, it wasn't as in-your-face as most people make out), but in the end, I feel that good acting or a subtle message weren't this movie's intentions. It's action. And it does that very well.<br/><br/>So, if you want to see a great action movie, go see Kong: Skull Island."
"austin0731","4","1","3","9 May 2017"," rather disappointing
","Kong: Skull Island has nothing beneath the surface that a genre film should have, other than the action and large scale scenes there was basically 0 character development and as a huge fan of the Peter Jackson rendition of King Kong I have to say I am disappointed in the outcomes of this film. <br/><br/>Skull Island promised to up the ante and go 'big' with this new and scaled up Kong but the results really isn't that good at all. There was perhaps only 2 scenes in which we get big fights of Kong, which were really good yet as I said 2 only, most of the time the film just attempts to build suspense by not revealing where Kong is 'hiding' which really doesn't make much sense because he is a gigantic gorilla on this one tiny island. <br/><br/>Although most the acting is uninspiring and the characters were generic and predictable, Samuel L Jackson was probably the saving grace of this film playing a relatively interesting and unique character unlike the rest, likes of Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston, a rather shame by the sound of these names. <br/><br/>This film felt lacking both in character development and in fun, large scale monster battles and seems rather like a build up solely for the purpose of pitting Kong against Godzilla in the upcoming feature film. Not much attention was given to this film but for what it's worth this film was simply mediocre and just fine."

It lacks depth and we cannot feel any connect with the characters. They just come and go. There is the over enthusiastic scientist with an Asian woman lover. The lead actress, a pointless photographer who holds camera just to remind us about her character. The lead actor who tries to do something with all his might and the ruffian Military man played by Samuel Jackson, absolute non-sense.<br/><br/>I felt confused on what the story is about. Is it about identifying a non existing species ? Then who the hell gave authority to kill it ? Or who gave the authority for a raid ? No brains in the writing. Oh yes, we need some thrill right. There comes puking series of brutal murders. Men got chewed up, puked up, trashed up and God! What else ? We got to see all those terrible stuffs for the mistake we did Kong disappoints."

Hmmm?<br/><br/>Skull Island is supposed to be a dangerous place, but 90% of the deaths in this movie were based on asinine decisions. When 14 military helicopters engage Kong, instead of acting like Kamikaze pilots, why didn't they retreat to a better tactical position? I can see a few getting destroyed... but ALL of them? Makes no sense. <br/><br/>Later... after Hank Marlow, a WWII fighter pilot stranded on the island for over 20 years (played by John C. Reilly -- who does provide comedic relief), warns everyone NOT to enter the skull creature graveyard, they ALL do anyway. And guess what? Surprise surprise!

"westley34","2","1","3","24 April 2017"," Terrible
","This was a terrible movie with great special effects and good actors. The non feasibility of the action completely ruins it for any thinking person. There are like a dozen or more helicopters and every one of the pilots does not understand the simple concept of flying up out of the reach of a giant gorilla and going the other way. On the contrary, many of them fly right towards it. Not 5 minutes pass and something else implausible happens (like a spider sticking its leg through a man's mouth and impaling him. Then they try to tell us that a tribe of humans have been living in such a hostile environment for more than 28 years? That is just too implausible. Also when Kong was fighting the squid a piece of the squid flies off towards the camera and travels about 1000 feet in one second. That is nearly the speed of sound. Kong has a cut on his arm, but this is a creature that swats helicopters out of the air without getting cuts on his hands. Samuel Jackson says ""these men did not die in vain"", but they all clearly did. What an incredibly bad movie that could have been good considering the budget and the great cast. This is one of the biggest wastes ever. I am not willing to suspend disbelief as much as this garbage is asking us to."

"ycho-29371","5","1","3","19 April 2017"," Kong: Skull Island is a big pile of mess.....
","Finally, a new rehash of the classical 1933's 'King Kong' has been remade with Hollywood without even matching up to it's original, however, the 2005's 'King Kong' has been the most impressive and adequate of what it succeed. Kong Skull Island, directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts returns for a new project with one of the writers being a writer and director of my favorite films of 2014, Dan Gilroy. The first impression to deliver is this movie is a pile of mess that keeps on building and lowers the film. As the film begins, we are introduced to two scientists proving ancient species exist on an island, while excusing to map the geography of the island. We meet James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), a formal weapons dealer, and that is only what it has to offer. Additionally, we see Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) as for the most majority an uninteresting and unrelatable antagonist. There is no short description of their biography illustrated and flashed out that might be fascinating at least. Due to, a poorly written script and unprofessionally executed characters with no excess of heart, which just felt like attractive humans who could run in slow motion. The vast majority of the cast are just expendables bodies for large, CGI created monsters to toy with. Positive note, Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), is the best aspect that can elevate this film to a higher position with a rather interesting backstory and an excess of little heart we stood up for. We go into for a purpose, the purpose being able to see gigantic CGI monster crashing up with each other. Like as the anticipation, it does offer exhilarating eye candy visuals, consistently solid acting, a fast paced and intriguing deployment of the story, and the most important exhilarating, fascinating, and huge frenetic monsters that can satisfy some. All cast-ed monsters look promisingly amazing and flawless, adding more 'fun' and thrills for an adventure roller coaster ride. It keeps the audiences intrigued for certain monster battles and clashes processed with CGI. While it may satisfy some for just mindlessly watchable CGI monster film, but the whole affair can't escape a hugely hollow feeling after the ending credits roll. Also, it detracts from other successful films, elevating the film's originality to the bottom as it builds more disappointments. Overall, this film offers cool visuals with big CGI monsters for few moments, but the majority focuses on the human aspect which is a mess and a hollow that will keep most film buffs let down as the end credits begin."

","Hi there !<br/><br/>Just saw Kong-King the King Kang Kong - Himself; on Skull Island, also called SKong Island, SKung Island, Sking-Skang-Skung Island; or Skunk Island for short. And let me tell you, this is no skunk-er, quite a few times (just in my case) I don't agree with reviews, King Kong = Hollywood. Hollywood = King Kong. Do you see the ''elephant'' in the room, it's not an elephant - it's King Kong. I prefer protecting King Kong or Donkey Kong or whatever King or Kong that comes by - even a tiny one called Caesar (War of the Planet of the Apes); not attacking like savage bloodthirsty animal humans who want to 'put down' a 'monkey dog'... like the (dog) monkey it is... That's why I watch Hollywood movies. And you may call me a feeble-minded sheep/sheep id*ot but that wouldn't change anything; Hollywood or whatever you want to call it - these films have procured much joy over decades - something none of your complaining and critiquing/criticizing has ever done (except enlighten me on 'how you want to enlighten me'). With that said and off my chest (like King Kong beating his chest in a alpha-macho-testero way - I got that out): I will give my feelings about this film briefly in bullet points since I'm running out of space to make a real review : *Extremely High Budget *Character Depth was not deep though *Great variety of mega-huge critters *Every monster big, even the dinosaur skeletons because this Island and everything on it is Prehistoric (and Prehistoric 'dinosaur sized') *VFX are absolutely Breathtaking *Not as good as King Kong 2005 (Peter Jackson) *This King Kong is less nuanced but still nuanced enough in terms of emotions - he is far most 'beast/monster-like' than the 2005 version where there he looked Extremely nuanced and like a Real Animal (in fact in the 2005 version he looked a True Gorilla (the whole body and posture as quadruped on all 4), while now he's standing up as a biped and looks far more like Chimpanzee/Gorilla Antropomorphic Hybrid - looks like a standing hairy human with a gorilla face and looks far more like the 1930s version; his fur his face his body etc look much more the Original 1930 Version ( while the 2005 version he looked far more lie a Real MEga-Huge Gorilla). I read that in this film is Far Bigger than the 2005 version; he measures almost 300 feet tall in this film while in the 2005 version he measures about 50 or so feet tops. So, yeah, this King Kong - is Scary Big...and would make Mince Meat out Peter Jackson's version simply by being about 10 times bigger. *Samuel El Jackson the ell Jackson himself the best in this, John Goodman always good (of course, his name is Goodman), a couple of new comers (Forgot his name but he's Loki (now I remember, Tom Hiddleston)...the guide that is very popular actor right now also good too). Characters are just not deepened so whether they perish or not makes not that much difference (everyone is disposable) although the woman photographer (Brie Larson) is also great and kind of puts some characterization in this. King Kong doesn't need to be characterized - he Is a Character himself. Also there is the actor that plays the ww2 veteran that was stuck on the island since crashing on it 28 years ago (from 1973), always a fun actor. *The story rapidly : researchers find a lost island that is thought of as a hoax and that could house things unknown there; they go in with the military (1970s Apaches used in Vietnam war..BTW there is lots great 70s Rock music in the film - that was a truly nice touch) and find more than what they bargained for - they come face to face with f...ng huge Gorilla Monkey Standing Tall in front of them as they fly over the amazing islands (this was shot in Thailand or some very foreign closed-in area with the sea and mountains/huge Arphipelagos lying above the water - you know exactly like the ones you see on tourists post-cards - Picturesque, truly beautiful and breathtaking imagery). You kind of know what happens next : Kong is not pleased by these uninvited guests who shoot at him first - he bashes one helicopter after the other (like 8 of them for an early tally of 50 dead) and there's just one left : Samuel and the gang... on the island they will hunt..the mtfkr...but sadly there is hostile all around, nasty beasts like the Huge Lizards... Again the VFX are 100% quality and elevate this a lot - the camera angles are powerful and so is the sound, we hear King Kong's Roaring and Alpha-Male Chest-Beating in his Tantrums... The facial motion capture animation on the face of King Kong is breathtaking and you feel this is one Mean Monkey Gorilla who you do not want f...with. So, to finalize, loved it - it was not perfect OK and it did not the exact soul or feeling of Peter Jackson's 2005 version but Both stand as the Best ones - on their own and in their Own way - differently and that'sa great thing. Love em both. Both are entertaining and have their peculiarities; and stand Tall, like Kong himself and Own self, as their own. I give a solid and final 8/10."

It was pleasurably different than I thought. Without any spoilers, it has a different spin and the big ape is absolutely awe-inspiring. I usually don't go for CGI infested films, but since it's Kong, I expected it and it was necessary for the story and done extremely well.

The guy has less depth than a bathtub and he's supposed to make a spy movie. Unfortunate that even a bathtub is deep enough to drown beloved characters."

","I want to be very clear about this, anyone who doesn't wish to have an extremely thrilling and terrifying time, DO NOT see ""Kong: Skull Island."" He is back, well rested and ready to ensue some fresh havoc. This is not a remake, or a sequel, though it feels like it can go hand in hand with the original as far as the thrills are concerned. The cast really brings their A Game and the overall film packs a wallop with some of the best CGI that I've seen. The characters (although not the brightest bunch) play likable and generally somewhat believable roles; and Kong has never looked better! The film is loaded with thrills and chills, creeps and crawls, jump scares, and a shocking amount of gore for a PG-13 feature. I bet it was a kill away from a R-Rating, this wouldn't have flew under the PG-13 radar 30 years ago. All in all, a MUST SEE for any King Kong fan, or anyone desiring to have a truly thrilling and terrifying time! ""Kong: Skull Island"" spins a yarn that I would put against any past adaptation including the original. A+ an instant classic! <br/><br/>*Stay to the end for one last shock*"

","I prefer sequels over remakes, because sequels are a continuation of a storyline you like or love. A remake just erases everything which sometimes is an insult to fans of the original. Unless, the remake stands on its own that it's entertaining for ""old"" fans, and ""new"" fans.<br/><br/>The movie stands on its own and succeeds on various levels. First, the characters aren't as annoying as in the 2005 version. 2nd, it mixes character work and action, and doesn't offer to much of either. 3rd, the humor is not too much, and it's well timed. 4rd, it doesn't waste time with a (useless) build up, or side stories. It's a straight forward movie. And finally, more women will fall in love with Tom Hiddleston who is surprisingly well in action movies.<br/><br/>Enjoy it!!!"
"paul_haakonsen","6","1","3","15 April 2017"," Visually great, but the movie lacked a proper story...
","I didn't really have much of any expectations for ""Kong: Skull Island"", except that I had hoped for a CGI galore. And that was essentially all that this movie turned out to be, sad to say.<br/><br/>So this movie is supposed to be a prequel to the older ""King Kong"" movies, and the audience is supposed to believe that the secrets of Skull Island and the secrets of the existence of the mighty Kong managed to be a secret and kept quiet by all those who managed to escape from the Island alive? Sure, why not... Plausible? No, hardly so. But let's roll with it, for the sake of the entertainment purposes.<br/><br/>So the story, in all its simplicity, is about a group of scientists, funded by the American government, and assisted by the US armed forces, venture to a mysterious Island shrouded in a perpetual mist, where they are to look into what mysteries the Island hold. And they find a place where nature is merciless and evolved beyond the rest of the world.<br/><br/>I found the story to be way too simplistic and far fetched to be a worthy addition to the ""King Kong"" legacy. Sure, this was a visually stimulating movie, but it just didn't make sense. None of it did! So a small group of secluded islands harbor growth of natural predators to monstrous sizes of gargantuan proportions. Makes any sense? No, hardly so. Especially since you get to see like only a single gargantuan spider, one ape (not counting the skeletal remains in the graveyard) and some oddly-shaped reptilian beings. The ecosystem just doesn't make sense. How would there be enough food for such creatures? Would they feast upon one another, yes? But why isn't there more of them then?<br/><br/>The characters in the movie were two-dimensional and lacking anything that even remotely would be anything like character depth and growth. It was like watching clones and drones milling about. Especially characters like Hank Marlow (played by John C. Reilly). He had been there since World War II, yet managed to elude learning to speak the native language of those tribesmen on the Island, yet he lived among them? Sure, that was just believable. And also the painfully generic and stereotypical Preston Packard character (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Wow, just wow! That character was the epitome of how you make a character as generic and pointless as you possibly can.<br/><br/>The visual effects were off the charts, though. ""Kong: Skull Island"", as I mentioned earlier, is an effects movie. And I do applaud the special effects team, because they really mustered up here and came together with something very pleasing to the eye. It all looked very real and had so many nice touches in the details.<br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" was not an overly impressive movie, not in the slightest. It is the type of movie that you watch, then check it off your watch-list, and you quickly forget about it, just as you did with Peter Jacksons take on the original ""King Kong"" movie."

Any film that is able to evoke that feeling, is a winner in my book. But all nostalgia aside, I thought the movie did a great job of showcasing the Skull Island and the monsters that dwell there. Kong was presented as a real King, and the FX were great. Over all it was just was a fun monster movie, and who doesn't like those?"
"greggs_nbacon","6","1","3","6 April 2017"," Give me more monkey!
","One of the first classic films of cinema I remember identifying with was King Kong. When I was in the years of my early childhood, I was fortunate enough to get on the Kongfronatation ride at Universal Studios when it was still functional. That sparked an obsession. I will never forget the sheer disappoint I had in my heart when I heard that my classmates in elementary school booed a screening of the original 1933 Kong. To me, this was a great monster movie, and there is no way that anyone could possibly hate it! To make it short, I have always had a deep love for King Kong, and was obsessed with how he was to be depicted. When the 2005 version of Kong was released, I remember leaving the movies uninspired, even at the age of 10. To me, they had ruined my idea of how our giant simian friend was depicted, and I was greatly disappointed. So, of course, when Kong: Skull Island was released, I knew I had to see it.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is the second entry in Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures shared Monsterverse. the first entry was Godzilla (2014), which I felt to be slightly underwhelming. My sentiment has always been that in any monster movie, human conflict always drags down the true nature of the monsters. the whole plot of a family trying to be reunited in Godzilla warranted several eye rolls from me as an audience member. To be perfectly honest, I am not even sure we need the shared cinematic MonsterVerse. It seems that every studio is trying to find a way to copy Marvel's model that has made them billions of dollars. That being said, I think it is making individual films more and more uninspired, as they become part of a much larger and unnecessary vision.<br/><br/>One thing I will say for the writing of Kong is that the human characters were uninspired and unmemorable by the end of the film, I could maybe name one of the main characters. That is how easily forgettable they were. Incredibly underdeveloped and mundane, I never felt a real reason to care for these characters. Being as there was no central protagonist, the fractured lives of a cast of characters made me ignore them completely. Also, I felt the that there was very little conflict resolution for most of the characters. also, the studio shamelessly cast Chinese actress Tian Jing in a bit role. This is obviously to appeal to the Chinese and global audience, which is becoming more and more of an issue in contemporary blockbuster filmmaking. This is especially problematic when Chinese companies are starting to take majority control in major Hollywood studios. For example, Legendary Studios, that produced this film, is now owned by Chinese investors. In the next couple of years, China will be the biggest box office in the world, even surpassing the United States. This means that studios will do anything they have to to reach this giant global audience to maximize box office profit.<br/><br/>I will say that Kong Skull Island tried desperately to develop some real relevant socio-political themes, even having John Goodman mutter the line, ""There will never be a crazier time in Washington."" The setting of the Vietnam War was present, as much as they tried to force is. There were consistent homages to classic movies depicting the Vietnam War, such as ""Born to Breed"" engraved on one of the soldier's helmets. in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, Private Joker's helmet has ""Born to Kill"" written on the side of it. Also, it is very apparent that director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has seen Apocalypse Now many times. This very evident throughout the film. the production team even had a poster made that looks somewhat familiar. <br/><br/>All the elements of a Vietnam War movie are there. From thematic elements of war vs. peace to a blazing soundtrack of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Kong: Skull Island tries desperately to fit into the aesthetic. However, I am not sure that it successfully accomplishes this goal in the slighest. There is something to be said for the classic 1930s setting that Kong has always had, and without it, I felt as if something was missing entirely. There were homages to the original film subtly sprinkled throughout, but they felt too subtle to even notice.<br/><br/>Now that I have spent the last two paragraphs slamming what I really did not like about the movie. throughout mostly choppy dialogue, there were some moments of brilliance in the dialogue, mostly spoken by John C. Reilly's Captain Hank Marlow. Also, the battle scenes are breathtaking. As I have always felt the monsters, not the human should be the focus of the movies. Humans are mostly unnecessary. I don't go to see these movies to learn about human interest causes; I go to them because I want to see monsters blow things up. Kong really brings to the front the brutality and cruelty of the monsters that reside on the island with striking and surprising violence.<br/><br/>Overall, Kong: Skull Island is a decently fun movie. It is great to see on a big screen and it is moderately enjoyable. However, I do think that it is a very flawed and undeveloped film, and is not any way, shape, or form an innovative action film in the slightest.<br/><br/>(Score: 7/10)"

","So Kong: Skull Island. *****Spoiler Alert***** I quite enjoyed it, it is beautifully shot and the setting is excellent, the lost island comes alive on screen even down to the like insects buzzing about. I'll give it 2.5/5 as it's lot of nice shots with some reasonable acting in bits. The story on the whole is just the usual rubbish, lost island, recently re-discovered, go and have a look blah blah blah. This time it's the 1970's end of the Vietnam war and there are four groups of people: group A) Stupid scientists led by John Goodman Group B) Gung-Ho Vietnam helicopter Vets led by Samuel Jackson Group C) Pretty photographer lady and the bloke off Thor who isn't Thor. Maybe called Loki. (Don't worry about him though as he plays no useful part in the film) Group D) people already on the island. Natives and Pilot-Bloke out of WW2. I can't really be bothered to write up a proper review, just to say it's very silly, and the script is disappointing in it's lack of originality. Structurally the film seems to have a very long first act, and then relatively short second act and a microscopic third act. So it's all front heavy, and once they get there they don;t really know what to do. The best thing in it is The Lost WW2 Pilot, who gets all the best line and plays the moral compass which is interesting I suppose. The Bloke from Thor could be completely cut and does and achieves absolutely nothing, just a really odd role to bother with. The Vietnam Vets have just spent God knows how long in the jungle, so the silly scientists go and hire a bloke who knows about jungles. But they just hired the Vets? But, wait, hang on... Oh yes! They are silly scientists. Kong turns up in the opening shot and smashes stuff, and generally that's all he does. After so many films with giant creatures in: Kong, Godzilla, Cloverfield etc, could we possibly come up with a scenario where huge creatures do something other than just smash stuff? We know that monkeys and Apes are intelligent so why not have them do something intelligent? And after a while the endless fights Kong Vs Squid-thing, Kong Vs Helicopters and Kong Vs Biped-monster thing become a bit repetitive to be honest. All the scenes with the indigenous people in look wonderful but have absolutely no purpose at all, I just felt that they should have been involved in the story in somewhat rather than just being background colour. I enjoyed the film, looks like they had fun making it, but i just wish that Hollywood screenwriters would justify the huge sums they got paid by actually doing something original. 'Tis a silly film.

Five minutes in, every freaking one is toast after presumably surviving an entire year in 'Nam. Even the biplane pilots in the original did better than that! When I was practicing bayonet drills at Fort Benning, the instructor told us he'd never actually used one because he ""always carried plenty of ammunition."" Excellent advice for infantrymen and pilots both. <br/><br/>And I never ever saw anybody lugging around an actual record player--see the Air Cav scene in Apocalypse Now for the proper reel-to-reel machine. <br/><br/>In general a stupid waste of time and money although its good to see that John Goodman has lost weight and Brie Larson is as lovely as ever, although not as limber as Naomi Watts. Its good Samuel Jackson still has a day job shilling for Capital One, and its good to see John C. Reilly, an under-appreciated actor whose heart got broken by Roxy Hart in Chicago, stealing the show. One only hopes he hung in there long enough to see his beloved Cubbies win it all. But I guess if characters in these movies paid attention to the warning from the guy who'd ""lived there 28 years,"" we wouldn't have movies like this.<br/><br/>Hummm; maybe not such a bad idea."

Each time we revisit this story it gets bigger and more fanciful, but each time the visual effects can be more awe inspiring. This particular outing ticked a lot of boxes for me. We have a group of scientists, a platoon of soldiers due to return home from the Vietnam war, and a man running an expedition with a hidden agenda, put all these factions together on an island inhabited by monsters and there is bound to be bloodshed. Tom Hiddleston smouldered in slow motion as a man hired for his tracking skills, Brie Larson tossed her hair provocatively as the pushy woman photographer and Samuel L Jackson delivered an epic performance as Lt Col Packard, a man who is not yet ready to leave the war and who is letting his fighting spirit cloud his decision making process. This group of people made odd bedfellows but add a tribe of non speaking painted natives, a huge primate and some outstandingly ugly reptilian monsters and you have a movie that keeps you interested from start to finish.

","Kong: Skull Island. It's an adventure and exciting. It's also stupid and moronic. Samuel L. Jackson plays himself in his own special dense way.

A slimmed-down John Goodman is the scientist/explorer who is leading the team to explore Skull Island, just off the coast of Vietnam, 1973. The atom bomb tests weren't what we thought. One was to kill something. That's how stupid this can get. However, it is a real adventure if you dumb-yourself-down to 5 years old and just enjoy it. Great scenery, special effects, cinematography, and the giant ape is appropriate. This film makes up for the first King Kong in 1933 that broke my heart at the end when Carl Denham says, ""Oh no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast."" I always hated that ending. This film's ending is better. So it's up to you, but I can say I was entertained."
"henryluck","8","1","3","23 March 2017"," Kong: Skull Island 2D Review
","Kong: Skull Island 2D Review Watching Kong: Skull Island was mostly like watching my childhood dreams being reborn. As I marveled at the overgrown ruins of Skull Island and at the ginormous King Kong, the film caught my attention like a fish on a line. Why are our main characters on this deadly uncharted island in the first place? The year is 1973 and a group of explorers accompanied by US soldiers want to explore Skull Island to find the source that the US has been dropping bomb tests on. Even though the actors did a fine job of portraying the explorers, I didn't feel fully connected with them and the only actors I would really remember were Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard who seeks revenge on King Kong for killing his men in self-defence and John C. Reilly who played as an American war Lieutenant known as Hank Marlow who crashed landed on Skull Island in during World War 2 and had lived on the Island since. But even though the story served a valid enough excuse to go to Skull Island, the real magic of the film was in the action. When I first saw the hairy and battle-scared King Kong arise and swat helicopters out of the sky like they were flies, I felt a great sense of nostalgia like I felt as a child watching the Hulk. I also watched in amazement as King Kong tore apart a giant Octopus with his bare hands. I knew from watching this that King Kong was not to be underestimated. But there wasn't just Kong on the island. There were other atrocities too, such as a giant spider that impaled an unfortunate solider through the mouth with one of its legs. There were also the terrifying Skull Crawlers, hideous giant reptile-like monsters that created a giant aura of fear and savageness around them. They were so strong, that one of them sent a man flying hundreds of feet in the air with the flick of their massive tail. I was also amazed by the scale and sight of Skull Island too. Everything from the forest to the unholy wildlife intimidated me of the secret yet sinister powers of Skull Island. After, doing a bit of handy research on IMDb (International Movie Datebase) I found that Skull Island was shot with the Arri Alexa XT Plus and had Dolby Atmos Sound. This made the film gorgeous and pulse-racing even in the 2D screening that I saw which is something I thank the producers for spending a good part of the film's budget on. However, the film had a habit of killing the music before King Kong or other monsters lunged out to attack, which unfortunately made the jump scares predictable.<br/><br/>But overall, I had a well fun ride with Kong: Skull Island. The setting of the island was intimidating and felt realistic in a fantasy setting, King Kong was portrayed exceptionally as a giant ape and the fearsome king of the island, the other monsters were menacing and captivating and the many epic fight scenes throughout kept my attention from start to finish, despite many of the characters feeling forgettable and the jump scares giving you fair warning before they happened. But if you're looking for a thrilling monster move from the producers of 2014's Godzilla, then Kong: Skull Island should be next on your 2017 watch list. 8.5/10"

","A team of soldiers and scientists discover an uncharted island named Skull Island, which they travel to in an attempt to mark as their own by dropping explosives onto the island. However they soon discover that the island contains a gigantic ape known as Kong and that the inhabitants of the island also contains a wide variety of giant creatures. Needless to say, Kong goes berserk and smashes most of the helicopters leaving a small group of survivors to try and escape the island alive. As far as story goes, I'll leave it at that for those who haven't seen it.<br/><br/>I had been waiting to see this for some time, especially after the recent Legendary Godzilla movie from 2014. I must say that while I was entertained, I guess my expectations were a little too high especially since this had to follow Peter Jackson's remake from 2005, which I still think is superior to this movie. It's a good reimagining of the King Kong character, and while the monster action is terrific, the human characters are quite bland though most of the main actors (Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, John Goodman and especially John C Reilly) do a great job, their characters are not as fully developed as you think. However this can all be forgiven as this is a creature feature first and foremost.<br/><br/>As far as Kong himself goes, yes he is bigger than ever and looks great, this version of Kong reminds me of the 1976 version, being that it stands upright and moves just like a human rather than on all fours like the original and Peter Jackson's remake. As I stated this is more of a creature feature, do not expect the traditional beauty and the beast storyline as previous films. If you go into this movie expecting monster action, then yes you get that, although do not watch the trailer as it spoils most of the creatures.<br/><br/>And whatever you do, do not miss the after credits sequence, that part alone made me act like a 5 year old again."
"Screen_Blitz","7","1","3","16 March 2017"," Newly update rendition of King Kong is no game-changer. Nonetheless, it is a satisfying experience
","As an average monster B-movie, Kong: Skull Island does about everything it sets out to do. It is fast-paced, it is thrilling, and it is pure eye candy in terms of special effects. But when it comes to leveling up with previous iterations like the Peter Jackson installment back in 2005, it is perhaps less than successful as was Gareth Edward's 'Godzilla' in reaching the heights of the original Godzilla. Jordan Vogt-Roberts takes the director's chair to deliver an extravagant re-imagination of the giant gorilla. Blending in eye-popping special effects, visual spectacle, and sleek anti-war commentary, Roberts places the story of the giant gorilla in 70s Vietnam War period with visual heft that pays clear nods to Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' while attempting to retain the spirit of the popular Hollywood ape. Set in 1973, this film follows Bill Randa (played by John Goodman), a senior government official who leads a group of soldiers including British Air Service Captain James Conrad (played by Tom Hiddleston), U.S Army Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (played by Samuel L. Jackson), and U.S Army Major Jack Chapman (played by Toby Kebbell) along with a team of young soldiers and photojournalist Mason Weaver (played by Brie Larson) to an uncharted Pacific island where they encounter vicious creatures. Of course, the biggest threat of the island happens to be giant gorilla the size of a skyscraper who unleashes hell upon their arrival. With the help of World War II veteran Hank Marlow (played by John C. Reilly) who's been stranded on the island for nearly three decades, it is up to the big group to escape the island while surviving against the violent Gorilla and monstrous creature onslaught.<br/><br/>There is definitely nothing special or subversive about Jordan Vogt-Roberts, and the quality of his direction is predictably undermined by the previous iterations of titular gorilla. Roberts's execution for the popular source material is bit more blockbuster-ized than what Hollywood has spawned in the past. When it comes to delivering the thrills however, gets the job done. The plot quickly kicks into gear during the first half-hour when the ensemble cast of characters arrive on the island in helicopters, and the thirty-story gorilla appears out of nowhere swatting the helicopters from the air, blowing them in smithereens. The tension only heats up when the cast is forced to face down a wide variety of freaky creatures including carnivorous pterodactyls and boney dinosaur-like creatures that eat humans for breakfast. And this is all complete with slick CGI and a wide plethora of explosions to feast the eyes. There is definitely a Jurassic Park vibe to handed here. Characters are attacked, some of them are eaten, and the there is a grueling creature-on-creature battle that erupts during the final stretch. Underneath it all is a hodgepodge of anti-war commentary and morality issues toward the end that play roles in the story, and Roberts does not hesitate to spew a few homages of old Vietnam War flicks from the 80s era. It is easy to interpret to story as a B-monster movie decorated as a war flick. In terms of characterizations, the majority of the characters who sadly depth, with only Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard and John C. Reilly's Hank Marlow only being well developed. And it is the latter that serves as the show-stealer of the pack. Sprouting with charisma and kind-hearted humor, Reilly gives arguably the biggest appeal. The rest of the cast give some alright performances, but it does little to redeem for the shallow development. <br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is an exhilarating monster flick blooming with thrills, shiny special effects, and a direction that fairly pays off. This rendition of the popular primate is far from a game-changer nor does it try to be one. To say the least, it is a fun pre-Summer flick. If you are craving to see a giant gorilla the size of a skyscraper wrecking havoc and smashing creatures to oblivion, this one will make that investment."
"OlieRendch","7","1","3","16 March 2017"," Incredible visuals and creature design but poorly written.
","Kong: Skull Island is the second film in the ""MonsterVerse"" after Gareth Edward's 2014 film, Godzilla. It stars a lot of people, including, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman and John C. Reilly as a group of scientists and soldiers exploring a mysterious island. I've seen the main Kong films throughout the years and I have to say I do enjoy the concept of people finding an enormous gorilla on a primeval island; I always remember when I was younger being creeped out by Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong and at one point was quite obsessed with it; since then I've enjoyed the 1933 original and even watched the not-so-good 1976 attempt. Now though we see a different take on the character, one set in the 70s, and of a larger world.<br/><br/>I'll start with what I enjoyed, and first and foremost would be both the soundtrack and original score. Being set in the 70s, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts gives us some great pieces of music to accompany various scenes giving the film an upbeat, feel-good vibe, similar to that of Guardians of the Galaxy, or The Martian. And Henry Jackman delivers a well-composed dramatic score which includes some 70s vibes.<br/><br/>Another thing to enjoy is that this film is full of really cool moments; scenes or shots that intend for you to be awed. Whether it be a silhouette of choppers flying towards Kong or just the animals and people of the island being framed through the Brie Larson character's 1970 era camera lens which makes for a really nice touch. Vogt- Roberts certainly has an eye for interesting and unique camera set ups and there were some great ones in here I really loved as well as some epic wide shots that you could just frame.<br/><br/>Now unfortunately it's these amazing moments and ""awe shots"" that sort bring the movie down for me. While it's great to have those kind of scenes, you can't rely on them. Kong: Skull Island was visually stunning, almost to a surreal sense at times, adding to the island mystery, but as far as story and script goes, it was a bit underdeveloped. For the first two-thirds of the movie it felt like the story was just quickly written dialogue to get us from one cool shot to the next. The characters hardly had any development and surprisingly the most fleshed-out and interesting character was John C. Reilly's Hank Marlow. Although Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are certainly great actors and look great, their characters were very one-dimensional. Hiddleston's was a generic former military hunter/tracker man with convenient skills and Larson's was a photographer, and that was pretty much it. Sam Jackson and John Goodman are also great actors and have delivered some incredibly iconic characters but here even they almost seemed expendable at points.<br/><br/>So although the film is let down script-wise and is quite unevenly paced throughout most of it the final third is really good as it flows much better and the creature is design is amazing. Kong looks great, as well as some of the other fearsome creatures that inhabit the island but the stand-out for me were the disturbingly hideous Skull Crawlers whose mere existence you were thankful were only fictional.<br/><br/>In the end Kong: Skull Island isn't quite what I expected it to be but it is a great-looking monster-movie and even has an after-credit scene for those who like to get excited for what's to come."

"PyroSikTh","7","1","3","14 March 2017"," Good Fun if you Don't Engage your Brain too much
","Kong vs Godzilla is a classic B-movie team-up, and in a bid to compete with Marvel and DC's cinematic universes, and with a reasonably successful Godzilla reboot under the belt, Legendary decided to recreate that iconic clash. Kong is the second movie in Legendary's Monsterverse, although it's the first one to really embrace the idea of a shared continuity with Godzilla.<br/><br/>It's the early days of Monarch, the organisation that lead the investigations in Godzilla, and they're a laughing stock. There's no proof that any of their crackpot theories are true, so in a desperate bid they tack on to a survey team at the tail end of the Vietnam war. There's Monarch, made up of Bill Randa and Houston Brooks, a group of scientists headed up by Victor Nieves, a military arm lead by Colonel Packard, a tracker-for-hire, and a war photographer. They're instantly met with the sight of an angry Kong, separated, and spend the majority of the movie attempting to re-connect with each other, exploring the island as they go and uncovering the darker secrets it holds.<br/><br/>As plots go, Kong is nothing particularly new or, unfortunately, interesting. They embark on the expedition, are immediately separated, spend the entire movie finding each other, and then they attempt to get off the island. That's literally it. The little niggles of story are sourced from character's various motivations, which range from stereotypical to just plain absurd. It doesn't help that character development is pretty much non-existent. There's no lead protagonist, with the film instead going for an ensemble of equal opportunity, which results in a lack of focus.<br/><br/>But you know what, none of that really mattered much. Kong is absolutely a movie that chooses style over substance, and it's style is so superbly executed that nothing else really matters. I mean, it's a monster movie after all, and it takes that license seriously. It's all about monsters and big critters and explosive action between them. Kong fights helicopters, he fights an octopus, he fights weird lizard creatures from beneath, and he fights Samuel L Jackson. It's all a monster movie could need to stay entertaining.<br/><br/>Of course it helps that the CGI is spectacular. I feel like I say this every time, and maybe that's just because that's where we are with CGI these days, but all the visual effects work is so detailed and realistic. Kong himself is a breathtaking piece of work, full of expression and natural movements (thank you motion capture), and every other monster featured enjoys the same devotion, from the swamp-covered oxen to the towering spiders with bamboo for legs. Hell, even the storm surrounding the island looks imposing and otherworldly, with streaks of red lightning providing a very real threat to the crew of the expedition.<br/><br/>It's not just the CGI though. The cinematography gives the film such a unique appearance. It's the 70s in the Pacific, of course the natural colour pallet to take is one vibrant and full of greens, blues, and oranges. Visually it looks like a Vietnam war movie, with it's most obvious inspiration being Apocalypse Now. The choice of locations helps a lot as well, with wide, lush plains framed by towering rock-faces and hills covered in palm trees. I admit, one of my worries with Kong, before any footage premiered, was whether it would look even half as good as Godzilla. Thankfully, with Larry Fong responsible for the movie's appearance, I should never have worried. The long time Zack Snyder collaborator is responsible for making Snyder's movie's look unlike anything else, and he brings the same eye to Kong.<br/><br/>In short, Kong: Skull Island is an adrenaline pumping action movie full of explosions, big monsters, and incredible visuals. It lacks substance, both in characters and story, but it's technically a very well-made movie and perfect for just idly chucking on for a bit of mindless fun. Let's be honest, it was never going to be a deep or profound experience full of twists and turns, although I would've liked to have cared for the characters a little more. I give Kong: Skull Island a superficially enjoyable 7/10."
"eparazak","6","1","3","12 March 2017"," A much different take on the King Kong franchise
","After the Vietnam war, a team of scientists and military men investigate an uncharted island full of ferocious monsters including an ape named Kong.<br/><br/>This movie acts as a new installment to the King Kong franchise, an a much different take at that. Personally, I'm one of those people who wasn't extremely fond of the 2005 King Kong remake and because of that, I was anticipating this movie. Unfortunately, it ended up being a mixed bag.<br/><br/>To start with the bads, I found some of the green-screening way too obvious. This trend can first be seen during the beginning of the movie as some of the backgrounds don't match up with ones from the last or next shots, as an example. Another issue I had was with the ending. Without spoiling anything, I have to say that the ending of the movie feels unfinished; it left me confused and had me asking myself: ""Wait, that's it?"" However, my main issue with the movie is that despite the fact that the movie's title has the name Kong in it, we barely see him outside of the beginning and ending, and that's pretty disappointing for me. As someone who wanted to see more of King Kong throughout the film, it kind of is a letdown to see that he only has very few appearances. My final complaint has to be that the movie feels too different from its previous installments. When you go into a remake or reboot of an older movie, you'd expect them to at least somewhat follow the formula of the original work. That's not the case here, as it seems like the film is trying to be its own thing. Granted, they do pay homages to the original movie, but it doesn't save this from being one of the movie's weaknesses.<br/><br/>Now let's take a look at the goods. To start, the environments were beautiful. The movie gives us a breathtaking look at an uncharted island and it makes you want to see it for yourself. Another strength of the movie has to be the action scenes. The action scenes just looked plain awesome and they were the highlight of the film. The action scenes had a lot of engaging and gripping moments that left me on the edge of my seat. I don't want to spoil the movie, so if you'd like to watch the action scenes in this, then you should go see it for yourselves. The last strength of the movie is that it feels different; it's both the film's strength and weakness. The only real positive I can say about the movie being different is that it does a great job at being its own thing.<br/><br/>Overall, I find the movie to be a mixed bag. I like the action scenes, environment and the fact that it's trying to do something different with the franchise; although that is a weakness as well as the fact that we don't see the star very often."

","Better than expected, a not-too-shabby attempt at yet another (insert eye-roll here) King Kong picture, starring Tom Hiddleston, John C. Reilly and the beloved Samuel L. Jackson.<br/><br/>Predominantly set in 1973, the flick follows a purpose-built team of soldiers, scientists and stragglers as they head for the undiscovered Skull Island in search of the unknown. Here they stumble upon a beast trapped on the island known as Kong - a potentially misjudged anti-hero.<br/><br/>Highly-anticipated by many, this sequel was - in my mind - always going to be either a complete masterpiece or bucketful of disappointment. To my surprise(/delight/sadness), it turned out to be neither. Whilst on the most part I would praise its' solid cinematography (some beautiful landscape and action shots), as well as Kongs' expert-use of CGI throughout, these couldn't save it from what appeared to me a watered-down premise with fortune-cookie-clichés being pulled out of a hat and inserted into every appropriate crevice.<br/><br/>The acting standard as a whole is admittedly not bad - I have to give particular nod to Samuel L Jackson for finally producing a well played-out character (seriously, name me a role he's played well since Django Unchained and I'll be a monkey's uncle) - but I can't particularly criticise much of the performances throughout. Toby Kebbell (yes, that guy that's been in everything recently that you never remember the name of) and Brie Larson were probably the most bland - with Tom Hiddleston outshining most of his fellow cast members.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were indeed the most entertaining part - well-timed, well thought-out and, at times, epic! Other than a slight overuse of slow-motion features, and a couple of ridiculous shots, I honestly quite enjoyed seeing not only the fights with Kong himself but the other internal exchanges (no spoilers, I promised!).<br/><br/>Also, entirely blameless of the creators, but yet another movie this season with the insertion of JFK, Vietnam and 60's culture was really not needed (sorry guys!). Despite this, it redeemed itself slightly with some fairly enjoyable music throwbacks. Alongside these were plenty of well-utilised sound-effects and editing that I found rather enjoyable (a complete renunciation from the script).<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised to find Kong: Skull Island didn't leave me wanting 2 hours of my life back; that said, given the choice I wouldn't waste another two rewatching it. Okay to pass the time, Kong exists. If you're after something more worthwhile, perhaps skip this and shove on Predator (terribly brilliant) or Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus (brilliantly terrible).<br/><br/>showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/review-kong-skull-island.html"
"Richie-67-485852","8","1","3","12 March 2017"," Kong Good Story Potential
","King Kong lives on. There is no forgetting the original which did its job to seal it in our hearts forever. What comes after that remains to be seen even though I thought Peter Jackson gave it a good go. In his version, the beginning dragged on and on and the movie doesn't really get its legs until we hit Skull Island. Same with this movie too. All the set-up prior is not needed to help take us to a mysterious island full of intrigue and adventure. If it was done properly, it would help to build suspense which just doesn't take place in this movie. Once there, Skull Island should occupy and overwhelm our senses 100% of the time something all writers tried to do except the 1976 version which didn't pay too much attention to the island details. They captured some of the mystique but didn't dwell long enough on it or explore it more in detail. Forgetting all that for the moment, I thought what they did show was decent as the creatures do help one focus on the screen. However, there were not enough of them, their background and habits and for that matter who are the people who live there and how do they survive? They farm? A hostile island that has farming? Hmmm. Then there is this battle between Kong and guys with guns. Now some of these guys got in some good shots so why isn't Kong reeling from this? At some point he is smarting and then it is forgotten. There is one scene that is troubling for believe-ability and that is the major fight scene between Kong and another creature. I thought the other creature got the best of Kong no problem so how is he going to eventually fight Godzilla? Jacksons Kong had more strength where this one is much larger. The characters in the movie are not memorable nor do we care about them and when they get eaten, well they got what they had coming. What is so hard about a good script? They had a good two years to float something and nail it. Any Kong fan could come up with a better story on the spot if forced to do so. There is no excuse for not wowing the audience especially when the subject matter is King Kong, Skull Island and creatures galore never before seen. If the director would have created more tension, spent more time on Kong and diversified the life forms more, it would be worth seeing again and again plus owning the Blue Ray would be a must. Not the case with one exception. If they have some deleted scenes such as the giant ants mentioned but not shown and more Skull Island details. If anyone is satisfied with this version of Kong then I don't know what to say except I am happy for you. However, for the ones that adore the concept, that have seen the original dozens and dozens of times, it lets down quite well. Wait for this to hit cable. BTW....I went to see this in 3 D expecting some really spectacular stuff. Save your money! King Kong will always be King but the storytellers, where have they gone? Popcorn and a tasty drink will help a lot. Enjoy this Kong (after all it is a King Kong movie) and hope that the ones that worked on this movie learn as they go. UPDATE: I was not aware that this was being used to launch the monsterama as I call it bringing back all my childhood monsters like Ghidra, Rodan, Mothra and of course Godzilla plus more I am sure. If that is the intent here, then they did a fare job of bringing this up to date to ready it for what is to come. Also, I didn't know about scenes after the credits either. Must watch and thank you"

","Skull Island features the biggest Kong yet, a towering 100 ft tall primate able to swat helicopters from the sky like flies. But bigger doesn't necessarily mean better: while this latest great ape adventure is a slight improvement over Peter Jackson's bloated 2005 remake of the '33 classic, it's a monster movie desperately in need of a decent plot. The special effects laden action sequences cannot fail to impress, but the story does not.<br/><br/>The extremely basic screenplay takes a group of scientists and soldiers, has them embark on an expedition to the titular uncharted island, where they encounter Kong, who knocks them for six. The survivors must make their way to a rendezvous point on the North side of the island, avoiding being eaten by a variety of massive creatures or getting trodden on by the oversized simian. And that's about it. Kong battles a giant octopus, a massive crab/spider attacks the humans, vicious birds swoop out the sky, and nasty lizard creatures crawl from beneath the island's surface, all of which is mindlessly entertaining, but not in the least bit inspired.<br/><br/>5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for token eye candy Brie Larson, who strips to a figure hugging vest in an attempt to distract viewers from the lack of fresh ideas."

"ScribblyBug","6","1","3","12 March 2017"," A Two-Dimensional Comic Book
","Unlike previous instalments which tried to approach the film with a dark and dramatic approach, this film offers more of a campy explosive comic book appeal. Colours pop, camera angles are occasionally edgy, and the acting seems intentionally one step over the ""cheesy"" line. Unfortunately, the characters and their relationships don't really develop into anything meaningful or worthy of revisiting in a sequel. Written down on paper, they offer nothing that we haven't seen before. <br/><br/>As for the story, there isn't much on offer. It's pretty much the same as usual, a group of intrepid explorers manage to worm their way onto Skull Island where they fall victim to the island's murderous CGI creatures. Unfortunately, the story goes no further than that, other than a few character story lines that wriggle to the surface only to be killed off or muted to make way for another massive CGI fight sequence with excessive explosions and monster-roars. <br/><br/>It isn't as clever or original as the trailers and publicity made it out to be. There isn't much depth or heart to the film, it's just another big blockbuster blow-out that hopes to merge with other big blockbuster blow-outs to make an EVEN BIGGER blockbuster blow-out. I get that. They want money, and that's the only reason this film exists. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - despite my less-than flattering review, I didn't think of it as an entirely terrible movie. It kept me fairly entertained from start to finish, purely for the visual style of the movie and the much-appreciated fast-pace. I just hoped for.. a little bit more. I want to actually care about the characters, even the CGI ones, and I want the story to surprise me, to take a direction I wasn't expecting.

Then they do the same thing all over again. they reveal the baddie monsters in a pointless and suspense free early punch up with Kong so the big action scene in the bone yard has no suspense or reveal.

","Definitely one of the better blockbusters in recent times, with lots of recognizable actors that you'll find yourself hoping their characters won't die, which adds to the thrill. Samuel Jackson is of course solid, and infuriating near the end. Brie Larson was nice and believable. Tom Hiddleston doesn't really have the kind of presence that an actor in this type of movie should be having (he tries and he fails IMO). Straight Outta Compton actors Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell are good to see here. Corey Hawkins as a nerdy scientist alongside Jing Tian was a pleasure to see. John C. Reilly's character propels most of the movie. There was a lot of use of colored smoke which made for gorgeous shots, so I'm not really complaining. I appreciated the fact that the actors of color weren't just merely hired so they can claim ""diversity"", but gave them good roles, lines, and didn't kill them off. I also appreciated that the people in the island weren't painted as uncivilized or 'savages', the way these type of films usually do. However, it feels off that they never even developed any form of language besides staring really long into each others' eyes and bowing. The villainous monster design was good, and was a great contrast to Kong. Kong as a character and a creature was definitely more regal, and is further on the evolutionary process (i.e. walks upright and uses and builds tools)."
"joshbarton15","7","1","3","12 March 2017"," Blows its load too early but saved by some major monster action
","Kong: Skull Island serves as the second film in Legendary's MonsterVerse, following the monster hit that was Godzilla back in 2014. With an up and coming director at the helm, a mightily impressive cast in tow and, of course, the iconic Kong himself on full show, the ingredients were there for this to be another great monster film.<br/><br/>When a team of explorers and soldiers venture to an unchartered island in the Pacific, they get more than they bargained for when they realise the island is home to an array of giant creatures, including the mythic Kong.<br/><br/>Let's get the few negatives I had with Kong: Skull Island out of the way first. I wasn't particularly a massive fan of how they blew their load too early by showing Kong pretty much within the first fifteen minutes, losing any sense of awe that this iconic monster deserves. Compare it to the way Gareth Edwards built up to Godzilla's reveal and it's almost as if there's a total lack of respect for Kong.<br/><br/>Then there are the human characters and the film's screenplay, both void of any real weight. The characters are about as bland as they come and they're matched by some truly uninspired performances from the likes of Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, who really try their best with some awful dialogue. The most interesting character is Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard, who holds a real grudge against Kong however, they miss a chance for Jackson to go fully off the rails and his tirade against Kong comes across as half-hearted. John C. Reilly was the performance most people were worried about in this film but because of how his character is written into the film and the fact he isn't just an annoying joke machine, he is one of the best things about the film.<br/><br/>It's easy to say this is a film about Kong so we shouldn't really worry about the human characters. If we are supposed to care about what happens to these characters then there simply has to be something about them for us to give a damn about. Unfortunately, this is a similar problem that Godzilla faced.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island may be found lacking in some departments but I can't deny that there is still a lot of fun to be had with this film. Jordan Vogt-Roberts' film moves along at such a blistering pace and he certainly shows he can deliver an action sequence. I mentioned that the film lacks a sense of awe, particularly with the film moving from giant beast to giant beast so swiftly, but Vogt-Roberts manages to make amends with the final two set-pieces of the film, the final fight between Kong and a 'skull crawler' being the film's stand-out moment. <br/><br/>Kong himself looks fantastic, brought to life through a motion-capture performance from Terry Notary, as do the rest of the visual effects, and the decision to shoot on location in places like Hawaii and Vietnam rather than in a green-screen studio amplifies the great visual effects work on this film, as does Larry Fong's cinematography.<br/><br/>I'd have to say Kong: Skull Island left me a little disappointed, even if it does deliver plenty of action and has a post credits scene that left me excited for the future of the MonsterVerse. It certainly made me understand why there was no 'King' included in the title."

","(RATING: ☆☆½ out of 5) <br/><br/>GRADE: C <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Kong's back...bigger and duller.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: ""Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, Beauty and""...wait a second...that's the wrong beast movie! Hmm...let's try again...""Is that a monkey?""...Yeah, now we have the right beauty and her beast tale. This remake, newly titled Kong: Skull Island, has no real love story or any remote emotional connection. Beauty does not kill the beast in this update. No, instead, we have boredom that kills the moviegoer. <br/><br/>While the CGI is very well done, especially the immaculate detailing of matted fur and expressive eyes on our big silly ape, other features are sorely missing, like believable characters, a plot that makes sense, action sequences that build tension, dialog that sounds authentic. Would that the filmmakers had spent more energy and effort on a convincing script, the film could have at least been entertaining. It just wastes everyone's time. <br/><br/>The King Kong legend dates back to 1933, with numerous remakes (including the vastly superior one by Peter Jackson in 2005). But our reboot begins in 1943 until it fast forwards to 1973. The plot (as before) involves a group of explorers who venture onto a primitive island filled with monsters, historic beasts, and a big galoot of a gorilla. This time, however, Kong rules over the island (sans the King, because no one likes a monarchy anymore). Not only is our ape ""as big as a building"", he is literally a treehugger who cares about ecological balance. When he feasts his eyes on the lovely Mason Weaver (Brie Larson, a poor-man's substitute for Fay Wray), there is no love interest. It's more of a mutual admiration society, as if she is an active member in PETA.<br/><br/>While no animals were injured in the making of this film, several fine actors have certainly damaged their reputations. Such talented actors like Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Shea Whigham, and the aforementioned Ms. Larson, are wasted in their underdeveloped roles. Only John C. Reilly succeeds in making his character interesting.<br/><br/>Besides the fine special effects, the only other redeeming feature is the stunning cinematography by Larry Fong that does impress, although his photography aligns itself too frequently to Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now with its wartime imagery of whirling helicopters and red-lit skies. But one has to admire that he set the bar high for his goal.<br/><br/>The direction by Jordan Vogt-Roberts is not that lofty. It is merely adequate. He stages the action scenes well enough but relies too heavily with a 1970's pop soundtrack that overstates everything. All seems rote and predictable. The dangers the characters face are not the least exciting as there is no build-up or tension. His pacing of the film is off-kilter. (The film takes a good half hour even before the mission begins.)<br/><br/>However, the majority of the blame goes to its rightful source, the screenplay-by-committee team of Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein, and Derek Connolly. They strand the actors on the island with banal conversation, long tedious exposition, and stock characters. (At one point, the travelers are warned about the giant ants on this isle, but they never make an appearance in this misguided adventure/fantasy. Nary a crumb in sight.)<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is just not a very enjoyable movie experience. The CGI holds your interest momentarily, but there are no real scares or thrills in this monster movie. This Kong may be a lot bigger, but it's not a whole lot better."
"larrymeers","8","1","3","11 March 2017"," Not perfect, but a good example of a monster movie.
","Kong skull island is a movie about a group of people who discover an uncharted island and find a very mad gorilla known as King Kong, while also battling many more unholy creatures. So i really liked Kong in this movie, he was just a very strong, and gentle giant. The special effects in the movie were astounding. There are a few amazing scenes like when we first see Kong, And when he battles the octopus and the skull crawlers. The acting is good even though people themselves aren't. Some people were worried about how John C. Reilly's comedy and jokes were not going to work that well in this particular film, as for me i thought some of his jokes were funny, while others came off as stupid or not really that funny. The plot is very silly and not that well made. And my main grip with this movie is how you don't really care about anybody. So even though i found some flaws with this movie, i still enjoyed it. It's not nearly as good as the original, but i thought it was better then the 2005 version. So in the end it may have some flaws, but it is still a fun popcorn movie which sets a good example about what a true monster movie is. B+ or 8/10. Oh and by the way the end credits scene was amazing, the scientist says how there are many islands out there and he shows James Conrad some pictures about Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, And King Ghidorha, And it ends with a Godzilla roar. So be expecting these guys in a lot more movies!"
"lambiepie-2","7","1","3","11 March 2017"," A Saturday Matinée Kong
","It's been a while since I went to the movies just to see an entertaining, Saturday Matinée. I don't even think people use the words anymore, but I will say this is where this version of Kong belongs and fits in well with that type of genre. I am a fan of this kinda stuff and have been ever since I was 6 or 7 years old -- those bigger than life creatures who got that way because of man's environmental foibles or because man never paid attention to ""that island over there that popped up outta nowhere, gee, I wonder what's on it. Let's go and see..."" Ha! Kong: Skull Island brings all the enjoyment back in films like this. I wasn't looking for a deep message, or outstanding performances, just an adventure to escape for a few hours with friends and movie crowd who like this too.<br/><br/>Kong is CGI'ed and it's okay, not too distracting. You also get to see those rare moments of Kong as at a few points you see the 'sad and lonely side' of Kong's existence on the Island between the fights and pyrotechnics. The film takes place in 1973, and there are references to it, but it really didn't matter to me as it could have been done in any year and still have the same outcome. You also get to see the life on the island which gives you the impression that it is a place outta sync with evolution. An expedition with a military escort comes and that's when all the death and destruction with them starts. I found that entertaining to watch, there were a few 'jump' moments when things happen you don't expect, giggle moments when you think you know what's going to happen and it doesn't quite go as planned.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly is the human star of this to me as a fighter shot down on the island, has managed to live there for 28 years and gets his chance to get out. Tom Hiddleston is the tracker brought along and is fun to watch, especially in the 'gas' scene against other monsters on the Island. Samuel L. Jackson was also interesting to watch as head of the military envoy who goes off the deep end with wanting nothing but revenge against Kong. the John Goodman is the ""kook"" that gets government approval and gathers all of them, military and scientists, all together to go to the island (so he can prove he's not a kook, of course!). And then there is an assortment of other diverse cast members to keep the movie moving. Again, very good popcorn movie Saturday matinée fare.<br/><br/>There are a few Easter eggs in Kong: Shull Island this I got immediately. They are preparing you for the future of Kong and others. But if you miss them during the film, it'll be very clear after the credits. Please stay. Kong: Skull Island is the beginning of these type of matinée popcorn fares, so just grab some friends, go to the theater and enjoy."

","In the early 1970s, a government team is assembled for a portentous exploration of a mysterious, uncharted island in the Pacific.

","With the help of soldiers, a group of scientists goes on a mission to visit an Island in Southeast Asia. After reaching the Island they start to drop bombs, until someone shows up to fight. This is the second film in the series of monster movies that starts with Godzilla 2014 which is far better than this movie. The failed attempt of character development was the main problem that faces the whole story. The technical team did an excellent job and the actors are all talented. Now comes the King Kong factor which is the only thing that is worth watchable. The intro action scenes and the ending scenes were outstanding. The night scenes look ridiculous in 3D. The Academy award winner Brie Larson is assigned to take pictures in the movie and apart from one stunt scene there is nothing much to do for her. The only reason why she signed this movie is the popularity of King Kong movies, Other than that, I don't know why she acts in this movie. Samuel L Jackson's eye to eye contact with King Kong was unbearable to watch. Overall, it's watchable only because of King Kong and that's the only thing that keeps the movie alive."

Really?) paired with a bland female he had little chemistry with, surrounded by completely forgettable characters and a SLJ just not even pretending to try. If that's not enough, this movie belittles its audience's intelligence, overexplaining every single thing. Can we guess a person developing some pictures is a photographer? No, we also need a long close-up of their camera. Can we guess by the Vietnam comments, the clothes, the technology and everything else we are in the 70s? No, we are also bombarded with 70s music and a super close-up of a magazine cover where we can read ""1973"" for five minutes, just in case we miss it. We also have the obvious afterthought in the form of a black and an asian characters, clearly there to add ""diversity"" because someone probably pointed out at the last minute this movie had almost none of that. To add insult to injury, the character development department was on vacation for this one. Everyone is as deep as a petri dish. Sad production."
"Coffee_in_the_Clink","3","1","4","10 February 2020"," ""That is one ugly-ass bird!""
","It is 1972, and American forces are beginning to withdraw from Vietnam. In the words of Lieutenant Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), America has ""abandoned"" the war, not ""lost"" it. This is a perfect opportunity for government scientist Bill Randa (John Goodman) to get the funding and man-power that he needs to discover and explore Skull Island, an uncharted and legendary island somewhere in the Pacific. Packard and his men are assigned the task of bringing the expedition via helicopter to the island, while Randa also recruits a former SAS soldier with a speciality in tracking and map-reading to come along. When they get there, they discover that the island is home and ruled by a giant ape named Kong.<br/><br/>This is no Peter Jackson Kong. I'm a fan of his 2005 remake of the 1930s classic. Skull island in Jackson's film was a grim place full of shadowy peril and brilliant looking monsters. Skull island in this 2017 version looks more like a holiday brochure. The monsters are poor. The only thing it has going for it is Kong himself, who looks incredible, and was the only enjoyable thing about this film. Everything else is atrocious. The actors cant do a lot with the thin script they are given, and the action and gung-ho heroics become repetitive before long."

"CubsandCulture","8","1","4","29 December 2018"," The gags largely work...
","As a reworking of King Kong that is also trying to set up a bunch of Godzilla knockoffs this film is better than the concept deserves. The direction and screenplay keep the story moving largely by pepping in vaguely satirical barbs about the situation and genre. It makes the film rather fun and the cheese delectably cheesy. Sure the film is glorified B-movie that mixes Apocalypse Now for ill-considered reasons but boy was the adventure exciting, the vistas engaging and the fights brutal.<br/><br/>Reilly's Hank is easily the best part. He is funny and hits the perfect tone for this sort of film. And the character's fate is almost moving which isn't what one should expect from a film like this. The Cub fandom of Hank was a nice a clever touch. I sure hope the character lived to see 2016.<br/><br/>The art direction/creature design is good. Skull Island has been done several times, and similar lost world environments have been created. This one stands out because of mixing in more types of creatures and the Skulls (lizards) are a striking design. The native tribe of Skull Island has a neat look as well; the film largely avoids the implicit racism that King Kong always seems to embody. This was a really fun adventure. I am glad I took it."

","The real story is that Kong: Skull Island cost $185 million to make and raked in, as of this writing, $566.2 million. This is the only metric for ""success"" that concerns the studio, and by this measure the film performed well. But what have the makers given the world? Nothing but trite clichés and utter stupidities. What is lost in the equation is the capacity for narrative film to be idiosyncratic and critical. One might object that a rendition of King Kong on a Skull Island was never intended to provoke thought or be relevant to our social or political lives, to which I say ""exactly!"" This piece of garbage is a grotesque exercise in market speculation, one that vampirically draws upon the talents of very capable technicians, actors, designers, etc. by virtue of its bloated budget alone. The two-fold effect of the film is first the empty distraction it provides to all concerned, and second, as previously mentioned, the all-important revenue generated. This ultra-cynical operation of the corporate/industrial culture machine is rife throughout the box office, Kong: Skull Island is not distinguished along these lines either.

The design on Kong was really good, and they made Skull Island believable. <br/><br/>I thought the humor was on point as well, funny thing about it is they hired actors from Marvel/Disney movies.

","Kong: Skull Island is fun, no denying that. I was hoping for a little bit more depth than it offered. That's not to say anyone was bad in it at all, they were simply not brought together in a very strong manner.<br/><br/>Being a fan of Peter Jackson's Kong it's hard not to go into this wondering how it might compare. Whilst Jackson's Kong is a nice retelling of the original, this is definitely your Die Hard 5 version of King Kong. That is to say, the characterization, the sense of doom, even the tugging of the heart strings in Jackson's Kong do not cross over into Skull Island at all.<br/><br/>The characters here are 2 dimensional, with only one having a name I remember (because it's the same as a computer manufacturer) and I'm fresh out of the cinema earlier this evening. Oh and Kong of course, he's one I can name...! ""That's what I call them... You call them what you want"" line in the movie can definitely be applied to the characters in this film, they honestly could be called tom dick and harry and it'd have no different effect.<br/><br/>But, given that this is a more in-line with the Godzilla franchise (and apparently a setup for a Godzilla sequel?) it does provide much more thrills and spills than the more recent Godzilla movie, giving a hint that at least the Kong vs Godzilla movie could be entertaining enough.<br/><br/>There are a few nice action sequences. I'm not really sure what made up the rest of the film, in my mind, some silly stuff, like covering several miles in seemingly seconds, second-rate banter & monsters coming out of nowhere clichés left right and centre.<br/><br/>So it's fun. Come the ending I was ready to leave and didn't bother with whatever showed over the credits. It was fine as a no-brainer action movie, but it was a very mediocre ride for the Kong fan in me.

"zardoz-13","8","1","4","27 March 2017"," The Best ""King Kong"" Remake Since The Original
","Nobody is ever going to top the classic ""King Kong"" (1933) with Fray Wray, Robert Armstrong, and Bruce Cabot. You may complain it is too old, too contrived, and too black & white. Sure, it is, but it remains an archetypal fantasy, and it altered the way Hollywood made movies. Few may concern themselves about its legacy, and the ignorant will never know how ""King Kong"" shaped the cinematic future. Meanwhile, Hollywood keeps on trying to surpass the legendary Merian C. Cooper & Ernest B. Schoedsack classic. Although ""Kings of the Summer"" director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and three scribes: Dan Gilroy of ""The Bourne Legacy,"" Max Borenstein of the rebooted 2014 ""Godzilla,"" and Derrick Connelly of ""Jurassic World"" have taken liberties with the formulaic narrative, they have created an entertaining but audacious action & adventure epic that should rattle anybody's cage. <br/><br/>Principally, Vogt-Roberts and his writers have eliminated some tragic events critical in previous ""King Kong"" remakes. Indeed, the title ""Kong: Skull Island"" tells all in this captivating reboot. Aside from its double-pronged prologue that establishes the basics, virtually everything takes place on Skull Island. I know what you're thinking: Vogt-Roberts and company linger so long on Skull Island that they are saving the rest for Kong saga sequels like Peter Jackson when he produced ""The Hobbit."" Okay, might be a possibility. If you stick around after the end credits, you'll see a scene that charts the future for ""Kong"" sequels. Paying close attention to those end credits may raise some questions that the after-the-end-credits stinger answers. This is one scene you need to stick around for after everybody else has left. Whatever the case, ""Kong: Skull Island"" deviates from previous Kongs (maybe not the 1962 Toho Studio release ""King Kong Vs. Godzilla""), and the relationships among the humans and their interactions with Kong have been changed with the introduction of entirely different characters. Altogether, these changes in ""Kong: Skull Island"" create an interesting variation on the parable of this prodigious primate. Clocking in at 120 minutes with larger-than-life action galore, ""Kong: Skull Island"" does one thing better than its predecessors. Namely, the humans are more interesting and compelling than the beasts. Actor John C. Reilly virtually steals the show as a supporting character. Second, the filmmakers have dreamed up a premise that makes the setting justifiable rather than capricious. <br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" unfolds during World War II as an Allied aviator, Lieutenant Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly of ""Step Brothers""), bails out of his flaming P-51 fighter. No sooner has Marlow landed safely than the Japanese pilot, Gunpei Ikari (Japanese singer-songwriter Miyavi), who shot him down endures a similar fate. Marlow empties his .45 automatic pistol at his adversary, but he misses with all shots. The Nipponese pilot cannot shoot with any greater accuracy, so it boils down to Marlow dodging his enemy who discards his firearm and wields his Kantana sword. Locked into a life and death struggle, Marlow and his foe get the surprise of their lives when a skyscraper-sized gorilla interrupts their hand-to-hand fight. Afterward, the action shifts to 1975 and the twilight of the Vietnam War, as President Richard M. Nixon announces that America is calling it quits in Southeast Asia. Meantime, an enigmatic figure from the scientific Monarch agency, William 'Bill' Randa (John Goodman of ""10 Cloverfield Lane""), persuades reluctant Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins of ""Jack Reacher"") to let him piggy-back on a government mission to explore an anonymous island recently spotted by satellites. Willis agrees, but only because the Soviets have not obtained similar satellite images. <br/><br/>Randa has acquired a dubious reputation because he witnessed a monster attack a U.S. Navy vessel and kill everybody aboard except himself. Since this incident, everybody has labeled him a crackpot. Accompanying Randa to Vietnam is Yale geologist Huston Brooks (Corey Hawkins of ""Iron Man 3""), and they hire former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston of ""Thor"") who knows how to find soldiers lost in the jungle. Finally, Randa recruits U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Unbreakable"") and his Sky Devils helicopter assault squadron. Packard has the option of either going back to America or signing up for this mysterious mission. Incensed by Nixon's withdrawal from Vietnam, Packard accepts the mission because he wants to do something heroic before he leaves the hemisphere. Packard is Draconian to the max. He completes missions, and he leaves the enemy a sight worse than he found them, until he takes The Sky Devils to Skull Island. Lastly, another civilian, an attractive photo-journalist, Mason Weaver (Brie Larson of ""Trainwreck""), joins them at the last minute. Larson's character isn't as helpless as previous ""King Kong"" damsels. Unlike her predecessors, she doesn't form as memorable a relationship with Kong.<br/><br/>Treacherous weather conditions have concealed Skull Island from mankind since creation. Storms crackling with jagged lightning and impenetrable clouds besiege the island. Some civilians dispatched to the island balk at entering those ominous clouds. Colonel Packard refuses to allow anything as trifling as weather interfere with his objectives. The Sky Devils launch from a cargo ship. Momentarily, ""Kong: Skull Island"" pays tribute to the vintage Vietnam era film ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) as the choppers fly. Packard and company are not prepared for what they encounter after launching small bombs for seismic readings. Kong clashes with the Sky Devils in a sensational battle. The climactic scene in John Guillermin's ""King Kong"" (1976), when choppers surrounded Kong atop the World Trade Center in New York City, clearly inspired this fight. After Kong destroys all the choppers, our heroes find themselves afoot on an island teeming with savage predators. <br/><br/>Watching Tom Hiddleston play a conventional hero is a refreshing change. The way that various characters die reflects that wildlife that eats them. However, no death is too gruesome to observe. The MPAA has rated ""Skull Island"" as PG-13 for ""intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for brief strong language."""

However, if it's a coin toss between this and something you're certain to like, see the other movie.<br/><br/>The acting is good, the cinematography is good, the script is good, there's smashing and 'splosions and a little too much silliness for me.

"ferguson-6","7","1","4","25 March 2017"," creature feature
","Greetings again from the darkness. I enjoy creature movies. Even as a kid I enjoyed creature movies (as distinguished from monster movies, which I'm also fond of). From the classics to the (very) low budget ones on late night TV to the fear-mongering from Japan  I enjoy them all. Of course the most fascinating of the bunch is King Kong, and this version arrives 84 years after the still magnificent 1933 version from Merian C Cooper and featuring Fay Wray.<br/><br/>This time there is no shootout on The Empire State Building, and the connection between Kong and the girl is limited to a few knowing glances. Most of the film takes place on Kong's island  one he shares with some other creatures (not rodents) of unusual size. Unlike Spielberg in Jaws, who teased us for half the movie before finally revealing the shark, we get a glimpse of the imposing Kong very early on.<br/><br/>The cast is the best yet for a creature feature. John Goodman and Corey Hawkins play scientists/conspiracy theorists; Tom Hiddleston plays the world's only mercenary with perfect hair and skin; Brie Larson is a self-described anti-war photographer; while Samuel L Jackson, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann and Toby Kebbell play military men on their last mission at the end of the Vietnam War. The most colorful character is played by John C Riley – an eccentric WWII survivor who has been living on the island since 1944.<br/><br/>Jordan Vogt-Roberts directs this version, and his resume of The Kings of Summer and mostly TV work begs the question of how the heck did he get this gig? Fortunately he has cinematographer Larry Fong alongside, and his significant big action picture experience is obvious in the breath-taking helicopter scene (as well as many others). It's impossible not to notice the extreme love shown to Apocalypse Now and even Jurassic Park. Some of the shots and tone seem as if pulled directly from those films  even moreso than the original King Kong. We even get Samuel L Jackson recycling his ""hold onto your butts"" line.<br/><br/>There is plenty here to satisfy us lovers of creature features, though this version certainly lacks the emotional impact of Fay Wray and Naomi Watts connecting with Kong ... not much Beauty, but plenty of Beast. It's certainly recommended that you stay for the post-credits scene that sets the stage for 2020."
"Aly200","8","1","4","22 March 2017"," Finally an Original Kong Movie
","After all the remakes of the 1933 film, someone finally came along and made an original film about the king of giant apes. This Kong is even larger than before, but still intimidating and fierce as ever. He wants to defend his home and survive as the final survivor of his species.<br/><br/>As usual with government agencies in action films with giant monsters, they want to take a new species captive and study the specimen. Send out the ragtag group of explorers who are dispatched to track down the giant ape who knocks down their helicopter and traps the survivors of the crash on the titular island. Now it's up to the group of survivors to brave the elements of Skull Island and elude the massive Kong.<br/><br/>Leading the ragtag bunch are Samuel L. Jackson as military lieutenant Packard and Tom Hiddleston as tracking expert, James Conrad. Hiddleston portrays a disillusioned former military expert in his field who is willing to take on the job of finding Kong in order to make money. However as the film goes on, Conrad soon realizes what Kong's capture or demise will mean and switches sides to help keep the gargantuan ape safe from Packard's dark plots. In the role of Packard, Sam Jackson is the film's weaker link as he is more of a caricature of himself but wearing military camos. None of the actor's lines really stick out except for uttering a former line of his from another film classic that Jackson was involved in.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is impeccable from Brie Larson as level-headed antiwar photographer Mason Weaver who butts heads with Hiddleston's Conrad, ""24: Legacy""'s Corey Hawkins as nerdy consultant Houston Brooks, Jing Tian (from ""The Great Wall"") as a scientist in the search party (sadly she isn't fleshed out much), John Goodman as Randall, the government man who got the group to the island and as the film's comic relief is John C. Reilly as a stranded WWII pilot who warns the group of what their actions might cause.<br/><br/>The film's visuals are quite astounding particularly with the massive height of the titular ape. After having only a 25 foot tall Kong in Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of the 1933 ""King Kong"", Universal decided to go with an impressive height of 100 feet for this Kong. Actor Tobey Kebbel (who also has a role on-camera as a solider eventually killed by the giant ape)brings the giant ape to life via motion-capture and does an impressive feat. Lots of explosions are imminent throughout the film as helicopters are swatted away and blow up and explosives are set off. Still better handled than most Michael Bay action sequences of late.<br/><br/>Go see this film if you want an original Kong film and try to hit the IMAX if you can (I didn't go for IMAX to save time)."
"evantaylorgfc","7","1","4","22 March 2017"," An Entertaining, If Familiar, Ride
","This is my first IMDb review. Thought I should mention that.<br/><br/>Anyway, I recently saw Kong: Skull Island at the cinema, and in hindsight, I'm happy to say it was everything I expected. No better, but thankfully no worse.<br/><br/>I was a little apprehensive going into film, having seen some less than favourable reviews. The bulk of these reviews seemed to centre on how the characters were bland and poorly written, something that initially surprised me, mainly because of the huge talents involved. In regards to these complaints, I mostly agree. The characters aren't necessarily boring or uncompelling, they just don't go through any real arcs.<br/><br/>The main cast is led by Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, both of which have really broken onto the Hollywood scene in the last couple of years. Hiddleston's character, James Conrad, is a mass of bravado and charisma, something that seems fit for this sort of action movie, but wears thin fairly quickly. Larson is a little more tolerable, but again, her character, Mason Weaver, is only relatable because such a talented actress is portraying her. She's introduced as an anti-war photographer, and that's all she spends the film doing; taking photos.<br/><br/>The talent involved doesn't stop there either. The always entertaining Sam L. Jackson plays Preston Packard, a decorated Vietnam veteran who seems to relish war, and is probably the most interesting character in the film, purely because he builds a vendetta against the titular beast. Jackson is as watchable as ever, but has considerably less screen-time than I was expecting. The same can be said for John Goodman. As Bill Randa, a scientist working for Monarch, who's later revealed to have suspected Kong's existence all along, Randa fades into the background of most scenes, even to the extent where I actually forgot his character was still alive. However, he does suffer a pretty memorable, if premature, death scene, so there's that going for him.<br/><br/>The cast is rounded out by Corey Hawkins, Jing Tian and John Ortiz as Randa's fellow Monarch scientists, and Toby Kebbell, Jason Mitchell, Thomas Mann, Shea Whigham and Eugene Cordero as members of Packard's squad. Even Richard Jenkins has a cameo in the first five minutes. Then there's John C. Reilly, as Hank Marlow, a WWII fighter pilot who crashed on Skull Island in the 1940's and has been stuck there ever since. He brings his typical comedic timing to the film, even though a few lines of his aren't as funny as the writers clearly thought they were.<br/><br/>So to the plot; in 1973, Monarch receive satellite photos of an uncharted island in the South Pacific. So, spurred on by an apparent race with Russia to discover the island first, a ragtag team is assembled to explore the island. Kong shows up pretty quickly, and things predictably go awry.<br/><br/>I don't want to give a full rundown of the plot, so I'll try and skim through it pretty quickly. About two thirds of the cast die. Periodically, the group are attacked by 'Skull-Crawlers', giant, lizard-like creatures that are apparently responsible for the extinction of Kong's species. They're visually impressive, and creatively designed.<br/><br/>For a film that's rated PG-13 (12A in the UK), I'm sure it came close to pushing that rating. In terms of profanity, ""sh*t"" is uttered anywhere between 5 and 10 times, and I counted 2 and a half F-bombs (one from Reilly, one from Larson, Jackson is cut off midway through his seemingly customary ""Motherf*cker""). But it's the violence that really pushes this film. Not only is the opening Kong vs. Helicopter scene (probably the most impressive scene in the movie) extensive and full of PG-13 violence, but it continues from there on. Goodman's Randa is devoured by a Skull-Crawler, Ortiz' Victor Nieves is literally torn apart by a group of Pterodactyl-like creatures, and an unnamed soldier is impaled through the mouth by a giant spider. Kong also kills the final Skull-Crawler by literally putting his arm down the creatures throat and pulling it's innards out of it's mouth. Grim, I know.<br/><br/>Altogether, if I remember correctly, Hiddleston, Larson, Reilly, Hawkins, Tian, Mitchell, Mann and Reilly survive the ordeal.<br/><br/>However, I don't really believe any of this really hindered Skull Island. While some of the action scenes feel like they go on for a little too long, they're visually stunning, and Kong looks superb, far more monstrous that the Peter Jackson/Andy Serkis collaboration. The action is shot fantastically, although slow-motion feels a little over-used.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed Kong: Skull Island. It was everything I expected, but in a good way; It's not exactly an Oscar-worthy production (except maybe visual effects), but it was a fun thrill-ride and certainly worth your time if you're a fan of the genre. I see a big future for relatively unknown director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, who is probably sold a little bit short; the film is well directed, the faults ultimately fall upon the writers.<br/><br/>Pros: Stunning Visuals Talented Actors Just About Save Poorly Written Characters Sense of Humour Soundtrack Pacing<br/><br/>Cons: Poorly Written Characters Extensive Violence (not a problem for me, but probably is for others, considering this film is PG-13) Overly-Cliché Script"
"cschultz-2","7","1","4","22 March 2017"," A Good, Old-Fashioned Monster Movie
","""Kong: Skull Island"" reimagines the origins of the title creature, the enormous ape made famous in the legendary 1933 RKO Radio Pictures release ""King Kong""—the biggest classic monster of them all.<br/><br/>The new picture, a co-production of Legendary Entertainment and Tencent Pictures released by Warner Brothers, takes place not during the Depression or in the present day but in 1973, during the waning days of the Vietnam War: A crack US Army helicopter squadron is rerouted from their rotation stateside to accompany a government operative and his team of explorers to an mysteriously uncharted island in the South Pacific where, it is whispered, monsters still roam the earth.<br/><br/>From that point on, the plot becomes too complicated and convoluted to bear simple description, let alone belief. Suffice to say that ""Kong: Skull Island"" gives us a lot so swallow during its 118-minute running time, and does not withstand a great deal of scrutiny. Every time the picture slows down long enough to allow the viewer an opportunity to think, ""Hey, wait a minute"" another thunderous action sequence begins and the implausibility of the screenplay goes out the window. But credibility issues aside, the picture goes down fairly easily, thanks largely to an outstanding cast.<br/><br/>The commander of the Army helicopter squadron is played by the wonderful Samuel L. Jackson in the inimitable slow-burn, short-fused style familiar to fans of his appearances in the films of director Quentin Tarantino. Plainly Jackson is having the time of his life in his role, and his relish, enthusiasm, and plain enjoyment are infectious—the audience has just as much fun watching him as Jackson has playing the part.<br/><br/>The government operative responsible for diverting Jackson's squadron to the island is played in a subdued, thoughtful, and slightly unhinged and obsessive style by John Goodman. Although known primarily for his comic roles, Goodman provides a hint of tragedy to this picture: His character is revealed to have been the solitary survivor of the sinking of a US-owned vessel. The ship was presumed to have been the casualty of other, more natural forces. But Goodman eventually reveals the sinking was actually the result of an attack bywell, something big, and unseen on Earth for millions of years. Looking into his slightly unfocused eyes, we begin to believe him.<br/><br/>As a former British Special Forces officer turned mercenary and now working for Goodman as a tracker, Tom Hiddleston adds a note of clipped and efficient authority to the picture. Although Hiddleston gained wide public attention in his recurring role as the villainous Loki in the popular film adaptations of Marvel's ""Thor"" and ""Avengers"" line of comics, the actor has also gained critical recognition in pictures as diverse as Steven Spielberg's 2011 adaptation of the novel and play ""War Horse"" and in Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris."" And as an anti-war photojournalist working to expose the Skull Island mission as a corrupt military operation, last year's Academy Award-winning actress Brie Larson contributes a little gravity to a role which might in other hands have become jokey or cartoonish. While Larson appears in most of the island scenes, her role contains relatively little dialogue. But the actress displays a laconic aura of single-minded competence in a surprisingly unglamorous role. This member of the expedition is decidedly not a damsel in distress—rather, she gives even the US Army members of the expedition a run for their money, with a few lessons in fortitude in the bargain.<br/><br/>The versatile and dependable character actor John C. Reilly is also on hand, as an agreeably loopy Army Air Corps pilot shot down in 1944 and stranded Robinson Crusoe-style on Skull Island for the past three decades. In a role originally intended for Michael Keaton, Reilly acts as a sort of tour guide for the others, introducing to the members of the exploration mission the various sights, customs, and monstrous inhabitants of the isolated island.<br/><br/>As noted, the ""oh, come on"" factor of ""Kong: Skull Island"" is high. The screenplay, credited to Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein, and Derek Connolly, seems to have been a result of marathon caffeine-fueled sessions with the writers trying to top each other in proposing outlandish notions and preposterous situations, an effort matched perfectly by Jordan Vogt-Roberts frenetic, let's-cover-our-tracks style of direction. But to be fair, the audience does not attend a movie such as ""Kong: Skull Island"" with an expectation of credibility.<br/><br/>Rather, a movie such as this succeeds of fails on its verisimilitude, its special effects. And in ""Kong: Skull Island"" those effects are impressive and sometimes breathtaking, if never exactly overwhelming or frightening. The scenes of Kong taking on his various opponents—from the gigantic subterranean Skullcrawlers, to vicious flying pterosaurs, to a squadron of US Army helicopters and loads of napalm—are alone worth the price of admission. And in close-up shots, with the giant ape roaring from the screen, the viewer is not only able to inspect the orthodonture of the monster, but also nearly feel his hot breath blowing in their faces, even without the aid of 3-D glasses.<br/><br/>In the original 1933 ""King Kong,"" the title beast was described as having a size of between forty and fifty feet. In this picture, the ape is considerably larger, in plain anticipation of Kong being matched in future sequels with various other familiar monsters. <br/><br/>To be honest, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is likely not going to win any major awards for acting, writing, or direction. Movie viewers in the mood for an artistic triumph or a cathartic emotional journey are advised to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>But if you're looking for a raucous good time, a place to scratch your itch for a good, old fashioned monster flick, or even in the mood for a visit with a treasured—and very, very large—old friend, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is the movie for you."

I wish they had more Kong but there are more monsters that are there when he isn't which was the problem with Godzilla not having enough action. I really couldn't stand John Goodman.

","A fun but forgettable film.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that is made to be seen on the big screen. Basically because it makes Kong feel like a towering monster!<br/><br/>But it has its issues. The movie lacks a good dialog. It could have used some catch-phrases to give it some appeal. And although the character development wasn't bad, it needed an identifiable main character.<br/><br/>The film, at times, also insults our intelligence. Basically, if a pilot sees a helicopter get swatted down by a huge monster, perhaps the other pilots would change course or retreat! Or at least be smart enough not to fly their choppers within arms' length of an unknown monster!<br/><br/>That being said... The concept was good and intriguing. The visual setting was a feast for the eyes. I felt the real physical landscapes blended with the CGI sets very well. This was done better than a lot of recently released action movies.<br/><br/>'Kong: Skull Island' isn't going to win any major awards. But it is fun to watch!"
"Rendanlovell","7","1","4","19 March 2017"," Stylish, fun, trashy, and immensely entertaining,
","It's official, we finally have a franchise centered entirely around giant monsters. The films in this monster verse include 'Godzilla', 'Pacific Rim', and now 'Kong'. I gotta say, going into this film I expected the worst. I expected it to be the typical Marvel-esque film where it tries a little bit too hard to make you like its characters and ends in an unnecessarily over the top action sequence between an underdeveloped villain. But I'm happy to report that this film is not like that, at all. What is interesting about these three monster movies is that they all feel incredibly unique to the filmmakers. They all have a distinct voice and style that no other ""franchise"" has. They are very much the director's film. Not the studios. <br/><br/>This is one of the weirdest, most horrifically violent PG-13 studio films I have seen in quite some time. It actually remained me a great deal of 'The Great Wall'. Except this film seems to have a slight sense of self-awareness. This actually shocked me. It almost makes fun of itself and the films that are like it. It has the typical character sacrifice scene near the end except he just gets whipped a mile away from the action and just dies. It's not heroic, he just dies for basically no reason. It's scenes like this that really make this film work. Characters say goofy lines right before getting smashed to pieces, there's tons of color, and the camera is constantly on the move.<br/><br/>In many ways, it feels like a Micheal Bay movie that is actually aware of itself. It knows how dumb it is and it plays it up to ludicrous degrees. I mean, a guy literally gets impaled by a giant ant for crying out loud. If you're taking this film seriously, you're doing it wrong. If you think this is just a typical action movie and aren't open to what is about to happen you'll probably hate this film.<br/><br/>Because it is that typical action movie we all expected. The characters are flat as boards and they don't really do much aside from being smashed to death. Not to mention it features a giant monster that punches other giant monsters in their stupid faces. So, if you aren't ready to accept the fact that this film is almost making fun of itself then you probably shouldn't see this. <br/><br/>However, if you want to see gigantic action set pieces and corny dialogue ripped straight out of the 1980's then boy do I have a movie for you. This is the first massive scale action movie in a long time that is just an action movie. It knows exactly what it is and it doesn't screw around with hardly anything else. It doesn't really bother setting up characters or anything like that. It shows us where all these people are in their lives and then it just goes.<br/><br/>Within twenty minutes King Kong is tearing apart helicopters and crushing people to death. And from then on, the film does not stop moving. It's actually so frantically paced that you really don't have time to think about the paper thin characters or lack of story. It just goes from one action sequence to the next in such haste that nothing else really matters. That being said I do have one major flaw that almost ruins the entire film.<br/><br/>The editing here is an absolute travesty. This film is so poorly edited that it's borderline incoherent. There are scenes that abruptly end and transition into a completely different area featuring the same characters. They will be in one place and without warning the film will cut to an entirely different location at an entirely different time of day but it stays with the same characters the whole time. The editing is so aggressive and rushed that even some of the action scenes move too quickly to get a sense for what is happening.<br/><br/>But, aside from that, this film is thoroughly enjoyable. There a few parts that drag just a bit and that editing is in complete disarray, but I loved this film. It's such a breath of fresh air in a genre over saturated by people wearing capes that we vaguely care about. What 'Kong' does better than so many of these other action movies is that it just is a movie. It doesn't blatantly attempt to set up a sequel or take itself more seriously than it needed too. It knows that it's dumb and it plays on that. It's goofy, overblown, and often times downright weird, yet that's why I love it."
"eagandersongil","7","1","4","19 March 2017"," A bigger monster to get away from the old clichÃ©
","A new remake for a classic, now getting away from the old but adorable clichÃ© of always, Kong takes a different approach from its predecessors, but that does not mean that it is better. We have a script that innovates within the franchise, because even without the ""King"" in the name, Kong is king of an island and fight against Cajus - no dinosaurs this time - the script innovates and at the same time we all know their endings, The film tells the story of researcher Bill Randa (John Goodman), who in 1973 departed to explore an island that until then is isolated and unknown to the rest of the world. We have a very digital photograph, the chroma key jumps, and Kong's scanning is not very perfectionistic, sometimes even to notice its pixelization, and we also have the old focus on the sun of the apocalypse now - After all, we have references to war Of Vietnam - references that are wide open in their soundtrack, with a good rock of the 70s, its assembly is good, its rhythm does not get to mesmerize but it pleases, and its direction of art desires, its camera angles are great , Focus on the eyes creating a Mexican stalemate between Kong and his ""Enemies"", to the best style - Guarding the due proportions - Sergio Leone. We have one of the best blockbuster films I've seen that goes from John Goofman to Brie Larson, to Samuel L. Jackson and Tom Hiddleston, but incredible as it may seem, this cast is completely expendable, John Reilly even does A good performance, and Samuel Jackson is the least worst as ever, Oscar winner Brie Larson seems to have no desire at all, but let's give a discount, fianl this movie is from Kong, the gorilla now bigger than normal goes well, Despite the regular quality of its effects, it punches, kicks, picks up trunk, judo punches and detonates Cajus, that is, plays its role. ""Kong"" is a film for the nostalgic of monsters or for those who want to enjoy a Sunday afternoon with the family, because it is fun and good to watch and not even that bad."

Jackson, present in the last period of time in all the films made on Planet Earth(which kinda annoys me...) plays a little better than usual (same histrionic). A piece of very precious advice: don't go to watch it in 3D, Kong might jump out of the screen and you may be very very frightened. But, that would be nothing.

It was a brutal movie about humans trying to escape a savage world of giant creatures in which they don't belong. The film had enough humour. It didn't overdo it and it wasn't trying to be too serious as some other monster movies. (Godzilla.) Overall Kong: Skull Island is a solid step forward for the MonsterVerse. I can't wait to see what comes next."
"ryanskywalker-87402","7","1","4","15 March 2017"," Kong is back!!!!
","There are very few things that I respect more than a movie that is unafraid to embrace its own stupidity. Kong: Skull Island has thinly written characters, extreme tonal dissonance, bad dialogue, and a complete and utter disregard for the talents of Oscar-winning actress Brie Larson, but it's absolutely glorious in its brazen spectacle. Its thin characters and tonal dissonance don't matter as much because it thoroughly commits to its premise, and it seems like the movie is one ridiculousâ€“but hilariousâ€“visual gag after another. The bad dialogue is all part of the fun. It's not trying to be something it's not, and that's something I appreciate in any movie, especially a nostalgia-laced B-movie blockbuster about a giant ape.<br/><br/>Some might draw connections to the time era explored or the interplay between man and nature, but the movie succeeds at its main goal: entertain the hell out of the audience. Actors like Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are (pretty) pieces of cardboard in this, but seasoned vets like Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly thoroughly understand what it is they're being asked to do. They both ham it up big time, with Vogt-Roberts's visual flourishes adding to their performances in beautiful ways throughout. They both give pitch perfect performances that are 100% appropriate for their roles, and Reilly in particular becomes the heart and soul of the story. As an actor, the best response to a movie like this is to embrace the ridiculous, and Jackson and Reilly certainly do.<br/><br/>However, the ridiculous can sometimes move aside to reveal a visually stunning movie with a large heart. The production design is gorgeous, and the classic shotâ€“a character whose back is turned to us, staring up in awe and fear at Kongâ€“is breathtaking. The movie itself has that type of reaction to its own character, to its own force of nature, looking up in wonder and childish glee as Kong destroys another piece of its surroundings. This is big, bold, and confident filmmaking, precisely because the movie understands what it's not."

One thing that added a lot to the overall vibe of the film is that it was in a post Vietnam war setting. It added a lot to the entertainment and set a good tone, it wouldn't have been as good as it is without the time period it's set in. The best part of this movie is easily the end credits scene.<br/><br/>Here's the bad.<br/><br/>The story isn't all that great. I understand that this movie is just trying to be fun, which is perfectly okay, but if you're going to do that you can't take yourself too seriously, and this movie did that. There were a few cheesy parts but they weren't that bad. A few jokes didn't hit with the audience and weren't that funny. The ending of the movie falls flat. The payoff wasn't all that great and happened fairly fast.<br/><br/>There was one character that I think took away from the overall quality of the film. John C. Reilly's character wasn't all that great. He overacted for most of the movie and acted like a cartoon. Only some of his jokes hit with the audience.<br/><br/>Overall, Kong Skull Island is a good popcorn movie where you can turn off your brain for a while and watch a movie with some A+ cinematography and CGI. The characters have good chemistry with each other, even if some aren't all that great. It's good to see Kong back on the big screen."

We posed absolutely no threat to them, we were still using spears and shields at the supposed time. if they had given us a reason to why they disappeared the movie would have got a nine from me but they just missed out on this."

"nmn34","8","1","5","8 April 2017"," It Doesn't Put King Kong on a Pedestal
","The highest praise I can give this movie, it is not just a retelling of King Kong. I was introduced to the character with the 1933 original as a kid, watched it again with the 76 remake, and sat through the the 2005 Peter Jackson version. I will start fires if I have to watch another origin story in my lifetime. Instead, Skull Island is moving the series in an actual direction building up to the upcoming Godzilla crossover. And I would rate it a step up from the American Godzilla predecessor.<br/><br/>Visually the movie looks great. The monsters are fascinating to look at, the giant water buffalo are especially well done with the algae hanging from their horns and soulful eyes. The massive spider is more stylized with its gnashing claws and 'meaty' webbing but doesn't look hokey. And Kong himself is very detailed and quite expressive, its easy to see where the effects budget went and it was money well spent. But there is also artistry that went into presenting it. Scenes like Kong standing before the sunset, his silhouette blurred by the light, and his eyes piercing through the night mist as he draws close are more memorable than the actual action scenes. The only real complaint I have is the design of the skull crawlers themselves. Seeing all these interesting creatures, a two legged lizard is kind of a disappointment in comparison. They don't look like the credible threat they pose to Kong and the big, bad one looks too similar to the smaller jobbers to make it stand out.<br/><br/>Characters are pretty good at best to acceptable at worst, the best being Goodman's Bill Randa and John C Reily's Hank Marlow, but what they do with them is rather underwhelming. To cull the large cast, many o the cannon fodder characters are killed off pretty early but you kind of see how they all die in the first ten minutes. Either they are swallowed whole, stomped or otherwise crushed, or swatted into the distance, and rarely in new or creative ways. After seeing three people get stepped on, the impact is quickly lost. The key characters don't get much better treatment. The captain with the major insignia, swallowed. Bill, swallowed. Samuel Jackson, crushed by Kong. The soldier with an AK for reasons, he gets a little something different but its still pretty much him being swat into a cliff. His death is probably the most frustrating as it at first seems like it is going to have more significance. He is ready to sacrifice himself to kill the giant skull crawler but no, it turns out to be completely meaningless. I will give San some credit for surviving. When she was introduced without a single line of dialogue I was sure she was screwed.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad is pretty wooden and I started to play the action hero name game after a while when he was on screen. My best were Buff Hardchest, Quad Rockman, and Ron McMuscles, but while kind of boring and lifeless he wasn't the character that agitated me the most. That goes to Mason Weaver, the anti-war reporter. I found her character insufferable, the archetype non military character that challenges the system because she somehow knows better than everyone else. Of course she is right in the end which makes her even more obnoxious but some of her proposals are rather reprehensible. When the soldiers are trying to push westward against Hank's advice, they are doing so under the auspices of rescuing the stranded captain. Though the audience is already aware that he is dead, there is no way that any of them would be aware of this so by going against the system is tantamount to leaving a man behind. A man that has a child back home he was trying to get back to in time for their birthday. How none of the soldiers that they had shown to be close to him didn't punch her in the face for that I cannot imagine.<br/><br/>As a vehicle to set up an upcoming movie, I really liked this. It has some stupid decisions but they aren't as jarring as some movies. And I am thoroughly hyped for Godzilla vs Kong now. Its an interesting change of pace."

",""". . . The land where God did not finish creation . . . the place where myth and science meet."" Bill Randa (John Goodman)<br/><br/>In Kong: Skull Island, the real science is the creation by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and writers of a believable myth, gigantism run amok with a hundred-foot gorilla and other nasty, very large pre-historic monsters. By paying homage to 1933 filmmakers Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedack's Kong, this film shows myths can be reworked to maintain their original power while complementing the proceedings with new angles of vision.<br/><br/>Although Skull Island is a place of death as monsters battle for control, it still houses benign natives and visiting guests like tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). The dark side is Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), who not only represents the tunnel vision of present-day militarism but also the myth of the sexually powerful black man, a cultural companion to the imposing Kong.<br/><br/>However, this Kong has grown in sensitivity over 84 years: He protects the island's good denizens from the devils below and he respects the new blonde Fay Wray, Mason Weaver: ""People here used to live in fear, from everything. Then something strange happened: some of the monsters here started protecting them from the other monsters trying to kill them."" Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly). <br/><br/>This is a Kong to love more than fear. Gone is the threatening sexuality of the early Kong with his probing fingers; here is a monster more like a schoolboy seeing a beautiful teacher and protecting her.<br/><br/>Notable are this film's allusions to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (Conrad as last name of this hero and Marlow, Heart's narrator, and the last name of this WW II leftover Hank, played by Reilly with a wry detachment, a welcome antidote to almost everyone else's grave demeanor). The multiple shots of an over-sized sun and makeshift patrol boat leave no doubt of this film's debt to Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is a modern fable about our collaboration with nature and the menace of the military-industrial complex (consider the current budget proposal's lavish military spending). Beyond that, it's darn good story telling accompanied by state-of-the-art graphics to make the experience a marvel rather than a menace.<br/><br/>""Kong's a pretty good king. Keeps to himself, mostly. But you don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs, unless you're picking a fight."" Marlow"

","I will admit I was a little skeptical when I first heard about this movie. The whole franchise building thing hasn't worked out well for most studios and frankly the last Godzilla movie was a bit of a dud except for the final act.<br/><br/>So, I went to this movie with a little hope of it being any good. And when the movie started I was surprised!<br/><br/>I don't think most people will appreciate the human characters because we are not in the theatre to see them, and Tom Hiddleston's English accent is a little distracting. I also didn't know why a Oscar winning actress would want to play a character so thinly written. She is there just so there can be a girl among all the guys. She held her own though, with what she had been given.<br/><br/>But let just get to the good part, the hero of this movie is the cinematographer. The scale presented in this movie was outstanding. There is scene where Sam L Jackson is looking at Kong and the camera goes behind his head just to show the difference in scale and size. Each frame was brilliant, the helicopter shots were awesome, and the King fight scenes were better that that of Godzilla!<br/><br/>In the end, I had a lot of fun with this one...the movie was funny and commanding. The run time could have been shorter but King Kong beating the hell out of ""stuff"" made up for it!"
"augustvanderwerf","6","1","5","17 March 2017"," A fun, undeniably entertaining film, but with prominent problems
","I hadn't planned to see this until some friends invited me to go with them. After watching the movie, I still think that it's arguably skippable, but if you have plans to go, then by all means, go.<br/><br/>My biggest problem was the film's messily put together first act, which I disliked for virtually every reason possible. The cartoonish opening has two planes crashing on an unnamed island (wonder what its called?), the surviving pilots of which proceed to chase each other and engage in combat until they see a giant, furry hand, belonging to, well, you know. The problem here is that the movie expects us to not expect any of this, and to not know that they are on the titular island. I can already picture it on CinemaSins.<br/><br/>After showing us the title, the film cuts to D.C., where John Goodman's filmmaker is asking a senator to grant him a military escort to Skull Island, known for being the site of crashed planes, the pilots and passengers of which have so far never returned.<br/><br/>Every character is under the eye of a director (Jordan Vogt-Roberts) who has so many wannabe artsy shots that he doesn't seem to know what he's doing. The faults of the writer, the director, and the editor are best displayed in a scene where helicopters must pass through a hurricane, which they simply go through, with no exciting action; it is a scene so wasted that one wonders why it is even there.<br/><br/>Goodman is joined by a crew of characters, many of whom are underdeveloped. The ones we come to know the best are played by Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, and Brie Larson. Don't worry about the underdeveloped characters, though. The film has a high body count, composed almost entirely of underdeveloped characters, including the only one who is genuinely funny. You may be wondering if the film has a singular main protagonist. I'm still not entirely sure, and neither is the film. The camera keeps on switching from person to person after the crew is met by Kong, who, in this film's version of the original's famous plane scene, swats at the helicopters, prompting characters to switch from strictly expositional dialogue to dialogue that is just plain weird.<br/><br/>This sequence, filled with rapid match-cuts that make it hard to keep track of what is happening to who, is less engaging than one might expect, but the action that follows is good stuff.<br/><br/>The first sequence involving Kong is underwhelming, but none of the following sequences are. On the contrary, they are quite entertaining and impressive. The crew's encounter with what is called a Skullcrawler makes the creature seem unstoppable, and that's only a pawn for something far bigger, and far worse. It is epic seeing Kong fight the biggest of the Skullcrawlers, in the grand - and seemingly endless - climax. A big part of this is how the filmmakers decided to portray Kong, who comes to life under great CGI at a towering 100 feet. He is incredibly intimidating, and a worthy match for the rest of the island's creatures, which include giant spiders and a giant octopus. He's also on his hind feet, as opposed to being on all fours, like in Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong.<br/><br/>The thing I liked the most about Kong: Skull Island was Brie Larson's character, a pacifist photographer determined to expose the whole operation, believing it to be a secret military operation with dark motives. As limiting as that might sound, Larson makes it work, even if all her character mainly does is take photos. She's a strong female lead, and she's the lady that Kong has a sweet spot for; yet she's no damsel in distress. When the character is truly broken down, there's a lot more to her than meets the eye. I have to give it to the filmmakers on this one: the portrayal isn't at all sexist, and the only displays of affection is an embrace.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island certainly has its problems, aside from its awful beginning. Its devoid of major clichés, but it can't escape a few minor ones. It also has a few too many conveniences, and at times doesn't seem to know what's good for itself, but that's okay, because the movie is still a good time. Its more thoroughly entertaining than 2014's Godzilla, and also feels more satisfying overall. In fact, if it weren't so rough around the edges, it could have been a solid 8/10. For right now, though, its on the cusp of a 7/10, which isn't the worst place to be."

This time, Kong is king on Skull Island, an island full of giant Lizards, Spiders, Squids, and so much more. Kong is fighting the giant lizards called ""Skullcrawlers"" (Which is humorously named by John C. Reilly's character, because it sounds neat), which are trying to eat the people on the island and make the island their own, these Skullcrawlers are borderline terrifying, they are quick, agile, and have really really sharp teeth, just ask Toby Kebbell's character Chapman.<br/><br/>Kong himself is portrayed perfectly, with decreasing the amount of romance in the film (Which i liked a lot). The characters develop as the movie goes, but the story is just like any other Monster/Action Movie.<br/><br/>The Outstanding special effects and the horror of the island itself makes up for the so-so story in this movie.

"Robert_duder","7","1","5","16 March 2017"," The monster films of the new Millennium continue on the same path
","Set in the same Universe as 2014's Godzilla, it's really interesting to compare the two because they have almost the exact same faults as they do successes. I really wanted Kong: Skull Island to be a near perfectly crafted disaster/Monster film where they gave you characters with backstory that you cared about, a terrific story of survival and incredible special effects. I wanted this to be at least close to what Jurassic Park was. Kong: Skull Island is entertaining enough but it doesn't even deserve to call Jurassic Park a near relative. The concept is great, the special effects are good but the characters are downright drab. You have these fantastic actors with little to no backstory at all and such incredibly low personality. It leaves you feeling definitely empty.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston takes the lead and I was skeptical of that but he actually looks great and breaks the Loki mould and even his character had potential but again was written with such little pizazz. He's trying to be broody but without any back story, it comes across as very empty. Brie Larson is an Academy Award winning actress and this has to be one of the worst performances I've ever seen. The romance between her Hiddleston is ludicrous with no build up. She constantly looked confused and stares longingly at Hiddleston. It's really a bad performance for a poorly written character. John Goodman, an incredible actor, is given virtually nothing to work with. His character and performance reminded me so much of Bryan Cranston in Godzilla. He is underused and could have carried the film. The single saving grace is John C Reilly who at least gets a back story and has some personality. He might literally be the reason to watch this. He makes a bad script only slightly less bad. The chemistry with the cast isn't terrible but you never to experience any of it. Even Samuel L Jackson seems subdued by the low quality characters. <br/><br/>Are they really aiming for nothing more than CGI effects and the monster? Kong looks amazing although Peter Jackson's King Kong was astonishing. Jordan Vogt-Roberts has been plucked from virtual obscurity with only a handful of very indie type projects and now is handed this massive budget. All things considered, the direction and the cinematography isn't the problem here. The film could have been amazing. Instead it is entertaining enough and a decent popcorn flick but there is such little depth to anything. Gareth Edwards who directed Godzilla was fairly fresh faced too. I expect this monster fad will continue and look pretty but never meet the likes of similar epics in days gone by. 7/10"

The total 115min. are a bit short, some more minutes spend on character development would have been good. <br/><br/>All in all nothing new, but all really well made. Story line is rather fast, particular at the first half an hour. The acting as expected from the high level cast is very good, in particular from Sam Jackson and John C.Reily. Tom Hiddleston I found a bit bland, but might be according to the script, the rest of the ""dino food"" somewhere in between. The final showdown is pretty intense, naturally with the usual one or two exaggerations where people get somehow in the middle of the monster fights AND survive. Just grin and ignore it, doesn't spoil the fun. It is not Shakespere and doesn't want to be. <br/><br/>The CGI is mostly above par though Kong's silhouette looks a bit too much like a man. I prefer the Peter Jackson version of Kong. Jackson/Serkis also gave their Kong a bit more character making him more believable.<br/><br/>However, I'd prefer this movie slightly over the three hour ice-skating King Kong version. Enjoy."
"RforFilm","7","1","5","15 March 2017"," It may not be as iconic as the 1933 classic, Kong Skull Island is a fun monster movie that has a roar
","It's safe to say that out of the many iconic moments in cinema (Dorothy discovering herself in a world of Technicolor in Wizard of Oz, Charles Foster Kane saying ""Rosebud"" before his death in Citizen Kane and the entire finale of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World), many people can recall the image of a giant gorilla attacking planes off of the Empire State Building in King Kong. Though it may sound like something out of a B movie, people tend to forget that King Kong was once the true king of the world with some of the most impressive special effects of the time. I highly recommend the documentaries about the making of the 1933 film.<br/><br/>Aside from a couple of sequels and remakes in 1976 and 2005, there hasn't been more exploration of the world Kong lives in. Sure, we know he's a large ape, but the island that he called home had dinosaurs, giant spiders, and various monsters. That itself is a goldmine for more fantasy-like exploration. With the popularity of the American remake of Godzilla, it made sense that Warner Brothers would want to revive the eighth wonder of the world. The world is given more exploration in Kong: Skull Island.<br/><br/>In 1973, government scientist William Randa (played by John Goodman) gets approval to lead an expedition to an uncharted island that had been blocked by bad weather. He hires a military group in Saigon called the Sky Devils, a former Vietnam helicopter squadron led by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (played by Samuel L. Jackson) for escort. He also hires a former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (played by Tom Hiddleston) and photojournalist Mason Weaver (played by Brie Larson). All together in a helicopter convey, they make it through the island, but are quickly brought down by a gorilla standing over a hundred feet.<br/><br/>The survivors are split into two group with both planning on heading north to the rendezvous point where there only hope for rescue is in three days. While Randa, Packard, and some of the solders start searching for fellow crew, Conrad, Weaver and the rest of the survivors are found by a tribe of Iwi natives, but are assured by a WWII pilot whose been stuck there for thirty years Hank Marlow (played by John C. Reilly) that they are friendly. It's discovered that Kong is worshiped as a god to protect them from the larger lizard creatures on the island. Along with those, giant spiders, and King Kong himself, its race against time to see who can make it.<br/><br/>For a spin off about King Kong, my expectations were low. The good news is that Kong: Skull Island happens to be good monster movie. Good, but not great. Half of that has to do with the casting. While John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson have a lot of good scenes (including a subtle Jurassic Park reference), neither Tom Hiddleston nor Brie Larson are that interesting. Both actors are trying, but the script simply makes their characters empty shells of leading men and women. But lets face it, the real star of the movie happens to be Kong. Unlike Godzilla, which took a lot of time away from the monster, here we get more of the giant ape and him fighting the various creatures of Skull Island. I love his design and of how more animalistic his personality is, even more so then the 2005 remake.<br/><br/>Though the characters aren't strong, what makes up for it is the atmosphere and tome. It's clear that a lot of influence was taken from Apocalypse Now, Jurassic Park and of course King Kong. It all meshes into a beautiful looking picture that fits right alongside the multiple Vietnam war movies. I'm not sure who was responsible for the cinematography, but they deserve a lot of accolades.<br/><br/>I'll give this seven Kongs out of ten. While I can't see thing alongside the original King Kong in a state of icon-like phrase, it's a fun popcorn monster movie. It gives you what you want fast and manages to keep the tone going. I have to give this a lot of credit for running under two hours. With a lot of blockbusters going well over that, it's nice to see a movie that knows how long it needs to be. As long as you can accept this a blockbuster, then I'm sure you'll have some fun. Get to the theaters and see if this roars some excitement into you."

Furthermore, the film strikes the audience with a dynamic perspective of the antagonist/protagonist role, both switching back and forth between the characters. The only discrepancy -- In my opinion, the film was overcast; there were too many characters (in the beginning) which disappoint an entertained audience with urges to see character development. For the ones you do get to know, John C.

Jackson) and his soldiers, including Chapman (Tony Kebble), Mills (Jason Mitchell), Slivko (Thomas Mann), and Cole (Shea Whigham), who take to the sky to penetrate Skull Island's storm defense. Entering the wondrous area, the outsiders are immediately confronted by Kong, a monster ape who doesn't take kindly to strangers bombing his area, making a mess out of Packard's men, separating them in the process. As teams of survivors assess their situation, they encounter the strange inhabitants of Skull Island, including Marlow (John C. Reilly), a stranded WWII soldier thrilled to see Americans again, and vicious subterranean beasts waiting for their chance to kill Kong and claim the island. <br/><br/>Nothing tops the first act of ""Kong: Skull Island."" Vogt-Roberts has a defined vision for his take on monster madness, dialing back the clock to 1973, entering into an era stained by the Vietnam War, with the military machine just beginning the process of winding down. Most of the soldiers are anticipating a return home, eager to get out of combat and restart their lives in America, but there's a final, last-minute mission that needs attention. It's Randa who inspires the trip to Skull Island, manufacturing a geological survey to help secure funding and manpower, finally receiving a chance to step foot on the seemingly forbidden land. Vogt-Roberts energetically builds a team atmosphere in the early going, economically handling characterization and maintaining style (rich, colorful cinematography is provided by the mighty Larry Fong), generating a men-on-a-mission vibe that's goosed by classic rock cuts on the soundtrack and an almost nostalgic view of military procedure, detailing the assembly of helicopters, cynical men, and heavy weaponry.<br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" doesn't waste time meeting the titular threat (he shows up in brief prologue that establishes Marlow's residency on the island), but the great ape really jumps into the fray 30 minutes into the movie, welcoming the invading choppers in battle mode, crunching metal and feasting on Army men. Chaos erupts, but Vogt-Roberts keeps everything clear and intense, allowing the audience to study Kong's defensive measures while the screenplay separates the characters into different groups spread out over the island, giving the effort a little more variation when it comes time to tour the alien land. While ""Kong: Skull Island"" has several subplots to juggle, the most defined is Packard's lust for revenge, taking the loss of life personally, transforming the depressed leader into an Ahab-like hunter who takes on greater danger just for the opportunity to kill Kong. <br/><br/>Marlow eventually re-enters the story, introducing a native civilization the picture does surprisingly little with, and ""Kong: Skull Island"" settles down, becoming more of an episodic event movie, with the intruders getting a full taste of life on the strange land, which is populated with giant everything, including spiders, water buffalo, and an octopus. Threats are external and internal, but the film slackens some as it rolls to a third act battle, requiring a slightly tighter edit as character bits become superfluous and suspense weakens due to action overkill. It's understandable that Vogt-Roberts doesn't want to leave ""Kong: Skull Island"" without a full sense of accomplishment, but as the feature works through a two hour run time, storytelling efficiency becomes more prized than another extreme close- up of Kong roaring and beating his chest. <br/><br/>It remains to be seen where the MonsterVerse will end up, but ""Kong: Skull Island"" is a fine addition to the newfound franchise as a big screen force of nature. It's entertaining escapism with a giddy appreciation for creature violence and thickly sliced human motivation, delivering an idiosyncratic King Kong extravaganza that's different in many ways, while still exploiting traditional monster mayhem."

","Finally, after being disappointed by film after film after film after film this year we have the only film other than Hidden Figures that has lived up to my expectations. Kong: Skull Island is easily the best film about Kong since the original. The story takes place in 1973 as the Vietnam War is coming to an end which, in my opinion, sets a great atmosphere for what is about to come. The backstory feels a little rushed, especially for a two hour film, but that means we don't have to wait very long for the main character to make his appearance. There are many elements and story lines which mirror the original story while still telling a new one. Visual effects are wonderful, as is the soundtrack. Kong: Skull Island is definitely worth seeing, and even more so if you have the opportunity to see it in IMAX 3D. P.S. Don't forget to stay for the added scene after the final credits."

"francescobrosolo","1","1","6","20 September 2017"," Kong the Otaku King
","Skull Island is basically what you get when you pick an amateur director who is a fanboy of anime and give him free rein over an established American legend. Everything from the look of the monster to the (absent) characterizations of the characters scream ""anime fanboy"". Too bad Kong is an American legend. And it's not a matter of patriotism, I'm not American. The matter is that there is nothing about this movie that screams ""King Kong"".<br/><br/>Now let's take a look at his many problems. 1) the characters are so wooden and uninteresting that I can't remember the name of any of them except for Hiddleston's because it is a famous name (not because I liked the character). 2) Speaking of Hiddleston, he is completely miscast in the role of the average American action hero. There's a reason he was cast as Loki instead of Thor, don't you think? Samuel L. Jackson is basically playing his soldier character that we saw him playing in so many many movies except a lot better (for example Basic or Rules of Engangement). The blonde woman, the black idiot (because he's playing an idiotic character) and the Chinese woman are forcefully put in highlight because.. SJW. And John Goodman, one of the greatest actors still around, plays such a useless character that you'd get to ask why the hell they'd cast him. 3) The title character Kong is basically built up to fight Godzilla. Actually the whole movie is basically built up to lead to a Godzilla/Kong fighting movie. Which is a problem per se since a movie should have his own reasons to exist and being awesome instead of just serving as an excuse to make another. This Kong is supposed to be the biggest Kong ever seen, but his greatness is only so so. He is defeated easily by the army and need the humans help to save his butt. Then when fighting the lead bad guy.. he need humans help again! Sorry, Peter Jackson King Kong did not be to 100 feets tall to kick three dinosaurs assess at once and being totally bad ass. 4) The fighting scenes are nothing compared to his predecessor. Plus if you have seen the trailers, you basically already saw the whole fighting scenes. All of them. 5) The director pushed the premise that you actually see a lot of the monster in this movie. And how much screen time Kong actually get? 9 minutes. No kidding. 6) Instead of the iconic dinosaurs, we get a cliché giant spider, a monster who I can't even know how to define (he's basically a living tree trunk with legs..), some bad copies of Peter Jackson's Terapusmordaxs but much smaller and easier to kill, a giant squid (because the director is an anime fanboy remember?) and the lead bad guys are... basically serpents with skinless heads and arms bigger than the rest of their bodies. That's right: humongous beasts came out from an anime instead of the legendary dinosaurs Kong is used to. But hey that's what you get when you watch too many anime. Kong itself is ugly: he doesn't even look like a gorilla. Make him bipedal made him look even faker. The natives too looks like a bunch of punk hippies. 7) They made Kong 100 feets tall who is a dwarf compared to Godzilla. But since this Kong is supposed to fight Godzilla one day then he has to grow up.. how? They said he's still only a teenage.. and here comes a big plot hole. The movie states that Kong's kind has been wiped out by the serpentine monsters. Who are exterminated in this very movie by the teenage Kong. But if the monsters succeed in wiping out Kong's parents that means that they weren't so bigger than their son. So even as an adult, how can Kong become big as Godzilla when his kind clearly wasn't?<br/><br/>Kong Skull Island is a useless spot commercial for a future King Kong vs Godzilla who has no reason to exist on his own. You want to watch a movie with a memorable plot? This movie has not. A movie with interesting, lovable or at least funny characters? Neither. A movie with a bad ass giant monster that kick ass in cool action scenes? There are a lot of movies that did it better than this."

The only thing that did change over time was the introduction of stupid characters that did increasingly stupid things.

As soon as they arrive, the giant ape shows up and we learn that the mini-gun mounted on the helicopter, which can turn an armoured vehicle into a pile of scrap metal in a second, can barely annoy the thing. We also learn that the pilots are mentally retarded. Whoever chose not to leave the theater at this point was in for even more nonsense and abysmally poor screen writing.

","Over the years there had been many attempts to bring the story of King Kong to the theaters and each time had been an epic failure, so after the trailers of Kong: Skull Island (2017); we had to go see it. The trailer for Kong had already shown a huge progress between this movie and every other King Kong related film and the cast for Kong: Skull Island (2017) was certainly an eye catcher.<br/><br/>Last night on the first viewing we were in our seats ready to enjoy the movie, it wasn't a big crowd. In reality probably 20 people in the theater. The lights went out and the film began and right off the start we were saying ""this looks to be really good"". The graphics, for the most part, are extremely good, there were only two or three spots that you could really see the film set and green screen hiccups. The script was well put together for the most part until about ⅔ of the way through as the film starts to lose steam. By mid-way through it many items were starting to stand out for example: If someone had just come out of the water completely soaked and two seconds later in the film, their hair and makeup had been redone and they're dry. Items like that sort of started to show themselves more and more towards the ending as if the film was completely rushed to finish up.<br/><br/>Now, in short, this film is very entertaining and it is marketed towards the right audience and age group, I'm certain that area will miss a lot of the items I pointed out. We did have a wonderful time watching the film, and it is the best King Kong made film to date. The graphics are as good, if not better than Michaels Bay's ""Ninja Turtles"". Would we see it again? Yes."

","A King Kong theme can never go wrong. However, despite the visual effects - I saw it in 3-D - I never really engaged with any of the characters, apart from the Richard Attenborough-style mad doctor.<br/><br/>It is a familiar pattern of one action scene after another. Whilst this may enthrall young audiences, I actually found it quite boring and over-long.<br/><br/>In all, it was King Kong - meets Jurassic Park - meets Hacksaw Ridge - meets Any Film With Peculiar Beasts.<br/><br/>I scored it seven as I LOVE King Kong, and the concept of a primitive olde-worlde island covered in the skulls of prehistoric monsters appeals to me greatly. The primitive tribe is an excellent example of costume and makeup. The beautiful Japanese girl should have had more of a leading role than having to play support to the tired female-in-distress wearing the skimpiest clothing in the lookalike style of Laura Dern.<br/><br/>It's a rehash of all the Kong films you ever saw.

","Kong: Skull Island is a thoroughly entertaining picture that will have you completely engaged throughout. Most Hollywood blockbusters at the moment can feel quite mindless; however this film is visually stunning and has quite a thought provoking message at its core. <br/><br/>The film stars big names such as Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly and John Goodman. The film actually follows quite a few main characters but the film never gets over crowded. Everyone in the film does a spectacular job. I personally really enjoyed John C. Reilly's portrayal of his character and how his personal storyline progressed. <br/><br/>The cinematography is truly beautiful in this film. The effects of the film are also very realistic and make the film very visually engaging. The helicopter sequence at the beginning of the film is a good example of this. <br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a really good film that brings back the feel of the old adventure films of the past. Jordan Vogt-Roberts has done a brilliant job directing a light-hearted, yet still realistic action- packed film. The film's music is also very well chosen and helps to create an atmosphere.

","Hollywood decides to reboot KING KONG ? Didn't they do that about ten years ago with very overlong mediocre results ? In other words it's not really a film I had any interest in seeing . That said my mind was quickly changed by the very good word of mouth , especially with all the references made to APOCALYPSE NOW and other 'Nam war films so gave it a chance <br/><br/>I certainly wasn't disappointed with these references . In fact my one criticism of the early part of the movie is just how overdone the references are and you can't fail to notice them and the Doors soundtrack is conspicuous by its absence . Subtlety isn't a strength of this Hollywood blockbuster <br/><br/>Where the strength lies is just how enjoyable it is as an action blockbuster full of explosions , gunfire and stunts . You remember in the Peter Jackson remake where the only good bit is the characters get attacked by assorted creepy crawlers in the gorge ? Well here director Jordan Vogt Roberts takes a leaf out of the highlight of the Jackson version and gives the audience what they're anticipating - a high body count featuring gory deaths . I was personally surprised by just how gory some of the deaths were in a 12 cert film and the screenplay isn't afraid to kill off characters <br/><br/>If there's a downside to all this then it's down to the fact that no film can really compare to the 1933 original which perhaps still remains the greatest monster movie of all time , even after all these long decades .

"schroederagustavo","5","0","3","3 May 2020"," A generic Vietnam movie featuring King Kong
","This is not a terrible movie, by any stretch of the imagination, I think it has some really good special effects and the actors seem to be trying their best to make this a good movie. However, it's not that either. Kong: Skull Island strives to be mindless entertainment, but for the most part, the movie isn't even that fun or entertaining, for that matter. It feels like a movie made by people who wanted to make a Vietnam film and have seen many Vietnam films, and so they had these check boxes with elements that these films have. You all know them: CCR (and other music from the time), helicopters, shots of these helicopters against the sun, soldier banter, the jungle, etc. I understand what they were going for and if the aim was to check these boxes, then they succeeded, but all of the elements feel like they were put in there to try and achieve this feeling that Vietnam movies have while being a movie that's easy to digest, but it just fails pretty miserably. I think they were going for a similar to Tropic Thunder, which is an example of a lighthearted Vietnam movie that actually works. All of the same elements that I just mentioned are there, but the execution is infinitely better in that film. For a lot of the movie I was simply bored, because it was very predictable throughout and not very well executed, in my opinion. I was also not a fan of the color palette they used, I'm not sure what to call it, but everything is very bright and colorful and it contrasts so much with the idea that this is kind of technically made like a war movie and I think they messed with the colors so that it automatically feels more ""light-hearted"", but it just didn't work. And also, Kong isn't really in the movie that much, so that was disappointing. Oh, John C. Reilly is also in the film. I usually like him in movies and I like him as an actor in this film, but I felt his dialogue was just very poorly written jokes that didn't work at all for me. Then Tom Hiddleston's character is set up to be this badass soldier assassin or whatever, but he does pretty much zero in the movie except for a single scene that isn't really that impressive or anything.<br/><br/>In general, I didn't particularly enjoy this one, except for the final fight, the special effects and a few other things here and there. I think the final fight between Kong and the lizard monster was pretty sweet, I kind of hope there was more of that in the film. And Brie Larson runs around in a dirty, sweaty tanktop for about half of the movie, so there's that. But in general, the comedy failed for me, as well as almost everything else they attempted. It fails as a comedy, as an action movie, as a Kong movie and also as a Vietnam movie. And maybe it's because they tried to do all of those things at once and maybe they don't mix well. Or perhaps it's that the filmmakers were too incompetent. I'm not exactly sure what it was, but one thing is for sure, I would not recommend this movie."

","Following the conclusion of the Vietnam War, Kong: Skull Island follows a team of scientists and soldiers as they explore an uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean, only to discover that they have stumbled across an island filled with monsters, weather storms, and other dangers. Washed up monster hunters Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) assemble a team consisting of former Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to guide the expedition; a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) ; and the awarded journalist and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). The group becomes separated as their helicopters are destroyed by a massive ape they later learn to call ""Kong"", and as they are separated each group is forced to survive against a myriad of other equally terrifying and exotic beasts.
As you can already tell this film is stuffed with award winning, big name actors. Tom Hiddleston stars as the movie's lead: James Conrad, the man leading the party on Skull Island. Sam L. Jackson plays a hell bent war general who wants nothing more than to kill Kong, even if it means his men not making it to the pick up zone on time. Brie Larson and John Goodman both do a good job porting their characters, and do the best with what the are given, but are evident left with shallow characters. One of the most surprising actors in the film was John C. Reilly, who shows up roughly halfway through the film as an old American pilot who crashed here during WW2. While all of these actors did exceptionally well, the real show stealers were the troops. Although they didn't have as many moments or lines as the others, I always enjoyed the film most when they were on screen. Their performances were really convincing on showing how close you grow with your brothers wile stationed together during wars, and how brutal it can be to watched them killed.
Probably the most entertaining part of the film, is how Vogt-Roberts nails the monsters. The level of scale, fear, imagination and action he is almost constantly delivering is impeccable. The fights with Kong are always shot in a wide, sweeping shot that turns around him and holds on for long. Those are absolutely incredible, they are sophisticated, beautiful shots to which sounds adds a real savage nature and together bring a real enthusiasm for the audience to the fights. Moreover, the various other monsters from the island are all interesting creatures and all feel part of the island.
Furthermore, Vogt-Roberts shows off quite a drive in his first act. The journey to the island is riveting and build with constantly good editing and witty cinematography choices that always keep us oriented in what's going on. The full blown action sequences are amazing, really absolutely stunning. He places the camera in the most interesting places and it throws us into the world and the size of Kong. The score is dead on with every scene and never felt out of place, which is a very easy problem to notice in a lot of recent films. The cinematography is some of my favorite, where loud actions scenes would suddenly be cut quiet and replaced with nothing but the sound of a gun reloading. While this movie wasn't up for any oscars, I think it easily could've won sound mixing and/or editing. While the movie is hits a slow patch part way through the second act, but is quickly resurrected at the end as the movie reaches its climax.
Kong: Skull Island sticks out from the other Kong movies. I see it as less of a Kong movie and more so a King Kong meets Jurassic Park meets Saving Private Ryan film. I don't think I have ever left a theater so pleasantly surprised by a movie. Arguably the most underrated film of 2017, I am giving Kong: Skull Island a 7.5/10."

","So apparently they're working on a MonsterVerse, inspired by MCU no doubt, and this is the second installment after 2014's Godzilla. While Kong: Skull Island is eons away from even being on the same level as the weakest of the MCU titles (I'm looking at you The Incredible Hulk), they're faring much better compared to the planned Dark Universe featuring monsters of the smaller kind such as vampires, werewolves and the lot. Depending on who you ask, the first movie is either 2014's Dracula Untold or 2017's The Mummy, both received negative reviews and the latter considered as a box-office dud.<br/><br/>Given that perspective, bear with me as I try to save this 8th movie from the King Kong franchise so we can look forward to 2020's Godzilla vs. King Kong movie. I do remember having seen a Kong movie as a kid, and I'm assuming that it's 1986's King Kong Lives. I may or may have not seen Peter Jackson's King Kong in 2005 but I'll be sure to remember having seen this version years from now. Not that it's a testament to the movie's quality, but more of because I want to give their planned multiverse a chance.<br/><br/>Starring Loki, Nick Fury and Captain Marvel, I mean Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson, along with other heavily armed men, they set out for an island that had a way of keeping itself away from the world's prying eyes, and they start bombing it even before they landed and as expected all hell breaks loose when they face a young Kong and puts them in their place early on. But humans being the idiots that we are, goes after it even as they're told Kong is protecting them from other monsters lurking within the island. With natural selection taking its course (thankfully), the heroes live to see another day until they go on to their next expedition.<br/><br/>Almost everything in the movie was done by the numbers. I tried to guess what was gonna happen next, especially at the beginning and I got most of it correct. Cue the handsome lead playing pool in a bar. Cue the rock music. Cue the ride into sunset shot. Cue the guitar riffs. Cue the suspicious female lead. Cue Samuel L. Jackson spouting out expletives. While it's predictability was annoying (I can still tell the difference between an homage and lazy writing so don't @ me), there were some really cool shots, one being the close-up of Samuel L. Jackson's eyes then fading into Kong's. The fight scenes and effects were believable enough to keep you on the edge of your seats and the island itself and it's mystery is akin to when we first stepped inside Jurassic Park. Also of note is the director's vision on how to differentiate his Kong from the others before it: it's still in its adolescent years and was left to fend for itself surrounded by the creatures that killed it's parents shortly after it was born. Making something mysterious relatable and accessible was a brilliant move and should bode well for the franchise as we head on to the next installments about beasts we only know we should be afraid of."

","Why would someone make another King Kong movie? Sometimes, it's better to make once or max twice of the same character's story and let it be. If you make more, it doesn't turn out to be a movie anymore. It clearly looks like a competition of who's story, graphics, actors are better and we end up wasting time and money.<br/><br/>The height of Kong, the way he walks make him look like a Bigfoot. Bigfoot(s) as the monster(s) on an unchartered Island would have made a better story. The graphics were more of the 90's. The storyline had so many goof ups that it was noticeable the very first time you see the movie. The 2005 King Kong movie, simply ""Wow"". IMDB agrees with me.

Kong is an impressive CGI creation, as are the mean chicken lizards he's constantly fighting.<br/><br/>A post-credits sequence hints at a sequel. Though this movie was moderately enjoyable, I'm not sure whether or not that counts more as a promise or a threat.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","Very entertaining popcorn flick. the action was really cool. it has it's flaws but this is just a mindless fun movie that kept me into it throughout. and they did one thing very right, Kong was awesome. straight BEAST<br/><br/>i didn't feel it as much the second time. wasn't that into it, and noticed the stupid and cheesy parts a lot more. dropped it from 3.5 to 3.0. i kept thinking about it for the next couple days and decided to drop it all the way to a 2.5. it just wasn't that good, even as a mindless movie (2 viewings)"

","The film starts in 1944, when two World War II air pilots both crash land on an island. They engage in close combat when they are interrupted by the appearance of King Kong.
It then goes to 1973. Two people (I've forgotten their names), who believe in the existance of monsters, are given permission to go to Skull Island to search for these monsters. The two people hire James Conrad, a tracker (Tom Hiddleston) and Mason Weaver, an anti-war photographer (Brie Larson), and then hire Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), with his men, to escort them to Skull Island.
None of the hired help knows what they're really going there for. They believe it is to test out seismic explosives to see if the earth really is hollow. Once on the island, they begin dropping the explosives, but that grabs the attention of King Kong. They are attacked and the survivors are all spread out over the island.
They now have to find each other and reach a rendezvous point where the group had arranged for some helicopters to take them away by a specific time. But King Kong isn't the only monster on the island.
My plot summary probably sucks, but that's as much as I can remember about the basic plot. It's an interesting story - and some of the creatures play a role in the climax. It was very exciting, and had some humour. The acting was very good as well - particularly on Jackson's and Larson's part. I got a kick out of John C. Reilly's role in it - trying to imagine him as Wreck-It Ralph from ""Wreck-It Ralph"". But Reilly was very good.
I enjoyed the momentary fight with Kong and Krakken - it was interesting. The visual effects were awesome - they blended in very well with the live-action. It was very scary and quite tense. There were plenty of thrills and bordered on horror a few times - particularly when one of the large reptiles retches up on of the character's skull. I still feel like throwing up when I think about it.
I also got a particular kick out of three of the MCU cast being in it.
Also, I really loved Jackson's performance (I know I've mentioned this above), though I hated the character and harbored no regret at his death, which was deeply satisfying for me. The climax was excellent!!! Very, very tense, and scary. The movie is a little bit thought-provoking (for me, anyway).
But, it has it's flaws. After they crash-land, the movie seemed to focus too much on some of the characters encountering several over-sized animals and insects and getting killed by them until all the survivors finally meet up and it detracts from the plot and experience quite a lot. It's only in the latter part once all the survivors reunite that the movie really begins to shine and we get to have the excellent, excellent climax. Other than some of the characters being killed off, the rest of the movie is pretty enjoyable and quite good.
I also really loved the scene where Reilly's character is reunited with his family. I was scared that the filmmakers would kill him off, so was relived that he survived.
Conclusion: skip it."

","Kong: Skull Island is my first encounter with a King Kong film and it has certainly exceeded my expectations. Not the most nuanced or interesting plot, but unlike the Godzilla film which is in the same universe, the film has much better character development, featuring characters we can associate and feel with. The more memorable scenes largely rely on CGI and the scale and battle sequences just doesn't get old. Perhaps most surprisingly about the film is the cinematography, the color of some of the scenes is simply beautiful. However, the very forced inclusion of Jing Tian to add a little Chinese flavour feels forced and very disappointing as it directly damages the artistic value of these works."

The people who still think Y is evil end up dying. The end. The reason I'm not giving this movie a 1/10 is because it did have its moments even though it's story was the blandest thing imaginable.

","Vietnam War is nearing its end and the US forces are slowly withdrawing from the Pacific. But then a satellite reveals an uncharted island, surrounded by eternal storms and hazardous waters. An island shaped like a skull.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island is just about what it needs to be. What I mean by that is that it is honest. It is a trashy B-flick straight from the pages of pulp magazines. It has it all, from Vietnam War filled with bloodhungry soldiers to giant apes to dinosaurs to a tribe of painted savages to primordial monsters. It has a jaunty soundtrack, some cool special effects, one-liners, gory deaths and enough action scenes to make your blood pressure shoot for the stratosphere.<br/><br/>And if you can go in with those kinds of expectations, it's exactly the film you're looking for. But if you go in looking for anything else, you'll end up leaving disappointed. Because while this film has some big names, from Samuel L. Jackson to Tom Hiddleston, it is not a well-acted film. Not at all. Sure Jackson and Hiddleston are probably two of the most entertaining performances, but even they cannot forge diamonds out of something like this. And they shouldn't need to.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the monsters. aside from Kong, have really lazy designs, the natives are just a bit cringy and there are perhaps one or two too many characters for the maximum effectiveness and screen-time.<br/><br/>Still, I did like it.

"thebookswasbetter","7","0","2","30 November 2018"," Kong: Skull Island - Pretty People Running from Scary Monsters
","Last week, I finally sat down to watch Kong: Skull Island - a two-hour ride with a lot of cool monsters and a lot of missed opportunities.<br/><br/>Screen Crush tells us that there have been seven King Kong movies (not counting the rip-offs), making Kong: Skull Island the eighth installment in the franchise. There are elements in this movie that are universal to all King Kong movies, but it still manages to stand on its own in this very diverse (at least quality-wise) franchise.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, Kong: Skull Island stars Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson. In supporting roles we see Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Riley, John Goodman, as well as many, many others.<br/><br/>In this re-telling of the King Kong story, the expedition to Skull Island is led by a government agent Bill Randa, played by John Goodman. The official objective is to prove the so-called Hollow Earth theory, but what Randa actually wants is to prove the existence of monsters that once ruled the Earth.<br/><br/>Randa, together with seismologist Houston Brooks and biologist San Lin, recruits an expert tracker James Conrad, played by the de-Lokified Tom Hiddleston.<br/><br/>Since this is a government operation, the team is escorted by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard, played by Sam Jackson who's giving a wonderfully over-the-top performance. Preston and his men are about to end their tour in Vietnam, but Preston is more than happy to go on one last mission, much to the rest of the soldiers' chagrin.<br/><br/>The last to join this ragtag team of lovable misfits is Brie Larson's anti-war photographer Mason Weaver. Just like Randa, Weaver keeps her true intentions to herself, as she believes this expedition to be a covert military operation, one she is set on exposing.<br/><br/>They arrive at Skull Island, marvelling at the untamed beauty of it, but when they drop the explosives to map out the island, the explosions attract King Kong himself. He kills most of the team, with survivors getting split in two groups, separated by square miles of hostile jungle, and now we have our movie.<br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island takes place in 1973. The decision to make this movie a period piece had to with the film's place in the Monster Universe that Legendary Pictures set up with 2014's Godzilla. Studio decisions aside, this could have been a thematic decision as well.<br/><br/>1973 is the end of an era; a time of great disillusionment in the US. The times are unstable; the general mood is one of war-weariness and disappointment, and our characters are supposed to reflect this collective state of mind.<br/><br/>Sam Jackson's character is by far the best one to capture this disillusionment. Jackson describes him as Ahab, and the similarities are everything but subtle. He is the Ahab of this movie, but his quest for revenge against Kong is very-well motivated. He is a soldier who's about to go home for good. His war is over, and he plunges into this new mission head-first, desperate to give his life meaning again. It's his own selfish desires that get his men killed. So, here you have a good conflict, a good way to drive an already unstable character off the deep end. He sees Kong as the enemy and treats the expedition as a military operation.<br/><br/>I wish the other members of this star-studded team were as fun to watch as Sam Jackson, which is a real bummer, considering the talent that has been jammed into this flick. The exception here is John C. Riley, who plays a soldier who's been stranded on Skull Island since WWII. He provides the comedy, and is an overall warm presence in this movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston is insanely attractive as the leading man, and Brie Larson is very beautiful. Their characters have potential, him as the disillusioned former military, and her as the war-weary photo-journalist. I say potential, because initially, their characters were supposed to have more meat on them.<br/><br/>For instance, Dan Gilroy, who was one of the screenwriters, wanted Larson's character to be more jaded so that her ""emotional awakening"" after meeting Kong would be a bigger deal. Instead, she starts off as a righteous anti-war journalist determined to expose the government, and she stays that way until the end. Her emotional connection to Kong doesn't change anything, it just makes her motivation stronger.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that there was potential here to go deeper, to have the characters undergo some fundamental changes, but even with the cast as talented as this one, Kong: Skull Island still ends up being a movie about pretty people running from scary monsters.<br/><br/>Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's a monster flick - its first priority is to be entertaining. Okay, its first priority is to make money at the box office, which it did, so everyone's a winner.<br/><br/>Watching Kong: Skull Island made me think about how little monster movies have changed since 1933 brought us the original King Kong. They have become increasingly more progressive (read: politically correct), and we can't even compare production values and visual effects (though, the '33 Kong still looks pretty dope), but even eighty years later, the core of these movies remains the same: here's a beautiful breeding pair; here are some scary monsters. Now watch them run around for a couple of hours. Why try to change something that works, right?<br/><br/>Still, I wish Kong: Skull Island had been more than just an enjoyable treat. Like I said, the potential was there. Take San Lin, played by actress Jing Tian, for instance. Initially, she was going to have more screen-time and be a - how should I put it? - a real person. I don't know who's idea it was to cut her role down to just a couple of lines of dialogue, but it's this kind of decisions that make the difference between a great movie and a movie that's just entertaining.<br/><br/>John Gatins, writer of the second draft of the script cited Apocalypse Now as a major inspiration for Kong: Skull Island, and it shows. This movie borrows heavily not just from Apocalypse Now but from other war movies, like Platoon, so much so that at times Kong: Skull Island looks more like a war movie than an adventure movie.<br/><br/>But the main parallel you can draw between this monster movie and the war movies it was inspired by is the general idea of the heroes venturing into the unknown land to smite the enemy only to realize that the situation is far more complicated.<br/><br/>Despite its many, many flaws, Kong: Skull Island is a very fun movie. It's a very kind-hearted movie with some very positive themes. There is an anti-war sentiment; but the movie also rests on a general idea that people are good. There is a nice scene at the indigenous people's village where Larson takes pictures of these people and bonds with them. It's supposed to be a growing moment for her character and maybe it's a little manipulative. Still, it's a warm little scene and the movie is better for it.<br/><br/>So, these were my two cents on Kong: Skull Island. I'm glad I watched this movie, but I'm also glad I didn't have to pay full price for it."

","Kong: Skull Island is another attempt from Warner Brothers to launch a shared-universe since their DC-Extended Universe has gotten a bit rusty outside Wonder Woman. Anyway, how does the universe with a monkey and a Japanese dinosaur compare to the DCEU, let alone Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe? Entertaining but not all that special either. There are war-movie cliches we've seen a dozen times before (helicopter imagery derived from Apocalypse Now) and disaster-movie tropes done in Jurassic Park (dumb characters not figuring out the obvious), and the same savage tribe from the other King Kong movies (although to be fair they do tone down the racism with them here).<br/><br/>Kong is still a money-magnet somewhat, but there seems to be a REAL strech to turn the King Kong canon into something like The Star Wars Expanded Universe or something. Hell, MARVEL was lucky in getting Iron Man to work on the big screen back in 2008. This shared universe thing is getting a bit tiring and these efforts seem half-assed and rushed in order to get in on an appealing craze without trying to tell a well-balanced story to get the audience in on at square one. Well, there might be more story to this franchise than Skull Island and its King, though I can't see all that much ahead of this movie just yet.<br/><br/>Skull Island gets 3/5 stars for me. Not a bad movie. Let it pass."

Even worse is that the party actually obeys! For what reason would scientists obey a government official if they have nothing to gain by doing so?

"jessicadraper-92504","3","0","4","12 May 2018"," Kong: Skull Island and Rampage--Too many damn dirty apes. And lizards.
","Weird synergy: in the span of 7 days, I watched not just one but two movies featuring giant apes battling giant reptiles. Kong: Skull Island (2017) and Rampage (2018). This commentary covers both, since they have a lot in common. Oh, and SPOILERS, so be warned. <br/><br/>Kong is King Kong set in the 1970s, right before satellites made ""finding"" a ""lost island"" pretty much impossible, and just in time to make Kong a proxy target so Samuel L. Jackson's crazy helicopter-flight commander can re-fight the Vietnam War (he gets the assignment right after the ""you're going home"" papers arrive for his squad) and win this time. With all the young-soldier casualties, bloody-minded irrationality, wrong-headed objectives, and eventual defeat that comes with it, of course. The rest of the movie stays at that level of imagination, too. The sacrificial-lamb soldier boys have just enough screen time and individual characteristics so that I recognize which one just got squished, speared, or chomped (of course, the one writing the letter home to his kid gets a fake-out save before dying horribly). The civilian researchers chant the appropriate scientific incantations intended to act as explanations, or possibly just a smoke screen to satisfy the undemanding who want to know why this is happening. John Goodman is totally wasted. The righteous, feminist war photographer is annoyingly righteous and lacks any sense of danger or caution; at least Kong doesn't pick her up while she screams in stereotypical style (that comes later, when Kong saves her when she falls off a cliff, and then somehow defeats the evil lizard monster by pulling its entire tongue and entrails out with the hand that's holding her, somehow not making reporter jam in the process). However, just couldn't make the movie without the soulful gaze between the giant ape and a white (of course) woman the relative size of a small mouse. Tom Hiddleston shows off his excellent cheekbones and high-class accent but tones down the sharp wit and settles for an Avenger-worthy scene with a katana and a bunch of horribly ugly flying bird-reptile-piranha things. John C. Reilly is the best part of the movie, having a grand time as a WWII pilot stranded on the island (among the weirdly painted, utterly silent natives), showing just the occasional flash of real menace amid the castaway-dementia chatter. The real stars, though, and the real point of the show, is ""Hey, look at the monsters we can create with computers these days!"" And they are impressive--the landscape, the giant creatures, the weather, the fire, all look realer than real. And, in the animals' case, dirtier and more vegetation- and fungus-covered. Regular gorillas and wildebeests don't have moss and mushrooms growing on them. Why would a giant one have a whole ecosystem in its fur? The big reptiles, basically snakes with shark teeth and two arm/legs, are ugly but disappointing; too alien-looking for a ""primeval"" island, and not coherent-looking enough to be interesting or believable as animals. Many fights, many fake-out deaths, and much roaring ensues. Kong saves the humans for no reason other than a crush on chicky-boo. John C. Reilly gets to come home to the wife who waited for him all that time and a grown son with bad sideburns. (Point for continuity and budget-savvy here--the same actor plays the son and the pilot as a young man. Extra budget bonus point for having dead-daddy soldier also act as motion-capture model for Kong, thus explaining his relative lack of scenes or spoken lines.) End credits. After-credit teaser: Godzilla! Mothra! Rodan! All real and coming to wreak havoc! If this movie makes enough money to justify remaking those movies. Again.<br/><br/>Rampage, on the other hand, is not a remake. It's a takeoff on a 1980s video game with giant, mutated monsters as the target/antagonists. The movie sets them up for unspecified modern day in a standard ""ruthless head of evil science corporation creates super-weapon serum to somehow make billions of dollars selling it to unspecified bad-guy governments or wealthy terrorists"" scenario from the first scene, with the corporate she-villain sacrificing a lovely lady scientist and an entire space station to a rampage-""infected"" lab rat. Yes, infected, though they never specify whether the green-mist-ooze leaking out of the cryo-capsules turned meteorites is chemical or biological; they chant CRISPR like a Word of Power, but don't really seem to know how DNA works. Or that it couldn't grow an ape, wolf, and alligator to King Kong size in a day or two. Or give them illogical, magical, chimera-like powers: Alligators can climb skyscrapers! Gorillas can regenerate any wound but grizzly-bear scratches! And, as Dwayne Johnson says, ""Of course the wolf can fly."" Glide, really, though why somebody thought it would be a good idea to mix flying-squirrel DNA in with all the other porcupine, armadillo, and Godzilla genes is as good a question as why the evil corporation doesn't have a better way to control the rampaged-out animals besides tiny vials of ""antidote"" that ""reduce their aggression."" But back to Dwayne, who's the real reason we saw the show in the first place (specifically, Mom picked it for her birthday matinee). He's in serious mode here, with a few light moments between him and George (yeah, the ape, with a name-riff on the curious monkey) and their sign-language banter. Because of course the ape can sign. And of course Dwayne--or David Okoye, rather--likes animals better than people, due to bad experiences with poachers. He's also mostly bulletproof, incredibly strong (""That's a big arm there--don't fight it,"" he tells a soldier he's choking out), and stoically macho in an endearing way. Which is why you get him to star in the show. The unspecified-agency ""cowboy"" is Jeffrey Dean Morgan, looking amused, lean, and grizzled in the Tommy Lee Jones role. The nice-lady scientist is Naomie Harris, spouting sciencey lines appropriately. The evil corporate overlord sister-brother team are respectively icy and petulant. He does get one of the best lines, noting to the Fed agent that ""Complicity isn't a crime, right?"" Then he runs out into the street and gets squished messily by the giant paw of one animal or the other. The various commandos, soldiers, and civilians competently scream, die, or wander around dazed. <br/><br/>And a lot of them die in really nasty ways--stomped, squished, torn apart, chomped, or gulped down whole. Mostly bloodless, and weirdly weightless, but so obviously and clearly that it would be disturbing if it weren't so clearly artificial. The devouring and dismembering is almost played for laughs--as when evil corporate lady falls screaming into George's open maw and he gulps her down so easily I expected a burp to finish the joke. It also reminded me of the ill-fated nanny's horrible, prolonged dismemberment in Jurassic World, which shared many of the same characteristics: major destruction, sky-high body count, and massive fights that absolutely failed to interest me. Perhaps part of that is just taste, since I don't get excited about watching big monsters knocking things down and killing people, but part of it is the complete lack of weight, thought, or interest that went into the plot and characters. It's a lot of sound (wear earplugs if you see any of these in a theater), a lot of fury, and a lot of pixels sacrificed in the service of--well, nothing much but a couple of hours and fading memories of bass-enhanced predatory roars. They're not memorable enough even to spend energy on debating ""how could that happen"" and ""why didn't they"" over pie afterwards."

"xboxbeastdh","5","0","1","4 April 2018"," No king and little Kong
","Kong skull island is the next instalment of a classic monster universe that's been started up that began with 2014's Godzilla, which I rather liked and now this next instalment is here to give us a Kong vs Godzilla remake I guarantee is coming. So in the film, a group of scientists and soldiers go to skull island in the chances of mapping out the uncharted island and this leads them to a grand island of exotic and fantastical wildlife the king of which is Kong, the iconic gargantuan gorilla who we all grew up with. And when the group comes to the island, as you say in the trailer, destruction, Kong throwing down and most of what you'd expect from a monster movie of today. The build up to this film was rather well anticipated with fairly interesting trailers and marketing especially the poster which I must say, I love. I was interested in this movie and the potential to create a fun universe was possible. But I'm rather upset to say that, for me, the film didn't really deliver what I expected. While there are some fun and entertaining scenes in this film, I was ultimately let down with the film. As we all expected, Kong throwing down in the film was going to be great and this film does deliver on those scenes and they are great. Kong is such a badass classic monster and it's so great to see him back on the big screen again.The setting and design of Skull Island is awesome too. Although, the aspects that bring the film down are, to begin with, the characters. The vast majority of the characters in the film are very uninteresting and have next to no shred of backstory or motivation. Tom Hiddleston's, James Conrad is there to be their guide and he only really receives one small scene in which he expresses a moment of his past and it's so brief and aren't impactful. All other scenes, his character is just a guy who's really good at tracking and can occasionally take on winged creatures with a katana, as you saw in the trailer. John Goodmans character also is barely given anything except one short line about his backstory and that's it. Same with Brie Larson who also is given near nothing. The best character in the film is John C Reilly as someone who crash landed on the island many decades before and at least his character had some interest and some okay humour but still isn't a great character. Furthermore, the editing of the film is very choppy and is very conflicting with itself. For example, for many of Kong's fight sequences, the transitions are smooth and also well filmed in large wide shots, but then the action sequences with the human characters adapts to a 300 style fast to slow motion style which felt extremely off putting and not effective at all. The film also, during the first act , to be specific, quickly rushes through to give us the characters without the needed development they needed to get them straight to the island and for kong to get on screen. Also, a lot of the shots where characters are in frame with kong in the background have incredibly noticeable green screen that appeared very dated despite the okay CGI with the creatures. So in conclusion, Kong was a rather disappointing remake for me. There are definitely positive aspects to the movie and the moments with Kong are great but due to the poor characters and conflicted editing, I must say that the film was only slightly above average for me and i'm gonna give Kong: Skull Island a...<br/><br/>6/10"

"pfs-150-951923","10","0","1","4 February 2018"," A movie that knows exactly what it is about.
","The reason for the ten star rating is that this movie is exactly what it should be. It is a perfect monster flick. Its funny, action packed, completely over the top, sometimes bad, funny dialog that is not necessarily on purpose.<br/><br/>Kong takes the both genious and creative route of mixing total vietnam war/murica cliches with a movie about killing wild beasts. And as a huge fan of music from the 70's, it was the perfect soundtrack to me.<br/><br/>Unlike godzilla, this movie doesn't hide away the monster. We get our build up in the start and immediately when comming to the island, it just skips the whole, walking around the woods, slow introduction to the jungle sequence. Kong just comes out of nowhere and starts wrecking all kinds of havoc. It is an ingenious get to the point maneuver. Everyone knows what it is about.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie is where it lacks. And that is part of the charm to me. Most of them are you're nam marines, smiling at napalm and trying to gun their way out of every situation and that is what's most entertaining to look at. When it is man vs monster, it is coolest when both sides are equally primitive in fighting. In a lot of other movies, people might find a smart way to slay the beast, but where is the fun in that?<br/><br/>But! The reason why this movie truly shines is that it is about the monster. The human characters are mostly bland yes, but Kong is definetely not. Kong is a suprisingly deep character with back story and feelings. He is the main character of the movie and that is what many monster flicks don't realize. Kong's parents are dead and he is all alone. You can feel his lonelyness throughout the movie, especially when he enteracts with characters. Sometimes, when he sees the humans and they don't fight him, he just walks away. Because he knows it is not going to change anything anyway. It is actually quite heartbraking when you think about it. He is likely to be the last of his species and the only thing there is left to do is to fight for his survival. He is king of the island and it doesn't serve him any purpose. He just wants someone to understand him. And that is deep."

","Well what a two hours this film was. Two hours spent with characters that, by the end of the film, I knew no more than I learned when they were first introduced, but I'd already forgotten their names. <br/><br/>There was a British guy who, umm, had some experience somewhere? (James), an idiot who's obsessed with war and there purely so there'd be some conflict in the film (Preston), Brie Larson from Room (Mason), weird Santa Claus (Marlow) and an annoying teenager that needs babysitting the entire movie (still don't know his name).<br/><br/>The majority of time I spent watching this movie I was frustrated at the characters. The worst was when we were shown that one of the soldiers (don't know his name) was eaten by one of the monsters. We were then shown the war obsessed character claiming that they had to go on a suicide mission to rescue him, either trying to act noble but failing, or it was the writer's horrible choice of conflict. We, the audience would then be frustrated by them risking everything in order to, 'save' some soldier (who's name I DON'T know) that we already know is dead. Then, when they tell Preston that the soldier is actually dead, he continues to insist that they go anyway, probably purely to annoy me. <br/><br/>Preston then has to kill Kong because, ummm, the soldiers invaded his land, started attacking him, and Kong ended up killing some soldiers in self defense? What a biggot. Long story short, King Kong ends up saving Brie Larson just because she, ummm, did something? I say he should have killed all the humans because they are the ones who disrupted the somewhat peaceful state of the land he was on by blowing stuff up and nearly burning him to death. <br/><br/>Anyway, I hope I didn't ramble too much and that you actually understood what I was saying. I didn't like the film, but hey, if you ever want a brain exercise, try watching the film and see if you can remember all the character's names! I bet you won't!"

They probably avoided using the whole word so that the movie wouldn't get restricted.

The camera babe, has a camera in her hands but take like, what, 5 shots?

","I haven't despised a film this much for a long, LONG time. First of all; Brie Larson didn't need to be there, other than to so sympathy and empathy for Kong. She plays a photographer, who will not be able to publish her photos, because it's a a top-secret government mission and also John Goodman's character (who only speaks exposition throughout the film), has a camera, so she wasn't needed, AT ALL.<br/><br/>The directorial choices are SO WEIRD it hurts. One time they show a guy getting dropped into Kong's mouth and then stupidly cut to a guy eating a sandwich and then later show a guy actually get eaten. Those weird ""camera on top of a gun""-scenes are so unnecessary.<br/><br/>The characters were very clichéd and their choices were idiotic. Shea Whigham's character's proposed ""sacrifice/Come and get me""- scene is stupid in an another level.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson's character I kind of understand (he doesn't want to think the war is lost and that they conceded and he wants to prove himself) but his scenes are ridiculous and he seems typecast (I mean he says ""Hold to your butts"" in one scene. Just. No.) <br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston and others are just there and Hiddleston is their leader. (That's about it. The Japanese character barely has any lines and I can't remember what was her role, I guess she was Corey Hawkins' assistant oslt and all the others are just stereotypes)<br/><br/>John C. Reilly is probably the most compelling character in the film and literally only who has an arc (Younger version of his character is shown landing to the island in flashbacks) but when he leaves the tribe, he's lived for nearly 30 years, it's literally just; ""Well, I guess this is goodbye... Bye!"" That was pretty... well stupid and bland. I mean, the last scene of the film (not counting the after- credit scene) is Reilly returning to his family and having a hot dog, BECAUSE THAT HAD MORE DEVELOPMENT THAN Oscar WINNER BRIE LARSON AND TOM HIDDLESTON!<br/><br/>The good stuff (I guess) is the special effects and motion capture for Kong (though the constant size changes are hair-ripping, I mean that Kong's hand in the mountain in one scene is as big as half of Kong in all the other scenes), that one scene at the tribe where they visually show Kong's story via paintings, the gory stuff was cool also (although it makes the tone feel more messy, which is annoying, but I respect the studio for having balls by making this PG-13 rated blockbuster be this graphic) + the fight scenes with Kong and monsters were okay and the designs for them were good."

","This version of King Kong starts in 1944 with an American and Japanese soldier crashing their planes on an unknown island. They chase each other through the jungle until they come to a cliff. The Japanese soldier is close to killing the American when suddenly two gigantic ape hands appear: hello Kong! The fate of the two soldiers is unknown when we jump to 1973 where we meet Bill Randa (John Goodman) and his colleague in Washington D.C. They are scientist who want funding for an expedition to a recently discovered location called Skull Island. They get the funding and an military escort, made up of Vietnam veterans who are called the Sky Devils squadron. The leader of the Sky Devils, Colonel Preston Packard (Samual L Jackson) is reluctant to return to civil life after Vietnam so he gladly accepts the job. Also joining the expedition is a former S.A.S. Captain named James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and photographer Mason (Brie Larson). When the team arrives at Skull Island the plan from the scientists is to drop bombs from choppers in order to measure the ground reaction (or something like that). The whole team (about 30-40 people) gets on the choppers and after a rough flight through thick storm clouds they arrive at the island. All goes well but after dropping the first bombs the team is met by something that doesn't like bombs: the giant ape Kong and he is angry. Kong easily takes out the choppers and half the team is killed as a result. The surviving members are divided and have some new goals: get off the island and/or kill the giant ape. <br/><br/>While not bad this movie was very mediocre for me. It looks gorgeous, there are some tense moments and when Kong is on screen beating stuff up it's entertaining. The back story is very basic but I wasn't expecting much so that's okay. What was truly bad in this movie is the incredibly blend characters: they could all be replaced with cardboard boards without changing the end product. Nobody was given any background whatsoever, there was no chemistry between anyone and most where just there for Kong or the other monsters to play around with. It's a shame because they had some talented people here, but even the best actors can only do so much with so little. Take Tom Hiddleston who played the SAS captain for instance: we get one very short introduction scene of him and that's it! How can I root for a guy when there is so little shown of who he is and what his motivation is?<br/><br/>The only character with proper motivation is Samual L Jackson but that get's to the point of ridiculous very quickly. It's getting a little better when Jonh C. Reilly shows up because his character is at least given more then one line of background and there are some jokes thrown around. But he is just mainly there to explain the background story for the audience, it almost feel like they pause the film and show a power point presentation. (""here is what you need to know, please wait for question at the end!"") They even had cave drawings to explain stuff. <br/><br/>The special effects look cool though and the fight scenes between Kong and the other big monsters are awesome. But that is just 10 minutes out of two hours of boring characters. The plot is incredibly predictable, there are zero surprises found here. They also try a little to hard to force a 70's feel with all the classic rock songs played, but I let that slide as they were good songs. If they had used less characters, gave them more material to work with and went more for a serious survival story I think it might have worked a lot better than just putting loads of characters in it and try to copy a Marvel movie. <br/><br/>If your bored, don't care about wooden characters and just want to see a big ape beat stuff up then this will probably entertain you. If you like good characters in a monster movie with a plot that has some unexpected twists then look elsewhere, you don't find that here."
"shobanchittuprolu","6","0","1","13 August 2017"," Kong: Skull Island is a messy King Kong film with lot of monsters,lot of characters and lot of boredom.
","Kong: Skull Island (2017): Kong:Skull Island is retelling of the story of the giant ape we've all come to know and love after Peter Jackson's visual epic King Kong.Kong: Skull Island is a part of MonsterVerse series.With a terrific trailer and brilliant star-cast,Kong raised lot of expectations despite of its less famous director.SO how is it? Plot: When the Vietnam War ends, Bill Randa (John Goodman) and his partner Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) from the Monarch organization succeed to get the financing for an expedition to the recently discovered Skull Island from Senator Willis. He hires the former Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to guide the expedition; a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L.Jackson); and the awarded journalist and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). On the arrival, the helicopters need to cross a storm and soon they drop bombs on the forest to map the seismology of the island. Soon they are attacked by a huge gorilla called Kong that destroys the helicopters and kills part of the crew and scatter the rest through the island. The group commanded by Conrad meets Hank Marlow (John C.Railey), a survivor from the World War II that lives with a tribe of natives. He explains that Kong protects the island and the natives from underground monsters and shall not be killed. But Colonel Packard is insane seeking revenge for his men that died.<br/><br/>My Review: Kong: Skull Island is not just a Kong film but more as a Skull Island film as it got more scope to show its hidden monsters like a giant spider,yak,grasshopper,jurassic period birds and the villain of Temple Run game. (It's not a joke!) Kong is so predictable for a monster film (not like Godzilla) but what goes wrong is its uneven point of view.Even though the character introductions took time it seemed interesting.The movie raised hopes from the scene where they enter the dangerous storm to the scene where Kong smashes their choppers.The entry of Kong and its fight with the choppers is one of the most entertaining and thrilling moments of the year.But unfortunately,this is the end of the good part! There are more lot of monsters and characters in the movie which looks meddled and made the whole movie a mess.When the giant spider attacks,I thought it would be eye-spectacle but it disappointed.All the other monsters are so boring and none of them are scary enough.Even the main villain monster looks silly like the monster in Temple Run.While the King Kong has epic fight with dinosaurs in 2005 version,2017 version lacks such epic moments.<br/><br/>The visual effects, the CGI, the overly well-done post-production and DI (digital intermediate) make this Kong outing sexier than it should be. 3D is worth adding a lot of depth into the beautiful Skull Island.In collaboration with cinematographer Larry Fong, the director has made a feature that, in between all of the messy characters and monsters,finds legitimate beauty in the epic landscapes. Combined with a guitar-heavy soundtrack powered by the sounds of Creedence Clearwater Revival, David Bowie, Black Sabbath and more, Kong: Skull Island has an unmistakable, realistic, and story-enhancing aesthetic that gives the film a relief and distinct flavor.<br/><br/>The major disappointment is star-cast and Brie-Larson is huge disappointment.After a Oscar-Winning performance I expected a lot from Brie Larson.I know that we shouldn't expect performance from these films,but Brie Larson is totally lost on this film.Tom Hiddleston is Mr.Cool in this film even when the situations are worse.Is it supposed to be inspiring?. John Railey is the only one who put up some note-worthy performance.<br/><br/>So,Kong: Skull Island is a messy King Kong film with lot of monsters,lot of characters and lot of boredom.<br/><br/>My rating 5.75/10"

","Set in 1973, a ""monster hunter"" played by John Goodman scams the U.S. Government into funding an expedition into an island to supposedly look for valuable resources; but what Goodman really seeks is validation into his theory that monsters live within the earth, and at some point they will all come out and eat us like chicken nuggets. With a tracker (played by Tom Hiddleston) by his side and a unit of the Army's Assault Helicopter Company led by Samuel L. Jackson as an escort, Goodman and his fellow scientists begin their exploration of the island in a violent wayand they are all met with violence by the island's largest and most fearsome monster, King Kong.<br/><br/>Their helicopters destroyed, the human survivors have a small chance of escaping the island and getting back to their ship. But Kong and the island monsters aren't the only ones the humans must fear. Jackson, in his quest to avenge his men who were killed by Kong, turns into Capt. Ahab and risks everything and everyone to exact his pound of gorilla flesh.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Kong: Skull Island"" is the scene when King Kong fights the big, underground lizard thing. King monster against king monster; and a monsterfest is what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" suffers from numerous shenanigans, such as Vietnam veteran helicopter pilots staying too close to Kong, with the result of being swatted and crushed by the giant ape. Then there's Hiddleston's character who never loses his cool no matter how many giant, ugly creatures are trying to eat him — I've seen people show more emotion while playing video games. Enough of the negatives. What this movie has going for it are: 1) a fast paced, dynamic direction by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, giving this flick a tremendous amount of fun energy; and 2) monsters, monsters, and more monsters. I've been a fan of Japanese monster movies from the 1950s/1960sthey are silly, and generally make no sense; but they are fun to watch. Well, ""Kong: Skull Island"" is like that.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

"freeofavia","4","0","1","6 August 2017"," Not another cinematic universe movie
","This film is set in the year Vietnam ended, 1973. And the production design is done very well. Sets, props, costumes, all to spec. I love history films, and its even better when you throw science fiction into the mix.<br/><br/>As has been said, this movie has some serious acting chops on board, and they do a good job. Michael Fassbend- I mean Tom Hiddleston is great! Although most of the characters are very flat, I can't blame the cast for that, and they do well with what they have to work with.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for this movie was surprising at times, and included a lot of song choices I really enjoyed. Most however were somewhat lacking in originality of choice. CCR's Run Through the Jungle perhaps being the laziest choice for any movie set in the jungle, ever. Especially since Credence is used in every Vietnam movie ever anyways. And this is a Vietnam movie.<br/><br/>The movies anti-war theme is prevalent, and not subtle. They very clearly draw a distinction between the destruction of the Vietnam war and the destruction of this separate Jungle environment, with the very same incendiary weapons. The imagery of the red and orange flames and the backdrop of a blue and green jungle is beautiful and striking. Perhaps the best part visually of the movie.<br/><br/>The Computer generated effects seemed to be lacking here. Kong is likely the best looking monster in the movie, and he doesn't look much better than Peter Jackson's version. He certainly looks worse than Caesar from Planet of the Apes. The dire water buffalo looked cool the first time, but lacked realism and grit. I got very tired of seeing them. The spider looked very good. The ""skull crawlers"" (stupid name, even with a thinly veiled excuse in the dialogue) were very generic, which was fine. But I expected ""the big one"" to have a bit more flair. Instead of getting Ubisoft, they should try to get Nintendo to design their monster next time. I don't know if they actually used Ubisoft, but those things definitely looked like a bad video game enemy, and the big one like a slightly stronger variant that looks hardly any different.<br/><br/>I'll also say the sound design is very lazy. Nothing about it intrigued me anyways, and Kong sounded like they threw four different animals in a blender and just went with whatever came out. I get there's only so much you can do, but when it's supposed to sound like you're sitting in front of a giant ape breathing, but it actually sounds like you're on acid at the zoo, you know you're doing something wrong.<br/><br/>Now, for the writing, the Achilles' Heel of every major blockbuster these days. <br/><br/>*Spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>So John Goodman tells everyone they are going to drop bombs for a geological survey. Makes perfect sense right? I'm pretty sure the atomic bomb was developed for mapping the Mariana trench.<br/><br/>I get that it's not supposed to make sense, but come on, it's just lazy. And it's just an excuse for<br/><br/>Big Dumb Action Scene! They drop bombs in the forest, killing all the CG deer (assumingly by reducing their hit points to zero), and angering ""the monkey"". Never mind that nobody ever gets corrected calling an ape a monkey, this scene is stupid because no soldier in his right mind would start shooting at something big enough to swat him out of the sky without being given an explicit order to fire. And absolutely no sane pilot would go along with it either. The whole scene where the helicopters fight Kong is just unnecessary pseudo apocalypse porn, which would be fine if it didn't ruin the story. At that point, these characters who I had grown to really like, became a bunch o stupid assholes who deserved to get killed. And at that point it's like, ""well Kong's going to kill them now, I guess I'll sit back and enjoy"", which is very disheartening, to get invested in a group of characters and become resigned to their fate because they start acting like jerks. Sure, I still cared about Brie and Tom, but not a lot. I don't think there was much given to like about Tom except that he was competent, and Brie except that she was Idealistic.<br/><br/>John Goodman was the worst of them all. It was his crappy plan to lure Kong out with bombs. Why not use the world class tracker you hired, hunt kong down, and use the bombs on him?! That would make more sense! I have a feeling that was probably the original script, with much more mystery and exploration. Maybe a little survival here and there, mixed in with a lot of biological horror. But I'm sure the studio decided they wanted a big, smashy smashy explodey CG orgy right at the beginning so people didn't fall asleep, so here we go. Stupid plot point about trying to get Kong to destroy all their transport, so they can take a picture, and in a desperate last ditch effort for survival, trek cross country through the most dangerous terrain on planet earth so we can hopefully get picked up by another chopper, and take the pictures back to the military so we can start a campaign to fund an attack expedition back to the island to finally kill Kong. Because taking a picture of a one of a kind animal defending it's home habitat, being gunned down by Vietnam era U.S. military issue helicopters, would definitely rouse support for the most difficult assassination in human history, where there are no resources at stake or definable threats we are defending against, would definitely win over the hearts of the American people into another military conflict against a freaking monkey!

I can't even count the number of times I laughed out loud or prepared myself with a giddy, youthful anticipation for the result of a sweet build up to some inevitably awesome scene.

Really? Those are clues about what's to come. The characters are one dimensional stereotypes despite the intervention of John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson. The romance is flat and insipid. There is very little suspense or subtlety. It really feels like it was a movie created by committee and focus groups targeted at the lowest common denominator.

","KONG: SKULL ISLAND is a Hollywood blockbuster intended as a prequel for a forthcoming KING KONG VS. GODZILLA remake along with lots of other upcoming monster mayhem. Thankfully, this does away with the usual nonsense business of yet another KING KONG remake; the action is set entirely on Skull Island and there's none of that sappy romance between the giant ape and a human female. In terms of quality, it's a real mixed bag, one which gets by thanks to the big scale CGI action sequences in which Kong battles various giant enemies. Kaiju fans will be happy, and the post-credits coda is the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>The human cast fare less well here, with a wooden Tom Hiddleston failing to make any kind of impact and Samuel L. Jackson overacting in a predictable role. John C. Reilly bags the only real characterisation while others like Toby Kebbell and Jing Tian are wasted. The worst actor of the whole thing is Brie Larson, whose wide-eyed reaction shots are an example of ridiculous, and quite embarrassing, overacting. The overload of CGI does get wearying at times, and the film is occasionally laughable, what with the CGI deer and helicopters in proliferation, but otherwise it's typical brainless entertainment that keeps you distracted for its running time."

(Glaring at a giant gorilla while standing rooted to the spot amidst the destruction of a fleet of helicopters- with tons of shrapnel whizzing through the air all around him- seems to be Jackson's idea of proving himself ""a tough motherf--ker.""

","It seriously would have played better without a single-speaking human in it.<br/><br/>Kong:Skull Island isn't a bad little flick, but it isn't great either. Positives include some fresh ideas and spins on traditional Kong themes, and the CGI action with Kong is exceptional. THe negatives are non-stop stupid actions by the characters, a lack of an ending, and a poor script.<br/><br/>When the film tries to be funny it isn't. And the film just follows such a cookie cutter modern-cgi-action template that is growing-old very fast. <br/><br/>You might like this if you liked Warcraft, or the Transformer sequels, or John Carter. <br/><br/>Some stuff stuck out really bad in terms of terrible improbability, and I guess it might be nit-picking if not for the frequency of such actions/scenes. The photographer taking nothing but bad pictures at inopportune times, and no good pictures at perfect times.. the helicopters flying at low-altitude after not one, not two, not three, but 6 or 7 hand been knocked down in quite a long-span of time... all that stuff just ultimately pulls the viewer away, and the script and the lack of scares and comedy do the same. <br/><br/>Those fresh ideas end-up being squandered a bit and the film ends-up being nothing more than a lower-brow version of Nimrod Antal's ""Predators"". There's not a single-character in this film that gains any steam or likability. The closest is John C. Reilly, who tries his best to save the film, but ultimately fails along with the rest.<br/><br/>I'd pass on this unless you just really like the shallow action- stuff. If so, Kong and the CGI could be worth it, I guess."

","This movie is at the same time the best and the worst of what the Hollywood can offer to movie enthusiasts. Because it is a cinematic syphilis on steroids
 
And here is a list of main reasons for the negative labeling:
<ul><li>weak dialogues</li><li>among around dozen of characters, the female ones were reduced to only two, who exchange with each other around the same amount of sentences (two)</li><li>main female character most of her time on the screen is shown wearing a body top (but for some perverse reason in a gray color instead of the standard horny white)</li><li>stereotypical Angry Black Man, played by no other than Samuel L.

As for the positives: it had a big budget and you can tell it right away. And yes, it is entertaining to watch palm trees vs. helicopters combat, amplified by a slow down of a song; and yes, the final fight is also impressing. Aside from the graphical artifacts with colors in the 2D version and its issues with sharpness of image, the whole technical side of this movie is at the top. But that is the core problem with this one: that is has no core. It is just a shiny packaging with nothing inside but some explosions and fights mixed with some clichés and with only a tiny pinch of essence
 
And so, a king size pile of turd in a colorful wrapping paper deserves a 3/10. Although it is a comforting thought, that this reincarnation of King Kong only three months after its premiere has a mere 6.8 rating on the IMDb, while the previous one by Peter Jackson initially had 8.3 but it took a decade to bring it down to a more appropriate 7.2 grade.

"ahmedredasamy","6","0","2","25 July 2017"," The Beast which never loved the girl.
","""King Kong"" has always been the story about the might beast that fell in love with a woman who eventually causes his death. This has been the story from the 30s till the extraordinary remake by Peter Jackson. However, this movie doesn't stick to the rituals of the story, as it tells the story of the beast in his own land, without the famous Empire State Scene, without being captured. The Graphics are great, however, there has not been much development between this version and Jackson's version technically. Having a cast consisting of super talented actors like Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larsson, Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Reilly and John Goodman. However, their performances were very average except Reilly maybe. The opening scene of the movie was very very good. Incorporating Kong in a fight with Godzilla -which is the next move for this universe- would be pretty tough as Kong is much smaller and Godzilla is a lot stronger. We are talking about a beast which can breathe Fire against an ape. However, it is gonna be fantastic watching that battle. Skull Island borrows lots of elements from Apocalypse Now. You'd feel that you are watching a second part of it only this time, Marlon Brando has evolved and became this giant ape. I believe that this borrowing was to make the movie more acclaimed, Yet the ultimate result of the movie is that it's a fun ride that is easily forgettable and would never stick to anyone's mind just like Godzilla. The only difference is that Godzilla was a sequel to an awful movie while Kong was following a very good one. Perhaps the comparison between King Kong and Skull Island have hurt the movie"

","Before watching this film, I had convinced myself that the concept of a giant gorilla was played out. That in this day and age, with all the cinematic wonders we are used too. With all the special effects that we take for granted. A giant gorilla just wouldn't cut it anymore.<br/><br/>I'm not one to shy away from being wrong however and this film review will bring no exceptions. so here goes.... I was wrong.<br/><br/>The first thing to say about this film is that it's not the original king kong story, therefore we learn more about Kong and his origin. It may seem obvious to some with the title of the film, but I guess my pessimism had blinded me to the fact that this film wasn't even marketed as the original kong story. As we all know, Kong is not the bad guy, it is in fact mankind who play the bad guys in the kong films. This film is no exception in this respect but I feel like they captured a beautiful balance of human kindness and the very worst we are capable of. <br/><br/>Skull Island uses CGI to it's full potential, the film is beyond visually satisfying for the audience. With every new giant creature Kong comes into contact with we get a perspective of the trials kong faces in protecting the people of the island. There are some truly harrowing scenes throughout the film but all visually thrilling and worth the 2 second cringe that any gore may bring you.<br/><br/>It will pain me to say it, but if anything about the film could have been improved it would have to be the plot. Perhaps a longer build up before we got to see skull island. I'm not quite suggesting the same type of wait we had with Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong. But a fair balance of the two would have worked nicely.<br/><br/>I rate Skull Island an 8/10"

","This movie made me look up Shea Whigham and Corey Hawkins, because their performances impressed me. I was already prepared to like SLJ, The Man With The Scowl, and so I did. Hiddleston was in good physical shape and okay in acting, except in one scene where his ""Let's go"" really needed an exclamation point in style; it ought to have been ""LET'S GO!!!"" with the extra punctuation since they were about to be mincemeat and all. Brie Larson fitted her role well and if she's Victoria Woodhull in 2018 as Wiki says, I'll try to see that film.<br/><br/>The real punch in the movie came in the form of Kong, a defender without peer. If I were an Iwi *sp?* tribesperson and needed defending from the Skullcreatures, I would worship Kong, too. He's really on the ball. The creature design for the Skullcreatures reminded me of the night creatures in Pitch Black, a high point in monster movies, which had the 'slow buildup' approach to seeing the monsters. As for this movie, it came on soon and strong with the fantastic beasts and exotic Iwi tribe and I liked it for that fact. It didn't disappoint in action, the water buffalo struck a realistic herbivore *non- violent giant species* note that made me smile, and the ending was particularly satisfying."

"cherold","7","0","2","20 July 2017"," Best of the Kong remakes
","The original 1933 film King Kong was such a hit that studios have been reviving the big ape ever since. There were sequels, there were a couple of Japanese things, and in the 70s there was a painfully slow and tedious movie only notable for containing Jessica Lange's all- time worst performance.<br/><br/>More recently Peter Jackson attempted to turn the story into a LOTR- style epic, resulting in a few good scenes drowned in sheer bulk.<br/><br/>Skull Island is in some ways a return to the simplicity of the original. There's a giant ape on an island of monsters, there's a bunch of people getting killed, and there's a lot of action. <br/><br/>The shortest Kong movie in some time, coming in at well under two hours, the film gets in a lot of action and even has room for a madness-of-war, Vietnam-inspired undercurrent (which feels a little random but basically works).<br/><br/>The best action scene is Kong versus the helicopters. It's a very intense sequence that, like many scenes in the movie, is a sort of call-back to something in the original. It's unfortunate that the movie can't match that scene elsewhere, but it's generally quite entertaining all the same. I do think it's possible that if you edited the Jackson film from 3 hours to the length of this one it might be the better movie, but based on what was released, Skull Island is easily the best Kong reboot.<br/><br/>Skull Island isn't too attached to the original story, which is fine by me. It even virtually ditches the whole ape/girl romance, which went from obsessive love in the original to weirdly sexual in the 70s to girl-as-pet from Jackson to a sort of mutual respect thing in this one. <br/><br/>The movie also stays on the island - no empire state building this time around. There's room for a sequel, but I hope this franchise continues to do its own thing."

","King Kong has fascinated movies makers for decades now and Kong : Skull Island is the latest spin off on this 'larger than life chest-thumping' ape .Kong boasts of an ensemble cast comprising of seasoned actors like Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman & John C. Reilly besides Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson (of Room fame). The movie takes all these characters to the mysterious Skull Island where not just Kong but a string of other creatures awaits them. What starts as a geological expedition eventually turns into a game of survival.Tom Hiddleston plays one of its kind action hero who does not get to fire a single bullet throughout the movie but he does manage to break off his 'godly' image with this movie. Brie Larson is vibrant as the 'anti-war photojournalist' who lands up exactly in the middle of a war like situation. It's great to see John Goodman and especially John C. Reilly come back in their true form and give some great performances here. Now coming to Samuel L. Jackson, who does it simply with his eyes. No actor could dare stare back at King Kong with the kind of hatred in his eyes, the way he does. His character has multiple layers and he showcases shades of grey here. All said and done, the cinematography by Larry Fong is outstanding. Each and every shot in the movie is beautiful.

"JimHaw","2","0","1","6 July 2017"," Worthless
","When I go see a sci fi movie like this one, I know that I am expected to suspend my disbelief but this one is beyond even that. <br/><br/>""Kong: Skull Island"" is an updated version of the Edgar Wallace/Merian Cooper 1933 creation ""King Kong"". There have been many others that more closely follow the story-line. There have also been dozens of sequels. Most are rather low budget but entertaining.<br/><br/>This update is set at the end of the Vietnam War. It is a story about a group of scientists and soldiers sent to explore an uncharted island. So far, so good. The acting is okay but not great however no reason to leave the cineplex just yet. However, this changes once on the island. Here are some of my issues with it:<br/><br/>1. Lack of tactical retreat: When they are flying low across the island and first come across Kong, they keep flying toward it. I guess that is reasonable. However, at some point, certainly after a couple of the helicopters were easily destroyed by Kong, you would think the commanding officer (Col Preston Packard ie Samuel Jackson) would order a tactical retreat in order to reassess the situation and decide on an appropriate course of action. Instead, he tries to fight on. <br/><br/>2. Getting too close: Kong is much bigger than in most previous versions of this story. His arms seem to have a span of a football field. Yet the helicopters (including a Chinook full of scientists) keep darting in front of his face. Why not back off? Although he can run very fast, a helicopter can fly UH-1 Huey can fly at a speed of over 100 mph, Konk could not keep up. Or, why not climb? <br/><br/>3. Shoot first and ask questions later: This movie maintains the stereotypical soldier who shoots first before assessing the real danger. I will not comment on whether or not that is a warranted stereotype but it certainly is how the soldiers in this movie react out of fear. They shoot at anything and everything that moves without regard to the true level of danger. <br/><br/>4. The ""White Whale"": Kong becomes Col Packard's white whale for which he is willing to sacrifice the lives of all his men in order to kill. Okay, you might be thinking this is not a bad direction for the movie to take and you are right. I am just tired of it. Why do so many military type movies have to have an obsessive character whose only thought is to kill at any price? <br/><br/>5. Why are the chief bad creatures immune to bullets and fire but not to swords? <br/><br/>6. While on the subject of fire, where did the flamethrower and chemical grenades come from? Neither are standard equipment for a tactical military unit of any kind. <br/><br/>And I could continue on but will not tire you. If you can suspend your disbelief beyond what I am able, you might enjoy this trash."

The humans in the film are forgettable, cookie-cutter versions of the same characters you've seen a million times. Oh look there's Sam Jackson. Oh look Alison Brie's emotive eyes. Oh look John C.

If we are looking at the same Kong that we have seen in various other films, I think my question is the same posed as many others...how is he so impossibly huge all of a sudden? He went from being 25 or 30 feet tall to almost 500 feet? What in the world? Also the creature designs were interesting and I really liked them! But they seemed to be a bit out of place for this film. They would have made more sense if they were on an alien planet, and it kinda irritates me that John Goodman refers to them as ""ancient species"". Now one thing I really did enjoy was the aboriginal skull islanders, their designs for war paint and garb were very creative. Their communication without language gave the film a bit of a spice up in its uniqueness. So overall, the film was pretty great, I just don't feel like it can be connected to any type of King Kong prequels, and just kinda seems to have appeared out of thin air. I really liked it, but its underlying senses were a bit disappointing."

"HonestMovies","7","0","4","29 June 2017"," Great movie. A big budget B-Movie
","Kong: Skull Island is the newest film to feature the giant ape. Kong got his start eighty-four years ago in 1933, and since then Kong has become an icon as the ""American Monster"". Kong: Skull island is a special type of movie, it's a movie that you have to be in the mind- set to watch. If you're not in the mood to watch giant monsters fighting, then this is not for you, but if you're in the frame of mind for a fun movie set during the Vietnam War with giant monsters and Apocalypse Now– esque imagery then this is the movie for you. The movie starts out during World War II when an American pilot named Hank Marlow and a Japanese pilot named Gunpei Ikari blow each other out of the sky and crash land on a beach in the south pacific. Once on the beach, Marlow and Ikari began to fight each other. Their fight leads them through the jungle and ends on a cliff, where suddenly the ground begins shaking and a giant shadow falls over them and with a loud growl a giant head rises over the cliff to give the viewers their first look at King Kong. The movie then picks up in 1973 and follows Bill Randa, a U.S. government agent who starts going around recruiting people who could guide him on his venture to Skull Island. He hires former British Special Air Services captain James Conrad, who was a skilled tracker. He also recruits the Sky Devils, a Vietnam War veteran helicopter squadron led by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard. Later their group is joined by a photojournalist named Mason Weaver. Once on Skull Island Lieutenant Packard's men start dropping explosives developed by seismologist Houston Brooks to map out the island. This act enrages Kong, who begins attacking the helicopters, destroying most and damaging the rest. The attack scatters the survivors over the island into two groups, Packard's group and Conrad's group. Both must reach the northern part of the island to meet the refueling team who is arriving in three days. On their way, they run into the Iwi natives, downed American Pilot Hank Marlow, horrifying beasts known as Skullcralers, a boat that was frankenstined together out of their planes, Giant spiders, and Pterosaur creatures before reuniting for one final battle. This movie is great and fun to watch. Unlike the other Kong films, this one is one is like a big budget B-movie. The serious tone of the other movies is gone, this one takes the idea of a giant ape and runs with it. No longer does he walk on his fist like a real gorilla, but now he stands on two legs. This film is a return to the original adventure story-style of people going to an island and discovering mysteries unsuspected by the rest of the world. The only the big problem with this movie is the lack of a true villain—-there are deadly creatures who need to be eliminated, and a war-bent general, but there is not one central antagonist for the heroes to defeat. If you go see ""Kong: Skull Island,"" don't leave when the credits start rolling—sit tight for a tantalizing hint as to what comes next! Overall this is a great film and is worth seeing. If you were hoping for a movie that would capture the greatness of the 1933 original then your going to be disappointed. Nothing can live up to the master piece that is the original King Kong , but what I love most about all the different interpretations of King Kong is their way of being different and taking the premises of Kong and shaping it to tell new stories and being able to distinguish itself from all of the other Kong films."
"carlos37andre","8","0","2","28 June 2017"," A perfect blockbuster made for the big audience!
","I've seen some people complaining about the poor character building of the movie, that's very likely a fact, the characters in this movie are not overly worked and exploited, but why the f#ck is that necessary?<br/><br/>The whole movie is built to show the Island, and what exactly is hidden there. There are at least 5 characters there that can be considered ""mainstream"" in the story, as it would be humanly possible to approach all the past (or whatever those people want) from them, and still feature Kong and the other monster on the Island without making it a Transformers movie? At less think about that, before starts hate the film (It's like Rogue One, the main character of the movie isn't a real character, but the whole universe that they live).<br/><br/>Anyway, for me the movie focuses on what's really important. The characters are not empty bags just waiting to be killed, they just do not have their background stories explored, but you can see a chemistry between the group, a friendship between the soldiers, some sense of danger in the middle of it all. And above all, the story goes on in a line so straightforward and cool, with incredible action scenes, and others that simply fill your eyes with such beauty.<br/><br/>The sense of adventure is also something very present there, and that accompanies the whole story and makes it an excellent experience. About the effects, only one or two scenes in the whole movie come to bother, and seem to laugh a little, in a way, other than that, the CGI is almost perfect.<br/><br/>In short, Kong is an extremely entertaining film, which makes two hours look like 20 minutes, a story that plays its part in presenting the big gorilla again in theaters and being a flawless blockbuster, which easily serves as an excellent pastime.<br/><br/>PS: I can't wait to see King Kong vs Godzilla!"

"ginocox-206-336968","5","0","1","25 June 2017"," Mindless entertainment that takes itself too seriously
","""Kong: Skull Island"" can't seem to decide whether it wants to be an action/adventure, an anti-war/anti-establishment political statement, a paean to preceding King Kong films with occasional nods to other movies, or an integral component of a franchise about very large monsters. Unfortunately, the film often fails to find a suitable balance between these competing objectives, to the detriment of the story. <br/><br/>For example, the camera used by Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) is prominently shown in quite a few shots. It looks quite sophisticated, with the chrome and glass rangefinder over the lens – unless one knows anything about cameras and photography, in which case you might wonder why she is using a rangefinder with such a slow lens in museum condition that obviously hasn't been knocked around in the jungles of Viet Nam. Turns out, the camera is a Leica M2, a moderately priced consumer model introduced in 1952 – not a camera a war photographer or even an anti-war photographer would have been likely to use twenty years later. The lens is F/3.5, which means it captures less than half as much light (relative to the size of the medium) as an iPhone 5. If you've ever tried to take a picture with your cell phone at night or in a dark restaurant without flash, your pictures were probably as intelligible as her nighttime shots. Why the M2, instead of the then current M5 or a Nikon F2? Probably because it looks cool and unusual and nobody bothered to wonder what type of camera a professional photographer would have chosen. Or maybe they wanted her to look more like a female Everyman than a war correspondent. Similarly, the sidearm used by Preston (Samuel L. Jackson) is a consumer model Colt M1902 which was never adopted by the army. There are dozens of other anachronisms, including Weaver's film. <br/><br/>In an early aerial battle scene, Kong snatches and knocks helicopters out of the air. Kong reportedly stands 104 feet tall. Helicopters ordinarily fly at 1,000 feet above whatever is below them. I've never studied aerial combat, but I think that if I were fighting a big ape, that I would fly high enough that it couldn't reach up and grab me out of the sky. <br/><br/>Early shots show six helicopters on the deck of the Athena. Two more are in a cargo bay, but their rotors are collapsed and it would probably take quite a while to prepare them for flight. But when they fly to Skull Island, there are an unlucky thirteen helicopters in flight formation. Why so many helicopters? First, so the director can get a shot that's evocative of a similar shot in ""Apocalypse Now."" Second, to have more carnage in the ensuing battle scene. Third, to have enough survivors (red shirts) for ensuing fight scenes. But this creates a number of problems with the script. The obvious lack of continuity shatters the audience's willful suspension of disbelief. The failure of thirteen experienced pilots, who survived countless combat missions in Viet Nam under Preston's no-nonsense command, to figure out that maybe they shouldn't be flying so close to the ground makes them and Preston seem inept. <br/><br/>Preston doesn't have a good motive to pursue Kong. His job is to protect the geological team. Kong is a force of nature. Preston's vendetta seems a bit like attacking a tornado because it killed your family. Ultimately, he must decide between mindless pursuit of Kong and fulfilling his mission. He's depicted as possibly demented, possibly as an allegory for America's involvement in Viet Nam, but it weakens the dramatic argument. The opposing viewpoint doesn't seem strong, as it doesn't need to overcome a compelling argument. <br/><br/>Later, they stop and say something like: We've got only twelve hours to get from point A to point B, a distance that would ordinarily take twenty hours to travel even without the unfamiliar terrain and fearsome creatures trying to eat us, so we don't have a second to spare, but before we go, let's take time to discuss ethics, ecology and the lessons of the Nuremberg trials. By this time, the characters lack credibility, so their discussion seems sophomoric. <br/><br/>The movie makes numerous political statements about warfare, self-determination, xenophobia, private property – a veritable smörgåsbord of liberal political concepts. It's critical of America's efforts to impose its political ideology on other nations. And yet, Kong could be viewed in an analogous role, imposing his rule to repress the skull crawlers and support the indigenous people. At one point, a character states, ""If you take away a species's natural competition, they'll proliferate out of control."" This was probably a reference to ecological diversity, but my first thought was of Syria (Skull Island), where deposing Gaddafi (Kong) resulted in a proliferation of Daesh (skull crawlers) and large casualties among refugees, but also large numbers spilling over borders. <br/><br/>The movie has many excellent elements. Exotic locations, a talented cast, awesome cinematography, convincing styling, costumes & props (although numerous anachronisms detract). The shots are refreshingly steady with an absence of those annoying jiggly-cam shots. It would excel as mindless entertainment if it didn't take itself so seriously or if it showed enough respect for the audience to take them seriously when presenting its political messages."
"cloudbustingforever","4","0","1","25 June 2017"," An underwhelming, tired old re-hash.
","My first ever review. Well, I can't say it was a disappointment, because I really wasn't expecting very much at all and to be fair, it lived up to expectations. It's not how much you spend on CGI that matters, but rather how you use them (or overuse them in this case). This was a sanitised Kong. It always felt like a CGI creation - there was nothing animalistic about it, ever. It wasn't terrifying or menacing. It was introduced too early in the film without any real build up. This severely lessened it's impact. And what about Tom Hiddlestone? he was like an action figure, he seemed completely out-of-place. I don't think a grain of dust, bead of sweat or splash of water so much as graced him till the last 5 minutes. Prior to that, he could have been replaced by a wooden-top, Ken-doll or some other inanimate object and I wouldn't have noticed. The story is pointless and contrived - it's only purpose is to tie together the series of big CGI action sequences. Don't go in with high expectations and you won't be disappointed. It can hold your attention, to be fair, it's not terrible, just very mediocre. I give it a generous 4."

","Overall it's a completely decent action/suspense movie. Nobody is going to be handing an Oscar to Brie Larson or Tom Hiddleston for their work in this movie but they're both pretty good. Probably the only person who rises above looking slightly bored is John C. Reilly. He seems to be having a lot fun with the character and the story picks up when he shows up. Samuel L. Jackson is fine but seems arbitrarily angry throughout. The movie looks great though. I didn't see it in the theatre but I'd imagine it was even more visually appealing. It has some great colour that gives it a 70s feel without feeling retro. I read some complaints of distracting slow-mo but it didn't bother me. This is the DoP of Sucker Punch and Batman v Superman but I don't think he's 'unleashed' like those movies. As for the story it never really rises above passable. They go to Skull Island and King Kong is there. Obviously there's a bit more to it than that but it never rises above monsters attacking people. Do a lot of people do dumb things to move the plot forward? Yes. Did I find that distracting? Not really. It never becomes more than a pretty movie that has so-so fights and too many characters.

","As I said, this movie is SHAMELESSLY entertaining and that's exactly what I want from movies like these. Sure, I love a good character arch, plot devices, morals, meanings and twists but I also go to the movies to be entertained! <br/><br/>Amazingly though, this movie does convey heart as well as humour (however dark it may be.) The movie is visually stunning and takes you on an epic adventure with really cool creatures and landscapes added in to, really convey what a different world this island is. It also manages to change our perceptions of certain characters and plot lines as well as subverting certain character archetypes. As well as great performances by all the main and side characters, in that they all had their own little idiosyncrasies and we even get small bits of back story for side characters, so they don't feel like random cannon fodder to be thrown to the monsters. <br/><br/>Saying this, it is a great movie on it's own but manages to craftily put in clues and hints that, once put in conjunction with the post-credits scene does a great job of succinctly making it an addition and one of the building blocks of the Monsters Universe. <br/><br/>As I said though, while this movie does provoke some thought and hit you a little in the feels, it isn't a deep, meaningful exploration of the human psyche, nor is it asking any eternal man vs. beast questions but not every movie has too! It is purely for entertainment purposes and like any good action adventure movie, it'll get your heart pounding and adrenaline up while taking you on a crazy journey."

"ChristianLeFeuvre","8","0","1","12 June 2017"," If you want to investigate an island, make sure its 'king' doesn't mind
","Hollywood's first truly successful 'creature feature' was undeniably the 1933 classic 'King Kong'. The movie was remade both in 1976, and again in 2005 with the big budget Peter Jackson directed version. Well, Kong is back. This time though, it's thankfully not another remake. 'Kong: Skull Island' sees the great ape on his own turf and he, as king, will defend the island and himself from any outsiders. The 'outsiders' in this case are a group of scientists and soldiers who set out to investigate an uncharted island, called 'Skull Island'. The movie opens at the latter part of the Second World War, and we see a couple of American and Japanese fighter pilots, who are forced to parachute onto an island in the South Pacific and carry on their fight until they are suddenly interrupted (in, what is, an impressive introduction to our titular character). As the opening credits roll we are skipped through time until the mid-seventies and we see the American troop withdrawal from Vietnam. Bill Randa, played by John Goodman, is a scorned government agent who has always maintained there are undiscovered 'creatures' out there, and once he learns of this uncharted island, he is adamant it could hold the proof he needs. Along with a couple of government scientist who want to map the island, he recruits James Conrad, an expert tracker and former British Serviceman (Tom Hiddleston), a photojournalist Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), and a group of young soldiers fresh out of fighting in the Vietnam war led by tough Colonel, Preston Packard, played by Samuel L. Jackson. As the helicopters breech the continuous storm surrounding the island and drop map-reading bombs down, the mighty ape Kong sets about smashing the helicopters out of the sky. Separated, the survivors of the crashed helicopters must reunite in order to get to the rescue spot. Along the way they come across Hank Marlow, an American airman who has been stranded on the island since 1944 (yes, the airman from the opening of the movie) who agrees to help. But with Packard now out for revenge against Kong for killing most of his men and the fact that Kong is not the only giant creature on the island they find their escape much harder than they thought. This movie is visually incredible, and the scenes the helicopters arrival over the island, Kong and ripping them apart (literally) and when he is stood in silhouette against the setting sun are fantastic. It contains all you'd expect from a big monster movie, a great cast, exciting action scenes and a fantastic 'monster'. Samuel L. Jackson's character 'Packard', is so consumed by rage over the death of the soldiers under his command, that his determination to exact revenge actually makes him the real villain of the movie. Conrad, Weaver and Marlow know that Kong is just defending himself and his own island home, and is not the 'monster' Packard believes he is and there is a nice moment when Weaver attempts to 'connect' with the ape in order to gain his trust and make him understand they are not all there to hurt him. Do not expect a 'Fay Wray damsel-in-distress' type of relationship between Weaver and Kong though, which is actually a relief and I genuinely don't think it would have worked in this movie. The director has definitely set out to make a great movie here, and with easily noticeable references to toward Apocalypse Now (it actually feels like he has tried to make a Vietnam War film crossed with the monster movie genre). The CGI and motion-capture Kong is incredible, and actually quite believable (but I will maintain that the ape we saw in Peter Jackson's 2005 movie was far better). The cinematography is very impressive and the story works very well. What lets this film down dramatically though is the script, and you never find yourself caring about any of the human characters. There is hardly any chance to get to know, or connect with, most of the characters before they are killed off. The only two characters that genuinely stood-out for me were Packard, and Marlow (played brilliantly by John C. Reilly). Jackson as always is terrific and John C. Reilly's performance of the castaway airman Marlow just steals every scene he's in. He has some of the funniest lines too. Unfortunately Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, both great actors, aren't given enough to do here to really make an impact, and John Goodman's character is killed off so quickly, that his early scenes battling for belief and co-operation from his bosses seemed a waste of time. This film doesn't pull any punches in its violence, and there are a couple of deaths that happen that were pretty gruesome. However, having said that, most of the violence is similar in style to that of Jurassic Park – gruesome and cruel, but more fun than horrific. There is a post-credit scene that sets the groundwork for the forthcoming merge of the 'monster-verse', with a new Godzilla film and even a 'Godzilla vs. Kong' movie in the works. Apart from obviously milking the franchises for all the dollars they can earn, I don't understand the Hollywood's obsession with merging various 'universes' of movies. Scenes in the recent 'Mummy' remake with Tom Cruise, scream out that is has been made as an introductory movie to a new franchise of horror 'monsters' (Dracula, The Invisible Man and Jekyll & Hyde). It has been 12 years since the last 'Kong Kong' film, and I personally believe that this could have been better. Kong doesn't need to have his own franchise 'universe'. This could have been a spectacular stand-alone movie but it was hampered by undeveloped characters and a weak script. Despite this though, 'Kong: Skull Island' is a good and entertaining film. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has set out to bring a visually spectacular and thrilling monster movie to the screens, and he has definitely delivered."
"jackvhorbst","10","0","1","11 June 2017"," Great VFX, simple yet awesome story and also great work by actors
","This is actually one of the best VFX movies you can see. The best thing is you do not have to wait for an hour or so for the Kong to appear, he is there since the beginning. Samuel Jackson did the justice to his character by making a lot of people despised his character in the movie . Of course that was a pretty bad and lame decision made by them to go to the other side to search for their comrade but it was a decision made by a commander who lost his men. He was a veteran who lost his mind so it pretty much summed up and made a good story overall. Things might be predictable but still with some new crisps. One of the best thing that even Kong had a backstory and it was quite emotional so it would attach the viewer with him. A great movie to watch especially with your family and kids. I must say a 10 on 10."

","... And the cinematic universe-supported by Godzilla, King Kong and other legendary monsters-has been opened, and what way to start, my God!<br/><br/>The titanic anthropoid made history by climbing the Empire State Building by the hand of Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack in 1933—a period in which the Great Depression, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party braising their ominous horrors—and returned in two opportunities more to steal the show: the first one was in 1976, directed by John Guillermin; and the second one, about seventeen years ago, thanks to Peter Jackson, a filmmaker who did well by bringing back (in part) gigantic mammal's dignity with such super production, which was returning to its roots and resumed the reinvention of Disney fundamental work ""Beauty and The Beast"", it interpreted as ""Beauty and The Monster"". This year, the most acclaimed movie monster (which shares glory with Godzilla) comes back with the financial aid of Warner Bros. and Legendary, in a story must not be weighted as reboot, remake or sequel, quite the contrary, it approaches to area prequels based on 2005 blockbuster, since it's situated in the 1970s, with the Vietam War as a backdrop, and the Skull Island as a unique setting for unwinding sensational action, with no need for reinterpreting for the nth time the melodrama starring by Fay Wray at that time; aspect which is replaced fully by the violent silhouette of an animal embedded in an orange sunset. Tangible entertainment and human beings predilection to think that nature belongs to them, merge into the pleasures of a voracious struggle of man Vs nature<br/><br/>Certainly, King Kong is the legitimate star, however, because of the atmosphere in where the film is placed, he'll have to share the limelight with visually terrifying superb beings, which straight out of the pages of ""The Lost World"" by Arthur Conan Doyle: modernized pterodactyls, huge cephalopods, irate arachnids and bipedal reptiles of disproportionate scale compone the majestic venerable natural panorama (Vietnam and Hawaii) and model on the screen at once, offering a strong battle coprotagonized by the unwary human characters. They come as explorers, an expedition upheld by Randa (John Goodman), an insatiable researcher who yearns to validate his theory about mythological creatures. A guide (Tom Hiddleston), a war photographer (Brie Larson), and a squad of ex-combatants from Vietnam, captained by disheartening lieutenant colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) will be compelled to initiate a field fight for survival, another war, only this time the opponent isn't something of their kind.<br/><br/>It's a tremendous feat what Warner has forged for all fans of kaiju- eiga and overall mass. ""Skull Island"" is the unreservedly uprising to B movies, which, here, has a case of mega-production. GRANDILOQUENT, this is the exact concept to define fiction adventure-action film; each of its technical aspects is unspeakable, accurate for a tenacious spectator who delights with an irresistible comfit containing low in calories in its script, disproportion replaced by the aesthetic glucose portion that many other pre-summer movies only dream of. It's a fruition and a preeminent advancement for CGI used in films like these ones; undergo trepidation, fun, adrenaline, dismay, the blood, the paradises, live and direct shuddering and hand-to-hand conflagrations by such technological resource, it'll astound audience, where two- hour run-time passes at the speed of light since we spend the time venerating, literally, marvelous photography of Larry Fong.hits compilation of yesteryear by Henry Jackman, formidable production work of Stefan Dechant and laborious activity in the editing room coordinated by Richard Pearson; all technical elements have to be exalted into any film competition, it's undeniable.<br/><br/>The film runs with a most peculiar kind of narrative balance, that in essence, is both strong and weak point. From appreciable courtesies to Francis Ford Coppola's classic (""Apocalypse Now"") to remembrances with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" directed by Steven Spielberg due to design molds for Hiddleston's character. Performances, in part, are well made, however, the privations of the story-line are the biggest hindrances faced by the actors and story. Don't expect neither ontological dialogs nor outstanding twists in the varied narrative arches and poorly scanned sub-plots, you must be mentally prepared to enjoy sensational long takes; any script contrariety is vague at the instant a beast warns its arrival. It's an anthological cast, deplorably, of all the ethnic ranges present in the movie, not more than two people are memorable: ironic and tyrannical Samuel L. Jackson, in a role of a lieutenant who defends fiercely, his ideology:""man is king"" and the comical counterpart, John C. Reilly, who'll have a few functional lines. While poor motivations in its development are unambiguous, they reach to peek a critique in defense of nature and animals and a subliminal antiwar revolution, nevertheless, these are only inwardly observable.<br/><br/>Jordan Vogt-Roberts has manufactured a collage of luxurious and pompous action-adventure sequences with his second work, it links you with the mammal monster from the very first moment, because of its rare avis technical conceptions. This time, the filmmaker has really carved out his path with such mega-production, and we must keep an eye on him since his film-making fashion coincides with audience's predilections and between ourselves, with considerable fragments of my idealized filming style. In the breathless beginning, the motion picture shows signs of what we are about to witness, a mosaic of sublime frames guided by a fierce timing, which is impaired by the meager development containing the plots of characters. If ""Skull Island"" is the preliminary film that opens MonsterVerse of Warner Bros., I don't even sketch how a Godzilla sequel (""King of Monsters"") or mega-event between King Kong and Godzilla-homologous Marvel's ""Civil War""-will be like. Roberts' King Kong is directly proportional to the visual and aesthetic impressions, however, manifests imbalance with regard to script barriers. High-octane entertainment, where monsters are kings and humans are harmless preys."

","""Hold on to your butts."" - The inimitable Samuel L. Jackson<br/><br/>It is the age of cinematic universes – collecting individual properties under franchise umbrellas is practically commonplace. We can now anticipate the likes of Godzilla and King Kong clashing in cinemas for our enjoyment. That already happened? In 1962, you say?<br/><br/>Ahem. Dubbed the ""MonsterVerse"" by Legendary Pictures, giant monsters resurface from some unspecified primordial age to stomp and munch on humans, and otherwise make a mess of civilization. Three years following 2014's Hollywood rendition of Godzilla comes Kong: Skull Island. A journey through jungles, testing camaraderie, pitting man (and woman) against nature. Think of it as Jurassic Park meets Apocalypse Now. Minus the profundity of Copolla's film. And with less notable characters than the one with dinosaurs. Well, I tried.<br/><br/>The Vietnam War is the backdrop here, complete with not one but two Credence Clearwater Revival songs. A soldier platoon is commissioned to safeguard a small team of scientists on a mission to chart a newly discovered island. Skull Island, they call it. You already knew that. Additionally, a no-nonsense tracker and an anti-war photojournalist are recruited for their expertise. They beset upon the island aboard an aircraft carrier, then proceed through a perpetually raging storm – wait, I'm sure this flock of helicopters couldn't possibly have fit on deck...<br/><br/>All the more humans to die horribly for our enjoyment, I suppose.<br/><br/>Before long, Kong is spectacularly revealed, which will surely persist as one of the most memorable events from the movie. A colossus of manlike shape blotting out the setting sun, Kong swats down the helicopters with effortless brutality. Watching the metal crumble in his hands just might bring a devilish grin to your face.<br/><br/>The visual effects are vaguely cartoonish. Bold saturated colors and some blatant use of green screen. Once I became accustomed to it I appreciated the stylization. It's a preferable aesthetic when compared to the drab, washed out look typically seen in modern blockbusters. In fact, I'd say it's in harmonious marriage with the breakneck tonal shifts of the film.<br/><br/>Now stranded on the island, as consequence of Kong's wrath, the fractured group must make it to a far off evacuation site if they want any hope of survival. The island proves far more treacherous than they could have foreseen. Over-sized insects and reptiles pluck their lives away like delicate petals.<br/><br/>The monsters are varied and many. Things that fly and swarm. That lumber, docile. Or pursue hungrily. You will witness Kong grapple a giant octopus and pummel scaly, skull faced creatures. If you came looking for monster action then rest assured this aspect of the film is faultless. It's a consistently thrilling showcase of kaiju combat. The climactic battle, in particular, made me feel like a giddy child smashing action figures against each other. I mean that in the most positive sense.<br/><br/>The human side of the film is not as arresting. Characterization is mostly obvious and familiar. It's certainly a better than average effort but I never found myself particularly invested. The characters are, at the very least, defined. And juggling this many, that's more of a compliment than it sounds. Note that none of them escape the shadow of Kong, who is an ever imposing figure.<br/><br/>The actors play their parts accordingly, but some are sadly underutilized (John Goodman for example). The standouts being Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly. The character of Packard and his downward spiral are excellently captured by Jackson's biting temperament.<br/><br/>What could easily slip into melodrama is often countered by humor. Many jokes miss their target, however. Nothing truly unforgivable, except maybe when a certain character labels the craft he's riding in a ""ploat."" It's a boat made out of plane scrap. Yup.<br/><br/>On the topic of humor, I had my concerns for John C. Reilly's role based off trailers. I predicted nothing more than one-note comic relief, but was pleasantly proved wrong. He quickly became the most endearing of the bunch. A man stranded on the island after an ill- fated dogfight during the heat of World War II. The years of unhealthy encounters with the island's monstrous inhabitants, the distance from the civilization he most understood, and prolonged contact with the unsociable natives, turned him more than a little odd. At times a man of congeniality, at others a man of dubious quality. Some times even adorable.<br/><br/>Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts presents his diverse influences, sprinkling in tasteful homages to Neon Genesis Evangelion and Metal Gear (among others). Expect nods to the original King Kong as well, including the big ape liberating himself from chains and the requisite ""beauty and the beast"" moment.<br/><br/>For a movie absolutely stuffed to capacity, that it withstands its own weight is a wonder. Driven by a director with clear passion, Kong: Skull Island is seductive; a ceaseless cataclysm of monster action. Unless you have a predisposed affection for giant monsters there's a good chance you'll be unfulfilled by this offering. Otherwise, what you get is a fearless tribute to Kong and his ilk.<br/><br/>Verdict: Moderately High Recommendation<br/><br/>For more reviews check out http://unsleepinghorror.com/"

","I'm not going to go into why this movie is not as good as it should be. Apart from the fact they have totally miscast some characters (Hiddleston especially) and the movies saving grace was John C Reilly, Kong: Skull Island was actually pretty entertaining.<br/><br/>I went into this knowing it'd be very Hollywood, so I expected nothing less. Why people were expecting more is beyond me. We knew the characters would be clichéd. We knew that Kong would reign supreme. We knew we'd see a load of weird creatures (one thing I hate about the Kong story is the creatures, but I know it has to be there). The story is what it is, it was never going to be some superb script up for Oscars and stuff. Yes, Hiddleston and Larson are beautiful people so we knew they would just be there for eye candy. All I wanted to see was a good Monster Movie, and luckily for me I got it.<br/><br/>The story reminded me of Jurassic Park 3. Lots of things were similar, with the Kong spin. Someone lures them all to the Island for one reason, then knowingly tells them it was all for a different reason. They go on the hunt for someone on the Island. There was even a boat they used to try to escape and a few other nods too. It was all very similar to me, but obviously a lot better.<br/><br/>Reilly stole the show when he eventually showed up. Hiddleston was a horrendous choice, but I usually like him. Jackson just turns up anywhere nowadays, so his presence in films now really doesn't excite me.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie does what it sets out to do. No it isn't perfect but if you go into it expecting a classic, you will be disappointed. One thing I will say is I much preferred this to the 2005 Kong. Apart from the small snippet where Kong came to NYC in the 2005 version, the rest of that movie for me was terrible."

The Peter Jackson interpretation of the original King Kong, it's probably my favorite three hour movie. But I do love it case in point. Later I saw the original and the second Kaiju film I saw in theaters was Pacific Rim and well you know what was third. After the success of Godzilla 2014 it seems that legendary pictures decided to go ahead and bring the second cinematic universe in film history the monsterverse. In this new iteration of Kong, Bill Randa of Monarch is given the go-ahead to go to Skull Island with a military escort. When they get there however they drop bombs unleashing monsters that killed Kong's family. Kong trashes the planes and destroys most of Colonel Packards men. James Conard teams up with Mason Weaver and a few others who crashed near them and learn about the island and Kong with the help of Hank Marlow who's been stuck on Skull Island since 1944. When they meet up with Colonel Packard and a few of his men they go searching for Jack but with the Skullcrawlers on the surface now it's up to Kong to protect them. This classical b-movie monster goodness. A major complaint fans had with the 2014 Godzilla was that they kept cutting the fights off and he was barley in the movie. You have nothing to worry about here folks when Kong's on screen, he's on screen and it's awesome! People complained that the human characters weren't that interesting but then again they're not boring so... yeah. The actors were great too. There were some silly moments like when Kong's about to eat someone and then it cuts to a guy eating a sandwich. The world of Skull Island is just incredible it was very cool that they shot on location and then in studio for the monster effects. This is by far my favorite iteration of Kong, it was great fun fantastical romp that was classic b-movie monster goodness with epic fights, decent acting and nice shots of the beautiful locations. I'm giving Kong: Skull Island a five out of five."

How was the film?<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film. Great CGI, along with great action, and set pieces. Only thing setting this apart from being much greater is the cinematography and characters(besides three of them).<br/><br/>The cinematography doesn't do much to distinguish the size of the characters and the size of Kong. To many times you'll question the scope is uneven and is noticeable. <br/><br/>And for the characters. Most of them are have no room to layer themselves in the plot. They're mostly your run of the mill, disaster team built squad of characters. Find the island, put together team, got to island, no connection but to survive, etc.<br/><br/>But the best characters within the film is the WWII pilot portrayed by John C. Reilly(Hank Marlow), John Goodman(Bill Randa), and believe or not, Samuel L. Jackson(Preston Packard).<br/><br/>John C. Reilly stills the show as the most lovable character. He is what glues the other characters together once he enters the scene. John Goodman, underutilized as he was, still makes good use of his screen time. And Sam Jackson portrays a really good broken captain in a battle between man and beast<br/><br/>I recommend this film if your wanting to see an excitingly good monster flick. 8/10"

","Did they really have Richard Nixon bobbleheads back in the day? Man, I bet those are worth some cash now! <br/><br/>This is just great escapist fun, don't see why it would need nitpicking at all, it was created to entertain, and it does. I love the original and the remakes and this maintains and improves on the grandeur of Kong in some ways.<br/><br/>Much more action than most Kong movies and the more modern setting is responsible for a few jokes and one heck of a soundtrack. Kong is physically much larger and impressive and there is a sweet story of a missing soldier that runs throughout.<br/><br/>Sit back, watch Kong flex his muscles and kick some ass and just have fun!"

"TopRanking","7","0","1","12 April 2017"," I ended up with mixed feelings.
","Loved Kong ever since I had the book when I was a kid. But the movie is enjoyable enough for sure because it's action-packed from start to finish.<br/><br/>Love Kong, he is a lot bigger and he stand more like a human. It kinda makes him more like a super ape than the 2005 version where he is an average ape but bigger and stronger. The action is great, the helicopter scene and the fights. Just the ridiculous sword scene was not needed at all. This is not the matrix universe. A little over the top.<br/><br/>Now the biggest thing this version missed out on, was a real connection between Kong and the girl. It is included in the movie and no there is no scream what makes him connect to her. And if I recall correctly a connection of 10 seconds. The 2005 version does that way better but in a lengthy run time. It was better to just leave it out completely and just put it in a follow up because Kong is growing this is just a teenage Kong. Or was it just teenage love at first sight, that could be it! <br/><br/>The acting was not great. John C Reily did the best job and was not even the main character, but he did have the deepest story line of all characters. Also Compton was represented. The lines of the soldiers where not funny. Was it intended to be funny? It wasn't. The acting was a bit to scripted.<br/><br/>The movie could do better with some better lines. But it's full of action and it delivers a different Kong movie!"
"Quietb-1","6","0","1","11 April 2017"," Big ape with a big heart.
","You know what you are getting into by the title. So if King Kong taking on nasty animals in jungle Isn't of interest stay away.<br/><br/>The movie has a very well paced beginning. Things slow down at Skull Island and thankfully nobody decides Kong would do better ice skating in New York.<br/><br/>The cast is serviceable and it is hard to compete with the big ape. Things pick up when John C. Reilly is on screen. The locations look good, the CGI animals are nothing special.<br/><br/>The movie looks good on the big screen and should be seen in a theater with good sound. There is an after credit sequence that isn't worth the wait through the lengthy credits. Basically some talking sets up a possible sequel. Do we need another Kong movie?"
"herbie051960","6","0","3","10 April 2017"," Not quite right
","I watched, I enjoyed, but it didn't quite flow, the connection of characters didn't seem right, people i saw early appeared later and I thought ""where had they been""? It seemed there was a fleeting attempt to connect Kong with the female lead (twice maybe), but was I expecting too much after the previous Kong movie and remakes *2. I think new audience's will enjoy, but if you haven't seen the previous 3 which are all based on the same story, take the time to see them, the 2005 version is my favourite."
"midas-jacobs","6","0","1","9 April 2017"," ""Kong: Skull Island"" contains enjoyable action scenes, but is lacking in characters
","A team has discovered an unknown island and was sent to that place to research it. But at arrival they entered the domain of Kong <br/><br/>Jordan Vogt-Roberts was the director of this film and he also wasn't really the problem of the film. Visually this film looks good, but that's also the best the film has to offer. The color grading was good enough and gave it a more vintage look and the cinematography overall was pretty good. The director had somewhat sense of scale, because he liked to put a human, as tiny as possible into the frame with Kong, who is ginormous in comparison to said human portrayed on screen. But that immediately brings me to one of the problems of the film: Kong. Well, how he looked at least, because even though he didn't visually look good, the scenes with him in them were the best that you can find in the film. Kong just looked very CGI to me, and he was the best looking CGI creature in the movie. This film is filled with moments in which the CGI is overwhelming. If they'd used more props, or went to location a bit more, this would've changed the movie quite a bit. Especially in the night scenes you could see that they were filmed in a set and that the backdrop consisted out of a green screen. And sometimes the film also goes into the ridiculous department with the CGI by showing the northern lights. Yes, the northern lights, you read that right. I know that they went on location numerous times, but some scenes then were shot in complete green rooms. Another aspect the movie failed at was the tone. It tried to be a drama, and action film, an over the top action film, a comedy, a serious film and all these things did not fit together at all. Often enough it tried to be taken seriously, when just unintentional funny stuff was going on, or it tried to be funny, when there was just nothing to laugh at.<br/><br/>The actors were just doing what the script was offering them, which is not a lot. The cast of this film is phenomenal, but underused. They have Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Toby Kebbell, Samuel Jackson, John C. Reilly, John Goodman The list goes on and on. All actors gave good performances, and were only likable due to their natural charisma. Samuel Jackson and John C. Reilly only managed to make their jokes work because of their on screen charisma. But some actors also had no chemistry together on screen and those were the little group of soldiers who were under Samuel Jackson's command. None of them felt like they liked each other and their relationship felt forced from the beginning.<br/><br/>The screenplay was the main problem with this film, because dear god, what did they do with the characters? Well, the characters that don't exist, because I've just watched two hours of hollow, empty, characterless human beings interact with each other, interchanged with some awesome scenes of Kong. But they had set up some things to create some interesting character, yet they completely forget about those things. In the beginning of the film for example we see Samuel Jackson's character with a bottle of alcohol, and he seems to be distant in the conversation he's having, which in my opinion insinuates the fact that he might be an alcoholic after the Vietnam War, but they never do anything with that set up character trait throughout the whole movie. The character of Toby Kebbell was given some character by having him write to his son, which practically made him together with John C. Reilly the most developed characters of them all, and the film has quite a lot of characters. John C. Reilly was stranded on the island for a very long time and we get to hear a bit about his past, but most of the time we get to re-hear what he has said before, so that really didn't add a lot to his character. Tom Hiddelston's character is just there to be cool, he's a tracker and that's pretty much all to his character. There's one scene where he talks about his past with Brie Larson, but that scene added very little to me caring for that character. There's also this ridiculous scene involving him in which he just asks for a sword and starts chopping things up, while magically having put on a gasmask with one hand, just to create one badass, senseless looking shot, which wasn't worth it at all. And if you want to know something more about Brie Larson's character: she's a photographer. The dialogue overall was just fine, there were some cheesy one liners, and bad jokes, but as a whole, it didn't achieve much.<br/><br/>In the end ""Kong: Skull Island"" wasn't a good movie at all, it was quite disappointing even. The acting was good and the action scenes were enjoyable, but the characters were lacking and the CGI wasn't the greatest. That's why this film gets just a 5.6/10."
"vellachsamie","7","0","1","8 April 2017"," Kong looks like 50 cents
","The movie is just as good as all the Hollywood top movies. Goodman and Jackson act out their parts in the typical Hollywood movie where the impossible seems natural. But more interestingly for me, Kong looks like 50 cents. I wonder if 50 cents helped in the animation as actors often do for animated movies. Kong look so much alike that I thought at any time, Kong could start singing."
"Gresh854","4","0","3","7 April 2017"," A Film That Contains Some Extremely Entertaining King Kong Throwdown Scenes, But Has Everything Else At A Dull
","I kept an open mind going into this film considering the trailers caught my attention since they made the film look extremely energetic, but there still was a possibility of this film flunking. I know it kills me to say this since I actually wanted this film to be solid, but I honestly think Skull Island was mediocre at best. This is an action film that is full of some super entertaining monster and of course King Kong action, destruction scenes, but in its entirety, it was a very flawed film. Now what I did however like about this film were a couple of things. One was the whole idea of the Skull Island aspect. All the monsters in this movie look super cool and have a very intensifying aspect to them that caught my attention. A majority of these monsters also have some pretty cool chaos scenes. Also Kong in this film had some pretty cool moments of destruction particularly the first time you see Kong. The scene lasts around 5 minutes and it is glorious, I absolutely loved that scene. Now that I've got that out of the way, I'm going to tell you why this film really didn't work for me. This film feels like it was rushed. For one the characters in this film are extremely poorly developed, I honestly couldn't care about any of them. The acting in the film from most of the actors and actresses, were for the most part really good. It's just that there was nothing for me to latch onto, or relate to with these characters since they have such vague character development. There is no sense of suspense when these characters are in danger, because I really couldn't care if they died, and that was hugely disappointing in my opinion. The only character that was slightly developed was surprisingly, John C Reily's character. Even so, John C Reily's character still didn't have that much of a pull on me, he was just the only character the film actually tries to make you care about. Now one thing that really upset me was Samuel's Jackson's character. Now I am a huge Samuel Jackson fan I've loved almost all of his performances in every film he's been in even the bad ones. For the first time ever I actually think I have found a Samuel Jackson role I have hated. Samuel Jackson's character in this film at first is just alright, but then he progressively becomes this over the top, un-charismatic, and unintelligent character who does some really stupid decisions with his military men, that bothered me so much. Something else that really bothered me in this film was the comedy. For me at least, 10% of the jokes land, and they are actually pretty funny. The other 90%, feels extremely forced. Almost every single scene in this film is always trying to be funny and it just got super annoying and repetitive after a while. This film also contains a really good soundtrack, with some extremely good 70s war songs. Well, unfortunately this movie decides to play these songs whenever they want at the most random times. Kind of like Suicide Squad, the soundtrack is good, but the way they interconnect that soundtrack with the film is done poorly. Also, some of the editing and plot points in this film are done a bit poorly. The editing isn't choppy too many times in this film, but when it is it's very noticeable. There are also some really bad green screen usage in this film. Some of the green screen looked really fake. This film at times looks very artificial an unrealistic, and I really wish they actually used natural backgrounds more often for this film. Even some of the CGI looks bad at times, which is bad considering this film mostly relies on CGI. But by far my hugest complaint about this film is without a doubt, the final decision that happens at the very end of the film. I have scene many movies in my life, but the certain decision that a couple of characters make towards the end, is one of the most random, unanswered, and pointless decisions, I have ever seen on film. I don't want to spoil it in case you haven't watched the film but when you see the film you'll know it. Hint, its the extremely random decision that is made ""after"" another group makes a stupid decision. My final flaw with this film is that at times it tries to be Jurassic Park. I know I shouldn't compare a film like Jurassic Park, with a simple monster movie like this one but I need to mention this. A couple of scenes in this movie are almost exact rip offs of scenes from Jurassic Park, and if you've scene Jurassic Park you will most likely know what scenes I'm talking about. Guys, Girls, I don't think I have to say anymore, Kong Skull Island was a huge disappointment. Right now at the time I'm writing this review, it's got a 77% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 7.1 on IMDb. To be honest I don't understand why this film is getting solid praise, especially from critics, but honestly if you like this movie, good for you, I am legitimately happy for you. To me though, I honestly found Kong Skull Island to be a huge mess that contained some really awesome monster destruction scenes thrown into it. If you like films like Transformers or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, you might like this film cause it falls under the same line as a mindless CGI extreme action festive. I'm going to give Kong Skull Island a grade of a C- and a IMDb score of a 5/10."
"addisonwhughes","6","0","3","5 April 2017"," As hollow as the Planet in this Earth- But Still Pretty Exciting
","Well, I didn't expect much from this movie. A reboot, the only film tied to it the woefully underdone and idiotic Godzilla. A set up for a Marvel movie ripoff franchise spanning multiple movie series and many, many, inside jokes. Going in, I expected to be fully disgusted by the blinding greed that went into such a movie. And while I was not altogether incorrect in my belief that it would be a horrible film, I was incorrect in my assumption that it would show as little monster and be as soul crushingly boring as it's predecessor.<br/><br/>The plot was quite lacking, laid out as more of a grim necessity than a moving story. The film appeared to be missing even up to an entire half hour of exposition, introducing characters as if we were supposed to know them. <br/><br/>In addition, human aspect of this film was a little weak, featuring Brie Larson and Tom Hiddleston in a half-baked romance plot as a device to cram as many Marvel actors as possible. In addition, John Goodman continues his trend of serious characters in vaguely non serious movies, and Samuel L. Jackson once again Stars as Nick Fury (sorry, wrong franchise. You get my drift though)<br/><br/>Packing several clichés as well as movie tie-ins, this film has several scientific inequities (the earth is hollow? Wow! Plot! Exposition) and weird coincidences (the organization in this movie is the same organization as in Godzilla? Wow! More Exposition).<br/><br/>However, it delivered heavily as a beat em up monster movie. So, it's fine I guess."
"jackpenmanreid","8","0","3","3 April 2017"," Great at what it does
","Went to see Kong: Skull Island with a friend yesterday and thought it was great. The cinematography as a whole was great and there's some fantastic shots in the film. The best thing about this film is that it knows what it is, it's a big dumb monster film and it excels at being that. The dialogue is shockingly bad for most of the film and the acting is sub-standard so if you're going into this film expecting anything more than giant monsters fighting each other then you should probably go elsewhere. The action is great and there's some inventive camera shots. Even though I have said the acting is poor the film still has a great cast. The two problems I have with this movie is it lacked any kind of suspense leading up to Kong's reveal and I also thought it ended abruptly. I thought the soundtrack was great too. There's also an after credits scene which is worth staying for too. Overall I would recommend this as it's exactly what it says on the tin, big dumb fun with giant monsters that you can just switch off for 2 hours and enjoy."

","I was pleasantly surprised by Kong. I expected a movie dominated by endless CGI creatures – but was only about 1/3 correct. And speaking of thirds, the first third of the movie borrows heavily from Apocalypse Now, lacking only the smell of napalm in the morning.<br/><br/>The movie features a diverse and interesting cast, and (SPOILER ALERT) you never know who is going to get killed off next. John C. Reilly is easily the most interesting character, followed by Samuel Jackson and John Goodman.<br/><br/>Tian Jing has a fair amount of screen time, but only 11 lines in the entire movie. Since the Brie Larson is the only other woman in the cast, I suspect Jing was added to offset some of the testosterone.<br/><br/>The movie is visually quite clever and the CGI is mostly in service of the plot. Except when the giant lizards show up, including in an extended fight scene that literally refuses to die.<br/><br/>See it now if you like this kind of movie. Otherwise, wait for the DVD and just fast-forward past the lizards."

","I hope I wasn't the only one who was excited to see Kong: Skull Island. I wasn't disappointed, nor was I impressed. The movie was what I thought it was going to be. Allow me to go further.<br/><br/>Synopsis: A diverse team of scientists, soldiers and adventurers unite to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific, as dangerous as it is beautiful. Cut off from everything they know, the team ventures into the domain of the mighty Kong, igniting the ultimate battle between man and nature. As their mission of discovery becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape a primal Eden in which humanity does not belong. Starring: Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman Director: Jordan Vogt-Roberts<br/><br/>First thing: How many Marvel actors can this put in this one movie? Apparently there are rumors out there that Mr. Goodman is going to be part of the MCU here soon as well. You will not hear me complain about that.<br/><br/>So, let's get the vegetables out of the way. There are two things that hurt the movie more than anything else. One was that almost all the action scenes were made to be slo-mo. All it did was add time to the movie. If the action would have been normal speed there could have been ten minutes taken out. Sure, the slo-mo was able to add more to the scenes, but it just became senseless after a while.<br/><br/>The other thing was the initial humor. The un-initial humor was okay, but when people tried to be funny in the movie, it only hurt. I know John C. Reilly was added for the humor, but it didn't work in the long run.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie? Sam L. Jackson. Sure, you can tell what he was going to do from the time you saw him first pop up on the screen, but it was fun waiting for it. He played the part perfectly.<br/><br/>The other actors, aside from Mr. Reilly, were good in their roles. Tom and Brie played off each other quite well. Sadly we won't get to see them together in another movie. I'll explain that in a minute.<br/><br/>Maybe if the director wouldn't have used the slo-mo so much I would say he did a good job. But he didn't, so I won't.<br/><br/>The story was perfect for what they were trying to do. They set up the MonsterVerse, as they call it at the production company, in the right way. Using the full name for M.U.T.O. confused quite a few people. Not to toot my own horn, but: toot-toot. I understood what was happening from the second I heard the full name. The after- credits scene only solidified what was happening.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Watch the movie. It is a fun movie. Of course, watch Godzilla first, then watch this movie. You'll thank yourself for that.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10"

"peefyn","6","0","2","29 March 2017"," A good looking monster movie
","There's not much more to this than ""a good looking monster movie"". More specifically it's a movie about people stuck in an unexplored habitat where they face pre-historic monsters. It's not really a remake of King Kong, because it leaves out most (if not all) iconic moments from the previous versions, and it also tells a story completely of its own.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie is, beyond a doubt, the visuals. There are some glorious shots in this movie, and perhaps the best ones being those that are obviously influenced by previous media set in the Vietnam war era. The creature design is also really neat. King Kong is massive, and he's also definitely not an ape as we know them. They've taken more inspiration from the old doll (from the first movie), than the more natural looking Kong from Jackson's remake. And it works really well! There's other creatures as well, some of them quite neat and interesting. Some of them I would have loved to see more of, but the ""skullcrawlers"" (which are highlights as an important enemy) are disappointing design wise. They look like a generic baddie in a monster film.<br/><br/>The plot itself is OK, but there's nothing really special or interesting about it. There are some great performances, but also some talent that is completely wasted in roles with hardly any airtime."
"david-klompas","6","0","2","29 March 2017"," Solid attempt at transcending genre
","It isn't often that an action film which tries to defy its genre actually succeeds in doing so. Kong: Skull Island happens to come pretty close to succeeding.<br/><br/>A fascinating prologue rewrites some history and sets up an alternate universe in which the existence of a massive gorilla seems somewhat plausible. <br/><br/>Brie Larson (the Room star who blew audiences away with her performance of a mother forced to raise a child under terrible constraint) gives a wonderful performance which plays a large part in lifting this film out of the trash heap. At first, I was skeptical about her choice to take on the role of Mason Weaver. But after a breathtaking helicopter scene, her presence begins to make sense: Larson clearly sought a fun role after the depressing elements of Room. And she is able to have fun while still bringing a sense of immense presence through a performance that will have audiences laughing out loud. Her co-star, Tom Hiddleston, is equally funny as a witty tracker looking for riches. The final piece of the puzzle is a wonderful performance by Samuel L. Jackson as a vigilante of sorts. <br/><br/>Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts does a good job of pulling this all together. But the real star of the show behind the scenes was the sound technician for giving the film one of the greatest soundtracks since films like Watchmen and games like Mass Effect reignited my belief in the film soundtrack as an art. <br/><br/>The result is an exciting return to Kong's universe that reignites an otherwise wilting franchise. Audiences of most persuasions will appreciate this as a strong entry into the annals of genre-defying action cinema."
"yetiwestin","7","0","2","28 March 2017"," Kong is back, but that's about it..
","King Kong is one of the most recognizable monsters of all time, and Kong: Skull Island definitely brings him back to his throne. If you want to see the most cinematically impressive Kong to date then this is your movie, but if you want anything more story wise you might be a bit let down. The 1933 Kong is a cinematic masterpiece, and the 1976 remake is good in its own right. The 2005 Peter Jackson version was a solid representation of Kong using the newest technology and effects, but still staying relativity true to the story. Understanding that Kong: Skull island is not a remake, but a reboot for future Legendary Pictures monster brawls will help some story confusion. This is not the same Kong as those previous, and it does not follow the old story lines. <br/><br/>Kong: Skull Island's story had a good amount of promise, the problem is the script and characters did not fit. Samuel L. Jackson and John Goodman have their usual screen presence, but the characters they are portraying are not ones we as the audience generally care about. None of the other characters are worth much either, besides being food for the many monstrous residents of Skull Island. <br/><br/>This version of Kong however is impressive. Easily the most destructive, aggressive, and largest Kong to date. When Kong is on the screen the movie is awesome. Great visual effects and camera angles really give the action some impact. Kong is what holds this movie together and makes it at least a decent entry into the franchise."
"colby-95131","7","0","2","28 March 2017"," All Hail The King
","Human nature dictates two things to fear the unknown and learn how to survive. Kong, presented as heroic as any mythological creature could be is so much more than just an over-sized ape. Below are a few of the ancient reasons why we Kong will always be King:<br/><br/>Jungle Fever: Skull Island is one the surface unlike anything else on planet earth as we see an array of inhabitants each living their lives to the sound of one drum beat. I felt enamoured at times with depth of Kong's home turf although some of it did feel like a music video due to off- beat yet comical acting. CGI is pretty much the only way I'll ever be able to experience what seeing Kong in the flesh might actually be like unless Big Foot comes out of retirement and releases an autobiography. The Island as a place I'll be honest is a little cliché' but that being said it works, sometimes the writing is on the wall in this scenario it's the pre-historic caveman-esque Frederick Flintstone drawings which really denote Kong as friend and not foe. The island itself is pretty a much homage to Apocalypse Now, but we do get elements of Bear Grylls/Ray Mears seep through. Based loosely on Vietnam this jungle definitely makes you consider what you may need in a survival kit.<br/><br/>Guns and Roses: This is not a film which could produce an Oscar nominee on paper it has a strong cast with Hiddlestone, Goodman, J.C Reilly and Jackson. Although the wise man once said ""there's never smoke without fire"" that fire I'm referring to is more or less a campfire. On screen the actual dialogue between the characters in a serious sense is irrelevant as everyone has their own agenda and lives by their principles anyway. However, the comedic value at times produces genuine moments of laughter – honestly I almost spilt my popcorn over the person next to me. Okay that's a lie as nobody buys popcorn but I did laugh which is something I wasn't prepared for so kudos to the writers. At times I felt like I was watching actors being themselves instead of playing a fleshed out character, in other words Jackson just seemed assertive, loud and nonsensical. Whereas Hiddlestone was clearly using this as a stepping stone for an Indiana Jones comes James Bond audition as he was cool, calm and collective in situations where you might need to reach for the duvet. Goodman/Reilly began as serious characters but ended up as a Captain Jack Sparrow tribute act, although at times it was touching and felt slightly genuine. There are other male characters but they mostly became cannon fodder and didn't really leave a lasting impression only in a comical sense. Overall the guns a.k.a. the men gave an enjoyable performance which did at times create moments which will stick in the memory.<br/><br/>The only rose within this film was the empowering anti-war photographer which was played out by Brie Larson. I'll be honest I've seen stronger performances – the character had a brilliant start and came out the traps as smart, quick-witted and humorous. As per all (original) Hollywood flicks this wouldn't last long and there must be something in the air within the Jungle as she'd gone head-over-heels for Hiddleston's action man demeanour. Once the love-bug had been instilled her character just lost momentum serving as a backup dancer to Hiddlestone. Although Larson's character did come good once again giving a convincing and heartfelt moment with Kong.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump: Kong was at times like a kid in a toy store and other times a menacing, commanding and authoritative figure. The terrifying figure of Kong looms large but as does Kong's heart and soul which is frequently misunderstood (in order to reinforce fear) but deep down Kong has a lot of inner-demons. Skull Island's Kong is the best Kong I've seen in a long while this because we see a lot more of Kong that you might expect and he's been humanised to the point where you think he could be just a really hairy punter down at your local. Kong's heart of gold is exemplified as he wanders about aimlessly at times producing good-will acts for those around him almost similar to Earl in My Name is Earl. Humanising Kong destroys the reputation of the big-guy it's like seeing Uncle Phil cry over food in the Fresh Prince. Although humanising Kong and conquering man's fear of the unknown has always been the super-glue to the franchise without this element it would just be a cruel hunting show. Kong needs to do little to get people in awe and I feel this will always hold the behemoth in good stead, I really did enjoy the moments of intense drama Kong produced in this edition of his life story.<br/><br/>The Kings Speech: I definitely felt Kong's presence and I feel I'll Skull Island of the bucket list for now but in short, I feel Skull Island is a must see. There are moments of awe, humour and genuine high-quality drama which make you wince a little causing you to be throw popcorn wildly in the air. This franchise will never cease to amaze as the backbone of what makes Kong great is believable. Kong scores a loud and almost defining 7/10."

","From the people who were able to make a Godzilla movie with only 11 minutes of Godzilla, comes another reboot of cinemas other most iconic monsters, King Kong. Kong: Skull Island is directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts and stars Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, John C. Reilly and the list goes on and on and on. It's a solid blockbuster film but lacks any and all kinds of emotional engagement.<br/><br/>This reboot is not the classic empire-state-building-finale Kong everyone has come to know the giant gorilla by, but instead tells a rather self contained adventure story. Due to the nature of this narrative, the film is going to require a lot of CGI, prosthetic and anything and everything that can help bring monsters to life. I have to hand it to them, the films visuals are spot on, the visual effects as well as production design and cinematography, come together perfectly to make what is a very good looking movie.<br/><br/>The action sequences as well are well shot and edited and enjoyment is easy to be had, my own personal favourite scene involves giant skeletons/fossils, flammable soil and a digesting Camera. Need I say more. It's a very well directed scene and features a very interesting hint of the horror genre.<br/><br/>Although the film looks good and has well directed scenes, the film lacks a lot of substance as it doesn't have any developed characters at all, bar the exception of John C. Reilly. The film features an all star cast and distributes screen time as evenly as it can between them. Regardless, no one is given enough time for the audience to form an attachment with, and so everyone feels extremely disposable. Anyone, including Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson, could have died and I wouldn't have given a single f*ck. Personally, Tom Hiddleston was wrongly cast in this film, or needs to drop his natural posh boy voice, and put on American accent or anything remotely macho if he is to play the archetypal masculine hero role. This is a King Kong film so really the protagonist should be King f*cking Kong. Although the lack of focus on the title character isn't as bad as the Gareth Edwards Godzilla movie, it is however frustrating to have to follow the story of a bunch of disposable humans I don't care for.... It's Aaron Taylor Johnson all over again. Also I can't not talk about the Asian girl who was just there for God knows what reason, as well as Toby Kebbell's character being a walking, talking, eulogy writing cliché.<br/><br/>As well as having sh*tty characters, Kong: Skull Island has some pretty dumb moments, some of which are absolutely laugh out loud dumb. It's not 'The Fast and the Furious' level of dumb, but the film is stupid to progress the plot. One moment in particular, involving a lake, a rifle being dropped and a guy with two grenades, is just on a completely different level of dumb that I couldn't contain my laughter.<br/><br/>Overall, Kong: Skull Island has great style but zero substance. Visually stunning and well shot and directed action sequences, but focuses on uninteresting characters and is dumb for the sake of plot progression. It's an enjoyable, average blockbuster that subtly sets up a sequel and leaves you with anticipation for the second ever Godzilla vs Kong in 2020. Fingers crossed Legendary get it right."

","Kong: Skull Island is almost definitely the monster movie we have all be waiting for. Tom Hiddleston was the best part of this movie because he manages to fit into the role of a drunken soldier with a dark past. He and Brie Larson share a great chemistry which really shows in the scenes that they learn to survive together. John C. Riley's character was surprisingly hilarious.<br/><br/>The film does lack professional dialogue sometimes which makes it slightly cheesy. The CGI effects in this film are phenomenal despite the obvious green screen. They handled the decision of which characters that will die perfectly, there is a random ensemble cast that is eaten by skull crawlers. main deaths include The founder of Monarch, major Chapman and Colonel Packard. I do have a problem with the over the top gore for a PG-13 rating and the need to cringe when the spider's stomach is cut open and the scene when pterodactyls rip a guys arm off. I would like to know more about the past of some characters (we did find a bit about Conrad's past).<br/><br/>I will give Kong: Skull Island 7/10"

","The thing about Kong movies so far is that you either feel for Kong or the humans but this time I felt for both equally. The human characters are likable as heck, you just want most of them to survive. At the same time Kong is also likable because even though he doesn't speak you can really get his situation and either feel sorry for him or totally comprehend his nature. It touches a bit on Kong's backstory and it really builds up to a whole new world of extraordinary things while keeping you entertained with action, humor and intrigue. Nothing feels forced. I feared John C. Reilly would be too ""him"" but he's actually one of the characters I like the most. And even though they take time to build up chemistry and relationships it doesn't feel like it drags. Oh and when it's time to throw down they THROW DOWN!!!"

","Do we really need another Kong movie is probably the question you're asking yourself right now, but for a big-screen reboot, Jordan Vogt Roberts has managed to do the impossible – make it seem fresh and relevant to today. The director has re imagined the Kong myth, transporting him back to his home of Skull Island - an unexplored domain where monsters lurk under the surface. Kong Skull Island is an energetic, enthusiastic and unashamedly ridiculous spectacle that develops and expands upon the Kong myth A team of scientists explore an uncharted island in the Pacific, venturing into the domain of the mighty Kong, and must fight to escape a primal Eden Director:Jordan Vogt-Roberts I have never seen his other film but he does a great job creating a fun film and setting up an new franchises with Godzilla this film is fun and great action close up with Kong playing around attack the helicopters john c reilly who was from the 1940 attacking the japan and he gets stranded and he goes a bit oddball living with the natives I think SAM l Jackson character is usual action man style role playing up to the beast ingoring the fires and stuff want to have a go at the beast make it an interesting watch and surviving the weird creatures taking his band of merry army men with him and civilian tom hiddleston plays his usual action role like Nate from uncharted playing a touch Indiana Jones role so beating the crap out of animals and letting and helping the scientist out as a tracker this film is set in the 70s and it feels like it with a cool 70 themed music form Ziggy stardust and co so with john Goodman wacky scientist up to no good his character is shady and want monsters instead of scientific work brie Larson is stunning as a photographer as Kong has a soft spot for her and she gets stunning photo Kong is spectacular amazing fighting off weird dinosaurs wood creatures and and flying reptile monster all the weird one are here there is plenty of colourun to watch full thing with reillys character he is f attacks that when you are not expecting it you will jump the plot is good the action is Hugh its worth seeing in the cinema for the explosions set in Vietnam and because I those flying monsters were real with those teeth god help everyone truly scary indeed. and Richard Nixon gets a cameo with a bobble head in the helicopter enjoing the music and the monster shots as well fun moments it has a big budget of$185,000,000 (estimated) and had a massive start with Opening Weekend: and still. going strong with 150 million and 260 and counting around the world and stay till the end credits for special closing credits scene"
