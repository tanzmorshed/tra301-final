","Being Canadian, I probably know fewer details of the Revolutionary War than the average U.S. viewer, but note that many seem absolutely outraged at the historical untruths of this movie. When I watched it, I personally found it quite captivating but always have enough sense not to get my history from Hollywood. Since my viewing, I've looked up some info and note various inaccuracies such as misplaced characters, exaggeration of British atrocities, inaccurate torching of a church with townsfolk inside being burned alive, and depiction of American owned slaves being freed to serve in the Continental Army. (Apparently, it was the British who promised to free them if they joined their forces, but later reneged.) My apologies if my facts aren't straight. <br/><br/>It's the FICTIONAL story of a widowed South Carolina farmer, Benjamin Martin, who is disgusted by his past supposedly heroic deeds during the French Indian Wars. He has resolved to avoid participation when the Colonies revolt against Britain and stay home to protect his seven children. However, he witnesses atrocities against his two older sons, Gabriel and Thomas, by the cruel British Colonel Tavington. Gabriel, the oldest, has joined the battle against the Redcoats early on, been captured, and sentenced by Tavington to hang. Thomas, the second son, attempts to free Gabriel as he is being taken away, only to be killed by Tavington right in front of his father. This forces the reluctant Benjamin into the fray, organizing a local militia group of farmers and ex Indian fighters who will tie up the British until the French arrive.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson gives a moving portrayal of the father who is driven into a battle he sought to avoid in order to protect his family from the British. For me, his personal and family story is the essence of the tale. Just as one would expect, Benjamin Martin comes across as very sympathetic and heroic. Apparently this character is sort of a composite of possibly three different real men of that era. <br/><br/>The film has wonderful period costumes, though also (like Gibson's earlier Braveheart) more than enough violence for my taste. However, it did bring to life for me the Revolutionary War, unfortunately in a purely fictional rather than historical way. Though I enjoyed this picture, it seems to have taken a lot of liberties with the truth. The movie should therefore be considered strictly as entertainment, not a history lesson."

","The Patriot is technically a good movie.  Nicely made with good characters, good acting, a strong storyline and fabulous cinematography.<br/><br/>But, to say this movie distorts history would be an understatement.  And that is extremely sad in a movie that sells itself as an accurate portrayal of events during the revolution.  The Patriot, unfortunately, crosses the line and try's to portray as 'actual fact' a film which is predominantly fictional.  Hence, the 'real life' equivalent of Benjamin Martin actually used to scalp Native Americans in his spare time (a fact neatly overlooked by the director).<br/><br/>This 'rose tinted' view of history is at its worst during the church-burning scene where a British Army officer ordered the murder of many innocent civilians by locking them in a church and setting it alight.  This event never took place and yet, thanks to The Patriot, a whole generation of Americans will believe that the British Army actually committed this horrendous act in South Carolina -- when in fact history shows that it was not the British Army that burned a church full of people in 1776 but the Nazis that did during WW2.<br/><br/>As a Brit, I don't so much mind Hollywood always portraying us as the 'bad guys' -- after all it is American money making these films -- I'm more concerned that some Americans actually believe what they watch.  This is especially true in movies like The Patriot which 'pretend' to be real.<br/><br/>It's a shame that in such a technically competent movie, which pays such attention to minutiae detail like the costumes, that something as significant as the accuracy of the screenplay could have been so grotesquely overlooked."

","I've always had a weak spot for historically inspired dramas. I like movies like for instance ""Braveheart"", ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"". I don't like them because they give me some good insight on what that time period was like. Most of them aren't very accurate and if I want to know more about the real history, I'll watch some documentaries or read a couple of books. No, I watch this movies to be entertained and that's also the most important thing I focus on when reviewing this kind of movies: Did I like what I saw or was it boring as hell? <br/><br/>The story of the ""The Patriot"" is situated in South Carolina in 1776. Benjamin Martin, a hero from the French-Indian war who has recently buried his wife, is haunted by his notoriously brutal past. He decides not to take part in the American Revolution against the British, because he wants to protect his family and doesn't want to leave them behind fatherless. When one of his sons, who earlier on had enlisted against his will, returns home, it all starts to go terribly wrong. The son is arrested by the British Colonel Tavington and accused of being a spy. He will be executed, but before it comes to that point, one of Benjamin's other sons runs towards the soldiers and is instantly killed. This makes Martin decide to enlist anyway and he becomes the leader of a makeshift militia, which consists of peasants, slaves, a minister and other irregulars. They are successful in their fights, but will all soon be confronted with the personal consequences...<br/><br/>As I already said in the introduction, I'm not looking for historical accuracy, because I know I'll not find it in movies like this one. Hollywood has a tradition of changing the actual facts, to make a movie look more appealing for the audience and I'm sure the same has happened more than once with this movie as well. No, what I want is entertainment and THAT, I did get. Some major battle scenes, some drama, the obvious patriotism, some decent acting,... it can all be found in this movie and I must say that I liked it (most of the time).<br/><br/>The main problem that I had with this movie was the sometimes oh so obvious struggle for the American hearts. It's almost like if they forget that there are also people outside the USA who will watch their movies. All the Americans are good and all the English, French,... are bad and arrogant. Perhaps the American audience needs such stereotypes in order to be able to identify themselves with that fierce warrior on the big silver screen, but personally I can see past that fake patriotism.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is an entertaining movie and I would say that it sure offers some good value for your money if you aren't looking for too much historical accuracy. The acting and most of the story (like for instance the part in which he loses his boy) are touching and more than OK. Overall I liked what I saw and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10. It's no masterpiece, but it sure is better than average."

","I have been a Mel Gibson fan since his very good Mad Max and his horrible Summer City. I loved this movie and it is in my top ten favorites of all time. Mel is very believable as Benjamin Martin who fights only after he looses one son to death and one son to the army. Heath Ledger plays Gabriel Martin who goes to fight for his country despite his father's protests. I know that not all of the facts are historically correct but this is a movie and did not claim to be a history lesson. The period is portrayed very well and the battle scenes are so well done that you almost feel you are there. This movie is very graphic in the battles and if you do not like the sight of blood and other realistic battle scenes then this might not be the movie for you. I watched the entire movie and did not realize the length. I was so engrossed in the plots."

","Just watched this movie for about the 20th time (I have it on TiVo) and for the life of me I cannot find the disdain many who have written here have commented on. Last I heard, this was FICTION - NOT a documentary; Ken Burns did not produce not write nor direct nor narrate this piece - Roland Emmerich, a man known for action FICTION did. Yes the depiction of the Revolutionary War was NOT 100% accurate but was never intended to be; just a drama set against the background of a war and it was refreshing to see the war in the background, whereupon American blood is spilled on American soil, was the Revolutionary War and not another Civil War piece; indeed, the Civil War has been played so many times in films over the past quarter century it was just refreshing to see a different war....<br/><br/>Being somewhat of a military historian I will say that the depiction of soldiers going musket to musket in the open field was indeed accurate; many may find it interesting to know that according to the gentlemanly practices of King George's army, both sides would also recess for tea at noon every day and resume the fighting afterwards - guerrilla warfare was not popular during the day which is why Gibson's militia unit was so overtly successful early on. That being said, the comments about the accuracy with the muskets are fairly accurate but I will say that I only see straight barrel musket rifles - none of the bell shape tipped muskets; the longer you keep a projectile on a straight course the more accuracy at longer ranges despite the lack of rifling grooves in the barrels (I spent time on Rifle Teams for 5 years). The prime inaccuracy I noted was when Tavington shot the rider (running away on horseback) in the back with a musket pistol at probably 40 yards or more - so unlikely, it tarnished the whole scene.<br/><br/>My favorite person - Billings; Leon Rippey's cynical, almost giggly snickering laugh completely stole the every scene where it was used and he is a long term favorite actor of mine; Jason Isaacs absolutely best screen villain of this movie (and perhaps in top 10 screen villains of all time).<br/><br/>I guess it boils down to ""different strokes for different folks"" we all have our opinions on this and I've aired mine."

","""The Patriot"", the story of an American farmer who fights in the War of Independence, is sometimes used, together with ""Braveheart"", as evidence of a supposed anti-British prejudice on the part of Mel Gibson. This is perhaps unfair to Gibson, who has gone on record as supporting the ties between Australia and the British monarchy (hardly the stance of a Brit-hating bigot). Although ""Braveheart"", which he produced and directed, was very much Gibson's own pet project, he was neither the producer, director or scriptwriter of ""The Patriot"". Indeed, he was not even first choice to play the lead. The producers originally wanted Harrison Ford who turned the part down, reportedly because he felt that the script turned the American Revolution into the story of one man's quest for revenge.<br/><br/>Because of its anti-British stance, the film was badly received in Britain. One newspaper accused it of blackening the character of the British officer Banastre Tarleton who served as the inspiration for the villainous Colonel Tavington. One commentator went so far as to say that it was the sort of film that the Nazis might have made about the American Revolution had they won World War II. Unlike some of my fellow-countrymen, I was not too worried about this aspect of the film. The total death toll in the American War of Independence was remarkably low, not only by modern standards but even by the standards of other wars of this era, such as the Napoleonic War. Nevertheless, in every war ever fought there have been crimes on both sides, and the War of Independence was no exception. (The rebels could be as ruthless as the British, but none of their atrocities are shown in this film). Some of the deeds attributed to Tavington may be fictitious, such as the church-burning scene, but in real life Tarleton had a well-deserved reputation for brutality, and was not only loathed by the American colonists but also distrusted by his own side. In the film the British commander Lord Cornwallis is shown as outwardly gentlemanly and honourable, but prepared secretly to countenance Tavington's methods. In reality, Cornwallis wanted to have Tarleton court-martialled; Tarleton was only saved by his influential connections.<br/><br/>I did, however, have some reservations about the way these events were portrayed. It was originally intended to make the film about Francis Marion, a real-life figure. Unfortunately Marion, although undoubtedly courageous and a skilled guerrilla leader, was also a slave-owner (as any landowner of substance in 1770s South Carolina would have been) and was therefore deemed unworthy to be the hero of a modern blockbuster (even though a TV series about him was made in the fifties). His exploits, therefore, are credited to a fictitious ""Benjamin Martin"". The slavery issue could have been avoided by moving the action to, say, New England, but instead the film gives us a wholly unrealistic picture of race relations in the period. The black workers on Martin's land are all free men, and black and white live together in harmony, with black soldiers willingly fighting alongside whites in the Continental Army. This sort of dishonest, idealised portrayal of slavery was at one time common in films like ""Gone with the Wind"", but I thought that it had died out with the growth of the Civil Rights movement.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, a reason why so many Southerners supported the revolutionaries was that slavery had been declared illegal in Britain itself in 1771 and they feared that the British Parliament would eventually legislate to ban it in the colonies. Needless to say, there is no mention of this attitude in the film. In later life Tarleton became MP for Liverpool, and a vehement defender of slavery. In this, if in nothing else, he and Marion had something in common).<br/><br/>My other reservation about the film's political stance is similar to Ford's. The film probably concentrated so heavily on British brutality because it is difficult to interest a modern audience, even an American audience, in the actual reasons why the war was fought. It is easy to make out an intellectual case for the principle of ""no taxation without representation"", which had been part of British constitutional thought since at least the Civil War in the 1640s. It is much less easy to justify the spilling of blood in defence of that principle, and Martin, scarred by his experiences in the French and Indian Wars, is originally shown as a pacifist, unwilling to fight or to support the Declaration of Independence which he believes will lead to war. His son Gabriel, however, joins the Continental Army, but is wrongly accused of being a spy and threatened with execution. Tavington, believing Martin to be a rebel sympathiser, burns down his home and murders another son, Thomas. Martin is forced to take up arms to defend his family and then forms a guerrilla band which he leads against the British. Despite the title of the film, however, Martin is not really motivated by patriotism; he seems less a patriot than a pacifist who has abandoned his principles in order to seek revenge.<br/><br/>The film is attractively photographed, although I felt that it sometimes showed a sanitised, prettified version of eighteenth-century life. In some ways it reminded me of ""The Last Samurai"", another visually attractive epic flawed by a dishonest approach to history and by excessive length, although I would rate it slightly higher, largely because Gibson makes a more commanding and impressive epic hero than does Tom Cruise. From the viewpoint of anyone without patriotic preconceptions, it can be seen simply as an exciting (if overlong) adventure film- my wife, who is not British by birth, was cheering on Martin and booing Tavington. Nevertheless, its approach to history never gets beyond a simplified story of heroes and villains. 6/10"

","There are movies that are historically perfect and there are those that sweep you into the history. This is the latter. The main character is a compilation of people, not all events happened perfectly as they were portrayed, but at the end, my students understand the sacrifice, emotion, struggle, and the events of a major battle for their test. They realize that the men and women who built our nation were real. They lived, loved, fought, sacrificed-many even died-and the rest got up another day to do it all again. Truly can not recommend this enough. (Though if blood makes you squeamish, watch it with me so I can tell you when not to look or to step into the Hall--what I do with my students...)"

","The Patriot is NOT a documentary. It didn't pretend to be, and wasn't. Loosely based upon Francis Marion (the ""Swamp Fox""), it only touched on Marion's impact on the Revolution in South Carolina. If anything, it was downplayed. For instance, in real life, he had over 150 men in his guerrilla band. The movie portrayed him as having far fewer. As a documentary, it fails on this and many other points. As a movie, it is a tremendous success.<br/><br/>As far as visuals, they were stunning. The wide-open vistas and battle scenes were breath-taking and beautifully filmed. Yes, it was violent, but that lent a realism to the film that most other films about this era lack. The look and feel of this period was portrayed well.<br/><br/>The acting was superb. I won't give anything away, but this did NOT (arguably) have either an entirely ""Hollywood"" plot – people, including civilians, DIE, as they do in war – or much of a ""Hollywood"" ending, despite a relatively happy one. That was impressive, and made the film genuine, exciting and at times, shocking. Plot points such as Benjamin Martin's youngest daughter's feelings about her daddy, and the romance between his son and a young girl were touching, and even emotional.<br/><br/>I found some things complain about. Crisp, clean, brand-new Colonial American flags suddenly appear after, and during, the final battle. In reality they would have been rags by then – or at least not so clean. One bad bit of dialogue: Benjamin Martin is on the beach with his sister-in- law, and he asks if he can sit down. Her reply, ""It's a free country – or will be soon,"" was a 20th century throw-away line dressed up with a 1780 caveat, and I cringed at it.<br/><br/>The film was historically accurate in many respects. The formal way of speaking, plus the family-above-all, loyalty-to-The-Cause attitudes expressed throughout, were genuine, even though both are out of favor today. Children using weapons, and going off to fight on a moment's notice, was not an uncommon story, and supposedly happened in a branch of my own family. Relationships like Martin's and his wife's sister did occur, often out of necessity. I was surprised to read afterwards that the battle tactics of the last scene occurred, almost exactly as shown, at the Battle of Cowpens, including fierce hand-to-hand combat. Colonel Banastre Tarleton – the basis for the movie's character William Tavington – was indeed seen as a war criminal by American colonists at the time, and the real Tarleton even had a horse shot out from under him!<br/><br/>But was it biased? Sure it was. Roughly a third of the American colonists were Loyalists, another third were ""rebels"", and another third were undecided. It would have made the story more complete and complex to portray this (or the time Tarleton mistakenly slaughtered some of those very Loyalists!) But I've read a poem online (""Ode to Valour"") dedicated to Col. Banastre Tarleton's ""heroic exploits"" that would shame modern-day propagandists.<br/><br/>I think we all accept that not every British officer of this era was a monster. In fact, in the movie – as in real life - Cornwallis and other British officers were appalled that the ""Ghost""/Swamp Fox did not play by the rules of ""civilized warfare"", and chastised characters like Tavington who also breached them. The real Swamp Fox knew a bit about balance, however. After after the war, when the real Francis Marion served in the South Carolina Senate, he is said to have advocated a lenient policy toward the Loyalists. The real Tarleton survived the war, went home to write his memoirs, was seen as a hero, and was elected to Parliament. Maybe we need a sequel to cover all of these other aspects of the story. Until then, this one is a must- see."

","Brig. Gen. Francis Marion, the historical person that Mel Gibson's character is loosely based on was a true war hero and patriot.  The ones who are denigrating his legacy are mostly British `historians' and those who are too stupid or lazy to do their own research.<br/><br/>Actually, Mel Gibson's Benjamin Martin is a composite of 3 historical characters:  one of course was Francis Marion the `Swamp Fox'; another was an illiterate backwoods general, Daniel Morgan, who encouraged the militia at the battle of Cowpens (final battle enacted in the movie) to stand their ground against the British; and the third was a cavalry officer, William Washington, who pursued Tarleton after Cowpens and fought him in hand-to-hand combat, which they both barely survived.<br/><br/>Gen. Marion used tactics that the Brits termed `ungentlemanly' for warfare, but he got the job done, just as the Viet Cong did 200 years later against our own GI's.  Marion knew, because of his lack of manpower, equipment, and experienced soldiers, he couldn't take on the superior British forces using outmoded and quaint European-style warfare (in fact, this idiotic style of warfare continued up until WWI).  The movie depicts this very well.  So Gen. Marion wisely used the only tactics left to him  hit-and-run, which he learned from fighting the Cherokees during the French and Indian Wars.<br/><br/>The movie's villainous Lt. Col. Tavington, who is also loosely based on Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton, is not too far from the truth, though a little over the top. <br/><br/>It was during the retreat of Waxhaws that Tarleton came to symbolize British cruelty in the Revolutionary War.  Tarleton was seen as a ""butcher"" when American forces under Col. Abraham Buford laid down their arms in an attempt to surrender yet the British continued their assault.  From then on, his reputation grew and `Tarleton's quarter', in effect, came to mean ""no quarter"".<br/><br/>In the tradition of the day, after the surrender at Yorktown, American officers hosted the defeated Cornwallis and other British officers at their respective tables.  But no American invited Tarleton nor would any eat with him.  Tarleton asked if the omission was accidental, and he was told that, indeed it was not, because of his past atrocities.<br/><br/>Tarleton lived a long life, condoning his use of total war  burning houses, destroying crops, the end justifying the means.  He also would never admit to any fault at Cowpens, saying he was `outnumbered' and received inadequate assistance from Cornwallis.  He wondered, ""how some unforeseen event"" could ""throw terror into the most disciplined soldiers"".<br/><br/>I didn't go into this movie for a history lesson but to be entertained, and I was, but after reading some of the inaccurate and illiterate reviews, I found it necessary to give a `history lesson'!  The movie wasn't perfect  it was cloying and obvious at times, but I give it high marks for effort and for bringing to the screen an important part of American history that has received disparate treatment in movies, and I think Devlin & Emmerich can now be forgiven for Godzilla."
"evanmatthews53","10","35","59","29 October 2008"," Very Well Done
","As a fan of historical films, I really enjoyed the movie "" The Patriot"" starring Mel Gibson who skillfully portrays the role of an American colonial during the Revolutionary War. Actors like Gibson have a talent for making history come alive on screen and engaging the audience. The movie held my interest. It was never dull or slow. The sets were just great and I often felt like I was in the middle of a battlefield. I loved the flashes of color, cannons blazing, colonial flags waving, the columns of British soldiers dressed in their best and brightest uniforms and the array of women and children who were colorful parts of colonial America. All in all, this was well worth the watch and a real change from the usual long list of action packed, special effects films which are a bit overdone."

","I was expecting Gladiator to be Braveheart 2, but that title goes to The Patriot.  What this movie has above all other movies this summer is a script.  Robert Rodat, who penned Saving Private Ryan, paints this Revolutionary drama with wonderfully broad strokes, but does not forget the human aspect.  Mel Gibson shows his acting chops in a characer similar to Wallace, but far more complex.  However, it is Jason Isaacs that, in the spirit of Alan Rickman and Tim Roth, steals the show with his deliciously evil portrayal of Col. Tavington.  What separates this epic apart from the other summer movies is Rodat's wonderful ability to evoke several different emotions.  Rodat wonderfully establishes many bonds and then breaks them abruptly with the death and destruction of war.  Truly there is more suffering in this movie than I have seen in almost any, and it makes the payoff at the end (you were aware that we actually win the war right?) that much better.  Emmerich also is able to capture the essence of combat tactics of the day.  Be it the minute-man behind the bushes style, or the open field style Emmerich milks every dramatic possibility from these old style battle tactics.  All this combines to make a wonderful movie that should not be forgotten come Oscar time (especially Isaacs)."

"ironhorse_iv","7","7","9","6 July 2014"," Don't Thread on the Patriot. It's pretty entertaining despite some faults.
","This movie is a pretty entertaining film, despite the fact that it lacks much historical accuracy and highly controversial for it criticized for demonizing the British Army, and for white-washing slavery out of the time. Still, the movie directed by Roland Emmerich of disaster movie fame, gave us a movie worth watching on Independence Day. I wouldn't be shameful to admit, that I honestly like this movie. The fictional historical war movie take place in American Revolutionary South Carolina, where Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is trying to raise his family in peace. When the movie comes to his doorsteps, and his family threaten, Martin takes on the arms, to help lead the American to freedom. The movie plot is basically the same with Mel Gibson's 1995's epic film, 'Braveheart', nothing really new. Once again, he's out for revenge, this time against Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaac) whom made Martin's life, a living hell. The movie is bloody, gruesome, and violence as hell. I have never saw a movie before this that portray the Napoleonic tactics so brutal. Still, there are some very light moments, some clever comedy, and even a love-story. While, the love-story isn't as strong as Braveheart levels, with Martin love affair with his widow's sister, Charlotte Selton (Joely Richardson) and Martin's son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) love affair with Anne Howard (Lisa Brenner). It didn't felt, too forced. The film does have a great relationship with the father/son that makes it worth checking out. I have to say, Heath Ledger was pretty much show that he could become a leading man with this film. I do think that Martin does have way too much children in the film that it's hard to keep track of them. I just glad, they didn't notice too much on them and more on him leading a rag-tag team of Militia men. The men were given some backstory, and each one was pretty interesting characters. You got the Reverend (Rene Auberjonois), the wild man (Leon Rippy), the slave (Jay Arlen Jones), the semi-racist Southern (Donald Logue) and the French Man (Tchéky Karyo). The movie also had some interesting real life historical figures played by great actors such as Gen. Lord Charles Cornwallis (Tom Wilkenson) and Col. Harry Burwell (Chris Cooper), influence and based off of Henry 'Lighthorse' Lee. Honestly, one of the best scenes in the movie, had to be with Charles Cornwallis and Benjamin Martin doing prison exchange. It was just so fun to watch. Jason Isaac's character is loosely based on Banastre Tartleton who might had cause the Waxhaw Massacre in which prisoners of war were brutally executed. The event helped to create the common image of him as a brutal commander, uninterested in the conventions of civilized warfare, but is a subject of debate, if he indeed fully did those horrible acts, himself. While, Tartleton is indeed a bit crude, he was more human, than Tavington whom is played as sadistic over the top one-dimensional evil villain. Honestly, in real life, the British Army at the time, would probably hang him or discharge him for how often, he disobey orders and how many atrocities was caused by his own hands. Another fault that some critic pick on is how they made Benjamin Martin into the hero, even with him committed atrocities as bad, if not worse, than those perpetrated by the British. Benjamin Martin is a composite figure the scriptwriter claims is based on real American Revolutionary War heroes: Andrew Pickens, Daniel Morgan and Thomas Sumter, but mostly Francis Marion. Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox, was the foremost guerrilla fighter of the Revolution; unfortunately, Marion had no qualms about slavery and he certainly didn't free any of his slaves. Hence, to make Martin more sympathetic to modern audiences, Martin is made anti-slavery sentiments and made Martin not a slave owner. This decision received criticism as a cop-out. What save the Patriot from being one-sided, is that it does not depict the American character Benjamin Martin as innocent of atrocities; a key plot point revolves around the character's haunting guilt over acts he engaged in, such as torturing, killing, and mutilating prisoners during the French and Indian War. Sadly, it get somewhat lost, once the film ends with the sappy happy ending. We never know if he still, being haunted by his actions or any new actions, he commit in this war. Rather than realistic anti-war character, Martin somehow is shoe horse as patriotism hero, even if that not the reason why he went to war in the first place. It makes no sense. Most of the war atrocities in the film, have no factual basis and parallel to the American or European 18th century wars, anyways. Yes, the movie is historical inaccurate, but the film does look like it takes place in 18th century, America. The location sets, the costumes, and the visual/special effects were all amazing. The score by John William is beautiful to listen to. Overall: Like Uncle Sam says, I want you to watch it. It's a good watch."

Perhaps one of the more surprisingly superb performances is that of Heath Ledger (10 Things I Hate about You) as Gabriel Martin, the stubborn oldest son of the Martin family.  These two stars lead the cast in teaching such lessons as what it means to be a patriot and a hero, the cost of freedom, and the value of family.  <br/><br/>""The Patriot"" is a well written story that is guaranteed to give you goosebumps.

However, in this case, I feel I must point out a few things.<br/><br/>All such films come with a disclaimer saying something to the effect that the characters portrayed aren't real and the story is just that, a story. For entertainment.  Martin and Tavington did not actually exist, they are merely characters, possibly based (as has been suggested) on actual historical figures.  I often wonder if such films as Treasure of the Sierra Madre, or Rio Grande, or just about any western flick was judged so harshly when it came out as we judge 'historical' pictures today?  Or any pirate film?  Zorro?  Any film with knights in it?  It seems to me that unless you are making a documentary, the historical accuracy doesn't truly matter in detail.  Certainly, I enjoy films better when they seem to be a reasonably accurate portrayal of a time (costumes, technologies), but I don't carp about whether some person existed.  Even if they did, I expect the film to be untrue so I can be entertained. For example, most wars are not constant fighting.  Certainly some battles went on for days at a time, but there is a lot of waiting and a lot of marching.  Yet most war films seem to be battle after battle after battle, with no real respite except for the wounded.  Not so. How about some facts?    Fact:  Americans fought against themselves during the war.  Many Americans served with the British forces.    Fact:  There were in fact many atrocities committed by the British forces, rapes, property burning, etc.  Don't believe me?  Check out the history of what happened to the original signers of the Declaration of Independence, their families and their properties.  That's actual history, not just entertainment history.  Of course, this wasn't only limited to the British forces.  According to Massachusetts history, the Revolutionary forces (not necessarily the armed forces even) were, um, not kind to people who sympathized with the British.  The tavern recruitment scene suggests this quite well.  Were churches actually burned with a town's population inside.  Maybe, maybe not, but it certainly was dramatic, wasn't it? Fact:  Literacy was not as common at that time as it is today.  Many people, especially the lower classes, and slaves could not read.    <br/><br/>
Did Cornwallis have a pair of great danes that were 'captured' by the enemy? I doubt it, but possibly. Were slaves that served in either army freed after a certain term of service?  Again, I don't know.  (I am not even certain that slavery was allowed in Britain at the time.  Indentured servants, I think yes (though the difference is slight, I grant you), but actual slavery, hmm.  I'll have to check on that.)  The colonies typically did form their own militias for local use.  The americans did, as a general rule, fight using more guerilla tactics  (especially early on, the american forces were composed largely of more militia than regulars, see below for comments on militia), check the accounts of the battle of Concord, and what happened to the British forces as they withdrew.<br/><br/>War is brutal and ugly.  People die.  Many of the soldiers don't want to be there.  Militia, being less well trained and thus disciplined, does have a tendency to fight very poorly in set piece battles (check current and past arguments for keeping a 'standing' 'professional' army).<br/><br/>Ignoring the historical accuracies or lack thereof (and btw, Braveheart was not 100% accurate either, though the main characters , Wallace, Robert the Bruce, King Edward, did all exist, but again, I don't seem to recall people complaining so loudly about that)  I found Mel's character to be believable and well portrayed.  Yes, there were elements of Hollywood happiness in the film (the beach town, he workers attitudes, the romances) and Hollywood sadness' in the film (the massacre, the child's death), but it was very entertaining.  I found many of the battles to be very realistic (okay, pistols WERE NOT that accurate and never have been) and sufficiently entertaining for my needs.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good film.  Hollywood, certainly, but entertaining."

","The Patriot is based around one Benjamin Martin, an ex-soldier, who now happily living as a family man finds himself thrust into conflict at the break of the American Revolution.<br/><br/>He loves the Brits does Mel Gibson, ""Gallipoli"", ""Braveheart"" and here with ""The Patriot"", see the pattern anyone? As with the aforementioned ""Gallipoli"" and ""Braveheart"", certain liberties have also been taken with events in ""The Patriot"" so as to glossy up for the eager Hollywood contingent. It's not my want to scribble about the facts of Benjamin Martin (Re: Francis Marion), or William Wallace for that matter, information as such is but a mere click away on the world wide web.<br/><br/>So casting aside the artistic licence factors, is ""The Patriot"" any good? Well nearly it is -- nearly. Gibson is fine, he shoulders the burden of the film with great gusto and no shortage of emotional depth. It's very easy to accept him as a staunch family man who transforms into a blood thirsty warrior. The problems, acting wise, lay away from Gibbo's central performance. Surrounded by caricature villains (though Jason Isaacs' Tavington is deliciously vile) and underwritten characters (Chris Cooper wasted and Joely Richardson is but a mere prop), Gibson has no choice but to hog the screen. So much so it ultimately turns into a one man star vehicle, which for a costume war epic isn't a great thing really.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"") directs and handles the battle sequences very well, there's lashings of blood as men line up to shoot and dismember one and other. While cannonball's whizz, bang and tear off body parts, it's grim, yet oddly rousing stuff. Not even the overtly flag waving and sloganeering on show can off set the impact of the well constructed battles. There is of course lots of tragedy to be found in the film, and these are some what surprisingly, tenderly handled by Emmerich, but mostly it's via an on song Gibson, who remains one of the few modern day male actors capable of believable grief. All of this is given a John Williams score that suitably flits between rousing and ethereal, and things are further boosted by the sumptuous photography from Caleb Deschanel.<br/><br/>There should have been more thought given to the racial (slaves) aspects in the conflict, and this coupled with the bad errors of under developed characters hurts ""The Patriot"" as a filmic exercise, not so as to stop it being entertaining, but more to stop it being a one man show. But as it is, thanks in the main to Gibson, and in spite of the overtly evident faults, it's an above average drama. 6/10"

"Movie_Reviewer123","1","78","161","21 April 2009"," A failed action movie that distorts history in every way possible.
","We all know and have seen the bias that is almost always presented in books such as American books of history. For example, many historical books I've read praise America no matter what circumstance they're in (such as during the Revolution or Civil War). Even during such tragic events as the 1833 ""Trail of Tears"" Indian massacre, you'll rarely read any criticism of it in the typical history book.<br/><br/>Why? Because it's about America. America has built up a false image of itself; America is shown as omnipotent, with no nation able to even hope to match its power, and it shows America to be a pure nation with few if any faults.<br/><br/>Obviously, we all know that that image couldn't be farther from the truth, as America has numerous faults, and many nations have the same if not more power than America.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, America won't stop brainwashing the public and make them aware that this image is false. ""The Patriot"" is a prime example of this propaganda.<br/><br/>Basically, Mel Gibson plays as an invincible farmer who has a vendetta against the British, as he does in almost all of his historical movies. Once again he plays the role as someone who despises the British more than any other human on Earth. I didn't watch this whole movie, mainly because I am simply too disgusted to watch it. Though a few parts of the movie are historically accurate, such as the decisive British victory at the Battle of Camden, but the rest of it is nothing but American flag-waving idiocy.<br/><br/>One scene that I really despise is when Gibson and his two sons fight a squad of British troops who are taking a prisoner away. His sons have dead accuracy, and Mel displays super-human strength, as he kills over 10 British troops - including their officer - without taking a scratch. Historically, any rebel foolish enough to attack even two British troops would quickly be killed. But no, the directors made the movie as far from historically accurate as possible, so Mel slaughters the troops. Another scene I hate is when the British are shown to burn down a church, trapping the people inside. What were those idiotic directors thinking!!? Great Britain's state religion was Protestantism; even if a British officer ordered a Protestant church to be burned, he would executed for high treason against the church. Burning churches was something the Nazis did, not the British, but apparently the directors were so brain-dead that they decided to make the Britsh do this. Another scene I hate is when Tavington kills an innocent civilian for no reason. Tavington is based on the real-life Colonel Banastre Tarleton, an excellent Britsh commander of cavalry. He was an excellent general, not a cold-blooded killer, and most likely, he never shot an innocent civilian in cold blood.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this movie is just plain terrible. The fact that it is so incredibly historically inaccurate simply ruins the movie entirely."

","I watched this film on DVD for the first time having avoided it for so long. My concerns were justified and echo many of the posts here.<br/><br/>It is claimed that historical innacuracies and little rewrites of history are to be allowed in any film. What concerns me is that all of these inncuracies in many films are ALL pointed against the British. They form a steady drip, drip of anti Britishness which can hardly be warranted. I feel that reasons for this are possibly that our inherent sense of decency means that we tolerate such criticism, and that we are easier targets than some of the real villans in the world, whom Hollywood seems frightened to portray.<br/><br/>Let me mention one scene in particular<br/><br/>SPOILERS *****<br/><br/>The burning of the people in the barn, this has been mentioned previous, and obviously this never happened. What is disturbing is that the only well documented instances of this actually happenning was when the Waffen SS burned the village of Orudur in France in 1944 with all of its inhabitants. and also in countless villages on the eastern front. The director, Roland Emmerich, a German, should be ashamed for linking this atrocity with Britain who did more than any other country to fight such tyranny in WW2 - disgraceful ! and remember Britain led the world in doing away with slavery when the colonies fought to retain it. Even the Alamo, was fought to retain slavery in Texas after the Mexicans had banned it - didn't see that in the film of the Alamo.<br/><br/>This is a fairy tale - read the history books."
"Theo Robertson","3","56","113","28 January 2010"," Almost So Bad To Be Entertaining But It Leaves A Bad Taste In The Mouth
","Since the last film I reviewed was COME AND SEE the Soviet film depicting Nazi war crimes in Bylorussia in World War 2 most distressingly the inhabitants of a village being burned alive in a barn I thought it'd be a good idea to rewatch THE PATRIOT a film set during the American War of Independence starring Mel Gibson and directed by German Roland Emmerich to see if it's every bit as bad as I remembered and which caused a lot of controversy when it was released <br/><br/>Unsurprisingly it is every bit as bad as I remembered . The battle scenes of massed ranks standing in front of one another firing muskets are vaguely realistic if only on a tactical level because in those days chivalry at its most basic still existed in the mind of military men and was a gentlemanly act . Strangely Richard Rodat ( The screenwriter of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN ) and Emmerich seem to have created an alternative universe where butchering the civilian population just because things were going slightly badly was part of a strategy by the Brits . There is some debate about atrocities happening during the period but historians are unanimous that while some things may have happened that could be classed as war crimes nothing on the scale as seen in here did happen during the period . It led to one critic Jonathan Foreman writing a famous article in The New York Post decrying THE PATRIOT as "" blood libel "" <br/><br/>Interestingly the film draws attention to the fact that the colonial rebels were helped by the French . Before anyone starts to applaud this fact their role is totally downplayed . There is a French officer present who's aiding these patriots because his wife and children were burned to death by these nasty Brits . Goodness me according to this film the British empire's idea of war is stocking up on a lot of matches setting fire to the nearest passer by who can't fight back . You can almost understand why he likes to slaughter surrendering red coats and it's left to Mel Gibson ( I won't refer to him as his character's name since he's Mel Gibson playing ... well Mel Gibson ) to point out that killing unarmed prisoners is wrong . Interesting too that that it's heavily implied at the end of the film the French only turned up at the end when the war was effectively over . I think that might have been true of America's role at the end of WW1 but certainly wasn't true of the French in the American War Of Independence . France , Holland and Spain all gave military help to the colonials throughout the war especially naval power . Effectively the whole world was against Britain helping the revolutionaries on land and sea <br/><br/>In this version of America everyone lived in a multi ethnic egalitarian utopia where all men are equal before God . Not only were black people not slaves but if look closely you can spot the occasional black face walking along streets unhindered .One can understand how much hatred Spike Lee has for the film and has been very vocal about it and it really is laughably bad the way the film spins out how much equality is afforded to African -Americans in the late 1770s . It's a bit like watching a version of SCHINDLER'S LIST were no one actually gets murdered for being Jewish . Just for the record Britain abolished slavery in 1807 while the Americans didn't get round to it for decades later . <br/><br/>This is a movie that shows Hollywood at its very worst . If it'd been made by a bunch of American journeymen film makers it would have just been Hollywood rubbish . However since I'd previously seen COME AND SEE it does leave a very disgusting taste in the mouth that it stars Mel Gibson and has been made by a German director . The only good thing to say about it is that it's so bad that no one will be able to take it seriously"

Let us also get a few things straight about the American Revolution. It was fought on these issues 1. The colonists refused to contribute to the cost of their own defence (and no, that is not a spelling mistake) from the French, which had been paid for in British money and the lives of her young men. 2. It was fought so that the colonists could break out from the colonies in the East and invade Indian territory which the British Crown - George III - has designated as Native Title. Jefferson is well-documented as have his eyes set on the West. 3 In the south it was fought to maintain slavery. Most blacks fought on the British side and for good reason. They had heard of the Case of Sommersett v Stewart in which Lord Mansfield, chief justice of the King's Bench had granted habeas corpus to James Sommersett who was a slave in Virginia and had been taken to England. The Anti-Slave Trade Movement was also gaining ground in Great Britain. The film tells Americans what they want to hear. If you don't like the truth, don't make films about history."

","Although the British are engaged in war in neighbouring areas, Benjamin Martin sees no reason to get involved as he is a peaceful man now, despite his infamous military background. However when the British burn his home and heartlessly kill one of his young sons, Martin knows he must take a stand and enters the conflict. With great personal sacrifice he joins the bloody conflict for freedom and honour and the love of his country.<br/><br/>In his episode of The Simpsons, Mel Gibson starred in a remake of Mr Smith Goes to Washington except Homer helped him to change it into a film that was closer to Lethal Weapon than the James Stewart original. That was a joke, but having just watched Mel Gibson turn the American Civil War into a sort of revenge action movie I considered that perhaps Homer had a hand in this one too and that the joke was on us for spending three hours watching it. It starts out with a bit of moral chat about the importance of peace etc but one dead son later and Benjamin Martin has become a one-man war machine, wiping out 20 British soldiers in a blink of an eye. It is the start of a morally simplistic film that offers little for those looking for a historical piece. In fairness the film never actually aims to be anything other than a modern action movie in a historical setting but having low ambitious doesn't mean it can't be criticised for being crap  because that is just what it is.<br/><br/>So we have the pantomime villains of the English killing women and children while the good wholesome American people (most of whom employ blacks to pick cotton rather than use slaves) try to do the right thing but are drawn into a bloody fight for freedom and justice. It is as simplistic as it sounds and every time Emmerich fears that his audience are losing touch with who the bad guys are, he'll have them burn kill a load of women with gleeful glints in their eyes. It gets tiresome very quickly and the fact that it is three hours long (give or take  I'd prefer to take) just makes it worse. Visually it looks as good as you would expect a big budget production to do but substance-wise it is just nonsense, with overblown (if impressive) battle sequences which laughably include lots of John Woo style use of guns, slow-mo and catching weapons in mid-air before using them. The bits in between the action are no better as they are merely twists of an emotional knife that the writer must have hoped would make us overlook how simplified everything is; I was waiting for the scene where Col Tavington drowned kittens in a sack to demonstrate how evil he was. No, this is not a film to come to for debate because as far as Rodat is concerned, that is all done and dusted in the early stages and then completely dismissed as nonsense by the next 160 minutes of film. I'm not going to even get into the historical liberties taken because even ignoring them this is still a terrible load of rubbish.<br/><br/>Once the film gets going, Mel Gibson only does a couple of things: he is either cocky (like Riggs), brave (like Braveheart) or full of indignation and swelling pride in his country. He flicks between these like someone was turning a switch in his back; he is never consistent and he is never a real person  in fact he is never anyone other than Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger gives a simplistic performance but with no material to work with, what could he do? I don't know why Richardson bothered to show up although I can appreciate that Karyo and Wilkinson have mortgages to pay just like the rest of us. I don't give the same excuse to Cooper because he always struck me as an intelligent actor who makes good decisions  he is really too good to be earning his money from this. The support all do what they are told but I don't want to be too hard on the majority of the cast simply because the material is not there and nobody can do good work with characters that would seem underdeveloped on children's television.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good looking and noisy action movie and as such it might just please audiences that like lots of things blowing up and Americans being the good guys. However for the majority of viewers the simplistic material, stomach-churning flag-waving, emotional exploitation and dumb action movie clichés. It is nonsense from start to finish in my opinion and it is not worth 90 minutes, far less 170."

For any Brits reading this I can assure you that the assumptions made by this film are not the general opinion in our country (though this movie's performance at the box-office might suggest otherwise). Some of us have actually studied the events surrounding the war of independence and might feel that the British should NOT have been portrayed as Nazis. Unfortunately they are - despite the fact that they abolished slavery before us, a fact which proves they were more humane than we were at the time but which is lamely demonstrated in this movie. I've been to London recently and the Brits are amazingly tolerant about propaganda like this (not to mention Austin Powers). Luckily their famous sense of humor is alive and well.

What was most shocking was that in order to make us 'sympethise' for Benjamin Martin they changed many of his important character flaws, making it appear that he was just a normal kind hearted man who's only flaw was the inability to make rocking chairs. Another appalling flaw was how the entire film appears to be centred around the atrocities carried out by the British, when, the fact that Benjamin Martin butchered a tribe of Mohawk Indians, cut up their bodys and set the body parts back to the Indians families is little mentioned. Also its portrayal of General Cornwallis was despicable, it failed to mention that Cornwallis' wife died, an act that emotionally damaged him and it says that after loosing the war of independence he never recovered, this is a lie, he returned to England, sat in the house of lords for a while then he went to be the governor of India and successfully untangled the messy web of Indian politics. There are many other inaccuracies such as Heath ledgers talk about a new world where all men would be equal, this ignores the next 50 odd years of American history, and also the bit where Mel Gibson and his two sons kill an entire British platoon and Mel fights half of them with an axe seemed a TAD unrealistic to me!

","This film is most frustrating in the way it misrepresents the nature of the war and the nature of the British rulers from whom the patriots ""freed"" themselves.<br/><br/>The first myth is that a few minutemen fought off an empire. In reality, the British government was trying to run the war on the cheap so that the army was always under-supplied and short of men. This prevented them from properly following up their consistent success against the Americans in the field. Eventually, France and Spain saw the opportunity to further their own colonial ambitions by joining the war on the side of the Americans and, by taking away maritime supremacy, made it impossible for the British to win.<br/><br/>The second myth is the nature of the British ruling class at that time. We are presented with the main villain who is a thinly disguised representation of Banastre Tarleton, one of the most effective commanders on either side. He is characterised as an oily Edwardian toff with an Oscar Wilde accent and the airs of a prince of the blood. In fact, Tarleton was from a middle class, Liverpool family. At that time Liverpool was a dynamic and growing world commercial centre. Its culture and atmosphere was much more akin to the Chicago of the 1880s than the leafy shires of Hollywood-England with country houses, mi-lords, milkmaids and faithful family retainers.<br/><br/>The Tarletons and their ilk were very ""American"" in their aggressive pursuit of wealth which they then used to purchase high positions in society. Young Banastre did not get his commission in the army through the nobility on his family tree. It was bought with hard cash earned by the family from the shipping trade. His relatively high rank at an early age was awarded in recognition of the ability he displayed in the field. He was by no means unique in this respect. Indeed, the character of the British officers would be much better modelled along the lines of Lawrence Harvey and Donald Wolfit in ""Room at the Top"" than the Merchant and Ivory anachronisms this film offers.<br/><br/>As to the cruelty ascribed to Tarleton and vividly practised by his proxy in the film, there may have been some truth to his having killed troops who had already surrendered. It does happen in war. But there is little evidence of a sustained policy of murder on his behalf. However, his ability to win even when at a disadvantage was certainly a problem for the enemy. No doubt inflating his reputation for ruthlessness was a useful American propaganda ploy to convince their notoriously unsteady troops that surrender or flight was not necessarily going to save them from the fury of ""Bloody Ban"" and his redcoats. It was sold to them as a case of fight or die.<br/><br/>Certainly, his alleged cruelty was not seen as generally representative of British treatment of the colonists. This is evidenced by the fact that he was the only commander of note not invited to a dinner to celebrate the end of the war attended by American, British and French officers.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this reputation did not follow him home where he returned and was elected to represent Liverpool in Parliament for many years before an honourable retirement to Shropshire."
"Raydio","6","25","49","11 January 2001"," Entertaining, but ultimately unbalanced and unsatisfying.
","I had fairly high hopes prior to watching this movie for the first time. I actually enjoy 'period' films, and American history is a particular favorite.<br/><br/>So I was very disappointed with ""The Patriot"". I felt that the director simply overlaid a generic story onto the Revolutionary War theme, and did so in a very unbalanced, black and white manner. I don't want to restate the many views already expressed, so I'll just say that my main objection to this film, was the way it assumes the viewing public are all simpletons. For example, why was it necessary for the director to bludgeon us with his obvious bias against the British in this film? I mean, how many atrocities did he require Col.Tavington to commit before he ensured that everyone in the audience was baying for British blood? Come on Mr Emmerich, haven't you ever heard of subtlety?<br/><br/>Apart from the black and white nature of the whole picture, there were far too many totally unrealistic scenes. Are we really to believe that Benjamin Martin and his two young boys could so easily despatch an entire company of British soldiers?<br/><br/>What a shame that what could (and should have) been a balanced, stirring narrative on an important period of America's history, was ultimately reduced to such formulaic Hollywood fluff. I sincerely hope that another studio/director revisits the topic, and does it right. As always, I suppose it all comes down to making a film that will score big at the box office, versus making a film that will actually mean something long after the movie posters for it have been torn down. If you like American period films, give ""Dances with Wolves"" a go - it's far superior!<br/><br/>6/10"

Fortunately, this sort of undue criticism can be easily seen through. Since it are always the people who find that their heritage is done injustice who write these sorts of reviews, they can easily be identified and ""filtered out"" through their location which they seem to be so proud of. Come on you Brits, are you really that narrow minded? Get a life! How do you think the Germans ought to feel about every other villain in a Hollywood production having a German accent? Luckily those poor guys have no clue because 99% of them only watch the German dubbed version in which the good guys speak German too. Belgians for instance are always pictured as a bunch of idiots: the rest of the world is made to believe that the only intelligent Belgian around is Hercule Poirot and he is so eccentric and ugly than no Belgian would want to be compared to him. Hey even Jean-Claude Van Damme is so embarrassed of being Belgian that he always plays a character from France or Canada to justify his accent.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Patriot is a really great movie which just has about everything to offer: Romance, action, drama, suspense and superb cinematography, but you have to take it for what it is: fiction, no more no less.<br/><br/>Please lads, If you really insist on seeing historically accurate things go watch documentaries instead but be very careful which ones you choose because the truth can hurt a whole lot more than fiction."
"y2knash","1","51","113","23 July 2000"," Fantastically Funny Movie!!
","What a great comedy film this is. I can't remember the last time I laughed so much at a movie!<br/><br/>An hilariously inept script, coupled with truly appalling acting (especially Mr Gibson and Mr Ledger) and some quite potty direction make for a surreal and pythonesque experience.<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>There is one scene where all these factors come together gloriously and in the future I firmly believe it will: A: Top the list of every poll as the funniest scene ever committed to celluloid. or B: Be consigned to some dark corner only to see the light of day at secret drama or film school classes in the lesson entitled 'How NOT to do it'!<br/><br/>The scene is this. Gabriel (Heath Ledger), distraught at the death of his new bride (and several other annoyingly self-righteous do-gooders) rides off with some pals to confront and destroy the evil Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs in an excellently evil performance - if this was X-Men). What follows is a lot of slow-motion killing, a 'don't go over there you fool, he's not really dead!' segment, a gasping for breath, twitching death scene in the arms of a loved one, and the most hilarious reaction acting from Gibson. He spends a couple of minutes trying to look lost in grief and ends up looking like he's chewing a wasp. Dreadful!<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, nothing really comes close to this scene, although watching Mel fight off the entire British army with only his sideburns and an American flag for assistance is pretty damn funny.<br/><br/>All other characters are woefully underwritten and act as window-dressing only, and that's a shame. The token slave would have made an interesting sub-plot, but he ends up just that, a token slave, and the film makers lack the conviction to tell us anything about him at all.<br/><br/>I suppose a lot of people will expect this movie to be a true and honest portrayal of an important part of american history. If they don't come out of the theatre feeling let down and disappointed I would be amazed.<br/><br/>On the other hand, they might just laugh their 'nads off!"

Then there is the depiction of the happy slave, an insult to the millions of Africans brought here and chains and whipped and raped by their ""masters.""

"jdkraus","8","5","7","27 February 2006"," Great in the first hour, but a swift change afterwords
","I saw this in theaters, and remember it very well. I have heard all the criticisms aimed at this movie, and I somewhat agree. This is a good film, but not great.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 1776, the start of the Revolutionary War. Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a patriot who fought in the French and Indian war, and is haunted by it. He does his best to raise his seven children, and owns a farm with some slaves. He decides to remain neutral and already foresees the disaster to come in the war, but he never expected it to come his way.<br/><br/>Two years into the war, a British army ends up on his front porch, and through his own eyes witnesses the horror of it, and the brutality of it, led by a vicious Colonel (Jason Isaccs). Because of his share of tragedy in the war, he joins the war effort with his eldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger), and Harry Burlum (Chris Cooper), and has his French assistant played by Tckey Karyo, releasing his ultimate fury, which can only be done by Gibson.<br/><br/>Everything is great, until after here. The film changes from brutal vendetta, to sudden coolness by Gibson and rather ridiculousness with the formation of the militia, bringing in new characters,and a whole new story of fighting for freedom, versus vigilantes. In fact, the film doesn't become an R again until the end of the film, with the climatic battle.<br/><br/>So, the film jumps to a sudden change, which leaves me disappointed, but the cinematography is truly beautiful and an artwork, which follows Gibson through the film, showing his darker side. The scenery is lovely and very authentic, and the score makes the pace go by fast, only delivered by the legendary John Williams. The battles are well choreographed, showing a fair amount of blood and maimed bodies, and a few very disturbing images (keep the children out).<br/><br/>I recommend this film not to history buffs, because there is no real accuracy to it, save for its brutality and that there were gatherings of militia that helped turn the tide of the war, but mainly to popcorn lovers. This is a good popcorn loving film, and I was entertained. It was good, but not grand like Gladiator or Braveheart. it does have an emotional impact in it, unlike most modern-day epics, but the great stuff in the film is in the first hour. don't be too disappointed by it."

Basically, many people, including to me, like this film, because of one presence in a them of the Gibson, but apart from it I shall mark off the magnificent performing of Jason Isaacs, who has built a convincing image of a villain and Heath Ledger, one of the young perspective actors which have perfectly consulted with a role of the high son of the protagonist. The director has overdone with external attributes of patriotism - such as abundance of the American flags, but as a whole film quite successful."
"freemantle_uk","1","21","42","9 April 2009"," Ultra terrible
","What does Mel Gibson have against the English? He made the awful Braveheart and he ends up doing this trash which is Braveheart 2 in all but name. What does Hollywood have against the British? It's not like we have been America's biggest ally since the Second World War and in a recently CNN poll 90% of Americans have a favourable opinion of Britain.<br/><br/>The Patriot focuses on Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a veteran of the French-Indian war. He lived in South Carolina in 1776 with his 7 children, working on his farm, with his black employees (first problem there). His wife had recently died and he just wants to live a peaceful life raising his family. In the State Assembly Benjamin even votes against joining the revolution. However his 18-year-old son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) decides to join the Contiential Army, but suffers defeat. The film fast forwards 2 years. Gabriel has become a messenger and given important document. Outside the Martin's farm was a skirmish between the Americans and British and Gabriel returns home. After the battle Benjamin cares for both the British and American troops, a British officer even thanks him. However Colonel William Tavington (Jason Issacs) shows up on the scene. He orders the Americans to be killed, burns down Martin's home, takes all the black workers so that they could be forced into the British army and takes Gabriel to be hung as a spy. It was during this that one of Benjamin's other sons, Thomas, gets killed, trying to free Gabriel. Its all these events that drives Benjamin to fight in the war, firstly freeing his son and ends up as the Colenial of the South Carlonia Milita. He fights a guerrilla war and becomes known as the Ghost. This leads to a battle of wits between Benjamin and Tavington/General Cornwallis (Tom Wilkingson). There are subplots, the father-son relationship and Benjamin's need to be a good father. There is Gabriel's love life. The recruitment of troops and the friendship between a slave and a racist.<br/><br/>This film is truly terrible. I hate historical inaccuracies in film and like Braveheart, the Patriot takes the Mick. The British never launched a massive terror campaign against civilians, let alone burn down a church full of a whole village. That was based on a Waffen SS attack in France, not 18th century America. During the war civilians were largely unaffected. Most slaves and Native American fought with the British. Native American got better trading deals with the British, whilst for slaves the British promise them freedom, whilst the Americans didn't. Also, for a film set in South Carolina in the end of the 18th Century they was little racism, a lot of tolerance and slaves seem happy with their work. The film erodes the ideas of the American War of Independence. The Americans fought for ideas of democracy and taxation, but this was ignored during the film, forcing on a one man struggle. Americans argued that the war was fought that because of the famous saying, 'no taxation without representation'; despite the fact that most British people didn't have the right to vote and the same for Americans in their state assemblies. The British argued that the Americans should have paid tax because they were in charge of their defend, especially during the French-Indian war. The British weren't evil during this war. The film made out that it was only just middle-class English soldiers, ignoring that there were Scottish and Irish troops in the British army. Also, one of the reason why Americans were angry with the British was because there was a large number of German troops in the British army. Also the main reason why American won independence was from support from France, Spain and the Netherlands, and they fought for their own self-interests against Britain, not because they believed in the American cause.<br/><br/>Like Braveheart, the British were made out to be as stupid and as event as possible, not fighting with honour. Tavington is a clear example of evil whilst Cornwallis was rather stupid, getting tricked easily, e.g. the scene of the prisoner exchange and his dogs surprising disloyalty. In real life Cornwallis was a perfectly capable commander of troops and the British army was a small, but professional force. The acting was wooden, Heath Ledger was terrible (which is surprising because of his later good work). Mel Gibson had his moments but he was nothing surprise for most of the film. Jason Issacc was cartoon character (he's better in the Harry Potter films) and Tom Wilkington was the strongest performance. No one stood out, and I find it weird that there was talk that Issacc could have had an Oscar nod for this film. The people of Liverpool were insulted with the character of Tavington insulting. Tavington was based on Banastre Tarleton who was Liverpool's MP for a while and supported Charles James Fox who supported the Americans during the War of Independence. At the same time Benjamin Martin was based on Francis Marion. Francis Marion was a man who enjoyed scaling natives. One scene in the film shows Benjamin giving his young sons rifles, and gets them to attack British soldiers: that's fatherly love for you. It is so bloody stupid a scene.<br/><br/>For some reason Roland Emmerich enjoyed using slow motion during the film, especially for the fight scene: it add nothing. The other problem is for some reason set piece one-on-one fights easily happened during the middle of battle: a little unrealistic. The only good aspect of the film is the realistic violence; with an excellent moment with a soldier getting his head torn off by a cannonball. But even here, it surprising how accuracy 18th Century rifles were.<br/><br/>The writing in the film is bad, the same level of Randall Wallace. He turned the American War of Independence into a one family struggle.<br/><br/>Films like this need to be stopped being made."

","This is the story of a man whose family is the most important thing in his life. That family is threatened by the outbreak of revolution and war. From the perspective of 225 years we call this event the Revolutionary War, but it was fought like a civil war because most Americans of the day considered themselves Englishmen. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson is great as a man determined to hold his family together and keep it safe from the destruction of war. How well he succeeds or fails in this effort is what the film is all about. <br/><br/>If you are my age you will remember the 1961 Jimmy Stewart movie, Shenandoah, set in Virginia at the outbreak of the Civil War. Shenandoah deals with the same theme found in The Patriot. I always thought Shenandoah was Stewart's best film. Mel Gibson's performance in The Patriot rises to that same level and I think it should earn him an Academy Award.<br/><br/>Whatever comparisons you've heard involving The Patriot and Braveheart, forget them. Both films have great energy, sweep and thousands of extras but The Patriot tells a story to which every parent can relate. This is a film you must see.

After a battle, he treats his son Gabriel, and both Regulars and Colonials. The brutal Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) burns down his plantation and kills his son Thomas (Gregory Smith). This drives him to seek revenge.<br/><br/>Should I ignore the bad history and enjoy the big action? That's the question here. I can ignore demonizing the Brits, or the cartoon villain. Maybe they didn't burn down a church. Maybe the characters are cartoons. Who cares? That's going to happen in any war movie. What I can't stomach is portrayal of slavery. They try to sidestep the issue by proclaiming all the blacks working on the plantation are actually free men. It really rang hollow. I rolled my eyes and tried to move on.<br/><br/>The action is terrific. One thing Roland Emmerich knows is big time action. He doesn't disappoint. I could still side with big action. It's still fun and games. The real Martin be damn. But every time a black person gets a scene, or blacks get a mention, the whole movie grinds up against reality. The movie tries desperately to excuse it away, and it's an awkward attempt every time.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson tries to Braveheart the American revolution. The problem is they run into the problem of slavery. While its good to root for the underdog Scots in Braveheart, the ignored underdog in this movie are actually the slaves.

The fight scenes and ambushes are the most entertaining part of this movie. The fight scenes are extremely well made and are not in the least bit watered down. The best part of this movie was when the guy got beheaded by the cannon ball. It was so gruesome and real! The low point of this movie was the initial ambush by Benjamin Martin. Though he was craving revenge for his lost son, the British soldiers were extremely bad actors. They just watched Benjamin Martin run through the trees without firing a shot, and seemed to be confused that all of the shots were not coming from one area. Other than this (which was still a good scene) the movie was really good. Occam and Dan Scott also get honorable mention for being awesome characters. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. Just don't nit-pick it apart - it's not a documentary! An overall fun movie. 7.5 / 10"

But as far as I remember the movie did a pretty good job of portraying the Revolutionary War without focusing on the heroes that are commonly associated with it.  The real heroes are the men who died in the war, fighting for their beliefs.  And this movie focuses on the people who fought who were common soldiers and did not go down in history as war heroes.<br/><br/>Some of you people are too picky.  When I go to a movie, I do not sit there and think of everything that is wrong with it.  I try to have an open mind in order to enjoy the movie more.  Besides it focuses on one man and his family, and just because there were very few black people in it does not mean that the movie as a whole is not acknowledging the important part that black people did play in the war.  It shows what a father would do to protect his family.  And (spoiler?)his past makes the character 3-dimensional with all the right emotions to prove that people do not emerge from war without losing something.  Most of the characters are fictitious yet do a great job of representing the people and beliefs of that time period.<br/><br/>The purpose of a movie is to entertain the audience who goes to see it. And for the most part,it fulfilled that purpose.  It also showed the struggle to create this country and the men who died for that cause.  It should make every American proud that they live in this country and remember all the people who died to make it what it is today.

You would think that after generating a billion dollars in the two years around this film, he would want to spend some of that goodwill on responsible citizenship in his adopted country. Instead, what we get is 'Braveheart' presented as history. It was fine in Braveheart to just make things up -- that was a mythical time and a relatively magical place. Creating a saintly giant is just good storytelling. But recent history is something else. History that changes the basic equations that defined the nation is something else. Tinkering with the notions of democratic self-determinism and collective deliberation is something else, especially when replaced by personal, uncontrolled vigilantism.<br/><br/>Worse, this defines not only what we think of ourselves, but what others think of us: violent thugs who react without limit based on personal vendetta.

And some, sadly, hold grudges based on lies.<br/><br/>This movie is not about history; it is a grudge-fest based on lies.<br/><br/>The movie has a scene of the peaceful American townspeople, after being lured inside a church, being killed when the British set fire to the church.<br/><br/>I think that if anything like this had actually happened, I would have heard about it, particularly in my college course on the American Revolution. The British, and especially their German mercenaries, weren't saints, and neither were the Americans, but they were downright gentlemanly compared to the sadists portrayed in this anti-British propaganda. <br/><br/>I would chalk it up to just another bit of historical nonsense from the film industry if it weren't for Mel Gibson, who has a long track record of such historical garbage, or for the German director Roland Emmerich.<br/><br/>You see it was Nazi Germany that actually went around massacring whole villages in cold blood. The scene Emmerich portrayed in ""The Patriot"" actually corresponds fairly closely to what the German Wafen SS did at the French town of Oradour-sur-Glane in 1944. They lured all the women and children in the town into the church, and after they finished listening to the killing of all the town's men, the Germans killed everyone in the church. You can see pictures of what remains of the town on the internet.<br/><br/>This was not the only time Germans massacred entire towns in France; there were also Tulle, Ascq, Maillé, Robert-Espagne, and Clermont-en- Argonne. And Nazi Germany did the same in many other European countries and in the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>It seems Emmerich wants to create some equivalency between the British and the Germans by portraying an entirely fictional scene in a mostly- fictionalized movie about the American Revolution. <br/><br/>Sorry, Roland, but myth does not equal history. Neither the British nor any of the Allies went around killing entire towns out of revenge, or for pure sadistic pleasure, as the Nazis did. <br/><br/>Sadly, some viewers will come away believing the hogwash in ""The Patriot"" if they watch it.

","Wow. You have a German director depicting the British burning down a church full of women and children. Now does that strike anybody else as ironic? After having read through the majority of these comments there seems little doubt that the film makers had their target market and they reeled them in. They went for the good ol' American flag waving, it's only a movie, don't take it seriously, good vs evil, black and white, don't need any depth or characterization, American movie goer. The more discerning American based comments do not like the movie for many reasons not only the 'dreaded' Historical Accuracy (it's only a movie! Geez) or the Nazi Brits. It really would be interesting to note American reactions if the shoe was on the other foot but then it wouldn't be Hollywood so they probably wouldn't watch it anyway. This film should not surprise people however. As someone else has noted Hollywood likes to portray the British as villains and has done so for many years. They always insult the American intelligence by figuring they need a simple good versus evil story and having an accent, preferably an English one, as the evil side fits in nicely with this. They must know what they are doing too judging by the money involved and the money the likes of this make. There is a disturbing trend towards skewing facts in movies and I for one do not subscribe to the fictional entertainment debate. The simple fact is a lot of people do not know, or care to know, history and they will take movies like this as fact. I know this from personal experience. It's absurd and insulting to the British. The sad part is it's only getting worse. 'U-571' took extreme liberties considering the US were not in the war at the time the movie took place and it was the evil Brits who actually captured the Enigma machine. 'The Colditz Story' has American heroes escaping from Colditz when NONE ever did. Ah but it's only entertainment and nobody is going to think it's really happened. Right?"

I should have expected the English soldiers not to be potrayed in a nice light, as it is directed by Mel Gibson, and will include his dislike/hatred of the English (Braveheart was similarly biased, though not too badly, though Gallipoli was just an insult to English soldiers), but I wasn't expecting the average redcoated soldier who was simply doing his job, to be shown as a mass murdering fiend who went around setting fire to churches with people inside. that particular event happened, though it was done by a group of American militia, who locked and set fire to a church with Virginian loyalist families inside. none of the atrocities dedicated to the British soldiers EVER happened. The War just wasn't like that. Personally, I think America was in the Right in trying to gain its Independence, but it was over the ridiculously high taxes imposed on the citizenry to fund an American continent army to fight the French in Canada, and not over ""Freedom"" which they alreay had to a large extent, and DEFINATELY not over slavery, for which most, including the main character Benjamin Martin (In real life he was Daniel Morgan), did not care about. He actually owned a number of slaves, bet you didn't know that. I think its insulting to the black population of America, because the result of the war was that slavery was still in practice long after it was banned in the British Empire. bet you didn't know that either. Bet you didn't know that the English baddie who murdered all those surrendering troops, in actual fact never murdered POW's in real life.<br/><br/>So Kudos to Mel Gibson for altering history to make himself look like the man who won the War of Independence, and to making the British soldiers (and there were Scottish, Welsh and Irish soldiers fighting there as well, which the director of Braveheart forgot to include in this film).<br/><br/>And before any of you out there say something like ""Well, we still won limey"" just remember that I think America was in the right in the whole war. I just don't like bald faced lies."

This disappoints several of Gibson's seven good-looking children, especially headstrong Heath Ledger (as Gabriel), who signs up to fight against his father's wishes. Next eldest Gregory Smith (as Thomas) must wait until he's seventeen.

","Samuel Johnson was right when he identified patriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel, and the proof is in this cartoon call to arms from the makers of 'Independence Day' and the Hollywood remake of 'Godzilla'. The film is a bubblegum whitewash of early American history, with all the misguided crowd-pleasing appeal of an Armed Forces recruitment ad, casting Mel Gibson as a conscientious objector (in screen vernacular always the next worse thing to an outright sissy) who rediscovers the moral rewards of deep commitment during the Revolutionary War, mostly by slaughtering half the Redcoats in New England. Screenwriter Robert Rodat waves the flag more stridently here than in his previous 'Saving Private Ryan', helping Gibson to shed his pacifism by presenting him with an adversary (British colonel Jason Isaacs) so evil and sadistic that even his own troops despise him (and later impaling the villain directly onto the Stars and Stripes, in a particularly grisly bit of low-brow propaganda).<br/><br/>The story invites obvious comparisons with Gibson's own Oscar winning 'Braveheart', but despite the quality of the production (and the transparent self-importance of its epic 160+ minute running time) the film is still little more than a prestigious vendetta drama, on the same emotional and intellectual level as any Charles Bronson 'Deathwish' scenario. Ace cinematographer Caleb Deschanel provides the fabulous scenery, and then newcomer Heath Ledger valiantly takes up the matinée idol torch passed to him by his on-screen father (and fellow Aussie heartthrob) Gibson."

","I'll start with the good things, the scenery, costumes and cinematography are fabulous, the battle sequences are very well staged and the score is wonderful. However, everything else didn't work for me. The film does suffer from a number of things(similar problems I had with Braveheart actually), and the historical inaccuracy is pretty much the least of its problems. This film does distort history, and badly, but it also suffers from too many subplots that prove superfluous in some cases, trite dialogue that make little impact and a truly pantomimic villain played by the usually excellent Jason Isaacs. The direction is nothing special, the pacing is too slow and the film is 10 minutes too long. The acting is lacking too, Mel Gibson tries hard with a very one-dimensional and unlikeable character but he struggles. In fact, only Heath Ledger gives a glimmer of hope and that is because he is the only character you feel sympathy for. Overall, I tried to like it, but too many flaws brought it down. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

I know they are supposed to be 'the villains' but often their cruelty is over the top, especially Jason Isaac's character. Another annoyance is the presentation of the battle scenes. While they are spectacularly choreographed and filmed, it's absurd when characters (eg. Martin's family) are viewing them like a football game instead of ducking for cover. Despite these quibbles, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Mel is absolutely convincing as the alternatively grieving and raging patriot. I found some of the death scenes so moving I started crying.

"Marz Aat","Null","8","14","12 July 2000"," A good movie in need of some editing.
","First off let me say that I liked The Patriot, and I think it's worth seeing -- especially given that there are so few movies set during the American Revolution, and this movie's acting and production values are good.<br/><br/>It's not a history lesson.  It doesn't purport to be a dramatization of actual historical events or the lives of historical personages though the inspiration for its plot can certainly be found among historical events. The only historical figure we see in the movie is a briefly glimpsed George Washington.  He doesn't speak and is seen from afar.<br/><br/>The story centers around one Benjamin Martin, played by Mel Gibson.  He's a Carolina plantation owner, widower, and hero of the French and Indian War. The movie opens with Martin putting his souvenirs of that war, including an engraved tomahawk, into a trunk and cryptically stating that he fears his sins will come back to haunt him.  Those sins turn about to be organizing an atrocity against the French and their Indian allies.  His role in that event is known to almost everyone except his children, and the memories of war keep him from taking up arms against the British though he thinks the colonies should be independent.  His duty, he maintains, is to protect his family.<br/><br/>But a son's willful enlistment in the Continental Army and the brutal actions of the decidedly ungentlemanly Tavington, an officer in the British Dragoons (his character is based on an actual officer nicknamed ""Bloody"" Tarleton just as Martin bears more than a passing resemblance to Francis Marion aka ""The Swamp Fox"" -- subject of a Disney movie of the same name) violently transforms Martin from a sullen neutral into the sort of violent avenger familiar from many of Gibson's other movie characters (see Hamlet, Riggs, Porter, and Mad Max) and, eventually, into a true patriot.<br/><br/>I didn't mind this character arc, expected as it was.  Dramatically it works, and, historically, the brutality and military and diplomatic incompetence of the British did push many a person off the fence during the Revolution and into the arms of the rebellion.<br/><br/>There are other things to like in this movie.  Historically, it does a good job in showing that not all the Colonials were pleased to have the French as allies, particularly the older soldiers who fought against them in the sometimes brutal French and Indian War.  The Carolina theater, with its savage guerilla warfare, a civil war where colonist turned on colonist, sometimes for political ends, sometimes to settle personal grudges, is well depicted.  And the movie shows a wide variety of Loyalist, British, and Colonials.  No side is universally brutal in the war.<br/><br/>But the latter is part of the movie's problem too.  This movie has too much going on, would have been served by another edit.  Screenwriter Robert Rodat wrote the excellent Saving Private Ryan.  Here, though, free from dramatizing events set against a quite specific historical event, his focus drifts.  At times, he seemed to be trying to write two movies.  One is about the American Revolution and its ideals.  The other is darker and about the practical and moral dilemma of whether leniency or brutality is the best way to bring a guerilla foe to heel.  The latter is the more fascinating movie, but it often overshadows the story of the Revolution.  Indeed, this plot of atrocity and reprisal could have been set in many time periods (including Missouri during the Civil War).<br/><br/>The movie also is weighed down by two romantic subplots.  One is a palatable, subtle romance between Gibson and the sister of his dead wife. The other is an intrusive romance between Martin's son and a woman whose main purpose is to satisfy the dramatic dictum that the innocent must suffer.<br/><br/>The movie also suffers from a lot of movie cliches:  enemies who conveniently go down with one shot except, of course, the villain; many a coincidence; and dramatic entrances at darkest hours as well as some literal flagwaving (though, in the movie's defense, flagbearers at this time were important to not only the morale of the military but also to its tactical deployment and would remain so at least through the Civil War).  Roland Emmerich, never a particularly subtle director (Exhibit One:  his Independence Day), delights in sentimental tokens in a way that would warm the heart of a Victorian melodramatist.  Besides the nascent American flag, he drags out  lead soldiers and silver necklaces and uses them not once, not twice, but several times as touchstones of poignancy.<br/><br/>I call them cliches.  But maybe these are what other people meant when they referred to the film as ""old fashioned moviemaking.""  However, the film's overuse of slow motion was certainly not old fashioned.<br/><br/>Historically, I was slightly bothered by the rather unbelievable congeniality that slaves and freedman showed towards Martin, a slaveholder, and his family.  (Though the movie does accurately show blacks fighting for both sides.)  The flintlock handguns used in the movie also seem to have unbelievable range, accuracy, and lethality.<br/><br/>Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans depicts the warfare of the period in a more exciting way.  Gettysburg and, of course, Waterloo do a better job showing the terror and tactics of Napoleonic style warfare though this may be the first movie to try and accurately depict the effects of cannonballs on massed formations as we see some decapitations and general maimings.<br/><br/>So why do I recommend this movie?  Because, beneath the sentimental excess and dramatic cliches, there is an interesting story of brutal warfare on American soil, and Gibson, in two or three scenes, is allowed to show a genuinely dark character who (rather like Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven) has been reformed by the love of a now dead woman and finds his violent nature again brought to the fore.  And it troubles him and his family."

","Although I am not an avid movie watcher, I am an avid lover of excellent movies.  Mel Gibson has always been one of my favorite actors, and as with many, Braveheart would have to be one of my favorite movies.  Once again, Gibson has given a role such realism, humor, character, and gentle charm, to make The Patriot the must see movie of the summer, if not the year.  Mel Gibson was not the only person to make this movie great.<br/><br/>The directing was superb, beyond anything I expected, and everything I hope to do someday.  Nothing in the movie, factual or technically, caused the viewer's concentration to be broken.  The costumes and props were amazingly accurate, and all fit the plot of the story perfectly.  The plot itself was realistic and contained many facts accurate with the war itself, causing me to feel as if I was actually witnessing a real event as it took place.  Violence, the reason the movie received an R rating, was abundant, but not overly used.  Although much bloodshed was shown, and gruesome ""hospital"" scenes were included also, they were strong enough to remember, but brief enough not to be overdoing it.  A testament to the excellent directing is the amount of superb performances by all characters.<br/><br/>Every actor played their role beautifully.  Each performance was real, and plausible.  From the son to the slaves, all performances added to the story and brought their own little piece of realism to the movie.  Not one performance in the movie took away from the story, all were acted with great emotion and beauty.  Although, Heath Ledger's performance is perhaps as strong as Gibson's, and definitely advanced the story with great emotion and realism.  My praises also go to the editors, and the writers.<br/><br/>Clean, I truly enjoyed the cleanliness of this movie.  I was not distracted from the plot by abundant and crude language, nor were unnecessary sexual scenes included.  So often good movies are spoiled by distracting sub-plots and unrealistic uses of vulgar language.  The language that was used at times fit the era, but was not over-used even then.  Thank you for writing a story that is so tight historically, and truly engulfs the viewer in some of the most heroic and tragic times of our country.<br/><br/>To anyone, of any nationality, I would recommend to see this movie, at no point is it portrayed that the British are completely a cruel nation, rather that one man over-steps his boundaries.  For anyone this movie is a testament to true courage and perseverance, and is an inspiring and enjoyable movie to watch."
"drmnc1","4","11","21","5 February 2014"," A film ruined by blatant inaccuracies to target blind patriotism
","Thank you, The Patriot, for compelling me so much to sign up on IMDb after being a long-time lurker. There has never been a historical film that infuriates so much as this one. It is possibly one of the least accurate portrayals of the American Revolution I have ever seen, and this film smacked of attempting to curry favour with the American masses. In fact, American patriots would feel disgusted by how badly the events, ideas and people of the American Revolution were depicted in this film.<br/><br/>The fact that this film attempts to target the blind, deep-rooted patriotism in America while blatantly trying to mask the historical inaccuracy and complete bias detracts from what could have potentially been a very good film. The directors didn't even attempt to try to be objective. However, this is what the monitored history in the America education system comes to, so I would expect nothing less. <br/><br/>One scene portrays this particularly well. The British Army burning down a church? Seriously? That is just truly ridiculous. Most British people were still devout Christians at that time; they wouldn't dare commit such sacrilege. Such mindless script-writing just proves the film-makers will stoop to any lengths to invoke American patriotism, to make the American people feel that there is no-one else who are as honourable and chivalrous as they. It is as if they didn't commit any sort of atrocities themselves in the American Revolution. Nobody remembers that before and after the setting of this film, the very same people portrayed in this film who brought America to salvation were the same people who also displayed the real extent of American treachery when they butchered, back-stabbed and reneged on their sham treaties with natives in the American-Indian Wars, but we won't dwell on that. I wonder why there haven't been any films of recent years portraying that conflict.<br/><br/>Every other character in the film laments how the new American nation will be ""the start of a new world where all men are created equal."" Of course, they fail to acknowledge that America failed to meet this criteria still almost 200 years after the film was set – Martin Luther King realised that. This is all hurriedly justified by the scriptwriters in a 10-second scene where the previously racist white man and the ex- slave make up – an entirely predictable scenario that anyone with a brain could see coming from the instant the two of them met. It is all such poor writing.<br/><br/>However, credit must be given that this film was actually quite gripping and had a very workable storyline that was very interesting. The vendetta of Benjamin Martin against William Tavington was a great storyline. The actual portrayal of the battles was fascinating, and quite accurate from what I was watching, and the fight sequences were also plausible.<br/><br/>War is not pretty, and it is the innocent that suffer the most. The Patriot actually displayed it very well. I am sick of seeing film after film where after the entire film, surprise surprise, none of the main characters have died, except one of course – the sacrificial lamb who's only purpose is to die at the end of the film. This actually makes the film a lot more gripping and interesting, and makes it a lot more realistic too. In war, not everyone comes out alive. It is rare you see this in film, and I am glad to see this occur once in a blue moon.<br/><br/>The story was touching and I could sympathise with Mel a lot. Here was me, thinking that kids were immune from deaths in films! The acting itself was quite good too (apart from Cornwallis, who the writers conveniently decided to portray as a moron, because according to them, British commanders were morons. Things never change I guess!). The action scenes were exciting and enthralling, especially the showdown between Isaacs' skirmishers and Ledger's revolutionaries. The final battle was pretty strong too. It's a shame that what could have been a good film was ruined by such patriotic mindlessness."

Historically it was simply ridiculous. 2 3/4 hours I'll never get back. Mel Gibson can get any movie made if they'll make ""The Patriot"". The idea that the British were on a level of evil with the Nazis is idiotic. Setting this movie in the Carolinas, where there was 50% black slave population and then not even adressing the issue, again shows a level of ignorance that is really startling.

"faralalala","Null","7","12","11 July 2000"," A great summer flick for all you musket carrying Patriots.
","Seems like the people making this film were trying to go for some big epic in the likeness of some other film about a war ravaged Mel.  Though this film is quite excellent, I have to say that this film has some glaring flaws.<br/><br/>First of all I must say that the action scenes are very good.  The first gun fight with Mel acting as an one man army was superb.  And when you see a cannonball flying through the air, expect some type of appendage to fly off. Then after that, the scenes got duller and duller.  Though maybe historically accurate, watching a whole bunch of guys line up like idiots to take turns shooting at each other is not that exciting and somewhat agonizing to watch when one realizes the stupidity.  I guess nothing can really compare with hand to hand combat(especially with huge swords *hint hint*).<br/><br/>As for the story, it was executed in a decent manner.  I loved the scenes in the beginning with all that father-son tension between Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger.  However, when the second half of the film came rolling along, the cheese was laid on pretty thick and it started to stink bad.  Though these scenes added a more light hearted tone at times, I felt it detracted from the dire tones of war.<br/><br/>In addition I must commend the actors for doing a fine job.  I really had no trouble believing the father son relationship and the representation of the British villain by Jason Isaacs brought chills to my spine.<br/><br/>
Overall, I would recommend this film to just about anybody except for those impressionable young kiddies.  Though I wouldn't say that the action can compare to scenes from Gladiator or BraveHeart, I'd say they come pretty damn close.  With an awesome soundtrack, flying limbs, a likeable protagonist and cold-hearted villain, I'd say prepare yourself for one intense ride."

","It's not the anti-english sentiment that annoys me, I'm welsh I could teach Mel Gibson a thing or two about it. What I found far more insulting was the PC treatment of the black characters. A South Carolina land owner having freed his slaves in 1776? I think not! 1876 maybe just about. This major annoyance only served to make an appallingly cliched piece of tripe even more unwatchable than it already was. Technically it's not bad, the settings are excellent the camera work and directing adequate. I've seen worse acting although I have seen an awful lot better as well. No what ruins this film is it's holier than thou cliched dialogue. Sadly it's very rare for a good script to come out of Hollywood these days. Sadder still is the fact that there is no 0 score on IMDB. The Patriot doesn't even deserve to score that highly. Rent Glory instead, ok so it's a civil war movie but the battles (the only good bit in the Patriot) are as good, the script is much better and it might just give you a better idea about how blacks were treated by the USA about 100 years later."

Tell me, why is it not okay to shoot a prisoner if they are fighting for independence but it is heroic to chase a soldier who is RUNNING AWAY and hack him to pieces in a river?

","To be fair some of the action/battle sequences are good, but my God it's nauseating at times. Mel Gibson uses the American flag to dismount the main villain from his horse, he waves it about in slow motion to bad music to 'inspire' to rebels to keep on fighting in the climatic battle, and he has black people working on his farm in South Carolina but they're not slaves of course they're more like modern-day employees who actually want to work there(!). The white rebel racist ends up as the best friend of a freed slave (who himself has suddenly fallen in love with the rebels who kept him as a slave in the first place), when 'Mel'asks Jodie Foster if he can sit down next to her she replies 'It's a free country... or at least it will be' (talk about vomit inducing), and this whole thing about Mel Gibson being a patriot is nonsense - he joined the revolutionary cause to get revenge for his son, not out of feelings of patriotism. And I never understood why rebels were called patriots anyway, surely the Loyalists were the patriots. Finally there's the thing about the British soldiers being portrayed carrying out acts of genocide which the Nazi's would've been proud of. This is so offensive words can hardly describe. Oh... and hardly any of the actors are that good (ironically the two which most stand out are British - Jason Isaacs and Tom Wilkinson). This film has a (very) small number of positive attributes, but overall it's stomach-churning drivel which, unfortunately, some people WILL take to be historically accurate."

"iyerlakerfan","4","6","10","8 December 2015"," historically inaccurate and jumbled story
","If you're entering the theater with the intent to place artistic integrity before blatant marketability, this is not your film. The Patriot is a jumbled, uncoordinated mess without a sense of moral ambiguity that insults the memory of American soldiers who gave their lives for a coordinated cause. It also attributes Nazi mannerisms to the British, led by Colonel William Tavington, who is portrayed by Jason Isaacs.<br/><br/>The plot is as similar to other Roland Emmerich productions (Godzilla, Independence Day, 10,000 B.C.) as it is insultingly simple. A colonial man named Benjamin Martin (played by Mel Gibson) is beset with disaster (the Revolutionary War), and must face it bravely, lest he lose his life as well. In the view of some, this is more of a disaster movie (both figuratively and literally) than a war movie, because Emmerich chooses to place the focus of the nearly 3-hour-long movie on the atrocities (most of which are apocryphal) committed by the British rather than the struggle of the well-meaning protagonist. In reality, church burnings by the British never occurred, there is no evidence Banastre Tarleton (renamed as Tavington in the movie and portrayed by Jason Isaacs) ever broke war rules and shot a child in cold blood, and prisoners of war were never needlessly shot down. This movie also decides that the character shouldn't own slaves (so why choose the location of South Carolina?), or it would make him look bad. This film decides to put big- budget profitability instead of historical accuracy, and hence fails to provide a proper story.<br/><br/>Interspersed throughout the movie are various ""hilarious"" segments meant to provide comic relief from a serious topic. Fake black teeth, a well- dressed Frenchman, a young lady's deaf father (who wasn't on the screen long enough to provide us anything to laugh at) and Gibson's children, offer nothing more than a simple pleasantry to distract us from Gibson mutilating a corpse with a tomahawk. However this comic relief is misplaced and takes away from the harsh realities of war. While all this may offer half a chuckle at best, one cannot miss the main problem with The Patriot: it follows a familiar storyline with monotonous characters whose struggles are too clichéd for us to sympathize with them. Additionally, the actors in this movie are curt and apathetic - e.g when a character dies, a potentially emotional and powerful scene ends up becoming a jumbled mess of pointless reassurances and quick recovery . Gibson's performance is not only limited by his monotonous drone in place of much needed emotion, but also hindered by a mediocre script and a too-liberal ""Americanized"" accent. However, his is not the only reviled performance. Heath Ledger is apparently sparing his talent for a later movie, as he seems to act uninterested in the production as well. Ironically, the only decent performance in this film was that of Jason Isaacs's, whose character was basically reduced to nothing but a cartoony ""bad guy"" left hopelessly for the audience to hate. <br/><br/>The movie doesn't care to focus on character development and emotions as much as it does on glorifying its special effects and slapping on a story at the end. Artistically, it provides nothing of significant merit whatsoever. For those who are looking for a film studio's excuse to show off their excellent CGI and special effects, this movie will suit their purposes. However, if you appreciate a truly compelling story, studded with wisdom, historical accuracy and a powerful message like I do, then let this disaster blow over without your help."

","The Patriot is my least favorite movie of the last 10 years, right down there with Pet Detective, Nature Calls.  The dialogue and plot are ludicrously predictable.  The movie has no heart, no depth whatsoever. The directing is pretty god-awful, too, since every actor comes across as if s/he's reading his/her lines lifelessly from a teleprompter.  That includes Mel.  Considering the money that went into production and paying for the big stars, you'd think the producers could have put a little more effort into finding writers who could write a quality script.

","Note: I would've rated this a 1, since it was what it deserved but note it is certainly not the worst movie I saw.<br/><br/>It just sucked =(<br/><br/>What I want to begin with is the positives of the Patriot then we'll play down the negatives. OK, there is nothing good about the movie. I cannot even begin to say how bad it was. If I were you, I would most definitely not let my students watch this or anyone excluding the people who would want to mock this film.<br/><br/>The action was cheap and fake; the uniforms looked so stiff like they were plastic or something and the backgrounds is like paintings. That said enough on the outside; let's proceed with the actual facts and ideas behind the movie.<br/><br/>Again, it is not very ""accurate"", in fact, it probably contradicts everything you have told us about the Revolutionary War. My first question is, why would they make up fictional characters when the historical figures are right there? And the film never actually includes that many known characters at that time. The only person in there I knew was Cornwallis. They also used tactics and tricks that are very controversial and not really probable. The characters were all pretty flat, I wouldn't care if they died or something. They were also pretty badly drawn out from history. Benjamin Martin was not a nice guy like how he was portrayed. Tavington was probably the worst character, all he had was one intent, to take revenge on Ben and it is just not interesting. Real soldiers, especially colonels would have much higher priorities and would value bigger problems over one man.<br/><br/>Would you honestly say that colonial militia would put up fake cotton filled depictions of British officers 100m away from Cornwallis and he would actually buy it? My guess is no, and I'm guessing so is yours. Then why would they do that? Again, I guess it was a low budget production film that is an inaccurate, shallow action flick that insults the actual events that took place.<br/><br/>I promised you some positives so I would briefly mention it since there is actually not much substance here. The only good part is the brutality of the film. I'm not saying violence is good and we should encourage it, but at that time it may have been the most appropriate. But unfortunately, that again brings back the negatives. Whenever the militia shoots it's like an expert marksmen shooting at a range like 1 ft away from him. They never miss. But the British, they are like losers with guns that have like bullets leaking out like water out of a broken pipe and its wood or something. This is probably the most inaccurate fact in the movie, since it was just the opposite.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm pretty sure you're pretty tired of me droning about how horrible the film was (even though it was =)), but I mean it's true. I find it offensive and not helpful, perhaps the only reason you would let us see it was to tell you how bad it was and compare.

My least favorite film is Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"". Aside from a complete and utter disregard for historical accuracy, it is so obvious and ridiculous in its manipulation of hokey emotionality, that I can only imagine that it will go down in history as one of the worst films ever made. Among my strongest complaints: 1 - ""The Dragoon"" suffers from the overblown, overwritten, overevil, scenery chewing villain complex unexcelled in the history of cinema, even as Mel Gibson villains go. Honestly, I would not have been surprised in the least if he had demanded to be brought a box of kittens, puppies and baby ducks, and then jumped up and down on the box, in slow motion, allthewhile cackling maniacally. To prove his evilness, he has an entire congregation locked into a church, and then has the church burned to the ground, to teach the rebels a lesson. The church literally burns completely down, but then in the ashes, one character finds a silver necklace, to prove that his love has died in the holocaust. Actually, the necklace must have been made of titanium, as it did not melt, or even scorch in the firestorm. 2 - Gibson's Ninja Children. When Gibson's oldest son is arrested, he and his several dozen motherless children go into the woods on a rescue mission, after one bit of instruction ""Aim low, aim slow"", the children are transformed into perfect marksmen, unaffected by the multiple killings each of them commits. Every shot kills a soldier, and not one of them gets the slightest scratch, or shows any emotion at having killed people.<br/><br/>Oh, I could go on, but even thinking of this trainwreck gives me such a headache that I really ought to stop."

Lofty ideas, but very attainable.<br/><br/>Movies such as The Big Blue, Blade Runner, Last of the Mohicans, Gladiator, Grosse Point Blank, LA Confidential, Boondock Saints, Get Real, Room With a View, Good Will Hunting, and yes Braveheart, to name a few, are what I call don't watch the clock and yes that movie is worth a second, third fourth look and eventually to be purchased.<br/><br/>The Patriot is one of those movies when you wonder when it will end.  We have heads being blown off, legs being blown off, Mel being a cross between William Wallace, Martin Riggs and a dash of Tristan from Legends of the Fall, and overall a movie that is just plain sappy.  The only saving grace was the convincing performance of the bad guy.<br/><br/>I could say more and go on; however, that would be about the same pain that this movie inflicted on my wife, a friend and myself.

First off, why is it called ""The Patriot""? Mel Gibson's character only fights because his son is killed, not because he wants to defend the land which he lives in. The protagonist is a typical one dimensional cold hearted guy with a British accent and that's about it. Speaking of the British, I don't have a problem with bending events/history to improve a story/themes, but Roland Emmerich just twisted facts so that the audience would hate the British and feel proud to be Americans every time Gibson shot one of them. The aspect of the movie which really left me scratching my head, besides the hokey story and terrible acting, was the end when everyone came back to rebuild Gibson's house. This must have been the most unrealistic part of the film. You better believe after the war these people would have been getting drunk and having sex, not building a house. I also thought that the ending depicted the soldiers as slaves or rather was a plug for Fascist government. Sure it put a tear and some people's eyes when they came back to build the house, but think about it, it's like they are tied to their master Gibson and can't break away from him; the end was like the slaves returning home out of the goodness of their hearts.

Mel Gibson, you should have known better than to have anything to do with this overly long, depressing dud.<br/><br/>Shame on the screenwriters for playing fast and loose with so many historical facts.

","Mel Gibson is hardly new at misrepresenting history.  He completely distorted the facts in ""Braveheart"" and now he repeats the trick in ""The Patriot.""  WHY he feels it necessary to so completely distort facts in order to win over the audience to his side is a mystery.  One hardly needs to have pseudo-evil demons to hate in order to take the side of the Scots or the Americans.  But he likes to make sure NO ONE takes the other side, I guess. I wonder what other war Mr. Gibson will try to distort next. <br/><br/>
The violence in this movie is hard to watch.  The story is sweet.  But it is completely lost on me when the situation is painted in such absurd black & white terms.  Brits - evil.

","...""Braveheart"" take two could be an alternative title. But really, ""The Propagandist"" would be most apt, since this laughable ""history"" is some of the most virulent Anglophobic claptrap I have ever seen. All the blatant inaccuracy of Revere's famous Boston Massacre engraving seems to be the approach, i.e., forget the facts, just hate the Brits! I couldn't decide if the cartoon characters shown as the Brits were more one-dimensionally stupid or one-dimensionally bloodthirsty. Oops! Maybe I've missed some unexpected character development in a Gibson flick - the Brits really were two-dimensional: stupid AND bloodthirsty.<br/><br/>And gee, what a ""good massuh"" Gibson's character was to his slaves - they all loved him. Kind of makes you want to be a slave and wonder what all that abolitionist nonsense was about! Can anyone even begin to believe how mangled the facts are in this mess of a film? Turning regular British soldiers into incessant civilian-murdering thugs may have been what one would expect of a period propagandist like Paul Revere, but surely we ought to expect a bit more truth and enlightened approach these days. And the watering down of the hateful institution of slavery, practiced by these ""patriots"", just sidesteps an historical dilemma we Amercians ought to be coming to grips with some day.<br/><br/>I am also very tired of the untruthful clichés in supposed historical films, and I thought the American public would be too at this point. What is really disappointing to me is that some of my countrymen are so sheepishly jingoistic that they'll get caught up in this ""hooray for the red white and blue"" mentality and like this film, despite what trash it really is.<br/><br/>For example, if these film makers had made a brand new Western showing the old clichés - the peaceful, civilized, settlers getting massacred by the savage, bloodthirsty Indians - the film would have been hooted out of the theater. But somehow, because it is so ""patriotic"" to support the American revolution, and fashionable in some quarters to think badly of the Brits, we accept the same level of outrageously untruthful clichés in this film.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who would prefer some small level of truth in their so-called historical films.

"Li-1","Null","3","4","6 March 2003"," Enjoyable, but easily the worst of Gibson's war epics.
","Rating: ** 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>Everything about The Patriot screams epic: the cinematography, the battle scenes, the score, the costumes, the sets, everything that is except for the script, which relies so much on overused clichés that some scenes are even a little painful to watch. Did we really need the subplot involving the little girl who won't talk to her father? Or the relationship between the racist and the slave and its contrived, ""Hollywood"" resolution? The basic story sounds just fine, a father who must join the Revolutionary War to protect his son, but director Roland Emmerich and writer Robert Rodat felt the need to tackle as many ""issues"" as possible to make this a true epic saga. <br/><br/>It's too bad the screenplay lets the movie down because The Patriot is noteworthy in many respects. Mel Gibson delivers another terrific performance, quite effortlessly, too. This type of character, the revenge-driven family man, is dangerously becoming a stereotype for Gibson (the family man stuff is still in both We Were Soldiers and Signs, sans the revenge). Jason Isaacs proves to be his equal as the delightfully nasty Colonel Tavington, a rather cartoonish role but played with zeal and fervor by the talented and underrated Isaacs. Heath Ledger makes his breakout performance here, but I fail to see what the hype was all about; he's flat and dull, though he's shown marked improvement recently in The Four Feathers.<br/><br/>The Patriot features two memorable action sequences, the first is a hair-raising, heart-pounding forest ambush that had me thinking the film would be daring to enter realms Hollywood usually strayed from. Silly me, the rest of the movie was pure Hollywood and seemed to forget all about the at best ambiguous behavior of Gibson's character during the forest attack. The final bloody battle sequence is appropriately rousing, thanks to the well-choreographed mayhem and John Williams' stirring score, but concludes on a somewhat pathetic note, as a certain character suddenly appears to grow eyes on the back of his head (you'll know what I mean when you see it). These first-rate action scenes deserve to support a better, more even film.<br/><br/>Before The Patriot, there was the immensely superior Braveheart, a gripping epic that delivered genuine passion, heart, and rousing battle scenes that made the three hour running time fly by. After The Patriot came We Were Soldiers, a riveting look at modern warfare, and its combat scenes were among the best of its kind. So The Patriot qualifies as a bridge between two superior motion pictures. Since it's a crowdpleaser, I have no doubt many crowds will be pleased. But realize that clichés can never be an apt substitute for real drama."

","Utter bilge disguised as history lesson which plays as such a typical example of a latter-day auto-pilot Mel Gibson career effort that one could go down a checklist. Over the top violence? Check. Gibson cast as a one-dimensional character who endures a ridiculous amount of physical turmoil? Check. Cartoony villains? Check. Death(s) of major supporting character(s) to give Gibson's lead a motivated vendetta? Check. The depiction of the British army is so laughable that it seems impossible they could have ever amassed an empire at all much less won any hard fought battles. Gibson is typically and unmemorably cast as a French-Indian War veteran and widowed father of a gigantic brood (no doubt Mrs. Martin expired from prolonged stays in the delivery room). He hopes to avoid any conflict in the forthcoming Revolutionary War, but when his family is targeted and threatened by Snidely Whiplash (oops, I mean Jason Isaacs channeling Snidely Whiplash), naturally a macho man has to do what a man has to do. The late Heath Ledger is on hand as Gibson's eldest son Gabriel. He looks pretty in Revolutionary War outfits, but there is little more to the role than that. Trivia claims that screenwriter Robert Rodat penned 17 drafts before settling on the current version. He should have penned at least another 17 more because the final version is trash. The film has all of the depth of a puddle. The British are all evil and stupid, Gibson is some unholy combo of Rambo and George Washington, and to say that the film takes liberty with facts is an understatement of massive proportions. One scene involves the British army locking unarmed women, children and old people in a church (including a major supporting character) and setting it ablaze murdering all inside. Try as I might, I have researched this and cannot locate so much as one recorded incident of such a thing being perpetrated by the British army in the Revolutionary War. The film's most laughable moment features Joely Richardson, as Gibson's sister-in-law and token love interest, being placed in charge of caring for his underage brood. When the British arrive at her home to take them prisoner, she literally sneaks them out under an entire platoon's nose by hiding under tables and behind bushes, etc. My description fails to do the lunacy justice - I thought perhaps I had wandered in to a children's fantasy-adventure for a moment. Total garbage - I suggest fans of this film pick up a book and read about the Revolutionary War - it would really be eye-opening for them."

But this was ridiculous. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when Ben Martin (Mel Gibson) comes running out of his burning house looking vaguely like an 18th century Rambo. Or when little Susan (Skye McComb Bartusiak) cries out in anguish ""Papa! Papa! I'll say anything you want! Just don't go, papa!"" And I loved the beginning, as the ""mailman"" delivers the package to the black woman at Martin's house and politely smiles and responds ""you're welcome,"" to her ""thank you."" This is South Carolina in 1776. I doubt a white man would have been so polite. Of course there's a lot of violence, and the nasty old British kill a whole lot of innocent people. Blah blah blah!

However the trailers left me feeling a bit flat, and I skipped it in cinema's.. my brother rented it on video and I caught a few scenes as he watched it, as I was in and out of the room. What I seen was laughably bad. Almost as if it was a spoof movie!! My impression of it was so poor, I've never sat down and watched it until now. <br/><br/>Well.... nothing I have seen here gave me the impression I was wrong!! The Patriot is boring, pretincious, ridiculously cliché and is just bad movie in general. Also the title makes no sense either. As Gibson's character was not a Patriot at all. He couldn't care less about the war, and had no desire to get involved at all, until a character dies, which spurns Mel's desire for revenge. Revenge not his patriotic duty. <br/><br/>Gibson goes through the motions, Heath Ledger gives the impression he is reading his lines from a none to helpful actors prompt book.. and Jason Isaacs is awful in full pantomime villain mode. <br/><br/>It seems like Emmerich tried to cram as many clichés in as possible, as if he was winking at the audience. But no. Sadly, it's serious. A peaceful man refuses to fight until a personal tragedy forces him into action, Children, who can not only outsmart red coats, they have a much better shooting accuracy than trained red coats too!! (As the bad guys all have terrible aim, so not too many heroes die) the token black guy and the lone racist (only one racist guy in 1776 South Carolina??

Pathetic<br/><br/>To put it bluntly, I'd rather go see a firework display during a thunderstorm than rewatch The Patriot.<br/><br/>However my thoughts were not echoed by many, as The Patriot was another $100 million grosser for Gibson, as it ended the year with $113 million at the domestic box office to finish the year as the 19th highest grossing movie of 2000."

Even super-patriotic Americans have to be thinking what they are watching is some old bull squat.<br/><br/>Now I know not everyone goes to a movie to be taught a history lesson but if you choose to historic piece you need to show both sides of the story in a true to life fashion or you just come off playing favorites.

Barry Norman would no doubt agree.<br/><br/>Why can't we ever have a movie showing the US as the bad guy? Mmmm?

"benderampage","Null","10","21","4 October 2001"," Woah! Could somebody stop the movie please? I feel sick!
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Mel Gibson, or The Eternal Champion, as he likes to be called, is beginning a habit of saving the principles of freedom during his wacky adventures through time.  I think The Patriot was relying on the hitherto infallible formula that overlong war dramas are always well-liked successes.  Come on guy, need I remind you of the Postman?!  Unfortunately, the respective Director/Producer team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin brought The Patriot to us.  These two goat-legged demonspawn were also responsible for the deplorably mind-numbing tripe that was Independence Day and the god-awful, Japan-free version of Godzilla.  I did, however, enjoy the ace camerawork of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel.  There were plenty, but not too many, beautiful shots of the countryside.  The battle scenes look excellent.  Despite its shortcomings, The Patriot was definitely a picturesque film.  The plot, on the other hand.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson plays a cop on the ragged edge, wait, I mean an ex-soldier on the ragged edge, whose name was Benjamin Martin. Don't let the malignancy of the movie fool you, Gibson is a phenomenal actor, and he shines through despite the movie in general.  After dismembering a large troop of French soldiers, he returned home to pray for forgiveness.  Martin's wife is dead, and he raised seven children alone.  When his oldest son, Gabriel, portrayed by fellow Aussie Heath Ledger, joins the revolt against King George's tyranny, Martin forbids him to leave, which makes no difference to the headstrong, idealistic Gabriel.  Gabriel returns `two years' later, (though there was little to no recognition of the passage of time) with a large bayonet incision on his midsection.  However, despite his adversity in nearly having his organs spilling out of his skin, the next day, he wakes up in his house with a bandage on that allows him to walk with no pain whatsoever.  The war is taken directly to Martin's front door, where he is caring for wounded, both American and British.  Enter the heartless bad-guy, Colonel Tavington, portrayed with startling evilness by Jason Isaacs. Basically, Tavington is the kind of character that would shoot a twelve-year old in the back and then chuckle about it.  Coincidentally, this is just one of the many horrors perpetrated by the chilling Colonel. He orders the wounded Americans shot, and arrests Gabriel as a spy, planning to hang him. As Martin points out, these are direct infractions of the rules of war. Bah, the evil officer cares not for rules; he kills without compassion or compunction.  That's what makes him evil.<br/><br/>This leads to a powerful scene in which Martin and his two young sons ambush a troop of twenty redcoats who are holding Gabriel.  The sons fire round after round into the British ranks.  Every shot is a kill, and they are crying the entire time.  Martin, after firing all his guns, runs into the fray with his hatchet and dagger, personally gutting the majority of the woefully incompetent British soldiers.  This scene was very powerful, so I won't disclose the entire happenings, but it was tremendously exciting.<br/><br/>
Later in the movie, we meet a character for the second time.  This is a character that I really didn't even care to meet the first time to be frank. I had truly hoped they forgot about her.  She was one of Gabriel's acquaintances from his younger years, all grown up and obvious fertile ground for an annoyingly childish love interest.  Well, they don't disappoint us on this ground, or, more accurately, they do.  Ann, portrayed with true-to-life irritation, has far too many scenes in which she and Gabriel trade a prank back and forth.  No, it's not the old rubber vomit in the luggage trick; they take unrelenting joy in giving each other tea mixed with a dash of ink.  Unfortunately, this ""imaginative"" prank leads to countless shots of toothy, ear-to-ear grins full of black teeth.  To his day, I'm not sure if the intent here was for humor, or to make us sad. After Martin and Son join forces, Gabriel walks into the church in Ann's town.  He tries to enlist the men of the town, but to no avail, they cower in fear at his bellicose ways, too afraid to fight the British.  A glimmer of hope appears as Ann, in a rousing speech, browbeats the callow men into joining the guerrillas.  This rousing speech was set to a rousing John Williams score, it would have been quite rousing if it weren't for the fact that it was stereotypical, poorly delivered, and set to a rousing John Williams tune.  Several of the people in the theatre, myself included, actually started laughing during this scene.  If there's one thing that knocks a movie down a few notches, it's uncontrollable laughter during a scene that is supposed to be serious.<br/><br/>While on the subject of female love interests that are trite, annoying, and unable to act, we have Martin's sister-in-law, Cleavage.  Uh, I mean Clara. She was portrayed with a number of low-cut dresses by Joely Richardson.  I can recall, early in the movie, thinking, `Oh, please don't let her be a love interest.  Please, movie, I'll do anything!'  I've seen enough movies by now to know that pleading with a movie is a very bad sign.  About two hours later, the movie kicks me in the teeth by showing a `romantic' scene between the Martin and his sister-in-law.  Overall, this is one movie that you should definitely see if you like having your brain cut open and sliced into tiny bits, or if you decide beforehand, that you just want to see people getting cut open by bayonets."

","Wow. Just when you thought Mel Gibson couldn't possibly go more over the top than he did in Braveheart, this movie comes along.<br/><br/>The entire movie is basically nothing but a pedestal for Gibson to stand upon. Of course he is only portrayed as the hero with only virtues and no vices or flaws, but then again his character has the depth of the story. Simply put: Americans good, British bad. I suppose you have to be an American to like this kind of cheese.<br/><br/> Anyway, the entire movie cumulates in a supposedly 'epic' final battle in which the American 'peasants' defeat the British 'elite army'. Anyone who is by now not swept away by patriotism will thoroughly gag, because Gibson single-handedly rallies the American soldiers with a self-indulging display of superman heroism that culminates in his killing of the evil English officer in the cheesiest and most over-the-top way imaginable.<br/><br/>Avoid at all cost unless you like to see Gibson playing the super specimen of the male gender, or think the world ends once you leave America's border and the rest of the world is stupid."
"k-thomas","5","6","11","6 February 2006"," Typical Hollywoods Version Of History
","The Patriot reminds me of those old world war 2 movies where the Japanese used to have sinister grins on their faces and show ten rows of shiny white teeth when about to kill the good guy Americans. For entertainment, the film is good. Very good photography,action and acting. The problem is, that for American students learning about the revolutionary war, it is a complete shambles. I agree fully with entertainer Spike Lee in that the black characters were portrayed in a very insulting manner. The British at the time of the revolution abolished slavery and offered freedom to all black slaves who joined their forces. Abraham Lincoln copied this during the American civil war. To give the impression, that a bunch of farmers, clerks a priest and even small children defeated the British army, who at the time, were considered one of the most disciplined and trained armies in the world is totally ludicrous.If you watch the special features on the DVD, it is explained how the French had a large impact on the outcome of the conflict.They supplied food, clothing, shoes and military assistance, unlike the film, where there was only one French military attaché. It is even stated on the DVD, that there would not have been an America if it was not for the French. Also it fails to mention how the Native Americans had an important role in the conflict and the Dutch and Spanish, who at the time, were also at war with Britain. As i have earlier stated, the film is entertaining, but to offer it as a historical account of the revolutionary war is an insult to peoples intelligence. I have read recently, that former US President Jimmy Carter is in the process of writing a book about the conflict and has stated, that young Americans today, do not know the full facts and wants to put things right.I am looking forward to the release of this book."

"chucknorrisrules","2","9","19","18 June 2009"," It could've been so beautiful
","I broke a vow recently that I had made that I would never watch The Patriot, but curiosity got the better of me and I watched it. First glance told me that this was an awful film that was borderline ""Birth of a Nation"" that would've made the KKK blush! Sometimes, it got so bad that I laughed my head off at it! Second time round, it didn't seem quite as bad, but still not great.<br/><br/>There are 3 main problems with this film.<br/><br/>1. Slavery is brushed over very tidily, something that Spike Lee was enraged about. In an early scene, Jason Isaac's character Colonel William Tavington offers freedom to all slaves who join the British army, to which the (entirely) black workers reply that they're ""not slaves"" before he simply press-gangs them into service. The Native Americans too, rarely get a mention. It is likely that it is because of the fact that though a few did fight with the colonists, the majority fought alongside the British because they felt that the emergence of the United States would result in them being ousted from their lands, and this would look embarrassing on film. Speaking of embarrassing, one of the worst parts of the film was the Caribbean-style village with the happy and contented black workers. I mean, we are in 18th Century America, aren't we? Not 21st Century Barbados!<br/><br/>2. My main problem (predictably), the British are portrayed as ridiculously O.T.T 18th Century Nazis. Granted, the British Empire wasn't always that nice with plenty of atrocities to boot, but neither side was worse than the other during the revolutionary war. However, here the British redcoats shoot wounded soldiers, burn down houses, kill people even to the point of barring them in a church and burning it, which is disturbing considering that the (German) director is copying atrocities that the SS committed in WWII (the church one matching the 1944 Oradour-Sur-Glane massacre) while making people believe we British actually did this in the war. To copy real atrocities to make ones that never happened in this war is not just unfair on us Brits, but on those who died in the real massacre. On a personal note, I do not mind if its about actual atrocities committed by our country, but making up false ones while making the revolutionaries as nauseatingly perfect is borderline nationalism that would embarrass the KKK! I don't really mind us being the bad guys. Sometimes it gets annoying, sometimes it's quite refreshing, but I counted the British atrocities in this film, and there were 10 of them. Considering that the Americans weren't as innocent as they were shown in the film makes it rather hypocritical of the makers. I mean, we don't need everyone to hate us on a false premise!<br/><br/>3. Some of the lines uttered by the likes of Tavington such as ""stupid boy"" are rather embarrassing, the sort of thing I'd expect from a villain twirling a long moustache with a top hat. The love interest was awful and completely uninteresting. The bit with Gabriel and the tea with ink in it wasn't a highlight, though the bit where the British general's dogs are taken by Benjamin was fairly amusing. Some of the special effects looked nice, but others were downright awful, with of cannonballs literally whipping people's legs and heads off, and the use of slow motion ruining some otherwise very good fight sequences.<br/><br/>The film's only saving graces were the cast (mostly). Gibson is a fine actor on screen (and certainly not an Anglophobe), most of the cast are very good, though often a tad sentimental. The other is the battle at the end, which at last, throws away all the Anglophobic propaganda with both sides fighting without any frills for once, with the exception of the showdown with Tavington. The other real saving grace is the beautiful settings, of the swamps, open fields, and forests, of South Carolina."
"psmith87","7","9","19","22 March 2006"," Watchable film, yet don't take its message to heart.
","This is a very watchable and enjoyable film, don't get me wrong. I feel compelled to say however that you should not believe a lot of what it says. I don't know whether Mel Gibson hates the British, or more specifically the English, but you would be forgiven for thinking so. But neither this film or indeed Braveheart do anything to make one think differently.<br/><br/>In wars bad things do happen, but the idea of honour and decency is something British officers are very much trained to practise. Even if a 'rebel' office was to commit vile act he would not have done so under the blessing of his commander.<br/><br/>Now as an Englishman I look at American films and wonder why many of the 'bad guys' have British accents. Perhaps an American will explain this to me one day. There is also something very wrong with the 'patriotism' idea in this film. It demonises one side (i.e. the British) and shouts the praise of the 'Americans'. Given the terrible acts carried out by the United states since such as the massacre of the native American Indians and the constant wars to expand its own borders this movie should have been more evenhanded. Especially since the old imperial system so vilified by Americans resembles very much what America is today.<br/><br/>It is important to say that I don't hate America and i don't go to rallies in which American flags are burnt, indeed I look to America as a source of friendship, yet why does the American film industry continue to make overly biased and plainly historically inaccurate films? Oh and as a matter of my own national pride, the wars of independence were won entirely because of the aid granted to the colonists by France!"
"tullymox","1","9","19","1 August 2000"," If you loved The Patriot, You'll really love The Savior
","Fresh from their successful depiction of the American Revolution in The Patriot, the team of Devlin/Emmerich is rebounding with another historical epic: The Savior.  Expanding on the themes that they and Mel Gibson brought to the table with The Patriot, this dynamic team intends to create a biblical epic that in their words, ""really kicks ass!"".  According to Emmerich, ""From Intolerance to that pussy Scorsese flick, Jesus has always been depicted as a mamby-pamby hippie type.  Our Christ will be loving, but he won't be afraid to wipe the floor with sinners when the story demands it.""  Filming began last week for the film that seems destined to be the Christmas 2001 box office champ, and the director is overjoyed with the results so far. ""I knew that we were going out on a limb by casting Steve Buscemi as Jesus, but like Michael Keaton in Batman, we know audiences will be sold by his performance.  And the rest of the cast: Angelina Jolie as Mary Magdalene, Samuel L. Jackson as Peter, Freddie Prinze Jr. as Joseph, and of course, Cameron Diaz as the Virgin Mary! And what would one of our movies be without world-class villains - Jason Isaacs as Judas Iscariot, Bill Plimpton as Pontius Pilate, and Patrick MacGoohan as Herod.  Imagine the spirituality of The Ten Commandments, combined with the poetic violence of Braveheart and The Patriot, instilled with the star power of an Irwin Allen film. Not to give away too much, but we intend to focus more on the neglected aspects of Jesus' story, especially the part where he leads his ragtag army to victory over the much better equipped Romans.  And in our story, the people who sell Jesus down the river don't get off so easily - there will be, pardon the pun, hell (or heaven) to pay."" The most intriguing aspect of the film is the decision to interpret the crucifixion and resurrection in a different manner than the New Testament.  As Emmerich puts it, ""Jesus is crucified, of course, but who's to say that he really died up there.  In our view, the Son of God could have just ""played possum"" until they cut him down.  Obviously, this makes his return so much more plausible. Subsequently, the ""Retribution Sequence"" will show the other side of Christ, the one who smites his oppressors rather than turns the other cheek. And for those who criticize our interpretation of history, we can only say that this is a MOVIE...get over your anal-retentive picky selves.  We intend to stay faithful to the history, but sometimes the story will dictate that we compress, rearrange, puree, liquefy, distort, obfuscate and rewrite whole centuries of recorded events. If you want to see it exactly as it was, watch a documentary or read a book"".  Who knows how close to the true events The Savior will be, but if their track record is any indicator, Devlin and Emmerich will be giving us another roller coaster tour through the past."

"petenjan_ws8","Null","7","14","17 October 2008"," It should have been called 'TRAITOR'
","Once again, Hollywood (and Gibson) try to re-write history. As with the anti-English 'Braveheart', films like this load of nonsense fail to point out is the truth behind the myth. Whilst mistakes were made by British officers, they were by no means the buffoons portrayed in this film. Having been saved from take over of the Colonies by the French, the colonists then refused to help pay for their own protection via taxation, and a number decided to revolt against their Country (Great Britain). By no means was the revolt a popular one and thousands of colonists fought for their home Country against the rebels. Others remained neutral. The French, Dutch and Spanish didn't fight much in the Colonies as they declared a World War on Britain and attacked or threatened British possessions everywhere they could - especially India, worth a LOT more than the colonies at that time. They were no fools and could see the danger to Britain of fighting on several fronts at once. It was less 'let's help the rebels' - more 'let's help ourselves, while we can'. This in turn drained the treasury and resources which meant that German troops were sent to fight. These troops were trained to fight European wars, and not against amateurs who rarely stood up to proper battle. Eventually UK troops had to surrender when a French fleet stopped the reinforcements and supplies reaching Yorktown. After that, the traitors succeeded and 'Independence' was gained. A high % of the colonists then moved to Canada. Funny thing is, the War ruined France, leading to the Revolution (thousands murdered) and the sale of Franco/American colonies to the new US. In the 1800's, the American Texans decided to revolt against the Mexican Government and stole Texas. Americans generally don't like France, which is ironic as but for them they'd never have achieved 'Independence'. Hulk prison ships were used mainly in the Anglo/American war of 1812, by the way. And the reason for the White House being WHITE? It was painted to hide the charred walls when British forces tried to burn it down when the American forces were pushed back from Canada to Washington. British officers even ate the Presidents dinner as he was in too much of a rush to escape. I love my American friends - but get SO tired of teaching them their own history...."

To put the behaviour of an British Officer (historically a colonial i.e. American) in such a context is not only historically untrue but highly unethical. I was frankly disgusted and outraged.

"FightingIrish","10","5","9","28 July 2001"," What great war films are made of
","Let me start out by saying that ""The Patriot"" is one of the greatest films I have seen in a very long time. Its tremendous originality comes from the fact that no other movie(s) about the Revolutionary War have been quite like it. And buried within the film it tells a story of a family. This family is slowly, and unhappily torn down by the war. It is a very sad film in the way that the family is destroyed(many of Mel Gibson's children are violently killed)and it really shows the bonds that they hold with one another. Another aspect that I particularly enjoyed was the acting. Jason Isaacs(Event Horizon) does an excellent portrayal of a ruthless antagonist, and Mel Gibson also does a splendid job as a father, desperately struggling for redemption and vengeance. I recommend all 165 minutes of this film, because even though you will cry, the overall film is not depressing, and the end will leave you with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>
Note- I also want to say that the MPAA was foolish in their rating decision. Small children probably should not see this, but as for teenagers and the like, it is certainly appropriate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

"PostTime","9","5","9","3 July 2000"," The Patriot should become a classic.
","I had been waiting for a long time for the release of The Patriot.  But, because of recent reviews, I had some reservations about the film and if I would see it at all.  Besides being a movie buff, I'm a history nut and Family Genealogist, so the haggling over historical accuracy was a factor influencing me. Unlike most people, too much playing with the facts would turn me off Very much.  Well, I'm happy to say that The Patriot, despite some minor transgressions, is a Very Entertaining movie and should be a classic in its genre for years to come. Sure, it doesn't emphasize just how much loyalty to England there was in the south, hence the reason England shifted their strategy there.  How Loyalist militias were involved.  Nor do they show the approx. 80% support the blacks gave the British as well, making the refugee hideout very unlikely.  Logistical errors, such as large mortars at inland campaigns during the Revolutionary War, can be forgiven since it didn't figure prominently. The story is about his family and the events that effect them.  It's about Personal sacrifice and principle.  This is where the story makes its biggest statements.  If most people stopped and realized that the Revolutionary War was NOT a popular war, but one fought by a minority of people dedicated to the cause, they would probably be shocked.  Such was the sacrifice those people made to create the first real Democracy since ancient Greece. Martin's character is Not based just on one person, as some critics try to claim in order to deflate the film because of the background of that person, but on a composite of at least four people.  The idea, after all, is to present the movie based on the events of the time.  It's not a documentary. In this sense, it fulfills its purpose very well.  Excellent entertainment with some minor historical alterations doesn't hurt this film.  Ignore the over sensative hupla about the ""errors"" and enjoy a very good film. Ladies....bring some tissue.  There were very few dry eyes amongst the ladies I seen leaving the theater."

"Verbatima","Null","9","20","5 June 2001"," Those English are awful people. Let's kill 'em.
","(That was sarcasm.)<br/><br/>Hollywood's general portrayal of the English is puzzling. (Not being English myself, I make this comment as a neutral and detached observer.)<br/><br/>First, you have your garden-variety romantic comedy.  An English person in a typical romantic comedy is a moderately cute blond guy dressed in unprepossessing catalogue attire and touting an exaggerated British accent, which passes with the general public not only as a sign, but as the very essence, of sophistication.  Indeed, what a hottie a British man is: foreign enough to be exotic, but not too much so; just enough accent to make English sound like a foreign language; and yet, you don't have to learn a language to communicate with him -- which, given the Americans' overwhelming aversion to foreign tongues, is of utmost importance.<br/><br/>Then you have the other genres, in which the English characters range from sterile and repressed to downright demonically villainous.  THE PATRIOT adheres to the latter stereotype.  I cannot begin imagine how offensive this movie is to the English viewer.<br/><br/>And what of history?  The American revolution was the revolution of the intellectuals; it was over taxes, fine points of political participation, the meaning of citizenship -- it was not prompted by acts of extreme terror and genocide, as the  movie seems to suggest.  There was violence to be sure, but it occurred on both sides, and it was neither the long-term cause nor the trigger for the American Revolution.  And let us not forget those colonists who were severely punished by expropriation of their property, banishment, imprisonment, and execution merely for refusing to renounce their allegeance to their original sovereign.<br/><br/>Of course, the sophistication of the revolution's causes does not mean that the colonists were unjustified in rebelling.  But the Americans are forever plagued by a nostalgia for a story of woe more compelling than that saga of resentment over the stupid stamp taxes.  We envy older nations their titanic struggles, their big chunks of suffering.  WE did not have a Hitler.  WE did not have to struggle for our very survival as a people and a culture (yet). For all that lofty verbiage in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence, the grievances that follow it seem boring and petty.<br/><br/>To that extent, THE PATRIOT is a miserable cry of that nostalgia rather than a conscious indictment of the English.  Though I doubt that would make the English viewers feel better."
"friman-2","1","9","20","18 December 2000"," Horrible
","This is a story about a revolutionary called ""The Patriot"", hmm...<br/><br/>The photography is impressive and especially the first battlefield is breathtakingly pictured. Here the sheer stupidity of warfare is shown, as well as the reason for why regulars were considered more reliable the militia (better discipline). All the little details are in place, the red coats, the ""sleeping bag"" for the soon to be married as well as references to various historical persons. The action is usually well co-ordinated, in particular the scene were they describe by pictures rather then words why Gibsons character is a man people used to fear. However his berserk rage cools quickly and he once again becomes the calculating guerrilla officer.<br/><br/>
The actors fill their parts, Gibson is greying but still strong and honest, the son is handsome, and his love chaste and the rest (of the American part of the cast) have endearing features, even those that are somewhat unwashed.<br/><br/>So far the film comes together well, the first quarter or so is entertaining, then it falls apart. It really does not matter if you have all the details correct when the big picture is completely out of focus. That the only person in South Caroline who seems to own a slave is described as a despicable exeption to the norm, as well as the prejudice filled soldier who in the end comes to terms with his black brother in arms, comes across as somewhat false. There would be another war before black rights within the US were begun to be addressed and a hundred years from that conflict there were forms of segregation in many American states that had been outlawed in Britain before the start of the war for independence. The French aid (not only of a fleet, but also of supplies and troops) is downplayed and the sole Frenchmen is there more for comic relief then to be a hero. In all this rewriting of history (only a few examples give here) the fact that the colonists are portrayed with many very modern views and are nothing like the people I studied when I read about the period is almost to small a detail to mention.<br/><br/>This is a film about a war that were the start of a on the whole very positive thing, the United States, but the director seems afraid to say anything that might appear damaging to the ""heroes"" of the era. Instead they have created a fairytale story about a war fought on one side by heroes and on the other by scum and idiots. There are entertaining parts but on the whole it is only depressing. I could not help but think of ID4, especially the president's speech (""...today we celebrate our independence...""). The film is like that speech, only more the two hours long with only the occasional break for action. If you like ""On Dangerous Ground"" (Steven Seagal) because of its realism, ""The Postman"" (Kevin Costner) for its great story and think John Wayne the greatest actor ever to have lived this is a film for you. Otherwise hitting your head against a wall is more pleasant then living through this spectacle."

So, I think that proves I'm not a commie, with the attention span of a fruit fly.  I liked Braveheart.  A lot.<br/><br/>While the cinematography was adequate, and even interesting in some shots, the editor of this movie pretty much raped anything that the director of photography might have set out to do.  Cuts are made sometimes without even a 10-degree change in the camera's position.  Its no suprise the editor, David Brenner, also worked on ID4.  Its similar to the Armageddon school of ""Needless cuts.""<br/><br/>Apart from some laughable CG, the fake troops and scenery is generally good. I doubt I would have been able to spot them if I had not seen a small story on the process behind making the battlefield shots on Dateline:NBC.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich (previous sins:  ID4, Godzilla), the director, seemed to fancy the look Saving Private Ryan and Gladiator used (with better effect on SPR's part) with diagonal shutters, and altered shutter-speed.  Thankfully the action stays zoomed-out for the most part, unlike Gladiator where it was mostly close-up blur.<br/><br/>This seems to be a good sign, but there is very little action. One of the opening night battles is a good sign to come, with gunpowder explosions lighting up the nearby forests beautifully.  But this action is not sustained.  That would be fine if the director could make us feel anything for the characters, but they are all walking cliches.  Emmerich relies heavily on a horrible, forgettable score.  I was shocked to see this was written by John Williams.  A stinker in every respect.  If this maudlin crap is your excuse for good orchestral music, I feel sorry for you.  Please try to listen to some real music in the future, by competent composers.  Its a sad day for soundtrack fans I guess.  Hopefully he can pick up his former glory with Episode 2.<br/><br/>I'll steal a quote from Steven Spielberg and say that this movie's portrayal of war was very pornographic, especially at the end.  The joyous swells in the score accompany mindless, English robot-drones happily skipping to their deaths.  Come on.  This movie has nothing to say, and insults the intelligent viewer.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson got paid 25 million dollars to be in this movie.  The Usual Suspects cost 6 million to MAKE.  Taxi Driver cost 1 million to MAKE.  The Godfather cost 6 million to make.  Pulp Fiction cost 8 million to make.  I hate to think of how many great, original, and interesting films were sacrificed to get this crap produced."

The cinematography was a bright spot, but the movie was slowed down to a crawl by Gibson's overacting and poor mastery of a colonial accent.<br/><br/>The direction was a let-down, but was inhibited by a non-linear screenplay...somewhat reminiscent of Godard.

That would be where a good story and movie would begin, and this movie ended. Too bad that Mel did not apply some of his devotion to realism (""Passion of the Christ"") to a story deserving of it.<br/><br/>After ""Braveheart"" and this, the next movie will star Mel as a Boer General against the awful colonial Brits, or as Gandhi against the awful colonial Brits, or maybe as de Valera against the awful colonial Brits, or maybe Menachem Begin against the awful colonial Brits -- ad nauseum!<br/><br/>On Another Note<br/><br/>Some comments here have asked ""whether it made sense to anyone that a black man would ever fight with a slave state"" (South Carolina) for the cause of freedom. Despite stereotypical expectations and historical revisionism, black men did, indeed, fight bravely in the American Revolution on both sides. At the battle of Cowpens in South Carolina, Banastre Tarleton was beaten in a fair fight by Patriot tactical brilliance. During the battle, Lieutenant Colonel William Washington (cousin to George Washington) dueled hand-to-hand with Tarleton and was saved only when his young African-American bugler shot his pistol at a dragoon with raised saber. <br/><br/>African-American soldiers later fought on both sides of the American Civil War, as well."

Not only were pistols smoothbore, they had an impossibly short barrel, and the image of the British Dragoon Colonel taking careful aim, barrel resting on his arm, sniping a fleeing militiaman is purely Hollywood.<br/><br/>I won't mention the Nazi-like atrocities committed by the would-be Gentlemen of the Dragoons.<br/><br/>Steele"
"senortuffy","5","7","15","3 February 2003"," Revolutionary fluff.
","This movie tugs at all the viewer's heartstrings as it portrays a family transformed by the American Revolution, but it is totally lacking in depth.<br/><br/>
Mel Gibson is miscast as the family patriarch raising seven children on a South Carolina plantation.  As in ""Braveheart"", he is womanless, which I suppose was supposed to make him look more noble in our eyes.  But it only makes for awkward moments with his sister-in-law, Joely Richardson.  And as in ""Braveheart"", the movie only picks up when Mel works himself into a rage.<br/><br/>
But that's about the extent of the emotional range shown by the movie's lead - awkward nobility and rage.  Mel as everyman just doesn't fly (Harrison Ford who is great in that kind of role turned down the part).  While I like him as an actor in certain parts, Mel Gibson just doesn't make this a very interesting movie.  He's too modern and doesn't belong in a period piece, as shown by his equally weak performance in ""Mutiny on the Bounty.""<br/><br/>
Another thing that annoyed me was all the leading American characters were played by non-Americans:  Mel Gibson, the patriot of the title (Aussie); Heath Ledger, his son (Aussie); Joely Richardson, Mel's love interest (British); Rene Auberjonois, a minister who joins the rebellion (Swiss/French).  Chris Cooper was the only American in a lead role.  I don't want to be nationalistic in a movie review, but you'd think the producers could come up with an American cast when making a movie about the Revolution.<br/><br/>Another sore point was how blacks were perceived in the movie.  From the opening shot where a black woman in the kitchen fusses over Mel's children like they're filming a floor wax commercial, the whole treatment of blacks in the South is antiseptic.  At times, the black characters are embarassing to watch.  You'd never know slavery was a bad thing from watching this movie.  Walt Disney could have written the script the way blacks were portrayed.<br/><br/>The best roles are reserved for the British villains.  Jason Isaacs plays the sneering Colonel Tavington, and his character is evil personified. Anticipating his inevitable death is about all that carries the movie for the last hour.  The very capable British character actor, Tom Wilkinson, is cast as General Cornwallis and is superb in the part.<br/><br/>
Eye candy for the most part, especially for the ladies who drool at the mention of Mel's name, and clearly designed to play to our emotions, but for the most part, this movie fails to break out of the mold of pedestrian entertainment."

","It's been a while since I left a movie theater this mad.  I actually argued with my friends all the way home.  This movie had some good scenes, but the director just needs to hook up with Jerry Bruckheimer and leave historical epics to someone more gifted.  Filmmaking lesson #1- you should never talk down to your audience...I thought this movie was very condecending.  If you cannot make a film that can sustain an audience's interest for more than an hour without having incredibly sadistic scenes with the cartoonish villan hurting defenseless people to outage your audience with righteous indignation, you are in the wrong business.  This is the kind of film that causes stupid people to get the wrong idea.  I sense alot of bad sentiment for the British if this becomes a hit (unfortunately, it probably will), and I do not blame them if they are pissed off about the main villan's actions. From what I have read, these actions have no vaild place in history. Cornwalis himself did not come off so bad.  They should have left the film as a battle of wits between Mel and Cornwalis, as in the hysterical ""negotiation"" scene.  Poor Mel seems to have sold his soul to these hacks for his 25 mil paycheck.  I actually thought he was going to impail his nemeis with the American flag at the climax.

","""The Patriot"" is without a doubt the best movie about the American Revolutionary War that was ever made. The movie is somehow the Revolutionary War's version of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" but only in reverse. Where in ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is a story about a young German student Paul Baumer who gets caught up with the pro-war enthusiasm of August 1914 and eagerly joins the Kaiser's army only to lose his love for war after seeing up front the horrors and bloodshed that war spawned. Where as in ""The Patriot"" the story is just the opposite.<br/><br/>In the movie we have a man Benjamin Martin, Mel Gibson,who fought with honor and bravery in the French and Indian War of 1754-60. Martin was so repelled by the war that he never wanted to have anything to do with war again. It wasn't until his home was burned down and his young son Thomas, Gregory Smith, was murdered by the British and his older son Gabriel, Heath Ledger, taken away by them to be hanged that Benjamin Martin changed his mind. Turning into a tiger and fighting like hell against the Red Coats with a fury that was impressive enough to inspire those of his fellow Colonialists to fight along with him.<br/><br/>""The Patriot"" is both grand in scope and deep and rich in the history that it presents. It's everything that a movie about an historic event like the American Revolutionary War should be. Well written and acted with beautiful and breath-taking photography and with an eye on the details of the era 1775-1781 that makes you feel as if you were there. <br/><br/>You can see just what a good actor Mel Gibson is in his first battle scene when he attacks a British unit with his two young sons who have his older son Gabriel being taken away to be executed. In a matter of minutes he changes from a peaceful and law biding person into a savage and blood-thirsty killer that's so convincing that it almost makes you for just that moment feel sorry for the British soldiers. Who are about to kill his oldest son and murdered by shooting in the back his younger son Thomas just moments before.<br/><br/>There's a number of equally effective scenes in the movie ending in one of the most action packed and realistic battle sequences ever filmed in any war movie in motion picture history. <br/><br/>With the movie ending at Yorktown Va. with the British Army of Gen. Cornwallis trapped between the Continental Army on land and the French Fleet blocking their escape to the sea on October 19, 1781 that ended the Revolutionary War in the American Colonialists favor. <br/><br/>""The Patriot"" is always being compared to Mel Gibson's previous historical movie classic ""Braveheart"" and alway seems to come out second best. I feel that ""The Patriot"" is every bit as good as ""Braveheart"" if not even a better movie. It's ""The Patriot's"" misfortune to have been made some five years after ""Braveheart"" so it comes across like it's not an entirely different movie then ""Braveheart"" but it's sequel"

","ON the one hand, I think it's brave to examine an era such as this, and look at the issues at hand, from the settlers point of view.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, so much of a formula is used here, for Jingoism and patriotism, presumably to make sure the movie sold tickets.<br/><br/>After seeing the film, and the scene, with the British burning the church, I was shocked to see that the British would do such a thing. I went to read my Revolutionary war history...and guess what, they didn't. May be in the 1950s this was OK, but in the modern era, fabricating events from wars that simply didn't happen is not OK, and distorts how people see history. This is not a responsible attitude to re-telling history. Overall, great production values wasted on a jingoistic simple tale made for the mass market. Don't bother."

"rrichr","Null","6","13","24 April 2004"," The Patrionator
","Quick Name one reason why TV is cool. Ok How about this? It lets you see movies like The Patriot without having to buy a ticket. Sure, you'll miss a bit of the R-rated carnage, but hey, that's why we have imagination. It's why Quentin Tarantino released the pull-way version of the ear-ectomy in Reservoir Dogs instead of the alternate version that actually showed Michael Madsen's razor work. The mind is the real stage, the real screen.<br/><br/>The Revolutionary War will probably never work well on the Hollywood screen. There are several reasons for this, all of which would require more space to properly examine than is available here. Suffice it to say that, despite its crucial role in the history of America, the Revolutionary War is simply too quaint to sell major tickets; best to leave it to PBS, maybe. Pigtailed men running around in knee breeches, marching in rigorous order and firing flintlock rifles that require minutes to load between shots doesn't exactly put us on the edge of our seats. But neither does the scowling, bellowing Mel Gibson, even as he hacks his way through a platoon of Redcoats like Toshiro Mifune with a tomahawk, avenging the rather brutal and unnecessary death (in terms of the story) of his youngest son at the hands of the British. The Patriot will, and probably should, irritate anyone with a reasonable knowledge of history, the references to which, in this film, skip off reality like a flat stone across water. The War of Independence really does deserve better. It was far, far more interesting than its pro-forma representation here.<br/><br/>So, is there nothing good to say? Well, damn near. However, The Patriot did render a superb villain in Jason Isaacs' Colonel William Tavington and it is around this somewhat trumped up spirit of darkness that the film really orbits. The Tavington character radiates the same cold light that emanated from what is possibly one of the very greatest portraits of nastiness ever brought to the screen: Jack Palance's gunfighter Jack Wilson in Shane. The fact that Tavington was forced by the powers to act more like an equestrian Reinhard Heydrich than an English gentleman of the era betrays the film's lack of confidence in its own historical foundation. The Brits pulled some funky stuff during the Revolution. Armed conflict tends to bring such things out in us. But atrocities as heinous as were ascribed to the British in The Patriot never occurred. Director Roland Emmerich is German. Perhaps he has residual issues over the outcome of World War Two. The historical person on which the Tavington character was obviously based, Colonel Banastre Tarleton, actually did command British forces in the Carolinas during the War of Independence, and was certainly interesting enough to warrant a film of his own. Tarleton was not the near-satanic presence that Tavington embodies, in fact quite the opposite. It's safe to say that if the boyish Tarleton, and not Jeb Stuart, had been commanding Lee's cavalry at Gettysburg, he would not have been dashing about stealing wagons instead of shadowing the Union army. The outcome of the battle, not to mention history, might well have been different. Still, the Tavington character is the one element in the film that really resonates. Maybe The Patriot should be re-released under the title, Bad Dragoon. <br/><br/>Rene Auberjonois, whose alienated, unflinching Constable Odo was probably the best thing about the otherwise moribund Babylon Five rip, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and who played the courageous reverend in The Patriot, also played the young George Washington in a 1974 episode of PBS' N.E.T. Playhouse, ""Portrait of the Hero as a Young Man"" depicting Washington's participation in the opening actions of the French and Indian War, when he commanded colonial militia under the British. For those wondering why Mel Gibson's Benjamin Martin refused to answer his son's (Heath Ledger) repeated question: `What happened at Fort Wilderness?', I may have an answer. There was, of course, no such historical place. If the definitive authority on such matters, the eminent 19th century historian Francis Parkman fails to reference it, then, it was never there. However, there is a Disney resort of that name in Orlando. Mel was probably embarrassed to admit that he overpaid for his cabin."
"MovieAddict2016","5","8","19","22 June 2005"," Politically correct, racist and dumb.
","I used to really like ""The Patriot."" Unfortunately, I watched it again recently and found myself quite disappointed. It's too silly, really. The ending, for example, is a hoot (somehow I had overlooked it countless times before). The Brits are all these vicious, stupid dogs and the Americans are smarter, better, stronger, and cooler.<br/><br/>It's extremely politically correct, so much so that it's almost laughable. In one corner there's the stereotypical black freedom fighter. In the other, the Evil Brit. And in yet another corner, the Man Who's Lost His Wife and Doesn't Want to Fight Because He's a Father and Has Learned to Value Human Life Despite His Violent Past (similar characters exist in every movie ever made, just about).<br/><br/>There's an exchange of dialogue that goes like this, during a fight: <br/><br/>(Before fighting the boss on level eight - err, I mean the British):<br/><br/>White Racist: You're a free man, now.<br/><br/>Black Man: I'm here on my own accord, now.<br/><br/>White Racist: I am honored to be fighting alongside you. Truly honored.<br/><br/>Then the black man smiles warmly.<br/><br/>It needn't be pointed out that this is awful stuff, but just for the sake of pointing it out to you: This is awful stuff, folks.<br/><br/>Later, during a retreat, Mel Gibson's character grabs the American flag, hauls it forward, yells ""No retreat!"" and waves it in the air. The black man looks on fondly. The point of all this is clear but it's way too heavy-handed and stupid. It's subtlety on the level of that scene in ""Cool Hand Luke"" (the only problem I have with the movie) where Paul Newman complains he just sees a lot of guys laying down rules. The exposition is unnecessary, and in both cases it ruins the flow of the scene.<br/><br/>So, to summarize: The movie is politically correct (it was originally going to be based on the Swamp Fox but they weren't allowed to show a hero mistreating his slaves, as the Swamp Fox did) and racist. It's anti-British, which I don't really have a problem with because every movie needs a villain, but it's a bit too much.<br/><br/>A couple years ago I considered this one of the best war films of all-time. Now, I see a pop culture reworking of a historical period, transformed by the director of ""Godzilla"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" into a silly, poorly-acted (apart from Gibson, who I'll always enjoy in film), stereotypical jumble of the biggest clichés in the book."

Well, my response is that 1)they don't see alot of movies, 2)their patriotism overshadows their aesthetic sensibilities or 3)they are simple-minded people who need characterizations, story-telling and acting drawn with the broadest of strokes so they aren't confused by such unnecesaries as historical accuracy. Now I'm from a former British colony just like you Americans, but we Canadians would never publicly display our hate-mongering on 2000 screens across the country and applaud it as a nation (at least I hope we wouldn't). Every non-American in this movie is seriously flawed, including those helping the Americans (the French), and every American, regardless of their actions is seen as a paragon of humanity and the same injustices that the ""evil"" British foist on the Americans, when duplicated by the Americans, is justified.  I thought we were in a more enlightened era now but this trash brings scapegoating to a new high.  I think the director, writer and producers should view Leni Riefenstahl's 'Olympia' as the pinnacle of propaganda (or perhaps they already did).  On a positive side, John Williams' score was a bit less derivative then usual and I jumped during the infamous 'cannonball scene'."

Their gun is one shot per reload, so their fight like stupid who stayed in the line while hoping that the bullet will miss in their head.

"fairchild_media","2","7","16","5 July 2000"," A just plain lousy film
","(Minor spoilers)<br/><br/>Disappointing and awful. I can't remember the last time I saw a story so trite and cliche. Braveheart transplanted to a different time and place, only without all of the stuff which made Braveheart great.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a hero of the French and Indian War who's now a pacifist living in South Carolina. It's 1776 and the War for Independence is underway. The barbaric British kill Gibson's wife (oops - that's Braveheart - I mean his son), p***ing him off into a crazy-angry vengeance, so he massacres the English garrison at the stockade (oops - that's Braveheart - I mean the British patrol marching along a road) then rounds up all of his highlander buddies (oops - that's Braveheart - I mean all of his colonist buddies) to wage a clever, outwit-the-uppity British campaign.<br/><br/>And the Braveheart rip-offs don't even begin to tell why this film sucks so badly. It's just a display of second-rate (and third-rate) writing, storytelling, acting, and dialog. Even Mel Gibson is just a two-dimensional walk-through for most of the film - he only has two or three scenes where he does any real acting. The only decent acting in The Patriot is done by Heath Ledger as one of Martin's sons. And ALL of the roles are caricatures and stereotypes.<br/><br/>Without ruining any surprises, here are a couple of examples from the film of just why it is so bad in specific areas - <br/><br/>Dialog: ""May I sit with you?"" ""It's a free country. At least, it soon will be.""<br/><br/>Plot contrivance: Could we guess that the black slave, fighting for the rebellion so that he can earn his freedom, would risk his life in a ""dramatic"" moment in battle to rescue the mean white guy who's been deriding and belittling him throughout the film? <br/><br/>Stupid, over-the-top idiocy: Geez, there's too much to choose from here - I can't pick just one example.<br/><br/>It gets worse. Jason Isaacs plays evil British Colonel William Tavington. His ridiculous, two-dimensional part is so badly conceived, so heavy-handed and so unremittingly stupid that it sends the film out of the realm of historical drama and into the world of cartoonish idiocy. He's obviously based on real-life British dragoon officer Banastre Tarleton, who commanded a legion in the south and committed some atrocities (he massacred a bunch of prisoners after a battle), but is taken to silly extremes just to make us hate those bad-guy British and salivate for the inevitable, one-on-one man-to-man showdown between Mel and the Evil British Officer as a pitched battle rages around them.<br/><br/>Gibson's character is also an obvious rip-off of real-life ""Swamp Fox"" Francis Marion, whose real-life exploits make all of this high Hollywood drama look terribly lightweight by comparison.<br/><br/>The best effects and prettiest views in the film are the couple of brief shots of ships - some in Charleston harbor, a British supply ship at anchor, and VERY impressive shots of the French fleet off Yorktown. Those had to be CGI and/or miniatures - I can't imagine there are that many square-rigged warships in the world today - but holy cow, they looked completely REAL, even when firing their guns.<br/><br/>The battle scenes have a few good elements. It is impossible not to be impressed when viewing rank after rank of period-attired and accoutred soldiers advancing across the field, presenting their muskets, and firing a volley. The cannon effects are pretty nice. But the battles overall are lousy - very poor overuse of slow-motion, making the scenes look silly. There's also much use of whatever that annoying digital effect was which was used in some of the fighting closeups in Gladiator. It looks bad, and it's distracting.<br/><br/>Now, for the choreography of the individual fighting stuff - it's worse than you see in a terrible no-budget TV show. REALLY poor. Jerky, badly-rehearsed and executed, with lots of the supposedly fatal blows obviously and clearly missing their supposed targets by a good foot. Very Three Stooges, only Stooge violence looks much more believable and realistic.<br/><br/>Pukey, pretentious score by John Williams, but since those are the only kind he does these days, it comes as no surprise.<br/><br/>I expected a lot from this film, based on the actors/writers/directors involved, but it is just a really crappy movie from start to finish.<br/><br/>Awful, awful, awful. 2 of 10."

Conflating the Brits with the S.S. is awful (read Schlink's The Reader for a discussion of the ramifications of the same S.S.'s tactics.)<br/><br/>Heath Ledger was really cute, though I'm not sure he really came across as a passionate idealist (I read an article that he was nervous as hell working with Gibson as his idol and I think that showed).<br/><br/>Why is Gibson always pairing up with much younger women? Joely Richardson as his wife's sister must have been barely older than his ""son"" -- and what is that a baby she's carrying around at the end?<br/><br/>It's always nice to see Chris Cooper; he's a rock.<br/><br/>This is definitely for those of us who like historical fiction. It reminded me of ""Barry Lyndon"" and the ""Sharpe"" series, which are both more thoughtful, deep, and better done. Only towards the end are the dramatic possibilities of the non-repeating, takes time to re-load muskets used whereas that's glossed over for most of the movie, probably on the assumption that Americans are used to more rapid-fire violence, and this is as violent as ""Gladiator.""<br/><br/>The mattes of backgrounds were used very effectively, particularly of the harbor and battle scenes.<br/><br/>John Williams's bombastic music is awful.

","I dunno? Maybe it's because the American Mel Gibson spent so many of his formative years in Australia he now feels the need to prove he's more American than the rest?? This is a solid entertaining movie but as history, ""it sucks big time"" as our American cousins would say. I won't give away any ""spoilers"" because I wouldn't want to dignify the plot of this disgusting film with response. Ok, a quick history lesson. By 1770 the British Empire was a fat lazy monolith, led by a fat lazy degenerate king. Britain's American colonies had quietly become a nation in the making; they'd ""come of age"", but the Empire just couldn't see it. What we should have done (with hindsight) was to accept the inevitable and welcome this new nation. What we did is, history. Britain did not lose the war, they failed to win it - just like America in Vietnam!!! The British Empire could have won (and I'm glad it didn't) but there was no domestic support. That again should ring a bell across the atlantic. As an amateur historian I'm really angry with all concerned. The Patriot presents the Americans as saints and the British as nothing more than nazis. Rubbish!! The scary thing is that young Americans might watch this distortion and actually believe it; just because Hollywood says it was so. You'll notice that Gibson's Black servants weren't slaves. For God's sake! They must've been the only free African-Americans in the whole of South Carolina back in the 1770s!! This appaling film has actually damaged British/American relations and for that I'd like to give Mel Gibson a metaphorical kick in the goolies.

","And in a good way, too. Given the title and subject material, I had expected to be deluged with ""Isn't America a wonderful nation"" type of dialogue and endless exposition of how freedom is to be valued etc. Whilst there is a certain amount of this, it was nowhere near as bad as I had feared an, as a result, I found myself enjoying the film for what it was - one man's struggle with his own demons and morals - and not yawning my way through the propaganda.<br/><br/>Gibson gives a solid performance as the aforementioned haunted individual, reluctant to take up arms against the British as he knows what horrors war will bring.<br/><br/>The British are portrayed variously as strutting fools or vicious, callous murderers. Jason Isaacs in particular is excellent as the commander who will stop at nothing to get the job done - in this case, crushing the American rebels. As a Brit, I suppose I should be more upset at the portrayal of my countrymen, but I know well what a dark time our colonial past was, so it didn't actually bother me. I actually found the characterisations rather humorous, which was perhaps unintentional. However, the characters are far too one-dimensional to take much exception to.<br/><br/>There are some interesting battle scenes and some eye-openers too. For instance, the thought that warfare was once conducted by lines of men standing facing each other and shooting until one side was completely wiped out or ran away made me smile in disbelief at the foolishness of it all. The fact that it is also true is the most shocking thing. Now, of course, we can obliterate an enemy without ever having to look in his eyes, so you tell me which is the most insane.<br/><br/>The story did seem to drag slightly in places, but not overly much, and the plot threads are very predictable. You know who will end up with who and who will die, who will win over the friendship of who, despite mistrust etc. But this does not harm the story in any real way.<br/><br/>Overall one of those movies that will probably end up being shown on TV at holiday times.

"RJBose","Null","6","14","19 February 2001"," According to this banal collection of movie standards, it was Mel Gibson, not George Washington.
","The Patriot is well filmed, but in the end it's just a ""politically corrected"" amalgamation of well-worn and painfully predictable Hollywood stereotypes and storylines, with scenes and plot ""twists"" lifted directly out of movies we have all seen a thousand times.  (There is a certain verisimilitude, though, imparted to the 18th Century battles scenes reminicent of the same type of ""reality"" that was brought to the D-Day landing segment of ""Saving Private Ryan"", and for this one can really gain some appreciation for what American soldiers went through during the Revolutionary War; I suspect, however,  that the true reason for this was the film makers' desire to show people's limbs being separated from their bodies by 12 pound cannonballs).<br/><br/>So here we have Mel Gibson as a South Carolina plantation owner, widower, and loving father to seven children: a well know ""bad-ass"" from his exploits during the French and Indian War (1754-63), Southern aristocrat Gibson now does not believe in violence, and wishes only to farm in peace. (This brings to mind the Clint Eastwood character in ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", who joins with the rebels only after his family is murdered and his farmstead burned by marauding Union troops). Gibson's politically correct plantation has no slaves, remarkably enough, but families of African-Americans happily working there of their own volition, as we are duly informed; the African-American woman who is the housekeeper and cook speaks perfect 20th Century English, and apparently can read too, since she casually examines the mail dropped off by a rider in the opening scene.  Actually, Gibson himself has no Southern accent, though some of his neighbors do.<br/><br/>At this point the evil English officer is introduced to the movie, who promptly and cooly shoots Mel's 15 year old son to set the plot into motion. His character is identical to the English villain in ""Rob Roy"", or the Sheriff of Nottingham from Robin Hood, for that matter: the upper class accented heartless butcher, seeking to compensate for his own wretchedness and unhappiness.  Forced into action, and to return to violence, Gibson's character confesses to the atrocities he and his collegues visited upon the French during the previous war.  In previous generations a military hero would have been shown in a psoitive light; for PC Hollywood today, however, the hero's exploits are now to be reviled as sadistic and murderous: his victory is not one of courage and tactics, but of torturing captured French soldiers (who had themselves committed heinois acts).<br/><br/>So the movie lurches on from battle to battle in predictable sequence. Some of these scenes, and indeed the climactic battle scene, seem to be directed lifted from ""Braveheart"", although with weapony slightly more advanced: hordes of men yelling and charging on broad fields with Mel in the thick of it.  Along the way the British are turned into SS troopers, more happy African-Americans are found living in African harmony somewhere near the coast (presumably of South Carolina) but speaking without the slightest trace of Southern, or African-American dialects or accents.  (A boorish white soldier in Gibson's command who scorned the black slave enlisted by his owner in Gibson's militia of course is later saved by him, and solemnly proclaims that he is ""honored"" to serve with him, lest any in the audience have missed this message).<br/><br/>George Washington and the Continental Army get pretty short shrift in Gibson's war, but in the pivotal battle, conveniently just before Yorktown (where the British surrendered) Gibson rallies the troops 'round the flag when the lines are faltering (just before finding and facing his nemisis among the 30,000 or so present on the battlefield)and siezes victory from the jaws of defeat- the Revolution is saved, and America is born! (Not before the ""we've-seen-this-at-least-a-thousand-times-before"" fight to the finish between Gibson and the evil British officer who murdered his son(s).This scene comes directly from ""Rob Roy"" in its choreography).<br/><br/>This movie unnecessarily demonizes the English, plays havoc with history to effect its Hollywood PC messages, disparages the accomplishments of American revolutionary soldiers and layers on tired diagloge, plot devices and sermonizing for any who have missed their ham-handed point of view.  As history it's a joke.  As a ""patriotic"" American film, it's disingenuous. As entertainment, it's only passable (barely).  It is not absolutely horrible, but that's really the best thing I can say about it, and that's rather sad."

","How do I bring my disgust over this movie to words? Difficult.<br/><br/>One of the things has to be the music: the music tells you a minute or two in advance what is going to happen the next five minutes.<br/><br/>Another thing: apart from the music, the predictability is just too much to bear. After an hour of movie, you know there's going to be another 'sympathy kill'. Which happens, 10 minutes later. You also know that Mel Gibson himself has to kill the b****rd, so the son won't succeed. It's template stuff. It's just too easy. You know when it becomes apparent to the viewer that Gibson and his sister-in-law aren't blood related, that there's a romance coming.<br/><br/>I don't think I need to go on. There are some positive things though. Gibson and his son (forget his real name) give good performances and his son's wife has a lovely face. Furthermore I would like to add that in typical Hollywood movies you can't discriminate against any minority, race or nationality. Except the English/British. It's just too ridiculous. An Englishman is always the bad guy, from 'Gone in 60 seconds' to 'Lost in space' and God knows how may more.<br/><br/>A couple of one-liners are okay ('Better one tyrant three thousand miles away, then three thousand tyrants one mile away') and the cannonball-mutilations are spectacular, but as a whole, I think I am lenient in giving this movie a 5 out of 10."

","""The Patriot"" is an American movie by German director Roland Emmerich, who is somewhat known for his spectacular Hollywood blockbusters that unfortunately rarely have achieved greatness in terms of storytelling. This film here is no exception. There are several run-times stated here and I watched the version that is the longest, the director's cut that runs for almost 3 hours, very long just like some other Mel Gibson films. Gibson was an Oscar winner at this point already for directing ""Braveheart"" a couple years earlier. ""The Patriot"" was also the breakthrough movie for Heath Ledger at the age of 20 and there are more somewhat famous actors in here such as Joely Richardson, Rene Auberjonois, Chris Cooper and Jason Isaacs.<br/><br/>I must say I never had a great interest in the days of the Civil War, so I may be a bit biased here. However, the biggest problem with this movie is probably the lack of emotion. They included plots about dying sons, a dead wife, honor and death in general from start to finish, but I must say, there was not a single situation when this movie really made an emotional impact. I do not think that it was Mel Gibson's fault. I appreciate him as an actor and I do believe he has good range. It's just the usual from Emmerich movies: style over substance. His films tend to get lost in great visuals, costumes, sound work etc., but they rarely succeed to work truly convincingly in terms of the story. This is also shown by the Academy Award nominations this film got including one for the legendary John Williams and also one for eternal losers Kevin O'Connell and Greg P. Russell. I cannot recommend this movie. Technically it may be a high-quality achievement, but story-wise it is not, especially not for a 3-hour movie. Thumbs down."

","Benjamin Martin is a South Carolina widower and well-to-do plantation owner with seven children. He was a brave veteran in the French and Indian War (1754-1763) that was fought on the frontier away from the settled families. Knowing that the new War of the American Revolution (1775/1776) will be fought on the ""home front,"" he is reluctant to fight. There will be a heavy price to pay. His oldest son Gabriel, who has already joined the Continental Army, returns home wounded from a nearby battlefield. Before long the homestead is overrun by British forces, and Ben's family cares for both the American and British wounded. Gabriel though is taken prisoner. Brutal British Colonel Tavington (obviously the infamous Banastre Tarleton; he even wears green) orders his men to kill the entire Continental wounded, condemns Gabriel as a spy, and orders the burning of the family house. While attempting to save Gabriel's life, another son of Ben, Thomas, is shot dead by Tavington. Incensed, Ben and two other, younger sons tail a 20- man British platoon that has taken Gabriel away for execution. When the dust clears from Ben's ambush, the English are cut to pieces (all are lost save one) and Gabriel is freed. Back home Ben witnesses a significant defeat of the Americans under General Horatio Gates in an unspecified battle (it would have to be The Battle of Camden, even though it occurred later, in 1780). Gates' tactics and heavy use of militia against British regulars were disastrous. With the fastest steed, he made a quick escape. His temporary replacement is Colonel Harry Burwell (in reality serving under the most capable General Nathaniel Green of RI, George Washington's second-in-command). Meanwhile British General Cornwallis, the victor at Camden and Charleston, chastises Tavington for his cruelty, and orders him to take prisoners alive rather than shoot them.<br/><br/>Ben now decides to join the war effort with his son Gabriel. His surviving children are sent to his dead wife's sister, the youthful Aunt Charlotte. Ben and Harry somberly discuss the strategic situation: there is no American force between Washington's in the north and their own in the south. If the southern army is defeated, Cornwallis can move north and hem-in Washington's troops, possibly ending the Revolution. In addition the Continental Army in the south is still composed mainly of militia. Determined more than ever, Ben's forces break up into smaller bands that harass and ambush the British (a la Francis Marion, the famous ""Swamp Fox""). Military recruitment is increased; slaves who enlist receive their freedom at war's end and receive five shillings per month. Over time the tide seems to be changing. There is still hope for help from the French: ""Absolument"" insists French officer Villeneuve.<br/><br/>The disappointed Cornwallis again calls upon Tavington; the latter says he can turn the tide again but ""What did you say about brutality?"" The officers know that Tavington's return to his evil ways will ensure that he will not be able to return to England at war's end. Perusing a color map, they discuss the new western land of Ohio. (In reality Cornwallis was no fan of Tarleton.) Tavington's return to viciousness is with a vengeance. He orders the population of a captured small town into a church. The doors are padlocked and the building set ablaze along with the congregation (fiction). Gabriel's new wife is one of the victims. (In reality Tarleton was never as evil as Tavington's portrayal although he certainly destroyed homes and provisions). Then, during a subsequent encounter with the British, Tavington sets a trap and turns the tables. The result is that another of Ben's sons dies (Gabriel), and many Continental officers are captured. Ben is devastated. After a thought process Ben overcomes his grief and leaves his surviving family with a slave settlement. He tricks Cornwallis and recaptures the officers by a ruse.<br/><br/>The time is fast approaching for the climatic battle to determine the victor of the southern sector. In one of the most exciting Revolutionary War battle scenes ever filmed, the battle sways back and forth. At a critical moment, Ben picks up an American flag and charges into the British ranks. The retreating Americans follow to a great victory (unspecified in the movie, but a fictional version of the Battle of Guilford Court House, 1781). Actually what had happened was that the British, after mopping up in Georgia and South Carolina, sustained two unexpected battle reverses (King's Mountain and Cowpens). To change matters, Cornwallis eagerly fights the Battle of Guilford Court House, which he actually wins. But the victory is Pyrrhic as he lost one- quarter of his entire force. General Greene, who actually chose the battle site, withdrew his unbroken Continentals in very good order. Then the British general moved through North Carolina to Virginia on to coastal Yorktown. In the movie events are indeed fast-forwarded to the Yorktown site. There the British field army is trapped by land and by sea. The northern Continental Army under Washington has already force-marched the allied troops from Newport, and are besieging the British by land. And, for once at the right place and at the right time, the French navy is shelling the hapless British. The latter's position is hopeless as they cannot stop the relentless allied bombardment of their positions. While the subsequent British surrender does not immediately stop the conflict, the writing is on the wall. With the long war finally over in 1783, Ben returns to his family and his new love interest (Charlotte). He will help rebuild the new nation.<br/><br/>While The Patriot is not always accurate, one cannot deny that the movie is exciting and the action terrific. The cinematography is gorgeous, and who can deny those excellent set designs and costumes? The director masterfully recreates America in the late 18th century, although life was not quite as hygienic. Give kudos to the great acting. For all of these reasons the picture is recommended."

Unavoidably reminiscent of Braveheart the film holds your attention with its vivid set design and intense battle scenes, though it feels more like a one-man quest for vengeance rather than a historical drama.

","Now despite the inaccuracies thrown throughout the film, the sets, battles, and the acting is very well done in comparison to other films of this same genre. However these does not erase the wrong message from this film. I am an American, and I also know a thing or two about history, and The Patriot is not a piece of history. All British characters in this film are portrayed as evil. And all Continentals are portrayed as something just under being saints. First of all the British never did ANYTHING remotely close to what was shown in this film. They never burned towns, or killed women and children on the levels shown here. They are not some evil race hell-bent on our destruction. The Continentals on the other hand did do many of those things throughout the war against many British citizens. In fact Sam Adams, a ""patriot,"" did many things to Loyalist settlements that the British in this film did to Americans. What is worse though is the fact that this movie portrays these misconceptions as facts worthy of a textbook. All this movie does is alienate the British, and become good propaganda for militaristic right-wing groups. So I would not recommend this movie for anything other than being an action film, other than that it is offensive, inaccurate, and militaristic."
"ntsci","Null","2","3","25 July 2006"," terrible history, but an OK brainless action flick -- Conan the Patriot
","As someone of Bristish ancestry, I feel very offended by this film... But on the other hand, the story is entertaining, the costumes are well put together and the military technology is for the most part well presented. Apparently Mel Gibson thinks we English are Nazis. Lets think, hummm, who ended slavery first the US? Very funny how the slavery issue is dealt with in the movie given the fact that it was the land of the free where slavery was accepted for another 80 years (after the war of 1812, Britian refused to give back slaves freed by the British armies because they argued that people are not property).<br/><br/>It would be nice to see an honest film about the revolutionary war... people struggling for self determination and puritan ideology (a leftover from the disastrous English civil war) on the one side and on the other side a superpower not really knowing what to do, but above all not wanting to lose face in a manner that would make its rivals (e.g., France, Austria, Prussia, Russia, Turkey, Spain) think it was weakening.<br/><br/>If you can get past the horrible depiction of the British, and the excessively nice depiction of the American, then the movie is an OK story about being forced to fight for ones family. It might be argued that this is fiction, but the story is about real events and present a very distorted depiction of real events that has the danger of distorting the audiences perception of those actual historical events. If Mels wants to write pure fiction, set the story in a fantasy world (e.g., like Conan the Barbarian, or Star Wars). If on the other hand Hollywood creates a story that touches upon real events in a manner than can damage the audiences understanding of it, I think there is an obligation to keep to historical facts.<br/><br/>Incidentally the battle near the end where the Americans turn the tide in the movie was actually a pretty small affair -- Cowpens. It was an important battle because it was a turning of the tide where the American began to work out tactics that were affective against their more experienced but less numerous foe. The book ""What if 2"" cites it as one of 13 times when the revolution was in danger of collapsing.<br/><br/>Certain aspects of the film accurately depict how an invading army would act at the time... seizing food supplies, burning houses, rounding up enemies & spys etc... this was standard and not something unique to nasty British. Its called foraging. No army leader with any brain is going to leave behind resources that could be used by the enemy. The British however were one of the first armies to place explicit limits on foraging and destruction. During the siege of Quebec city (1758) the British soldiers were explicitly told not to burn any church because despite the general anti-catholic nature of the English commoner, the British leaders recognized that all Churches were sacred and that destroying churches would unnecessarily hinder the process of conquest. So burning a church by itself would be inaccurate, burning it with people inside would be unheard of.<br/><br/>The movie also fails to depict atrocities committed by ""patriots"" against loyalists.<br/><br/>I think that the real disappointment is that the movie chose a cowardly approach of making the hero all good and the enemy all bad. We don't need to see the British colonel as an evil man. Hollywood never seems to understand the power of its own media. Executing a spy would have been within the rules of war (still are today), seizing property etc., but the movie goes out of its way to make him bad. He was justified in shooting the silly kid, but it would have made a better story, if he was shown to regret it (or if one of his men had shot the kid). A firm, but honorable enemy (just doing his job, fighting for his King, protecting his back) would have been a much better choice. A sympathetic portrayal of the enemy would actually be (1) closer to the truth, (2) make a more definite stand about values (what they're fighting for -- For Independence and self determination, not against British brutality), and (3) help reconcile old wounds by redefining the battle as one about a clash of values, not a clash of good vs. evil. Few wars (if any) are about good vs. evil.<br/><br/>Mel, how about making a film about the revolution that both American and British citizen can watch, enjoy and come away thinking, now that was a good movie. Instead Mel chose to vilify the British to sell tickets... ironically he did this at a time when the old enemies continue to form part of the strongest superpower alliance the world has ever seen."

","The Patriot is yet another war-epic by acclaimed acotr/director Mel Gibson. Set during Revolutionary War, Gibson portrays fictional militia leader Ben Martin driven to war by the loss of a son by British soldiers. Now, Martin will stop at nothing to defeat the invading British and save the young country.<br/><br/>The Patriot is not exactly original. It follows the same reasons for a man going to war as Braveheart did with Gibson in the lead. Gibson isn't bad, his character isn't exatly an easy one to play but he's played it before so it comes naturally. He is able to portray a lovable father and military man at the same time which is often hard to do.<br/><br/>Jason Isaac's plays the British colonel responsible for Martin's son's death. He is superb. he's cunning, he's full of hate, and is easy too hate. You are able to relate to the hatred felt by Martin very easily. He does by far the best job of the actors.<br/><br/>There are some problems to the film. The innacuarcies are numerous whether it concerns the battles represented or characters in general. What bothered me the most are characters not taking enough things serious. For example the militia destroy the vessel outside of Cornwallis' estate and Colonel Tavington just drinks up watching it even though the colonial militia is right outside their door. There at war for God's sake. <br/><br/>However even with the inaccuracies and the characters being a bit too one-dimensional it does give an excellent story to its audience. The battle scenes are visually stunning and suspenseful. The film shows us the 'honorable' way of fighting in lines of men facing each other and firing until either line retreats or is destroyed. It is quite interesting really to watch the old style of fighting and compare it too war of today. The film, in the end, portrays the message of taking war-fare to far and freedom. The drama is very good and villain is top-notch. Hopefully it's entertaining for you, it certainly was for me.<br/><br/>The Patriot.

Gibson showed the same resoluteness in his beliefs that Stewart did 25 years earlier. I only wish the Patriot could have had Katherine Ross's beauty, which added a lot to Shenandoah. But I will be very surprised if the two stories did not come from the same original novel, short story, or idea. Hasn't anyone else out there seen this similarity? Ward in Chicago."

","If one good thing came out of this production, it's that Mel Gibson met Caleb Deschanel, DP, and the two would go on to make THE PASSION OF THE Christ. But this one was strictly a paycheck effort. Columbia Pictures needed a tent-pole of the summer of 2000. Mel Gibson needed to pay off that Hamptons beach house, or put the finishing touches on his private chapel. 25 million dollars only goes so far these days.<br/><br/>With Emmerich, you pretty much know what to expect. Something along the lines of a low-rent Bruckheimer production, but with more cheese. Emmerich is going to put Leon Rippy in all of his movies. I thought it was funny how most of the British officers are either wig-wearing fags or stiff as cardboard martinets, with the exception of Isaacs. Those eyes burn with intensity! The man could easily become an international superstar.<br/><br/>In war, the terms ""good/evil"" do not have any application. In war, especially fighting a war where you live, you kill or get killed. But a lot of the action scenes here are awfully contrived. The plot has to go from A, to B, to C, so if you want reality, watch PBS. This movie is fairly entertaining, but it's a work of fiction. Any Englishman who professes to be offended by this movie, is giving the movie far too much credit. I give the movie points for Isaacs, and for the scene when Gibson weeps with unbearable sadness when Ledger dies before his eyes."
"ShawnDoe","4","2","3","4 July 2003"," Pure American Propaganda, DO NOT show on the history channel - but fun to watch...
","Well... let me start with the bad stuff because this is really important. This movie is pure American propaganda.  It is so over the top, so overly dramatic, so filled with chessey, cliche American SUPERIORITY to be almost humorous.  This is one heck of an American feel-good, American ego stroking movie - so much so that it is almost shameful.  But, the movie is set NOT in a fantasy world, but in a historical context.  And that is what worries me the worst.  I fear that many will watch this movie and take it for fact. Because this movie, like so many other movies, serves to portray Americans as noble, perfect, brave and GOOD (and everyone else as BAD) beyond belief. Bottom-line, I fear this movie promotes more American egotism, more ""we are better than everyone else"" when, frankly, it's not true.  And in this case, it paints a very one-sided, black-and-white view of an important event in American history.  <br/><br/>Not to say Americans are evil, just that they are like everyone else. Instead of American = good and English = evil, this movie should have portrayed English and Americans just both looking after their own interests, and shown individuals on both sides running the entire spectrum of good and evil.  Superiority is a dangerous attitude for ANYONE to adopt. <br/><br/>
But, as a movie, as an action flick, disregarding it's social impact or departure from history... what can I say, I enjoyed it.  The idea that one man can make a difference; the idea of fighting for the freedom of ones country against an overwhelming, ruthless, uncaring enemy; the idea of the underdog winning; the idea of everyone getting whats coming to them.  These are all ideals that I love to watch.  I just wish that we would search history for the right story to tell instead of REWRITING history to suit our story.  So, enjoy this movie for what it is...<br/><br/>*** FICTION!!! ***"

","Kudos to Mel Gibson, he had me hooked from the start with his realistic portrayal of American Revolutionaries. I know very little about the American War of Independence because the English School system does not place great emphasis upon it but I can see that he has perfectly captured those who valiantly fought against the English. Why, from the opening sequence I can see that this is a perfect portrayal. A pacifist man and his children (who can all read and write whilst working on the sizeable farm) along with his freed African-soontobeAmerican workers all go off to fight the demonic English with only four racists Americans in sight (all minor parts. I won't try to count the racist English). Gibson's character is perfect, a bit angry at times but perfectly well adjusted to modern society. No less than a miracle for a man supposed to have lived about two hundred years ago.<br/><br/>The portrayal of the Americans is wishful thinking and the portrayal of the English is point-blank racist. But that doesn't matter because they're English with their bad teeth and besides you can't be racist to white people. This villifying of the English in this film is typical not just of Mel Gibson's work, nor of that of American cinema in general but of the entire American culture.

Well, Tom Wilkinson would probably prefer to be called a co-star, but anyway he definitely give his character the right amount of political intrigue and ambition as the English general, while still finding room for some humour and other sensitive qualities - so his character's not totally two-dimensional. And Peter Woodward as his aide-de-camp I thought was a very fascinating character, holding together the scenes he figures in with real panache (the best being his entrance with the captured ""officer""). And finally I would like to point out Trevor Morgan who plays the third son Nathan, as really making his character both humorously and dramatically successful.<br/><br/>I think I could count on the fingers of one hand the times when a film has actually brought a tear to my eye; and this film is one of them.

But both the scenes where the son gets shot, and the one where the girl finally decides to speak to her father managed to finally choke me up.

Hopefully he will find projects far more worthy of his talent.<br/><br/>What most US based critics appear to have overlooked is that the movie is equally insulting to the American Revolutionaries - a generation of Americans will now grow up believing that the Revolution was won only because the British made the fatal mistake of annoying Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>I would like to think that Jason Isaacs is sending the whole thing up with his 'Stupid boy!' line (anyone with a passing knowledge of British sitcoms will understand my reference).<br/><br/>One day someone will make a decent film about the Revolution.

","If you come to see a movie full of patriotism and heroism, the Patriot will definitely entertain you.  But don't go away thinking that it has anything to do with the American Revolution.  Benjamin Martin, a YOUNG man during the American Revolution, was an actual person and we know about him because of a diary he kept during the war.  Apparently from the plot line, the NAME is the only thing that the production takes from Mr. Martin.  The movie takes a very elementary, perhaps juvenile, look at the American Revolution.  It also attempts to make the British soldiers out to be animals and barbarians, when in fact, the British were very civil towards American civilians during the war.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's a very entertaining movie, and does a VERY good job of suspending reality, just don't go home thinking that the American Revolution was anything like the movie."

","Okay, let's get the criticism out of the way.  This film was about as historically accurate as Braveheart.  That is to say, there WAS an American Revolution, and it was fought against the British.  The film is formulaic - it's the retired gunfighter being forced out of retirement by dire personal tragedy, forced to commit heinous crimes in the name of justice story. John Wayne did it, why not Mel Gibson?  Also, except for minor plot points, this was an off the shelf script, about as predictable as the orbits of the planets.  Those are the bad points.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie.  I liked it, and as an example of cinemagraphic excellence, it shines.  Seamless CGI effects make the viewer feel as if they were really on an 18th century battlefield.  Mel is a capable and personable enough actor to carry off this grand a story with relative ease.  Oh, and do they make one HATE the British!  Mel must have a personal grievance against the English.  The Bounty (where you again can see Mel in a ponytail) was not complimentary to Her Majesty's navy, Braveheart showed us the evil Longshanks, and now The Patriot's Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs) makes William Carey seem like Mother Teresa!  All in all, an enjoyable film, as long as one doesn't intend to accept it as historical fact."

","THE Patriot? This movie is full of patriots! And I hate this unbelievable idealistic stuff! The whole thing is even more absurd because they had the film directed by a German, Roland Emmerich.<br/><br/>But as I'm neither American nor British nor a patriot I shouldn't go too deep into this aspect. And so I have to admit that it's a three hour movie during which I hardly ever looked at my watch. The fighting scenes were exciting and authentic, Mel Gibson acted the same as in all his previous films, the screenwriter put in some lovely humorous scenes, and the story - surprise, surprise! - was not always predictable: It was more ""cruel"" for the viewer than the story in other mainstream movies. Entertainment factor: 9/10<br/><br/>Did you notice that with landscapes the camera always started with the same move? First filming at a rather low level and then moving up. That shows that director Emmerich lacks ideas also in his newest movie. (It wasn't much better with ""Independence Day"".) Quality factor: 2/10<br/><br/>Together that makes a rating of 6 out of 10."
"silvourbolt","7","2","3","2 September 2000"," Almost BRAVEHEART, but a few small flaws.
","THE PATRIOT is an excellent movie. It is an excellent example of how to do an epic action film, but it tries to be a sweeping action, romance, family, and to a lesser degree comedy epic. However, the PATRIOT doesn't quite deliver the romance portion very well, and truth be told, the portion of the film focusing on the family could have been better. But what do you expect from Roland Emmerich, whose best attempt at a story about a family was INDEPENDENCE DAY? Nevertheless, Emmerich did a good job on that aspect of the film, it just could have been better. This is by far Emmerich's best film, and a quite surprising turn-around after the God-awful GODZILLA.<br/><br/>Also, THE PATRIOT, in my opinion, did not take advantage of the American Revolution to it's fullest. In the final segments of the film, we see a quickie detail of the end of the war, but this film makes the Revolutionary War seem as if it was completely centered around stopping the band of men led by Gibson's character, which is, in my opinion, a mistake in story direction. The patriotism could have been pumped up, and that would have done for THE PATRIOT what Wallace did for Scotland: given the audience a surreal sense of honor and pride to be an American. I saw this movie on the Fourth of July, and at no other time of year could this movie have made me feel more patriotic, yet it still didn't completely deliver. Another slight annoyance is with the name Gibson takes on: ""The Ghost"" which is to say the least, not a very original idea nor a very original name to give the character. As well, the final confrontation, while excellently shot and gripping, it a bit contrived and unoriginal, a fault that BRAVEHEART did not have to carry by any degree. My last gripe is with the female love interest that Gibson takes on. She is not very well established, and personally, seems a bit wrong for Gibson's character. The floundering relationship acts like a sharp kick to the gut, taking a potentially flawless movie like BRAVEHEART and making it a mere great movie. Still, the movie is excellent, and to be quite honest, the scene where Martin (Gibson) rescues his eldest son is the most intense and vivid scene I have ever watched in my entire movie-going experience. That counts for something, and so does this fine example of an epic film. *************************************************"

","Let me first say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It wasn't, in my opinion, Braveheart, but it was very entertaining. In reading some of the reviews of this movie, many people have found fault with the fact that it was historically inaccurate. I don't believe this movie was intended to be a documentary. Like so many fact based movies that preceded it, it was intended to be, plainly and simply, a MOVIE. If you want history, go to the library or the History Channel. I find it amusing that a great majority of novels, when they are made into movies, are changed so much [characters and plots changed, added or deleted] without, for the most part, people getting upset about the changes. Yet when a movie is based on actual incidents and/or characters, people tend to get upset that they may not be totally, historically accurate. I would like to think that I am not the only person who watches a movie to be entertained and not to get an education. So go see this movie and enjoy it for what it is, an historically inaccurate piece of fine entertainment."

","...mawkish.  And embarrassing.  It wasn't the historical inaccuracies (_Elizabeth_ was historically inaccurate but ever so much more elegant and compelling); it was the Hollywood sentimentality of this movie and its predictably violent outcome that got to me.  I mean really.  Goring Tavington's horse with the tip of the American flag.  You knew that was coming ten miles away. And that utterly gratuitous bloodbath at the end.  The whole movie led up to it: Americans killing redcoats with berserker abandon.  This was the focus and impetus of the movie, it seemed to me, never mind all that talk about family values.  However, it makes me laugh that Britain thinks the filmmakers owe their country an apology. This was a movie, my friends.  The Revolution happened, but that was long ago.  This is fiction, fiction geared at not very subtle thinkers, and when that's its targetted audience, it's not a very subtle movie.  Forget it.  Give me Peter O'Toole in _Becket_.  Or better yet, _Shakespeare in Love_.  Next year Hollywood will aim at the Japanese in _Pearl Harbor_.  We'll see how that film compares to _The Patriot_."

","8/10.  Not as good as ""Braveheart.""  A lot of the battle scenes and backdrops were obviously computer generated/computer enhanced.  Contrast this with ""Last of the Mohicans"" where the battle scenes were much more realistic.  Also - I was not that impressed with Mel's performance in this movie.  It was inferior to that of Daniel Day-Lewis from ""Last of the Mohicans.""  It was hard to buy into the conflicted image portrayed by Mel - something just did not work for me.  Also - the villain in this film was pretty bland and was hard to hate(he was just a bore).  Contrast that to the villains in ""Braveheart"", ""Last of the Mohicans"", ""Rob Roy"" where you could really get into disliking the bad guy.<br/><br/>Like the Brits who object I also find myself doubting the whole plot line with the eeeevil Dragoon.  More like a vision of WWII and later than a vision from 200 years ago when chivalry was still in fashion.<br/><br/>It was still an entertaining film and worth seeing.  But in my opinion there was a lot wrong with it.  Perhaps too much time and effort in the special effects and not enough effort on characterization development and story line."

","This is a VERY good film. Mel is perfectly cast as the troubled father trying to come to grips with his wife's passing, and with some terrible ghosts of his own. All the while trying to hold on to the most important thing in his life. His family. I went to see this fully expecting to see another jingoistic, sabrerattlin',AMERICAN movie. Thankfully, I was surprised. Mel and Heath sucked you into their lives and hung on.  The cliche's were there(cruel British commanders, traitors, cowards,etc)but they never pulled you too far off course. The battle scenes were terrifying and the supporting characters, though not, in some cases , well developed, they still worked for the film in a whole. I did however find the the final confrontation with the ""evil"" British colonel a little over done. There battle seemed better suited for a Lethal Weapon movie than a Revolutionary War epic. It seemed a little contrived and tacked on. So we can have one more cheer for the hero and satisfy our own need to see vengeance. Only a small negative note. I hope that the American goverment will give Roland Emmerich a citizenship now. After ID4 and now The Patriot, I think he deserves one."

I gave it a solid 7 and I would probably have to see it a second time to pick up details I missed the first time, and probably like the movie even more.  Gibson is such a good actor, his accent helps in this film to give it realism.  Gibson is the type of actor whos physical gestures can really make a seen. It has great villains, family, revenge, and historical perspective that makes the movie believable.  The comeback of the historical epic is a nice change from your by the numbers, humdrum, action flicks.  This film will shock you, inspire you, and make you laugh.

"jhaggardjr","9","2","3","9 July 2000"," Beautifully made war epic
","""The Patriot"" is a sweeping war epic that takes place during the Revolutionary War in 1776. Beautifully directed by Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"") and well written by Robert Rodat (""Saving Private Ryan""), ""The Patriot"" stars Mel Gibson in one of his best film roles as Benjamin Martin, a widowed farmer who's taking care of his seven children. Martin had fought in an earlier war, and doesn't want anything to do with the Revolutionary War. That is until a terrible incident happens to his family, and he is forced to fight against the British. Gibson gives a powerful performance here, and he should get an Oscar nomination. Also giving a good performance in ""The Patriot"" is Australian newcomer Heath Ledger (who starred in last year's ""10 Things I Hate About You"") as Gibson's oldest son Gabriel, who joins his father in action. The other roles in the film are good, but the performances by Gibson and Ledger are the ones people will be talking about. The film also works on a technical level. The action scenes are brutal as you would expect from a war film, but very well done. The beautiful look of the film is also a plus. And there are some comic moments thrown in for good measure. I only had one minor complaint with ""The Patriot"" and that it's overlong. The movie runs 2 hours and 40 minutes, and it drags a little here and there. If it had been 20 or 30 minutes shorter, it would have been better. But other than that, ""The Patriot"" is for the most part a terrific war film, and far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far better than Al Pacino's 1985 disaster ""Revolution"" which was also about the Revolutionary War. <br/><br/>***1/2 (out of four)"
"Paddy Graham","3","2","3","15 June 2000"," Any cinematic merit spoilt by lies.
","The Patriot is an exciting film with dramatic action sequences and another good performance from Mel Gibson. However, coming from England, I found it impossible to enjoy the film and found it intensely irritating. The reason for this is not just a small minded love for my country but because of the black and white portrayal of the historical events depicted in the movie. Apparently the English soldiers were the bad guys and the Americans were the good guys. Well, true it is modern popular belief to instantly be on the side of the rebels against the oppressors. Fair enough. But in real life, and this is REAL life not Hollywood's depiction of it, the character played by Mel Gibson was himself guilty of many atrocities - including the raping of a servent girl and his passion for gambling. On the other hand the ""Horrible"" British officer in the Patriot who kills poor old Mel's family was and still is, an English war hero who was known as a man of honour. I find that it is a shame when such a potentially good film with great actors, and a great writer - spoils itself by resorting to the fabrication of history which in my opinion is a greater crime than those portrayed in the film. Overall I would have to say I was disappointed."

Tom Wikinson, Adam Baldwin and Chris Cooper round out the powerful cast. There is truly outstanding cinematography by Caleb Deschsnel which is accompanied by the excellent soundtrack by John Williams. However, it tends to be more dramatic & romantic, as opposed to realistic. Personally, I prefer the outstanding film ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) led by Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe Russell Means, Eric Schweig, & Jodhi May.

","This film came out around the same time as star Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" and I remember people thinking he'd directed this film as well, particularly because of savage battle scenes. However, ""The Patriot"" was directed by Roland Emmerich, the reliable producer/writer/director of many enjoyable but empty headed summer popcorn films, including ""Independence Day,"" ""White House Down,"" and ""Stargate."" While most of his films are unchallenging crowd pleasers, ""The Patriot"" stands apart in his filmography as quality piece of filmmaking. The film was written by Robert Rodat, who also wrote ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and he brings the same mix of realism and and emotion to the American Revolutionary War that he brought to WWII. Mel Gibson plays a farmer and retired war hero who wants nothing more than to left alone with his family and to run his farm. However, Gibson is pushed to his limits by Jason Isaacs, best known as the sneering Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, who play as a sneering British Colonel. Gibson's fictional Benjamin Martin is an amalgam of several Revolutionary War heroes, but primarily seems to be based upon Francis Marion, The Swamp Fox, who was a pivotal figure during the war, leading a group of irregular soldiers in a guerrilla war against the British in South Carolina, even after the Continental Army had been driven out the state. After Gibson's son, Heath Ledger, is captured by Issacs, Gibson leads his own ragtag band of soldiers against the redcoats using what was at the time was very unusual guerrilla tactics. The small and large scale action sequences in ""The Patriot"" are the real highlight of the film. They are exciting, brutally realistic, and most importantly, are emotionally poignant. There is an early scene in the film when Gibson ambushes a British detail to free his captured son, Ledger, where he uses his very young sons as his soldiers, and the filmmakers don't shy away from the young children's shock at their father telling them how to kill men, as well as taking time to show the aftermath and their reaction to their father's brutality. Besides being and exciting and unflinching in it's graphic and realistic presentation of war, it's the emotional component that elevates ""The Patriot"" from simply being a technically effective crafted battle sequence. However, although the film does a fine job of presenting a realistic depiction of war for this time period and also does an excellent job of period detail in terms of costumes, architecture, and set decor, the film grossly fails in it's whitewashing of history in an attempt to present a politically correct hero who's more palatable to audiences.. As I said before, ""The Patriot"" is a work of fiction, but having Gibson's Martin ""paying"" his black farmworkers instead of owning slaves seems wildly disingenuous (Francis Marion owned slaves). Additionally, the real-life Francis Marion committed many war atrocities, even by the standards of his time, which are completely absent in this film, although there are hints of something in Gibson's past during the French and Indian War. If ""The Patriot"" had been as honest in it's depiction of history in these respects as it had been in it's depiction of warfare, this film may have been a true classic. Despite this major lapse, ""The Patriot"" remains a strong piece of filmmaking, with an emotional center that focuses around family, which gives the film a resonance that is lacking from many war films. Well worth watching despite it's flaws."
"filipemanuelneto","6","1","1","15 February 2017"," What do the British think of this movie?
","Roland Emmerich saw Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" and what did he do? He thought the US should have its own Braveheart and called Gibson to help, giving him the lead role. This film begins badly: as I had occasion to refer to when I reviewed ""Braveheart"", Gibson's film is terribly bad as far as historical accuracy is concerned, however appealing and cinematic it may be (and it is, its undoubtedly epic). This film is unfortunately not better, at least historically and with regard to the English, who are portrayed in an almost insulting way. Okay, there are atrocities in war but everything has limits, and the British still had, at this time, a mentality very much for the gentlemen's war, at least the officers. I accept the argument that its fiction and not a documentary, but even if it is, it should respect more its historical background. I believe that many Englishmen did not accept the way this film portrayed their army. Despite this, the film has some historically correct details, as is the case with all the well built and elegant colonial settings and the costumes, in particular the military uniforms. The way the soldiers fought, quite formal in its essence, is also historically accurate. As a piece of entertainment, the movie works well. The epic way it was designed is nice, looks great in movies and even on TV. It has an extraordinary soundtrack by John Williams and cinematography, colorful and vivid, looks great. I also give a word of praise to the actors, Mel Gibson particularly. This actor had an interpretive tone very similar to what he kept in ""Braveheart"" but without that horrible fake Scottish accent. Here, Gibson seems more at ease with his character, a man seeking personal revenge in the midst of all the conflict he engages in. Heath Ledger, still young, also gives serious evidence of talent. Joely Richardson and Tom Wilkinson met what was expected of them, even though their characters did not require much. Jason Isaacs gave life to the villain and, although his character is not credible at all, he can be very sadistic and scary, showing the cruelest side of the war."

Well that's easy, 1995's Best Picture Oscar Winner ""Braveheart"". Aha, that is where you are wrong, well technically you are right because you answered the question with a correct answer but...I was referring to the new Roland Emmerich directed Revolutionary War epic ""The Patriot"". A duh.<br/><br/>It's an inevitable comparison. It would have been even if Gibson wasn't in it but when he signed up to portray Benjamin Martin, a widowed father of 7 children with a haunting past from The French-Indian War, he asked America to jokingly refer to his new film as ""Braveheart 2"" or maybe ""William Wallace vs. The British yet again..."" or wait, wait, wait maybe even ""Lt. Riggs vs. the...na"". Anyway on with the movie review.<br/><br/>It's the beginning of the summer and what do you say to yourself. ""I need action and a huge budget"". Well ""The Patriot"" easily boasts that with Gibson racking in $25 million and director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, Godzilla). An impressive screenwriter in Robert Rodat, known of course for his Oscar nominated screenplay for ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>I understand that this sounds like I am bashing the crap out Mel's new vehicle but I have to say it was some impressive eye candy and the script wasn't weak. The acting was on top of its' game and the drama was as thick as...well let's just say it was there slapping you in the face. But I was enjoying the whole thing all gul-darn near 3 hours of it. The action scenes were very intense and bloody, oh we all love the blood and guts, and the plot was all about REVENGE! WOOOO! I mean it's about a dad who is seeking revenge for a loved one's death. Never heard that before. It's clichéd like a mofo but it's good ol' American fun. I mean we never lose, just look at ""Rocky 4"" and our Olympic basketball team.<br/><br/>All in all, a clichéd war epic that pleases the crap out of the audience and reminds us how fun the pictures can be.<br/><br/>7/10"
"anana11","6","1","1","2 July 2000"," Predictability and hokeyness triumph over good acting
","Good acting, strong characters, and an attention to historic detail (details, not events or characters) could not completely make up for a predictable plot and general hokeyness.<br/><br/>Gibson was excellent as the tortured main character, as was Ledger and in fact every one of his children.  The little girl who played the youngest even managed to make me feel like crying in one of the most manipulative scenes in the movie.  The attention to detail, particularly the courtship rituals and war scenes (cannonballs, ""surgery"", etc.), was excellent.  That, of course is offset by the trampling of any historical fact that might have marred the blah plot, but more on that later. The humor was good too, especially one particular sight gag that did not lose laughability even though they showed it about four times.<br/><br/>The patriotism angle was extremely mishandled, making me laugh at their trite phrases when I was supposed to be moved by their ardor.  The real patriotism of that time would have been much more moving.  But, this is Hollywood and this is a Summer Blockbuster. The uninspired plot and predictability were the last straws.  By the end of the movie, I was successfully predicting every movement -- the last soldier/bullet, etc.  It really took me away from any engagement in the storyline. I hope all those actors go on to better projects.  They all deserve it."
"Mike-263","7","1","1","7 April 2001"," ...well...the battle scenes were great!!!
","Yes, aside from some of the greatest battle scenes (read: REALISTIC) since ""Saving Private Ryan"" - this film is just too over-sentimental and down-right manipulative (tear-jerker to the max...) There is also way too much religion forced on the audience... something a lot of people (myself included) find offensive.  Although I really wanted to like this film - in the end the word ""HOKEY"" comes to mind. The deleted scenes added to the DVD are a definite plus..."
"Tin Man-5","Null","1","1","17 January 2001"," Seems like two movies stuck together
","I shall be brief with ""The Patriot,"" a cross between ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Braveheart"" in the Revolutionary War. It seems like two different movies stuck together: One is a serious, if typical Hollywood war film about a fictitious character parading around trying to make the country free. Though it is fictitional, it works thanks to great battle scenes and an excellent Mel Gibson. While it is impossible and foolish to view it as a serious movie about the horrors of war, it works as a by-the-numbers adventure story, and I found it enjoyable viewing( though it is loaded with cliched material, i.e.: there's always the tolkien black man fighting for his freedom, ever since ""Glory,"" a much better war movie, made it famous, though ""The Patriot""  hardly takes such an important subject as seriously as it should be taken).<br/><br/>The other part is not so gratifying. Some scenes seem downright cartoonish, and not appropriate for a film that is intended to be taken as seriously as this one claims to be. The scene where Mel Gibson, in an effort to recruit men for his malitia, explains, ""God save King George,"" only to and knives thrown at him is enjoyable enough, but it plays too much like a Bugs Bunny/Elmer Fudd cartoon to be shown here. There are also a few scenes which play like a bad TV-movie, especially those which take place in the church where Heath Ledger's character goes recruiting for soldiers in a church. Those scenes were predictable and corny. That plus the fact that Ledger's girlfriend was a horrible actress, on the level of a guest star in a bad ""Christie"" episode.<br/><br/>So here's what we have: An excellently-produced and well-acted drama using the Revolutionary War as a backdrop fused with often cliched subplots and scenes which are too goofy and not serious enough. Hence, it's hard to tell what this film is trying to be: Campy or emotionally charged. For this reason, it lumbers when it should soar, and it is disappointing where it should be outstanding.<br/><br/>**1/2 out of ****"

","this was a Hollywood movie about the revolutionary war, made quite possibly only because there hasn't been one made that's on the tip of anyone's tongue. I watched it.  it lasted about 3 hours or something and those hours didn't drudge on or anything.  i was entertained by the slightly gratuitous violence and definitely entertained by the tactically retarded ""ye olde"" battle style, but there was an element of creativity lacking that lagged this movie.  It was the archetypical hero versus villian story with all the class structures in their typical respective places;  the good johnny rebel american peasants versus the insanely evil upper-class British b*****ds (and of course one really really really mean Brit in particular.) It just seemed very tired and failed to really make an impression on me.  If i were asked to recall a scene from 'The Patriot,' which i saw maybe 2 weeks ago- i could explicitly visualise heads getting blown off and legs cannonballed away, but there was really very little in the plotline that caught me off guard enough to fully focus my attention span.<br/><br/>the patriot is not a bad movie, but given the choice between watching this movie and 'that other mel gibson' epic war rebellion tale for the 15th time, old Bill Wallace won't let you down."

","Move over gladiator, The Patriot is the best action movie for 2000.  And being movie based on the War of Independence makes it all the more stirring for Americans.  I have read that it is not historically accurate except in the broadest sense (We won the British went home).  But that is okay. Private Ryan was fictional as well, no one complained about that.<br/><br/>Also the critics say that the person Mel Gibson's character was based on was a cruel savage beast of a man.  Well Mel Gibson's character is very savage, although he has been PC'ed a bit to make it more appealing.<br/><br/>Those minor points aside this is an awesome movie.  The battle scenes are frighteningly real.  Brutal and graphic.  And the acting in those scenes was amazing.  The sense of fear at standing on the front line was incredibly palpable, as well as the resolution to stand ground.<br/><br/>If you only see one movie, and aren't afraid of graphic battle scenes, you must see this movie."

","I thought this was a very good movie.  Good story, plenty of action and surprises.<br/><br/>I wonder if anyone noticed the similarities to an older movie, Shenandoah (1965), with James Stewart?  The basic story of Shenandoah is a southern farmer with large family, dead wife (with lasting influence), who doesn't want to get involved in the (Civil) war.  Only after he (Stewart) is forced to rescue his son does he get involved in the war (albeit not to the same level of engagement as Gibson in Patriot).  There are many other subtle similarities."
"Matt-Buc","Null","1","1","14 July 2000"," Technically-impressive war film, but it's all been seen before.
","The Patriot is a Revolutionary War action film from the team of director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin, known for lame sci-fi schlock like Godzilla and Independence Day. With Patriot, this pair has once again fallen short of their aspirations. Although it has substantial technical quality, this cannot mask that that movie is a stale rehash of scenes and ideas we have seen too many times.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin, a Colonial farmer with a dark past he earned for his actions during the French and Indian War.  He also has over a half dozen children, and because of this, when the battle for independence between the American Colonies and the British Empire spills into his backyard, he chooses not to fight. However, his oldest son Gabriel, played by relative newcomer Heath Ledger, is eager to join the rebel army, and thus drags his father into the conflict.<br/><br/>Gibson and Ledger are both good in their headlining roles, and bring much-needed credibility to the cast. The other stand-out here is as Martin's second oldest son, proof that good child actors do, in fact, still exist. But the rest of the actors can not stand up to both the intimidating presence of Gibson, nor  the limpness of the unoriginal and overlong script. Chris Cooper looks simply bored as a Colonel and old friend of Martin's, and Tom Wilkinson plays General Cornwallis as a prissy fop. That's pretty much how all the English in Patriot are depicted: as either simpering fools like Cornwallis or his Lieutenants, or blood-thirsty savages like the head villain, the devilish and psychotic Colonel Tavington.<br/><br/>Tavington enters the picture in the first half-hour, committing an act that thrusts Ben Martin into the struggle between America and England. Up until this point, The Patriot has been fairly subtle and ponderous, but all the while exciting. When Tavington arrives on the scene, the film deteriorates into a cheap and lazy action movie with all the predictable turns, albeit some great cinematography.<br/><br/>That great cinematography, along with the performances of Gibson and Ledger, are all that help the movie hover above its boring, pedestrian script. We've seen these scenes time and time again, and they seem to get worse every time. Gibson recruits a team of rag-tag guerrilla soldiers to help him in his fight. There's a Frenchman played by Tchéky Karyo, and that description is the soul and essence of the character. He's French. He has funny French clothes, and a funny French accent. There's also a preacher who shocks his town in a supposedly comedic scene by taking up arms with his fellow Americans. Along with these two is an assortment of two-fisted scoundrels and pirates. They're each given a couple of clunky one-liners to help solidify them in our minds before they're killed by the evil British. It doesn't work.<br/><br/>The worst of these characters is a slave who fights with the Colonials in order to win his freedom, following a new statement decreed by General Washington. The other soldiers despise him, but once he saves their lives, they become honored to have him on their side. This is just one example of the fake, mock sentimentality pressed onto the audience throughout the movie. On the subject of slavery and these politically correct emotions, the Africans we see working in the fields of Martin's home are discovered to not be slaves at all, but are instead free black men who work the land for Gibson, and are paid. How Emmerich or screenwriter Robert Rodat did not recognize the stupidity of making such statements about their character, in the time period of the film, is incredible.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast fares even worse. Jason Isaacs gives an admirable attempt as the wicked Tavington, but like almost everyone else in Patriot, he cannot rise above the cartoonish nature of his character. He kills children. He says evil, despicable things. He burns an entire quaint little town to ashes by locking them inside their church and having his men set the structure ablaze. Maybe all this would have some weight if the viewer didn't realize from the first minute the two laid eyes on each other that The Patriot would conclude with the trusty fist fight between the heroic Gibson and the serpentine Isaacs, complete with slow-motion dramatics and characters who choose to give speeches while they have more than enough time to dispatch their foe.<br/><br/>Also weak is Joely Richardson as Charlotte, the sister of Gibson's deceased wife. It's not really her fault; her role as Martin's love interest is shallow and strangely cryptic, considering the character she's playing. An even worse female role is Anne Howard, played by Lisa Brenner, the requisite cute love interest for Ledger. She's annoying and grating, and although her ultimate fate of pitiful, its hard to imagine how the movie would have been bearable if she had a larger role.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are nice, but after the first time we see one, nothing changes. We are then treated to the same-styled carnage several times, and each one gets even more haphazard and unexciting. The final conflict of the film makes an attempt at a Braveheart-like spectacle, but cannot rouse much substance to go along with its epic camera sweeps. To its credit, the rest of the movie makes no effort to even try and rip-off much of anything from the similarly-themed Gibson classic.<br/><br/>In the end, The Patriot is a well-made film, but we've seen everything it has to offer numerous times, and many of those experiences have been far superior.<br/><br/>Patriot receives a 7 out of 10."
"A-Ron-2","7","1","1","11 July 2000"," A Rousing and Exciting, if perhaps a bit shallow, film
","First, I would like to point out that I liked this film.  I liked it despite its many failings (and there are many).  I enjoyed myself, I felt compelled by the action and moved by the emotion (despite the inherent smarminess of some of the 'emotion jerking' scenes).  I would recommend the film to anyone looking for a reasonably good summer action film.<br/><br/>However, I was a bit disappointed by the fact that this movie did not rise above the normal summertime conventions.  I was hoping for a Saving Private Ryan or a Braveheart, but instead got Lethal Musket 4.  Even the scenes that were intended to bring out the 'character' of Benjamin Martin did little but use exploitive camera shots and overly emotional music rather than relying on story and acting (not to dismiss Gibson's acting, which was quite good and convincing).  I lay much of the blame on Emmerich, who I feel could have done a much better job with the material he had to work with.<br/><br/>The one scene in the film that I was particularly moved by was at the beginning, when Martin sets off with his two youngest sons to rescue his oldest son from the British.  I felt that this scene communicated well the pain and distress of a veteran who had been forced into a violent confrontation that he did not want (my own father was a Vietnam vet, and the scene did resonate a few chords with me).  This was an intelligent, disturbing and moving scene.<br/><br/>However, the rest of the film had a difficult time deciding what it wanted to do, and how it wanted to do it.  The battle scenes were somewhat exciting, but far too clean (especially considering the technology of that period), this was not a war film.  The romance was underdeveloped and confusing, this was not a romance.  The history was highly inaccurate and overly dramatic (which I do not have a problem with, per se), so this was not an historical re-enactment.  So what was this film?<br/><br/>Essentially, it was a bunch of action scenes and politically correct niceties tied together into a fun summer film package.  The movie seemed to have wanted to be taken seriously, but never became serious.  This is unfortunate, but not tragic.  The Patriot is a film worth seeing (particularly on the big screen), but don't go expecting SPR or Braveheart, you will be disappointed.  I did not go expecting that level of film, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Enjoy."
"DaveHill","7","1","1","5 July 2000"," Deep thoughts amidst the cartoony glory
","Three things stand out about The Patriot.<br/><br/>First, the production is gorgeous.  Both the beauty and the bloodiness of 18th Century life is captured with loving detail.<br/><br/>Second, the production (effectively) uses every cliche and hoary stereotype they can to play up the melodrama.  Good guys are brave and noble, occasionally rash when driven to extremes, but of good heart and true. Bad guys are egomaniacal brutes, doing everything but twirling their moustachios.<br/><br/>Third, countering the above, Gibson's character does a fine job of at least exploring the very real, very troubling questions of duty and violence. To whom does one have a duty -- self, family, neighbors, country, God?  How far does one go in pursuing that duty, to what depths of violence does one sink? What is just, what is honorable, what is socially acceptable, and what is moral?  How do you live with yourself after making such decisions, and seeing the cost they bring both to yourself and to others, either through your actions or your inaction?<br/><br/>Though ultimately it all dissolves into a bright-hued melange of patriotic fervor and Happy Endings, at least these questions are touched on and mentioned before being discarded.  The lessons of the film touch directly on our lives and on world events -- one gains a new understanding of recent violence and warfare in the Balkans, for example, after watching The Patriot."
"cbuhl79","8","1","1","28 June 2000"," It's no Braveheart . . .
","It's no Gladiatior either, although all three movies share a suspicious amount of plot points . . . peace loving father, loses loved ones, seeks revenge, lots of close combat fighting . . . It's also a little too complicated at times, some of the dialogue is way too cheesy, and a few of the lulls in the action are a bit too long (especially the last one).<br/><br/>But you know what? It may not be as good as Braveheart or Gladiator, but Braveheart is one of the best movies - if not the best - of the '90s, and Gladiator is one of the best movies of the last few years, so not being quite as good as those is hardly a major strike.<br/><br/>Despite the lulls in the action, and despite just a few too many minor plot lines, The Patriot has some marvellous battle scenes, memorable characters, and at least one plot twist that surprised me. Finally, the intense patriotism and quite literal flag waving was done tastefully and honorably, although I doubt that the British would see it that way. Don't expect this one to score big overseas, but I think it's a great film for the Fourth in this country."

It is a powerful and accurate portrayal of British doctrine in the colonies.  They really did that stuff all the time.  I guess they learnt it off of William Wallace...<br/><br/>Of course this film does make you think.  All that blood, all that sacrifice and all in the name of liberty. Liberty to keep slaves.  Liberty to oppress anyone from the Chinese to the Irish.  Liberty to wipe out the heathen Indians who squat on white mans land.  Liberty to drop two atom bombs when one was probably enough. Liberty to not be Communist or suspected to be Communist (McCarthy should be an honourary Englishman).  Liberty to plan a contained nuclear war in far away Europe.  Liberty to fight for freedom in the world anywhere, anytime until a soldier sprains his ankle or something then have the Liberty get the hell out.  Liberty to bomb the Chinese Embassy.<br/><br/>But seriously, go see this film.  I haven't laughed so much in ages.<br/><br/>(OK so these remarks are spiteful, but spiteful is what this film is)"
"dogbert-6","5","1","1","3 July 2000"," Braveheart goes colonial
","The comparison to ""Braveheart"" is unavoidable, so why resist. ""The Patriot"" has much the same ingredients; a family man reluctantly drawn to fight the yoke of English oppression, inspires his neighbors to turn the tide in what seemed a hopeless cause. The sadistic foe is confronted on the open battlefield, but this time with the more modern weapon technology of the 18th century. The English have overwhelming force, but the rebels have Mel. He manages to outwit them and this time he even wins, and he does it without mooning. When will those English learn not mess with this Aussie?<br/><br/>I should have enjoyed this movie more. It had the right amount of gentle comic relief. I still laugh thinking about the rocking chair and the black ink. There was all sorts of love, the kind between a young man and woman, between a father and son, between a husband and the memory of his dead wife, and between an English lord and his dogs. There was the wonderful recreation of the setting and dress of colonial times. With the aid of the computer, the effect was better than Williamsburg. There was the shocking horrors of war, complete with the perfect villain.<br/><br/>But the plot did not match the standard set by the rest of the movie. The actions were illogical, inconsistent and impossible. Such a weak script might be forgiven for the typical summer movie. But in a movie which showed so much promise, it left this viewer disappointed. It's like crafting a beautiful rocking chair, only to have it break when you sit on it."
"Winslow757","Null","1","1","3 July 2000"," a decent shot at an epic movie
","The Patriot is by no means one of the greatest movies ever made.  Anyone who says so needs to take a look at the AFI list and see some of them.  But it is an enjoyable film, and it is a good shot at an epic story.<br/><br/>The film does a fairly good job of balancing the conflict between telling a story about a man and his family and telling the larger story of the revolutionary war.  I do not make any claims towards the historical accuracy of the film--as far as I am concerned that is a non-issue--but I do think that as a film working within the confines of a historical-epic-drama genre, it does a good job of handling the Hollywood structure, as formulaic as that may sometimes seem.<br/><br/>I would definitely hesitate to say that this film is Braveheart in the Revolution. Except for falling into the same genre, fighting the same opposing nation, and starring the same lead actor, as movies they are quite different.  Braveheart focuses on the passion of William Wallace and his ability to lead a nation to freedom against all odds.  It's like Moses in the bible--he leads the people to freedom but can't live in the rewards of it.  The Patriot is much more about the personal story of one man and his family in the larger context of America at war for freedom.  Benjamin Martin is haunted by the ghosts of his violent past, and must come to terms with them if he is to live in the present.  It is about the struggle and determination of Americans to gain freedom, but it is also about coming of age and maturity, the changing relationships of father and son, etc.<br/><br/>One of the things that I liked about this movie, was that even though the antagonist Col. Tavington was genuinely evil, his superior, Gen. Cornwallis, was not depicted as one of the evil redcoats, but rather as a somewhat anachronistic gentleman unable to adapt to the changing rules of war.<br/><br/>On the whole, a decent summer movie.  Not spectacular.  But fun to watch."

","Movies like this sadden me.  It is just more Hollywood hype and little historical fact.  I don't understand why Hollywood can't make movies more factual yet entertaining.  It is one of those really predictable films where in several scenes the people around me in the theater were actually guessing aloud what would happen next.  It included the usual fighting scenes that are far less than reality could ever maintain.  It was sad to see that among the thousands of soldiers and militia the protagonist and antagonist were able to cross paths man-to-man on several occasions.  Meeting more than twice would be practically impossible at best in reality, let alone finding each other on a crowded battlefield aflame with gunfire, cannon balls, drums, and screams.  What even saddens me more is to know that they actually could have put together a wonderful story of our history, one that is unlike any other in the world.<br/><br/>I will say that the cinematography was quite beautiful and many of the scenes and sets were awesome.  Other than that, I feel like it would be a waste of my time to even comment on the workings of the story, other than to say it was a complete Hollywood-induced farce.  My only hope is that people will go to true sources on the Internet or at their library to find out the facts from a time that was so important in our history.

"Rerun-2","Null","1","1","3 July 2000"," Revised American history doesn't quite sink movie
","Here is the ultra-simplified American history for the MTV generation. ""The Patriot"" is a movie that essentially takes the entire American Revolution with all its complex motivations and political nuances, and boils it all down into a revenge plot.  It's almost amusing to see how the movie tries to struggle free of this notion, as it offers up some simplified images of glory and honor, while all the while the lead character's motivation is essentially the same: to kill his nemesis.<br/><br/>   That's not to say ""The Patriot"" is all bad.  Once you get past all the (literal) flag-waving and glorified American perspectives on the Revolutionary War, its actually pretty involving.  I found myself drawn into its story almost against my will.  It's a credit to Roland Emmerich, the director, and the screenplay, that the movie succeeded at making me care about Gibson's quest for justice even as I couldn't help rolling my eyes as he grabs an American flag and charges up a hillside to rout the fleeing rebel troops to turn around and press forward.<br/><br/>   The process by which Gibson gets there is a long and dark journey.  His character, Benjamin Martin, is a farmer and dedicated family man with a South Carolina plantation where he simply wants to harvest his crops and live in peace.  He is a highly respected hero of the French-English War years ago but has decided that war should never be used, even as a last resort, and is willing to sacrifice principle to this cause, as he lectures on in a speech he makes before a voting council that must decide on whether or not to join the revolution.  The movie opens in 1776 as the Declaration of Independence is about to be announced.  Martin's oldest son, Gabriel, signs on with the Continental army against his father's wishes, and goes off to war, where he fights for two years and becomes battle-hardened but loses none of his idealism.<br/><br/>   The same cannot be said of the rebels themselves, whose morale begins to falter as they suffer one defeat after another.  The decisive battles in the war were not won on the traditional battlefield, and the untrained and ill-equipped militia forces are cannon-fodder for the stalwart British. Eventually, Martin is compelled to join the fight when one of his young sons is killed by a vicious British officer named Tavington, who chooses to use fear and repression to crush the revolt, and employs brutal tactics to accomplish this goal.  Martin gathers a ragtag bunch from the surrounding towns and forms a militia of his own, that hides out in the swamp and uses hit-and-run tactics to catch the British off-guard.  Ultimately his goal is to search and destroy Tavington.<br/><br/>   The British are portrayed as either weak-minded or cruel, with the intent of making us feel a certain satisfaction when we see them being killed by muskets and hacked by tomohawks.  The guerilla tactics used by Martin to halt the flow of supplies are far more effective than the marching of the Continental troops into overwhelming fire from the enemy.  What's odd is the way the movie seems to be suggesting that Martin was the first one to come up with the idea, when by 1778 I imagine this idea had occurred to and even been used by George Washinton.  But the famous figures of the Revolution, including Washington, are never seen, and indeed are but shadowy figures in the movie while Martin leads his men into battle and more or less wins the war singlehandedly.  I admit I found it hard to believe at the film's climax when the battle slows to a crawl to allow Martin and Tavington to go at it, mano-e-mano.<br/><br/>  This is all a sort of laughable revisionist history to embrace, but I was able to overlook it and just enjoy watching Gibson at work.  He has a way of seeming plausible in the face of such silliness, and even though his character exhibits similar traits to that of his portrayal of William Wallace from ""Braveheart"" (to which this movie will inevitably be compared) I still identified with his losses and his principles.  He brings a certain dignity to the role.  I also enjoyed seeing Chris Cooper as the weary commander of the Continental regiment he is aiding, and Heath Ledger as his impulsive son who joins them.  <br/><br/>   One complaint I would register is the way that the African-Americans in this movie are relegated to the position of mute observers.  If the movie had not shown blacks at all I might have preferred that to watching them be dismissed out of hand, but due to the prevalence of slavery in the Carolinas in that day that would hardly have been realistic.  There is one slave who joins Martin's band but his thoughts and motives aren't really explored. While it is true that slaves who joined up were generally given their freedom at the end of the war, I felt as if this character was being used as a token, and it made me somewhat uncomfortable to watch as the movie tipped the race card.  Having watched ""Glory"" which revealed how black soldiers helped turn the tide of victory to the Union and treated its black characters with more dignity, this sort of pandering seemed superficial.<br/><br/>  All this aside, ""The Patriot"" works on the level of pure entertainment, and I enjoyed it as such.  I also would not recommend it be shown in history class."

Perhaps if they had forwarded the movie with a list of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and the fates many of them suffered after they pledged ""their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor"" to bring about a new form of government, then this tale would have been in context. But it lacked the ""one great shining Moment,"" that made it worth the price of admission."

","I first saw this film in 2000, expecting a decent movie. Unfortunately, that isn't what I got. I got a gross-out fest. This movie isn't very good. It's made by the same people who wrote Godzilla.<br/><br/>The first problem with this movie is that it's on the gory side. Yes, I know that war is like that. Problem is, unlike other movies like Saving Private Ryan, the gore here just comes off as a pathetic attempt to shock you, and just ends up making you nauseous instead of giving actual insight into the nature of war.<br/><br/>The second problem is that it isn't historically accurate. Tivington, from the accounts I've heard, wasn't a bloodthirsty lunatic. From what I hear, he was a typical British 1700s officer. Also, Gibson's character was originally going to be based on a real person, but the director found out that the person who Gibson would be based on married his teenage cousin, and raped his slaves.<br/><br/>Also, one other thing that annoyed me: There's one scene where Tivington fires a pistol at a cavalry rider about 1,500 feet away. He hits him. You'd have trouble getting that kind of range on one of today's pistols, much less one from the Revolutionary War.<br/><br/>Rating: 2.5 out of 10"

In one scene, for example, a British soldier burns a church full of Americans to the ground, something that never happened and was clearly just thought-up by Gibson because the actual events weren't juicy enough for the anti-British narrative he was pushing.<br/><br/>Presenting these events in a fictional context would be bad enough, but including them in what's supposed to be a true and accurate historic account is dangerous.

","The Patriot is one of those movies that you either love or hate, depending on whether or not you care if it's historically accurate. Being an American-made movie, you have to expect it to be at least a LITTLE bit slanted towards the States, but this one went WAY OVERBOARD!!!!<br/><br/>And just so we're clear, this entire review is my opinion of the story itself, not America's fight in the Revolutionary War. I have nothing against the U.S.A. Only the movie.<br/><br/>One of the worst parts was when Mel Gibson (Benjamin Martin)'s son is shot by a sadistic British Officer who, after shooting the young guy, says ""I hope you've learned something about loyalty."" (OH PUH-LEASE! Does it get any more disgusting than this? p.s. speaking of loyalty, guess who got tarred and feathered when they refused to take the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States of America just a few years later? Of course, it didn't mention that in The Patriot. The slaves seemed pretty content too!)<br/><br/>And then there was the part where one of those very people (the Loyalists, or ""Tories"" as they were called by the Patriots or ""Rebels"".) was being ordered to burn a church full of people, by the same sadist (Jason Isaacs was actually pretty good in this one! He has a talent for playing the evil dudes). This happened in World War Two.<br/><br/>Another scene showed Benjamin Martin and his young sons attacking a group of 20 or so British soldiers. When one of the men tries to run away, Martin pins him down on the ground and beats him to death. Who's the bloodthirsty one now? (I know that they murdered those men because they were their enemy, but for gosh sakes, at least wait for them to DO something before you ambush and kill them! Those guys were somebody's husband and father too.)<br/><br/>I think most people realize that a lot of the stuff in this movie was for entertainment rather than education. And come to think of it, it IS an action movie, not an historical documentary. But isn't it so much better when you can watch a movie and think 'wow! this actually happened!'?<br/><br/>Anyway, at least it had Heath Ledger!"

This movie reinforced the notion that being British or even worse English is to be considered lower than a Nazi a serial killer,or Gary Glitter. Of course I am kidding and Mr Gibson was a dam fool for even signing up to make this movie. The Patriot is historically inaccurate in almost every aspect ,accept maybe for the battle scenes. The characters are presented as good and evil.(the militia never took prisoners as shown in the movie, they could not afford too. the British always tried to take prisoners, mainly as hostages and to barter with. Remember Cornwallis was well aware that the British were outnumbered, )Their are no grey areas. Maybe some one should have told the writers that atrocities' took place on both sides and that most of the war crimes against the American army and the patriots were carried out by there fellow country men. But any one who watches this movie and believes that the British were complete Bastards should read there history books. Oh and P S. Mel Gibson character is a composite of a number of people. One of which was a slave owner and trader.

(Locking up a whole village in the church and setting fire to it is playing on emotions as is the death of the boy, which turns Mel Gibson's character into a hero seeking revenge and freedom from the English.) I thought that this film played too much on the indestructible hero, and the dialogue was often amusing instead of serious, although I think that it was trying to be serious.

"Gallus","Null","4","9","1 July 2000"," There is something wrong with this movie
","There is something wrong with this movie. Not that it is badly made or lacking in production values. Indeed, all that money can buy has been generously bestowed on it and, if you are willing to disregard certain things, you will probably spend a good evening. But certain things simply cannot be ignored.<br/><br/>The problem, as others have said, is one of historical truthfulness. Not that one should be too pedantic about the details history : I see nothing inherently wrong in inventing characters and refashioning events, when this is well-done. What, however, is wrong, very wrong, is to accuse people of the past of crimes they did not commit. Nobody will dispute that there is a streak of ruthlessness in the British character and that, during the American Revolution, history records many instances of confiscation, looting and destruction of insurgentsÕ property by British troops, as well as hangings of people actively involved in the patriotic cause. At the same time, that ruthlessness had limits and to suggest that  atrocities such as those described in the latter part of the film (systematic slaughter of innocent civilians, including the entire population of a village) could have been been perpetrated by British officers, let alone condoned, if only tacitly, by Lord Cornwallis, is a calculated insult to a great nation to which America owes its deepest cultural roots and which remains one of its closest allies. Furthermore, in the film, those scenes of atrocities are utterly useless, for, already within three minutes of his first appearance, Tavington has done more than enough (and within the limits of the harsh rules of war as they were understood at the time) to fuel Ben MartinÕs spirit of revenge for the rest of the film - and a spinoff TV series, if they care to make one.<br/><br/>Another major problem with THE PATRIOT relates to the rather dubious brand of patriotism which it preaches. Once upon a time, Hollywood knew how to make films celebrating the love of America in such a way as to infectiously communicate it to millions throughout the world. Think of such fine productions as SERGEANT YORK, ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, among numerous others. Alas, it seems that the recipe has since been lost and that the only forms of expression of patriotism known to contemporary American movie studios are loud, vulgar and unimaginative. Truly, there must be more subtle ways to advertise the love of the US than to wave the Star-Spangled Banner to the sound of blaring fanfares over and over again!...<br/><br/>The most questionable aspect of that newfangled patriotism is its utter insensitivity to the feelings of people of other nations, whose lives are presented as expendable (think of the many tasteless jokes about redcoat-killing in THE PATRIOT...), whereas American lives are treated as sacred and infinitely precious - as if only Americans were fully human... Such a view is both offensive and morally repulsive. I suggest that American movie producers make it a priority to look for ways more respectful of human dignity to enhance a national patriotism which can otherwise be so admirable, and especially for the way in which it succeeds in transcending ethnic and racial differences.<br/><br/>PS For the record : Lord Cornwallis was not an elderly military genius, as depicted in the film, but a YOUNG man (born in 1738, he was not yet 43 when he surrendered at Yorktown...), who owed his position more to his birth than to his professional competence, as well as a liberal gentleman who, in subsequent years, did much for the advancement of the civil rights of Irish Catholics (THAT should be of some interest to Mr. Gibson!)"

","This was a great movie from an action standpoint and Mel Gibsons performance was outstanding, however in the movie the main character was a slave holder or in the very least a and I can't say I would view an active slaveholder as a true Patriot. Unless the African American characters in this movie were freed Americans being paid good salaries to be house servants and field hands, which I doubt highly, this character was not a patriot of freedom but rather a patriot of the freedom to enslave and oppress others. <br/><br/>Whoever wrote this movie must have anticipated some criticism about how the African Americans would be portrayed because in one part the British soldiers offered the slave freedom and the African American replied that they are not slaves but they are freedmen ""happily working the white mans property"" and happily helping him with no concern for themselves. To me that part was the single biggest insult to my intelligence as an African American because we at no time in history were happily working any white mans property without some level of resentment which this movie fail to portray. <br/><br/>The movie patronizes and pacifies the African American community by portraying happy slaves and the typical token black ""saving the white man to prove your worth"" scenarios as their token attempt to include blacks but only in the contexts of yet still another form of servitude of having to save a white person in order to prove our worth. Frankly, I'm tired of the idea that we as African Americans are only worthy if we save and serve white people instead of each other. The movie basically treats African Americans as passive props in the fight for independence when modern history tells us that there were more than one black man fighting for freedom and slaves were far more involved than the happy passive clueless slaves and sharecropers that this movie portrays us as. I for one wish that the British had won the war because independence day for American was a death sentence for millions of my ancestors. The British owned slaves to as we know but I believe that the American form of slavery was much more harsh and inhumane. I'm a U.S. Veteran now but had I been alive then I would have fought for the British as they had provided freedom to slaves that fought. I would have preferred the uncertain future rather than fight on the side of a Hypocrisy/Democracy. As a person who has experienced racism I would most definitely have fought for the British. The movies shows a few blacks being shot by the British and leaves out the fact that the British freed many blacks for their service I guess in order to make it seem as if blacks and whites were fighting for the same things which we were not. Americans were for their rights for racial superiority and freedom for themselves to exclude, enslave and create a permanent underclass of blacks.<br/><br/>I'm sorry I was by no means impressed with the token black man character (not the actor himself) earning his worth by saving a white man. I do get the point of the white man that was racist being saved by a black man and then is attitude changes but I'm tired of us being brainwashed to save white people all the time"

","Leaving accuracy and bias aside, there are two kinds of movies based on history. Some are good for entertainment and gives a basic explanation of why and how a event happened, leaving out and changing many details. Others are more sophisticated, trying to give us every detail and every angle on how it happened.<br/><br/>This is a ""sophisticated"" recreation. The direction is sophisticated. The choice of scenery for each dramatic moment is nothing but perfect, and there are plenty of beautiful stray visuals in between. The acting is sophisticated, understated yet clear and as sharply directed as the subject requires. And the buildings, weapons, uniforms and other costumes are recreated with consistency, leaving nothing off because of budget limitations.<br/><br/>And yet it's strikingly blunt.<br/><br/>It's blunt in it's storyline, relying on ""generic basic archetypes"" to tell us what happened to the typical soldiers of each side and group, the typical black ex-slave, the typical women, the children etc. It's blunt in it's narrative, using devices like slow-motion in the middle of battles, drawn-out ""NOOOOO!!"" pleads and sudden changes of music to beat us over the head with something important and tragic happening.<br/><br/>It's blunt in the point it makes, never showing anything to suggest why someone would not pick up the fight-even as Gibson's character himself expresses dislike for it early in the movie, noone could possibly avoid thinking it's just so we can see him change his stand soon. And, it's blunt in it's depiction of the English-American conflict.<br/><br/>""Why do people believe they can justify death?"", Gibson's character says nearing the final battle, asking why the English army does what they are doing to the American people. Nothing in the movie gives any explanation to that either. The viewer comes out completely ignorant about the roots of the conflict, why it became violent or even what exactly the rebels were fighting for.<br/><br/>We know nothing about the British Empire or what exactly they want to kill all those innocent people for. The only message one really gets, is that it's okay to go one-against-40 with a troop of highly trained soldiers using nothing but a rifle and a steak knife, if you've seen a mean-eyed officer kill your son in front of the rest of your family. So as a political message, the movie comes off as almost completely impotent - there is nothing in real life, in the current world that this movie can be said to openly take a stand against.<br/><br/>Also, a sudden angle change about two-thirds through with a long, pointless and emotionless wedding scene and low-brow ""humour"" does further to enchance the pointlessness of this movie.<br/><br/>Yet the visual imprint of the movie is strong and sophisticated, just because of the brilliant images and scenery.

I don't understand what is wrong with making a movie about the American Revolution which actually sites the TRUE causes of the Revolution.  The British soldiers DID NOT go around shooting wounded enemy soldiers or burning people locked in churches.  To portray things like that is turning a blind eye and making a complete mockery of history.  It almost makes me sick, as a Graduate student in British Colonial History, to see a movie like this be made and received as well as it was in the USA.  Americans should stick to books and not movies like this for history lessons.<br/><br/> The whole point of 18th century warfare was to bring war and carnage AWAY from innocent people living in towns, hence the fact that all major battles were fought in fields.  There was a ""gentlemanly"" sentiment among soldiers of that time and shooting wounded soldiers would have resulted in a court martial and subsequent execution for the offending officer or enlisted man. Moreover, the part where Tavington locks several dozen people into the church and burns it down is absolutely ridiculous.  There was an incident that happpened just like that in France when the Nazis took over in 1940. Oh, and I love how they just white-washed the whole slave issue and turned it around against the Brits again.  The notion of a free black man in 18th century America is plain stupid.  Remember that one of the minor reasons the American colonies revolted was that Britain had banned slavery in England in 1772 and were planning to extend that law to all the Colonies soon after....the Southern colonies wouldn't have that.....which ultimately helped start the Civil War 90 years later.<br/><br/> Anyway, as a ficticious story, it isn't a bad movie.  The battles are very realistic and true to history, which is more than I can say for the motives of the characters who take part in the Revolution.<br/><br/> The American Revolution was about British restrictions on land and high taxes, not about British officers massacring American colonists.  Just remember, where did the American settlers come from? BRITAIN!  It was actually a civil war if you think about it.  No wonder this movie was lambasted in England.  Even Spike Lee dismissed this movie as pure ""revisionist history"", as it surely is.  Mel Gibson, after the historically flawed Braveheart, should be ashamed for accepting roles like this.  Does he dislike the Brits or what?<br/><br/> Still, complete disregard for historical facts warrants a 3/10.  Good 18th century warfare re-enactments."

","What were the makers of this abomination thinking when this movie was made? Once again, Roland Emmerich shows that he can captain a movie with a great cast, tremendous production values, excellent narrative flow, and a tidy plot that you can leave at the door when you leave.  Has anyone suggested to him (and the others responsible for this thing) that you are allowed to spend more than $50.00 for a script???<br/><br/>Actually, my two main criticisms of the movie are the total lack of social responsibility evident in the film and the utterly gratuitous violence.  As a caveat, I am a big fan of violent movies, and action flicks are the mainstay of my moviegoing existence.  The dynamics change, however, when you involve kids.  Scenes of little children shooting down men from a sniper's perch (which are selectively justified as ""war is hell"" and ""you have to do what you have to do"" when *nothing* else in the film even makes a pretense toward realism) and then talking about how they actually *enjoyed* the experience afterward completely blew me away.  Oh, and let's not forget the sadistic protagonist who butchers a man in front of his kids, has about a half-second of remorse about his bloodthirst, and then shrugs the action off as something that he was forced to do by the exigency of wartime.  Take what side you will in the debate about violence in movies -- I think that in the context of the juvenile violence which has been so ubiquitous in the media, and which has repeatedly spawned copycat violence, it is socially irresponsible to make portrayals such as these under the guise of ""realism,"" especially when such attention to historical detail is so lacking elsewhere in the movie.  It's also interesting to note that the ""point"" of such violence, which is ostensibly to horrify and to educate against the glorification of war, completely misses the point here when you think about how wanton this film is in embracing the conventions of every kick-ass revenge flick ever made before it.<br/><br/>All that being said, if you can stomach children being thrown into the mix of an action-packed bloodfest, then you'll probably love this movie.  I'll stick to Dirty Harry, where good but bad-ass adults blow away bad (adult) guys."
"james.steel","2","3","6","18 July 2000"," A racist and jingoistic attempt at an historical epic. I don't recommend it!
","This film has courted a lot of controversy in the UK about its anti-English content, so it was against my better judgement that I decided to go and see it. My immediate reaction is that the film is jingoistic, racist and xenophobic. I'm not just saying that because I happen to be English - I would criticize any film that is so blatantly racist against ANY nationality. However, as an Englishman, I find myself deeply insulted. In much the same manner as Braveheart, the English are portrayed as either foppish cowards, or psychopathic and sadistic killers. Are American audiences so gullible and shallow that they actually believe this?<br/><br/>The Colonel Tavington character is almost a comic-book caricature of evil. Apparently, his descendents are demanding an apology from the film-makers - and I can't blame them. The church-burning atrocity in the film certainly NEVER happened in the American independence war. It WAS actually committed by the Nazi SS in a French village during WWII - perhaps German director Roland Emmerich should learn something of his own history! The treatment of black slaves in the film is truly bizarre. They are seen smiling and happy as they work in the fields - even telling an English officer in one instance that they are not actually slaves at all! Another slave is fighting for the colonists in the belief that he will be freed once the cause is won. In fact, slavery was not abolished in the US for another 70 years (some 50 years after it was abolished in the British Empire!).<br/><br/>Its not so much the historical inaccuracy that bothers me (for instance, the recent Ridley Scott epic Gladiator contained numerous historical errors, but was nonetheless a superb film). It was more the jingoism and national stereotyping. One gets the impression that American audiences (whom I assume this film was aimed at) will not accept any film that doesn't contain American heroes fighting against foreign (preferably English) villains! Where the Brits are fighting on the same side as Americans, they are air-brushed out of history (e.g U-571, Saving Private Ryan). The scary thing is that far more people watch films like this - and actually BELIEVE them - than bother to read a history book. How would Americans react if Britain made a film showing American GI's committing horrendous atrocities against Vietnamese civilians, who are bravely trying to defend their small country against the might of American imperialism? There would be uproar in America no doubt!<br/><br/>On a more positive note, the cinematography of the film is rather good, and the battle scenes are handled excellently. There is certainly plenty of action throughout the film to keep things rolling. Mel Gibson handles himself well as usual in the lead role of Benjamin Martin - though the pained expression he often exhibits has been seen many times before (e.g. Braveheart, Ransom, Mad Max). Heath Ledger also does a good job as Benjamin's son. The love interest is provided somewhat woodenly by Joely Richardson - oddly playing the sister of Benjamin's dead wife.<br/><br/>On the whole, this film might have been passable were it not for the jingoism and racism. Like Emmerich's previous film Independence Day, this film can be safely dismissed as pro-American propaganda. I give it 2 out of 10."

Unfortunately this political correctness doesn't extend to the lesser battles. One English officer feebly tries to have principles temporarily but gives up - anything more complex might have stood in the way of this grossly over-acted and underscripted little adventure epic.<br/><br/>There's a few touching moments early on, but soon the audience wearies of the predictability of every scene, as rebel Gibson singlehandedly rallies the troops and drives the oppressors from American shores. There's even a few lines to show how, once the Brits are gone, slavery will probably be abolished as there will only be nice wholesome people left in this nice Little-House-on-the-Prairie country.<br/><br/>In the follow-up, Mel Gibson is going to free Australia. This should be mostly a political sleight-of-hand, as I don't think there have been any battles, but no doubt if it becomes a problem they will rewrite history a bit. Then there will be Mel Gibson frees Hollywood. In this movie, he puts paid to independent cinema that has for so long stood in the way of decent capitalistic dominance.

","THE PATRIOT / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>	""The Patriot"" is a rousing, vigorous Revolutionary War epic from the view point of a family full of vengeance and strong wills. Mel Gibson reprises his ""Braveheart"" characteristics for a production that shares many common factors, such as frequent and graphic battle sequences that are persuasive, personal, and tragic. He stars as a widower named Benjamin Martin, who contains fond memories of his late wife and is raising several children on a South Carolina estate in 1776. Of course, he is haunted by deep secrets in his past and is an expert on the French and Indian war. King George's taxation without representation is the subject of conflict here, and although Martin believes the policy to be unjust, he wants nothing to do with supporting war with the British. <br/><br/>	Benjamin's oldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger in an overzealous performance), goes against his father's strong intentions and joins the rebellion by enlisting as a soldier in the war. Soon a wounded Gabriel returns to his father's plantation as a battle occurs in the front of their livelihood, and the diabolically cruel Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) orders the novice solider to be hanged. In fury one of Benjamin's other children (Gregory Smith from ""Small Soldiers"") is killed for interrupting the process, compliments of Tavington. <br/><br/>	Naturally this action triggers an impulse within Benjamin whose rage causes him to switch to battle mode and, with the help of his two younger sons, ambushes the party in charge of Gabriel's hanging. Benjamin then takes up arms against the British and is given the command of a militia. With the help of French warrior Jean Villeneuve (Tcheky Karyo), he marks a full-throated revenge against the man who killed his son, and who changed his previous life.<br/><br/>	The film is fond of bridging on emotions such as love, patriotism and betrayal. These emotions are true to the story, and relate well with the audience. There is also some mild comic relief, revolving around simple-minded misunderstandings and character traits. Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" similarly portrayed such humor to ease the tension. But in a movie with as much human depth and tragic occurrences as ""The Patriot,"" why would the filmmakers want to induce chuckles. They only decrease the seriousness of the subject matter-although the production is careful not to tread over its head in laughs and foolishness.  <br/><br/>	I did see a few excessively familiar clichés within the material of ""The Patriot""; how many times do we really need to see a father raising his children on his own because his spouse passed away a few years earlier. In lesser films I can see where their dim-minded writers would purchase this concept from the marketplace of customary clichés, but when I witness this particular mechanical abstraction in a movie with as much power as this, it is really shameful and sticks out like a sore thumb. <br/><br/>	What really propels ""The Patriot"" from being a good movie to being a great movie is the strength and conviction of Mel Gibson's performance and the realism of the battle sequences. Especially in war epics, Gibson is capable of portraying characters of flamboyance and passion, while at the same time can drive the film's many action scenes into excitement and thrills; not many actors can do that, but Mel Gibson can."

Lets first get it down that Hollywood and no one else for that matter promised to deliver you a movie that was entirely truthful and accurate, they promised to deliver you an out of this world movie loosely based off history, and that is what they delivered.<br/><br/>If no one reading this review owns the extended cut DVD version of this movie then I feel sorry for you, in the special features the writer of this movie goes through a list of everything that is fictional and how loosely or not loosely a character is based on an actual person, for instance Mel Gibson's character is an entirely fictional character, which is to be expected... but the French-Man is loosely based off a french officer who truly did go to the colonies during this time as an act of proof that the French were helping the Americans defeat the English. Now obviously scenes are going to be fictional, perhaps or perhaps not a church was burned by the British or by the Americans, but that doesn't change the fact that British and Colonials alike did what could be consider sadistic things during the Revolutionary War, which is to be expected, I mean come on its war.<br/><br/>As for the rest, costume design, accuracy on how the war progressed, the dividing of the colonies neighbors when one man went with the British and another with the Americans, that is all accurate and was in my opinion well researched, all in all though nobody should expect a movie to be accurate they should expect a movie to be entertaining, unless of course the movie is a documentary, then it should be accurate.<br/><br/>If you are looking for accuracy go to Barnes and noble and pick up 3 or 4 different Historical books, read through each one, make a list of all the differences of opinion, research online the differences and come up with your educated reasoning for what 'theory' is correct... and please don't come back complaining that the movie 'The Day After Tomorrow' is globally inaccurate because not only would the northern hemisphere freeze from a global storm but so would a third of the southern hemisphere, because I nor does anyone else give a crap.<br/><br/>As for the movie, I think it was a very well done epic movie, sure a bit of the dialogue was cheesy, especially when the girl made her speech in the church to convince the people to take up arms in the militia, but many movies contain cheesy lines and whenever a movie is trying to take it to the extreme you will often find a cheesy speech or two in the dialogue... but I would rather take a well-produced movie with a good theme and intense battle scenes along with well acted out drama then have a lame movie that cost $5,000 to produce, contains actress's like Hilary Duff and has a car in it that's headlights act as eyeballs and the car has feelings, yes I know it was Lindsay Lohan who acted in that movie, but its all the same thing anyway.<br/><br/>So the next time you decide to gripe about falsehood in a movie how about you make a New Years Resolution that inclines you to only read textbooks instead of watch movies :]"

","I have never witnessed a more ridiculous movie in all my life. The plot is silly and it feels like the film is just a homage to American patriotism maybe that is why I do not enjoy it. The action scenes would be satisfying if they were not so stupidly done. A man running at twenty soldiers with a tomahawk? Two second reloads on muskets and rifles yes OK. Overall the film would be good without the obvious American propaganda and if the battle scenes were more realistic. Watch this if you are American for you non Americans I really would not recommend this film. Mel Gibson s performance is pretty good and a young heath ledger does his best to rescue this movie however this movie is un-salvageable and is a crime against the world cinema."

After one of his sons is killed and another wounded in the War of Independence, a plantation owner (Mel Gibson) in America's South seeks revenge on the British colonel (Jason Isaacs) responsible.<br/><br/>The Patriot is a regrettable period drama which rewrites or ignores huge swathes of history for its own ends, and reduces the complex politics of secession to a petty vengeance drama; it's not helped by Gibson's humourless, heavy-handed screen presence and an insanely long running time. The score was composed by John Williams, and was nominated for an Academy Award."

Maybe the acts of the British weren't as what was portrayed on film. It was still a good movie! You got to admit, from the same guy who made Ryan, this is a much better improvement. Solid acting on the parts of all the characters, especially Mr. Gibson. Mel was probably the only one out of a dozen actors who could have pulled this off so perfectly.

","As an American living in England, I regret the offensive historical ""liberties"" taken in the film for the ""fire"" scene in The Patriot. It simply wasn't necessary to demonstrate that the British were, in fact, at the time, ""the bad guys"".<br/><br/>The Brits I know and work with are wonderful people. But at that time, there were certainly powerful reasons why Americans declared independence, and that makes for a fascinating premise for this movie.<br/><br/>Cinematically, this is a beautiful film, and does a masterful job of winding several plotlines into an epic. While it can't possibly tell the story of the whole revolution, that's not the point. It's simply one story based on the feeling and general period of the Revolutionary War. It does not glamorize war, nor try to justify it. In fact, that's the main challenge of the plot. I enjoyed the character development, I enjoyed the actors' performances, and I loved the mis-en-scene.<br/><br/>If you choose to compare the two, I felt it was, in fact, better than Braveheart, which I found to be even more contrived and trite at times.<br/><br/>The film was certainly not perfect. I agree with one previous reviewer: with some minor editing (namely taking out a few lines), the substitution of the fire scene with something else less fictional, and some better SGI work (sea scenes were pretty lame), the film could have been perfect.<br/><br/>However, if you are an American, I urge you to see this film and to study your proud, colorful history.<br/><br/>If you are British, then I regret the partially unfair  portrayal. But see the film anyways. As I walked out of the theatre here, most of the Brits I heard discussing the film seemed to have been thoroughly moved by it. Though we have been the closest of allies for at least 100 years now, at several times, we were not, and there were some very good reasons why."

"TPK","8","3","7","4 July 2000"," Superior to Braveheart
","I know the strong opinion of most who've written here regarding this film, and perhaps I'm chancing my already tenuous reputation as a reviewer to say it, but all the same I'm willing to put this on the line:  The Patriot is one of the better historical fiction movies of the past ten years.<br/><br/>Is it fastidiously historically accurate?  No.  Characters use standard American English accents, and some modern colloquialisms are present. Slavery, which was a fact of life in the colonies, is much played down--perhaps in our politically correct times, this is inevitable.  But the makers of The Patriot are not striving to create a period piece in which every bit of historical minutiae is perfect--rather, they seek to create a certain mood about a period of our history.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson gives one of the better performances of his career, as a widower and father whose former bloody past haunts him.  All he hopes is to see himself and his family spared from war--alas, the war comes literally to his doorstep.  To his credit as an actor, Gibson is perfectly credible in a role that requires him to go from a gentle family man willing to nurse Redcoats back to health, to a gore-drenched Colonial nemesis repeatedly hacking into a British soldier's body with a tomahawk--all within the space of about twenty minutes.<br/><br/>This film is superior to Braveheart largely because, as an action-oriented film, there is less posturing and more action.  Simple men are not usually in the habit of giving rousing speeches; Gibson's character does not.  His men stick to him and trust him not for his fine words before a battle, but for his consistent actions during one.<br/><br/>There is definitely some character typecasting:  Our Hero, the Love Interest, the Noble Villain, the Ruthless Villain, the Doomed Young Lovers, etc., and the movie has taken some knocking in the press because of it. However, I challenge these detractors to name a single classic work which does not employ such stock characters.  Shakespeare, Chaucer, and the Italian commedia dell'arte style are immediate examples.  No, Shakespeare this ain't.  That doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile movie.<br/><br/>If you want to revel in the thoughts of the idealists who forged the Revolution, rent 1776.  If you're curious about what it must have been like for the common men, the workers and traders and farmers of the Colonies and their families, to become involved in a war that was not of their choosing, you should see The Patriot."
"AtLeastOnceAWeek","8","4","11","20 May 2005"," Seriously...did everyone *really* miss the point!
","I heard it called everything from ""mindless dribble"" to a ""masterpiece of cinematography"". My favourites are that it's ""anti-English"", which is laughable as it honours one of England's most cherished legends.<br/><br/>990 reviews (I'm sure there were more but this seems to be the limit)and only 5 have even come close to evaluating what this movie was *really* about.<br/><br/>For the 985 other reviews (who apparently failed Literature 101), I'll let you in on the writer's little secret. What ""The Patriot"" is, is a clever, metaphoric, adaptation of ""Robin Hood""...plan and simple.<br/><br/>It was so obvious to me that I can't understand how, in five years, no one has pointed it out before (exception: Kledge - 22 July 2000).<br/><br/>Let me Cliff Note the sub-plot for you (Sorry, I won't be as clever as Sid in ""Sleep With Me"")...<br/><br/>Benjamin Martin (Mel) is Robin of Locksley, Charlotte Selton is Maid Marian (as was -to a lesser extent- Anne Howard/Martin), Gabriel is Will Scarlett <br/><br/>Come on...John Billings is so obviously Little John (complete with the same family he had in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"") ...the list goes on and on, they even have a Friar Tuck!<br/><br/>I mean seriously...the Spanish Church is obviously Sherwood Forest... they even mount ""steal from the rich"" raids. And, the rescue of Robin's men (err...I mean Martin's men)...straight from the Robin Hood legend.<br/><br/>And, for you 400 whiney royalist, who complained about how ""unfair"" the movie was to the ""historic accuracy"" of the British army....whaaa, whaaa, whaaa! Col. William Tavington was not portraying a historic Dragoon Captain, he was portraying Sir Guy of Gisborne. He was an evil SnOB because *Gisborne* is an evil and ruthless character. If you're comparing historic accuracies, use Robin Hood lore, not Revolutionary War history! ...and then, don't bother. Metaphors are the spice not the main course.<br/><br/>That they were able to weave this into a totally different period piece as nothing short of remarkable.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it's an entertaining, *multi-level*, movie. A Mel Gibson movie. If you're looking for a documentary, go watch the History Channel."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","4","11","12 May 2004"," The main problem already is in the movie's title.
","This movie is so patriotic that it's not even funny anymore. I mean when the main character is literally fighting the English with an American flag, then you know that it can't get any more patriotic as this.<br/><br/>Yet the movie is made with lots of profession and is still eye candy and entertaining to watch. The movie is not as heavy to watch as ""Braveheart"" but is still full with many epic battlefields of the same proportion.<br/><br/>The balance of drama and spectacular scene's is fairly well and acceptable, with the exception of some needless plot lines that only waste time and the same goes for some of the characters. I have some mixed feeling about the story. The movie begins dramatic with Mel Gibson as a family man that is still coping with the loss of his wife, then it suddenly starts to focus much more on his oldest son (Heath Ledger) and finally for most parts on the war of independence. The way the story is told is not always good or logical.<br/><br/>Another problem with the movie is Mel Gibson. A lot of complaints were that he played to much of the same character as he did in ""Braveheart"". I experienced this the same way back in 2000 when I saw ""The Patriot"" in the theater. Basically what I saw was an American William Wallace fighting for freedom. But yes I must admit that now 4 years later this hardly is a complaint anymore.<br/><br/>Jason Isaacs once again was a pleasure to watch. His character was an incredibly stereotyped bad guy but he is such a great actor with such a great villain look that he actually made the character an enjoyable villain. Biggest surprise for me was Chris Cooper. Now, I know that nobody is going to believe me for saying this but I already felt back in 2000 that this guy would some day win an Oscar, something that happened in the year 2003 for his role in ""Adaptation"".<br/><br/>The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is wonderful and so is John Williams musical score, which both got nominated for an Academy Award along with Kevin O'Connell, Greg P. Russell and Lee Orloff for the category best sound.<br/><br/>You'll most likely appreciate this movie much better if you are a (patriotic) American. For those people I rate this movie an 8/10. For everybody else this movie is nothing more as an entertaining movie without any memorable scene's or deeper meaning.

Pretty much anything from 1600-1800 is just amazing to me. And yet, this film made it seem so silly and boring. Perhaps I should not be surprised when it was made by Roland Emmerich, who does not seem able to really add any gravity to his films. (See ""Godzilla"".) The worst part is the casting of Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger is great in any part, but Gibson just looks like a thug coming down from a weekend bender. He has a few roles he has played well, but is overall forgettable. And he helped make this film forgettable."
"johnnyboyz","5","2","4","21 November 2012"," An uneasy combination of its director probably producing their best work; its lead firing on all cylinders and this strange sense of having seen it all before.
","One could be right in saying that the crossover period between 1999 and 2000 Mel Gibson spent in front of the camera was epitomised by all of: the desire for revenge; the need to challenge a ruling patriarchy and the ill-witting stumbling into a situation wherein encouraging people to stand up and believe in a burning desire for liberation is key to his presence. In Brian Helegeland's 1999 remake of Point Blank, entitled Payback, Gibson played out the role of angered lowlife striving for a bloody revenge on a man who wronged him before further still taking on a dominant ruling force and finding love where he didn't expect it. In Nick Park's Aardman clay figurine driven animation Chicken Run, he voices a rooster who quite literally crash lands into a chicken farm and whose desire to be free of the restraints of the scattered coops did not match their owners lust for them to produce eggs. It was here Gibson's character, through one means or another, became an idolised beacon of hope prefigured by those in desperate need of leadership. Where both films clock in at about a hundred odd minutes in length and get the job done, Roland Emmerich's The Patriot just doesn't quite make the grade. It isn't as much fun and nor is it about as substantial, in spite of the fact it is the length of both these movies put together and allows for its lead (Gibson) to wade through similar content.<br/><br/>For sure, the film is that of Gibson's - in spite of the fact a handful of characters not limited to that of his eldest son Gabriel (Ledger) and a true to life British General named Cornwallis (Wilkinson), often strike us as going through plights that are more interesting. The project will eventually come to form one of those often tired circular journeys which begin on the homely sanctuary of a farm before ending on one after all the chaos; skirting with an enemy and experiencing life and such has played out. Along the way, the lead will be faced with the opportunity to bury the grief he has for a deceased spouse as well as discover the chance to rid himself of the post-traumatic stress disorder he has carried with him when specific wartime acts many-a year ago left him in startled awe at what he was capable of on a battlefield. The film has been branded as being about the dangers of pacifism, and it is a credit to the makers for addressing the crux of such a matter without indeed glorifying warfare.<br/><br/>The lead is Benjamin Martin, a widower, and he lives on a South Carolina plantation in 1776 where the African Americans are paid; his youngest kids run through corn fields with warm smiles on their faces and the maid bakes pies for supper (although mercifully, she does not leave them on the sill to cool). Trouble is brewing, and war with the English (only later referred to as ""the British"") over control of these East Coast states not limited to New York and Massachusetts is desired by most of the local council. Martin, troubled by what he experienced himself in the Franco-Indian wars, rejects the idea but is largely ignored when a crucial vote passes. Through one thing or another, he is dragged into the conflict when it quite literally arrives on his front door step and his family is befallen a tragedy; a tragedy instigated by a snarling villainous British Colonel named Tavington (Isaacs), who kills one of his sons and burns down the farm.<br/><br/>From here, Emmerich launches the piece into a post-Last of the Mohicans; sub-Braveheart (with splashes of Saving Private Ryan on account of the Robert Rodat screen writing credit) wartime thriller as that of the British Empire crush the American infantry before tables are turned through the sole help of Martin and his guerrilla troops with whom he had previously fought. Along the way, Emmerich will, in equal measure, stall as well as kick things on; there is a lull to proceedings for about forty minutes as the second act tries to kick in and we await formal hostilities between that of Martin and Tavington to start, whereas attempts to touch on issues resembling that of Civil rights are more-so dolloped than subtly slid into proceedings to prop up the primary focus.<br/><br/>There are things about the film one is able to admire, it provides us with a likable hero; a nasty antagonist and a number of supporting acts whose respective tales of romance and war time strife do well to just about justify the runtime. Emmerich resists depicting comically inclined British bad guys going up against brave, heart-on-the-sleeve Americans and allows for antagonism to transpire in both camps. Alas, it is an admirable failure. Granted, it falls into being one of those war films wherein the two key people, who are required to fight, are able to spot one another during the climactic battle wherein chaos and killing is all around them whilst they stand still and immune, but you go with it. The result is something fairly pedestrian, but not without merit."
"kvissa","4","2","4","21 February 2008"," Ridiculous movie!!
","I am extremely disappointed in this movie. It had so much potential but somehow the movie became utter rubbish around the 1/2 way mark. There is way too much cheesy dialog and moments in this movie. I guess I am one of those that expects some degree of realism when I see movies, especially movies such as these that like to themselves seriously (big name stars, story based on arguably the most imp time period in America, etc). I think only a fraction of the movie is based on actual historical facts. There is way too much 'in your face' bravado and 'patriotism'. I agree with some reviewers that the way the slaves were portrayed was a joke. Given that this is set in the late 1700's and in the South, there seemed to be a lot of 'acceptance' of them. Mel Gibson couldn't decide if he should play this movie seriously or tongue-in-cheek and that indecision comes through quite openly. This says a lot about the director too. I saw another one of Roland Emmerich's movie - Stargate, which I thought was utter trash too. Joely Richardson is intolerable as the 'aunt'/'stepmom-to-be' (go figure!). She showed absolutely 0 emotion throughout the movie. She shares equal honors on that front with Chris Cooper, who somehow keeps disappearing and re-surfacing throughout the movie. Heath Ledger and Tom Wilkinson were quite good in the movie, while Isaacs was below average and very one-dimensional. The one main thing that made me feel disgusted about this movie was the lack of emotion in the main characters when their near and dear ones are murdered by Col.Tavington (Isaac's character) at various times in the movie. The costumes and cinematography were the other redeeming features in this movie. All in all, I feel bad wasting my time on this movie, but maybe there are others who are looking for brainless fun (and think this movie is great) that might enjoy this movie."
"dorotka24","7","2","4","5 February 2008"," It's a movie, not a history lesson
","I will never cease to be amazed by the criticisms leveled at films for their historical inaccuracy. To this I have two suggestions: go read a history book on the time and place depicted in a film or sign up for a history class! I love history, but have never watched movies to get a history lesson.<br/><br/>Movies exist for one reason and one reason only - to entertain. In this regard, The Patriot does a fine job. The acting is excellent, and all the characters were well cast. The pacing was good, and I was never bored. The battle scenes were exceptionally brutal, which must be typical of combat situations throughout the ages. Most war films depicting the American Revolution are fairly sanitized or rely upon drama and acting to carry the story. Not so with Patriot - I'm surprised they didn't try to depict the carnage that undoubtedly resulted from firing grapeshot or cannister shot.<br/><br/>Although realism is not typically a word I would choose for any film, I felt that the depiction of combat here was probably much more realistic than most such movies. Many history books will try to teach us that warfare in the 18th century was a bit of a ""gentleman's"" competition of sorts, where quarter was given if asked, and honor was observed in such matters as the beginning and end of conflict, prisoner exchanges, and the like. This may have sometimes been the case between fully professional forces like those of England and France, but such countries seem to have held a different opinion entirely of rebel forces. These were apparently regarded not only with disdain, but outright contempt. Afterall, those guilty of treason have traditionally been treated much more harshly than other enemies.<br/><br/>Patriot seems to take this probability and run with it. The colonists who fought against England in the American Revolution were regarded as traitors, and were likely treated very harshly if captured or engaged in battle. The British in general were portrayed as pompous and at times villainous, but this is certainly not out of line for the way they undoubtedly felt about the rebels. Concurrently, I'm certain that the colonists who took part in the rebellion had a great deal of contempt for the British as well, but particularly for the Loyalists, or those colonists who remained loyal to and fought for Great Britain. <br/><br/>My criticisms revolve around the flow of the movie. There are many, many tragic scenes that were obviously a plot device to hammer home the horrors of war. I felt that one or two would have sufficed to make such a point, but instead we receive multiple such scenes. Some chopping would have definitely been appreciated.<br/><br/>Overall, Patriot is an intense, interesting take on a theater of the American Revolution that is not often depicted in film. I would recommend it to those who appreciate the genre of historical drama."
"gcalknet-1","7","2","4","4 August 2007"," acceptable
","I wish the writers, producers, director, etc. had chosen a true story from the American Revolution. I too am very bothered by the church burning scene. I am unaware of this type of atrocity being committed by the British during the revolution. Yet, the movie is one of my guilty pleasures for movies. I almost always watch it when on TV. On of the only accurate things that is good, is Martin's comment about Cornwallis being a military genius. He was. He was, however, out of his comfort zone in dealing with the rabble of the American colonies. The Revolution contained many great stories, and any would make for entertaining watching. When is Chris Cooper going to receive more recognition? I have enjoyed him in everything I have seen him in. In ""Seabisgit"" (sp), he was one of the best actors in many a year. And his characterization of the Colonial col. here is outstanding."

Mel flips out, and storms off to seek his revenge, not only on his son's killer, but on everyone associated with the murderer, which includes the entire British army.<br/><br/>No, it's not Braveheart, but you'd be forgiven for thinking so. It's also not as much fun as The Road Warrior, which was a better film in every way.<br/><br/>At least it improves a little over Braveheart, in which nearly every Scottish and English character was played by an Irish actor. In The Patriot, several of the British soldiers are actually British, even though the only American ""patriot"" in the film is played by Heath Ledger, who was Australian.<br/><br/>I would not be at all surprised if the makers of this film thought that the real reason the colonists fought the revolution was because George Washington's father (or son, or wife) was killed by King George III. Or that the Civil War started when a young Robert E. Lee insulted a young Abraham Lincoln, leading to years of resentment and loathing that finally culminated in all-out war between the two men. That's history for you: it's all about revenge."
"setanta5","8","2","4","4 September 2005"," An excellent, if somewhat flawed, film and a well-told story.
","An excellent film even thought it occasionally takes too much artistic licence. The story concerns a former soldier in the English King's army who has argued that liberty can be brought about by negotiation. He reluctantly joins the American struggle for independence when he witnesses the brutality of the English soldiers first hand.<br/><br/>The story is well told and keeps the viewer's attention throughout its more than two and half hours. It is not a flawless film by any means, too many set pieces for one thing, but its portrayal of English brutality is not, as many have suggested, unwarranted. It should serve as a reminder that the British empire ruined entire civilisations and killed millions. No country has yet negotiated or voted its way out of England's grasp, many countries such as Scotland and Wales have failed. Ireland repeatedly tried negotiation and failed, and had to resort to violence. Just like the Americans did.<br/><br/>If you liked this film I would recommend ""Braveheart"", ""Michael Collins"" and perhaps ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999)""<br/><br/>The director is Roland Emmerich a German whose best known films include ""The day after tomorrow"", ""Stargate"", ""Godzilla"" and (very appropriately) ""Independence day""."
"libertytree3","9","2","4","3 September 2005"," Great movie, just don't use it for your history homework
","""The Patriot"" is a superb movie set in South Carolina during the American Revolution. Although the characters (with the exception of Lord Cornwallis and references to King George III, George Washington, and General Gates) the events, locations, lifestyle, and details are mostly accurate. Benjamin Martin, while not an actual character himself, is the epitome of those militia leaders who fought in South Carolina in the Revolution, such as Francis Marion, Andrew Pickens, and Thomas Sumter. As a native South Carolinian and lifelong resident of Carolina, I was deeply appreciative that the film was not set in New England. The Revolution began in New England, but the vast majority of it occurred in the South, especially in the Carolinas. The battles mentioned in the movie, such as Charleston and Camden (the biggest British victory of the war b/c of General Gates's ignorance) are real places that are still beautifully maintained as historical sites today. The final battle of the movie is loosely based on the battle of Cowpens. The scenery and locations in the movie are incredibly accurate, having mostly been filmed in South Carolina. The weaponry, tactics, uniforms, architecture, and other details are very accurate. However, there are a few things that I noticed are incorrect:<br/><br/>1. At the beginning of the movie when the family rides over a hill to Charleston; there are no hills of any kind near Charleston or anywhere in the low country of SC.<br/><br/>2. Again, there are no hills from which to leap down onto a road and ambush the British from.<br/><br/>3. The fact that Benjamin Martin's slaves aren't slaves but paid freemen is incredibly unlikely. No slave holder at that time, even the historical figures that Martin is based, on would have done that.<br/><br/>4. Tavington is a green dragoon, but real green dragoons wore green, not red (hence the name)<br/><br/>5. The Native Americans that Martin killed in the past were indeed the Cherokee (not the Mohawk as Deagleman's review said; they lived in New York), although there was never a Fort Wilderness<br/><br/>6. There were no French in South Carolina to help the militia<br/><br/>7. The huge victories Martin won are unrealistic; the real fighters such as Francis Marion literally fired two shots and ran, they did not eliminate whole convoys or fire 8 guns 5 times in 2 minutes. However, Marion and his cohorts did employ a number of clever escapes.<br/><br/>8. During the Revolution, the Americans still had British accents; there was no difference between the way they talked<br/><br/>9. South Carolina was the only state during the Revolution that did not allow African-Americans, slaves or not, to serve in its militia or regular army. Occum would not have been allowed to fight. He also wouldn't have been granted freedom for his service even if he wasn't in South Carolina, because freedom was only granted for service with the regulars. However, there are accounts of slaves fighting for or alongside their masters with the militia either in exchange for freedom on different terms or just because they were told to.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the message of this movie is one that is distinctly American, one of hardships, loyalty and sacrifice (as well as really cool fight scenes and some great lines, particularly by Monsieur Villeneuve). In addition, the movie is also careful to point out two of the most little-know facts:<br/><br/>1. Slaves were still kept in large quantities, particularly in Sotuh Carolina, despite the Declaration of Indepence's ""all men are created equal"", as a result, some slaves fought for the British instead of the colonists for their freedom<br/><br/>2. It can be argued that the American Revolution was begun in the North, waged in the South, and won by the French<br/><br/>""The Patriot"" is a fabulous movie with a breath-taking performance by Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, and Jason Isaacs. I highly advise you watch it, whether you are a history buff, a Southerner, a Yankee, someone from another country, or just somebody who likes great action and war movies."

","This movie has its good and its bad sides. The good thing is that the action has been nicely worked out although it depends heavily on the clichÃ© slow-motion drama. The bad thing is my all-time favorite, good old fashioned American sentimental patriotism. It is just too darn sentimental, and it gets so bad at some points that I get distracted and annoyed at the director and fail to see the good sides of this movie. The scene where the daughter runs crying up to her father is really a tear-jerker, at least for other people, but to me it is bad cinematography. Of course the other side of this patriotism is that the English are shown as hypocritical idiots with more sense of style and fashion than of honest combat."

If you liked this film for its action scenes or even maybe for its plot.Then thats fine,but there is not one person with a brain on this planet than can like this film for how it has depicted history.<br/><br/>Heres a few things that i found 'strange' about this film:<br/><br/>1.why are there no scotish welsch or irish troops fighting alongside the english,why are there no highlanders ,no bagpipers??? and why is there only 1 loyalist fighting for the british? 2.British soldiers burning women and children??WAH?really? 3.The patriots seem to kill loads of english soldiers and lose hardly anymen themselves,if so,then why,according to offcial figures did the British(and hessian mercanaries) lose about 10000 killed and the Patriots(and allies) lose about 25000 killed. The list could go on for ever. The fact is ,is that this film is Rubbish and should be avoided at all costs. oh yeah,the people who liked this film seem to defend it by saying that the only people who dont like it are sore loser brits,well i see more people from europe and america!(glad to see) slating this film,than i do british."

","Warning: spoilers below, but then, how could anything spoil what is already rotten?  An insult to those who actually lived through the real thing, on both sides of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Those overseas members who commented on how this movie is made for the cheese-eating American public are absolutely right.  This movie wasn't about anything that happened in 1776, it was about ""how can we make Mel Gibson everyone's favorite character if he were say, an 18th century plantation owner who really cares about his slaves and has kids with perfectly white teeth?""<br/><br/>I saw this flick with my dad.  We went thinking it would be a serious fact-based docu-drama.  We spent most of the movie laughing and guessing the dialogue before it was spoken and guessing what would happen before it happened.  The movie was made for the idiot American public who buys into garbage no matter whether it is accurate or not, just as long as it's cutesy.<br/><br/>Why should there be anything funny in this tale of suffering and sacrifice?  But no, Hollywood has Mel walking out of the British encampment, whistling so the British officer's dogs come running, away from their master the evil British officer because they'd rather be with righteous Mel.  The theater cheered and clapped, and my dad and I looked at each other and rolled our eyes.  I wanted to smack the back of everyone's head.  They just ATE IT UP.  ""Oh, the dogs prefer Mel!  What a great scene!""  Not!!!  God the public is so stupid.<br/><br/>Ugh, and at the part when they find out the British have been looting villages and killing families, and one militiaman realizes his home was one them, and he goes racing off before anyone can stop him.  I forget the name of the character, because by that time I was in tears from laughing.  It's true.  My dad had turned to me and said in a mock-whiny voice, ""Oh, he's gonna find the toy gun.""  Sure enough, the man's battle-weary hand sifts through the wreckage of his once proud shack and finds the toy gun he made for his son.  Gee, who'da seen that'a comin'?  As soon as that happened, and with the sound of my dad's prediction still ringing in my ears, I burst out laughing, much to the annoyance of the dumb clucks in front of me.  By the time the guy shoots himself my dad and I were in hysterics.  I hate noisy people in a theater, but we were left with no choice.  What a farce!<br/><br/>""Before this movie is over, I will kill you,"" Mel said.<br/><br/>""Well, here I am?!"" the bad British office replied.<br/><br/>""Wha-?  Oh, well, actually, I didn't mean right NOW, but I will.  You'll see."" Mel said.<br/><br/>""Oh, brother!"" Jack sighed.<br/><br/>There are plenty of movies I like that contain some of the things I complain about here, but this one was just too much, mostly because it was a period piece.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this flick was in the beginning when Mel obliterated that small platoon of redcoats.  His two kids did a good job acting and being believable as scared children witnessing bloodshed and having no choice but to kill as well. For those commenters who raved about what great flick this was, it was entertainment, sort of, and that's it.  Otherwise, you people are the reason this type of trash keeps getting put out.  I blame you for my wasted money."

"alive-8","Null","2","4","27 June 2000"," Please forgive Mel...
","I have only one word which can describe this film: Unnecessary.<br/><br/>I walked into this movie expecting so much.  I wanted love, action, patriotism, family, and triumph.  Instead I got cliche, holocaust, incest, insanity, and bitterness.<br/><br/>The plot is a fairly simple one: Mel was a great fighter once (legendary in fact), but has since hung up his sword and pistol to settle down with his wife and family.  When the Redcoats kill one of his seven children, he kind of snaps and goes back into action like a one-man Terminator.  Easy enough story.  Here were the problems...<br/><br/>The filmmakers took almost a full half an hour before anything happened. I don't mean before the first fight, or before the first love scene--I mean ANYTHING.  Mel sitting around (literally) and looking lovingly at both his wife's grave and his children.  By the time the first scene that furthered the plot arrived, I was almost asleep, but I continued to give it the benefit of the doubt.  So they kill the son and Mel goes berserk.  The scene in which he eliminates a rather large band of Redcoats with the help of his two youngest sons is amazing.  I watched it and forgave the slow opening. ""Here it comes,"" I thought, ""The rest of this is going to kick butt.""<br/><br/>I was wrong.  You see, the incredibly weak script by Robert Rodat (who also wrote Saving Private Ryan, a movie that would have been boring had it not been directed by Steven Spielberg) has to force the idea that war is bad upon us repeatedly, as if we are all so stupid we didn't get it the first eighteen times. SPOILER ALERT The first son has to die--that makes sense.  It allows Mel to go back into action.  Then a bunch of other people die.  Then more of his children die. Then some more people die.  Then a guy kills himself.  Then the entire population of a town gets burned alive inside a church (the most unnecessary moment in the entire movie).  I'm sure I'm forgetting the other hundred people who bit it along the way as well.  The point is, kill one son to have Mel seek revenge.  Have some battles in which tons of people die (it worked in Private Ryan and Braveheart), just make sure it's no one you convinced us to care about.  If you really want to prove that the bad guy is evil, have him attempt to burn up the church, or give the order or something.  YOU DON'T ACTUALLY DO IT!<br/><br/>As if that overkill wasn't enough, everyone has to end up happy in the end, as if none of it had happened.  All the men who lost their families are happy and dancing, the slaveowner loves the slave, the house that had been burned down is being built again, and the children who were upset with their parents suddenly love them once more.  They are so happy, in fact, that Chris Cooper almost smiles.  Worst of all, there's Mel Gibson, the man who lost his entire family, his home, his tranquility, his peace of mind, his connection with God, and his sanity, standing there waving the flag in patriotic triumph.<br/><br/>On top of all of that, the movie is full of badly directed scenes (I'm not surprised--the director also helmed Universal Soldier and Godzilla), poorly written dialogue, and loooooooooooooooong monologues that could just as easily have been seen, not heard.  SHOW ME, DON'T TELL ME!<br/><br/>I can't believe Mel Gibson accepted the role, $25 million payoff or not. Even more, I can't believe he didn't stop halfway through it and say, ""Listen guys, you all suck, I have two Academy Awards, let me finish directing this thing properly.""<br/><br/>To compare this to Braveheart is an insult.  This is the kind of movie that tries to be a thoughtful, dramatic, sensitive experience, but instead completely disrespects its characters, betrays its own hyped-up emotions, and gives the finger to the audience.  It's as if the filmmakers are telling us that if we don't understand or sympathize with the characters, we are bad people.<br/><br/>Don't let them manipulate you, even though that is what they are trying desperately to do.  This movie is mediocre at best.  Bottom line is this: Although I like Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger immensely, all this movie managed to do was piss me off.  With the actors they had and the epic subject matter they had access to, this could have been a true classic. What they did with it was downright unpatriotic."

","When one sees these blockbusters, full of CinemaScope-like battle scenes, colors, graphic decapitations, the first impression is that there must be something here. I disagree with people who say it shouldn't be criticized because it's a movie and doesn't promise to be American history. No movie is an accurate portrayal of American history. They do however, within the world of the film, present accuracies and verisimilitude. This one is again a monster movie. The personification of evil, Satan himself, is British, and heartless. He locks people up in a church and burns them alive. He has no regard for anything--they are as flies to little boys--they kill them for their sport. Not only that, he's impenetrable, he's yet another thing that can't be killed. Thank God Mel Gibson is around. Unfortunately, by the time he gets into the action, there's not much left. The battle scenes are breathtaking; the scope of the movie phenomenal. Can't someone take this and do a Saving Private Ryan or Paths of Glory. Instead, we end up with the supernatural villain who can only be killed if he faces the Gibber, who personifies Popeye when he says, ""That's all I can stands, cuz I can't stands no more!"" I didn't make it to the theater to see this. I'm sure visually it is more grand than my big screen TV. A little subtlety, using characters we care about, people with hearts and souls, and, yes, a little bit of reality about what the American Revolution was about. As it stands now, we have shown that the great Patriots and Revolutionaries didn't win the war--An Australian Did! Aren't they part of the British Empire?"

Hollywood's, and Mel Gibson's, take on 18th century America.  Who are they trying to kid?  With such gross inaccuracy the movie loses all credibility with regard to it's depiction of the actual battle scenes.  I didn't know what to believe.  Add to the mix some hyper-emotional, cathartic releases by these '1990's' men and you have American Revolution suitable for the whole family.  Just avert your eyes when the occasional cannonball decapitates 'our' militiamen.  What a joke. This kind of 'all American' movie makes me embarrassed, not proud, to be an American.

Not nearly as pro-American as other Roland Emmerich movies which was good, considering I'm not American :) (although the portrayal of the British seemed a bit stretched).

","Although I didn't expect much as the last few works done by Emmerich have disappointed me, it was even worse. Let's leave the historical correctness out of it. A movie can be based in a certain time, without the need of being accurate. After all the war is just a framework for the so often told story of simple revenge.<br/><br/>At certain points exaggerated violence as seen in Martin's first attack, when he suddenly becomes berserk, can be used to put the whole into question. If it would have been just left like that. Emmerich would have suddenly turned his films to a new direction -- the audience has to think about the protagonist's actions. But no! Right afterwards the actions are all justified. Either by some brutalities done by the truly evil English or simply by witty behaviour of Martin. So it all ends up in the black/white scheme again. What is evil and what is good is defined by the colour of their uniform: you can switch your brains off.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a movie is not simply made by nice photography and sophisticated battle scenes; it's the story and the characters it lives from. The characters are flat and act out of simple motives. Worse, most of them are spoken about, just to make sure, that every last person sitting in the cinema finally gets it..."

In fact, this film is so pathetic (in every sense of the word), pretentious and ridiculously patriotic I can't see how it could appeal to anyone living outside American borders.<br/><br/>The dialogue and speeches of patriotism were so predictable, it felt as if my expectations on the next line were actually interacting with the actors. Despite great actors, wonderful photography and lavish costumes this picture ends up being nothing but another propaganda film from Hollywood, or is it Capitol Hill?<br/><br/>When Mel Gibson runs towards the line, grabbing an American flag on the way from a retreating soldier and bawling ""Hold the line! Hold the line!"" I don't know which association is the least flattering; the cheesiness of Toto or the pompous campaign song from ""Wag the dog"", which might very well have accompanied this scene.

"tjohanne","2","2","4","13 August 2000"," What a disappointment
","I was rather sceptical towards the movie before I saw it, and I really regretted seeing it afterwards. The movie starts out okay, but when the main character kills 20 professional English soldiers, only with the help of an old rifle (which shouldn´t be able to reload that fast), an axe and two crying kids - that really made me wanting to leave. Afterwards he was so covered in blood and looked very heroic in the annoying slow motion scenes as he chopped an Englishman to bits with the axe. I found it rather childish than deep in any way.<br/><br/>The Englishmen were mostly portrayed as idiots. They could not fight, they didn´t seem to have human feelings and they were led by a commander who made the monsters from Alien look friendly in comparison. That is simply quite ridiculous. England abandoned slavery some hundred years before USA, but that wasn´t so clear in the movie. Even the slaves who were ""freed"" by the English wouldn´t come.. they would rather protect their American master. I think the blacks were almost made fun of in this movie, and that disappoints me. Blacks living in London at the time, lived as free, equal human beeings, at least so said the law (as far as I know). But here they would rather stay and ""build a new world"" together with the Southern aristocracy... ha ha! What do the native Americans call George Washintgon? ""Destroyer of cities"" or something like that.. because of the numerous times they were backstabbed by different leaders, both English and American and had their families killed and homes destroyed, in a far worse manner than the Patriot lost his family in the film. What did we see of that in the movie? Nothing.. No no. all Americans are honest, upright people it seems. Blacks are dumb and pathetic, Englishmen are evil and arrogant, even though they have some sense of honour. Indians hardly exist, even.. that is the lesson of this very very annoying movie! It should almost be censored or labeled with a Parental Advisory sticker because of the crazy moral it spreads! Or at least have some kind of warning so that people are aware of the grave twisting of history that takes place in the movie. >And the fight scenes were awful as well. And the romantic drama of the movie were full of clichés. I hated it, really. Thanx"

I felt all the rage and anger, the pain of loosing family and friends, the glory of success, the joy about the little things of luck. For me this movie was a roller coaster of feelings. One moment you was crushed down and the other one you was raised up. This is not only an action movie or a movie only for american residents.

","The really gives audiences what they would want to see for their money. It is a three hour film filled with glorious scenery, action, special effects, Mel Gibson pulling some wonderful faces and a whole cast of likeable rogues.  It had echoes of the director's previous film, Independence Day and the writer's previous film, Saving Private Ryan.  If you could imagine these two films melted down together and then taken to the lowest common denominator you would have The Patriot. The film is too exaggerated to take the history as more than a backdrop to the human drama.  It mixes humour with tragedy, never taking the audience down into the darkness too deeply.  Mel Gibson's character has some depth and complexity, but I felt that this was never really explored, which was a pity. It did however, keep me interested for 3 hours, which is quite an accomplishment.  I put this down to the very professional technical merits of the film and a series of watchable stars inhabiting interesting characters. Just out of interest, it was one of the few films that actually uses the Dolby Surround Sound to service the plot."
"lori.m","8","2","4","10 August 2000"," Very enjoyable Hollywood blockbuster.
","Benjamin Martin(Mel Gibson) has a dark, shady past which he dearly wants to forget. Being a widower with seven children to care for helps him to do that very thing, but when his son Gabriel(Heath Ledger) signs up for the army to battle the Brits in the American Revolution, it's not long before events go awry, resulting in a family tragedy...<br/><br/>When Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich(producer and director respectively of such films as Independence Day) decided to do this film, they set out to make it a ""really beautiful movie"". If asked whether they had succeeded, the answer would be a semi-yes. It's not that this film isn't great, it is, it's just that what we have here is a Hollywood blockbuster beefed up with a decent plot and some good character development.<br/><br/>You won't be surprised when Mel turns in a performance that's as charismatic and captivating as ever. The treat here is Heath Ledger's star turn as Gabriel. Ledger hasn't ""ditched the accent"" as promised, but that doesn't matter, because here he has made his character someone you really care about. In ""10 Things I Hate About You"", he seemed promising, and now, in The Patriot, he dislays his full potential.<br/><br/>There's ample CGI usage on show here, a real standout being the fabulous recreations of whole towns. Of course, the entertaining battles are also effects-heavy and there's an amazing sequence where an in-motion cannonball takes up the whole screen for a split second and then proceeds to remove an unfortunate soldier's head. Exhilirating stuff, and guaranteed to make the audience jump.<br/><br/>It's no wonder that Spike Lee was getting all hot under the collar about the movie's script turning a blind eye to the treatment of blacks during this period in history. It was the 1700s, after all, so it's no mere historical inaccuracy to have American Southereners(!) talking about racial equality. It's just plain unrealistic Hollywood nonsense, and badly affects the film's believability.<br/><br/>The Brits are made out here to be real meanies, committing atrocities within the film that didn't even happen in the real war. Thankfully, this works for the film, because it's refreshing to have a baddie that you really hate(Jason Isaacs in a cold-blooded performance) instead of someone pathetically weak like Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus.<br/><br/>The final thing to be said about this film is that it has a richly sentimental feel to it. Mercifully, the emotional scenes never reach mawkish heights, but there's still a fair bit of heart string pulling about. That said, Emmerich compensates for the sentimentality by throwing in a good number of moments chock-a-block with gore, which is fair enough.<br/><br/>Rating:4 out of 5"

By coincidence one afternoon I was at the theater without a movie in mind and on a whim decided on this one.  I am so glad I did!!!  This movie has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>After a string of Mission to Mars-like letdowns I was once again reminded just what it is about movies that I love so much.  If movie-making is an art, this one is a masterpiece.  The story, acting, cinematography, and casting are all magnificent.  Mel Gibson gives a stunning performance as a father forced to go to war during the American Revolution.  I've heard people say it was ""just like Braveheart"", but I disagree.  Without the added responsibilities of producing and directing, Mr. Gibson was free to concentrate on acting his part, and he did a job beyond expectations.  Skye McCole Bartuziak also gave a very moving (and impressive) performance as Martin's (Gibson) youngest daughter traumatized by the losses she'd endured.<br/><br/>All in all, there wasn't anything about this movie that was bad.

","For all of those critics who bash this movie for its historical inaccuracies, you have to understand that this movie never proclaimed to be a factual documentary.  It is simply BASED on events that transpired and the lives of a number of important figures during the Revolutionary War.  With this view in mind, I thought the Patriot worked very well, stirring up some much needed patriotic feeling into our cynical society of today.   <br/><br/>
As far as the inaccuracies, I actually thought there were a lot more inaccuracies in Braveheart, a wonderful film with a story that bears little resemblance to the actual story of William Wallace.  For those who doubt all of the brutal tactics used by the British, the real-life British Officer Banastre Tarleton was known to be almost every bit as evil as the Tavington character in the movie.  With that said, I don't know of any event where he burned a church full of people, that might have been a little much. However, he did execute captured colonists and civilians, and was known as being astonishingly ruthless.  In real-life, Lord Cornwallis actually approved of Tarleton's tactics (the movie gave him a more positive outlook), and was so incensed after he was defeated at the Battle of Cowpens, that he chased Nathaniel Greene's army all across the Carolinas.  The result was that he eventually tired his army out and allowed Greene to make a few stands that sent Cornwallis to Yorktown.  <br/><br/>Others have complained that the movie did not show any of the brutality of the Americans.  It thought the shot of Mel Gibson repeatedly bashing the British soldier with blood all over his face and clothes, as well as the instance where the militia continued to kill British soldiers after they shouted for surrender, managed to give some of the American brutality.   <br/><br/>
With that said, I did have a few problems with the movie.  There were a few scenes of laughable cheesiness, such as Heath Ledger's girlfriend standing up in church to give her speech about independence, and the mano-a-mano fight between Tavington and Martin.  I would also have liked to see more of an exploration of the internal struggle between loyalists and patriots. Also, the movie made it sound as if the slavery problem was not such a big deal-something must have happened then between the Revolution and the Civil War!  Overall, however, a well-done, beautiful (the sets and costumes seemed very authentic), & inspiring movie.  *** (out of four stars)<br/><br/>Interesting  note: Mel Gibson, was not cast as `The Swampfox' Frances Marion (the character that Benjamin Martin was clearly based on ), because it was found that Marion spent his free-time hunting Indians!"
"les-35","8","2","4","9 July 2000"," Best I've seen on the American Revolution.
","There's some ""Hollywoodized"" history here, but ""The Patriot"" is arguably the most accurate movie ever made on the American Revolution.  Many Americans, because of their conditioning,  tend to have a ""Manifest Destiny"" attitude towards their revolution. They have the vague belief that the colonists were inevitably going to win. But the war was an extremely difficult one and easily could have been lost, were it not for some good fortune and the alliance with France.<br/><br/>  Gibson's movie zeroes in perfectly on the extreme difficulties of the revolution, and graphically depicts the mind sets of the Patriots, the Loyalists and the ""middle group"" that was constantly being pressured by both their rebellious neighbors and by occupying British and Loyalist forces. The South was one of the bitterest areas of the Revolution, partly because the British were growing desperate to crush the rebels, and all of this comes through in the movie.<br/><br/>   My only slight misgiving is the length of the movie and perhaps too much depiction of family sentimentalities.  The concluding scene, which shows an American triumph and the survival of the hero, is quite appropriate, and invokes memories of ""Braveheart,"" another Gibson triumph.<br/><br/>   Well worth watching, for both history buffs, like myself, and other types of movie goers."
"Roch-2","Null","2","4","5 July 2000"," Patriotic whitewash
","The British do not fare well in Mel Gibson movies. 'Braveheart' made effete treachery, murder and blackmail seem like the main British virtues. In 'The Patriot' British soldiers shoot wounded prisoners, execute civilians, commit mass murder and generally nasty up the landscape. The American militia fighters are saints by comparison.<br/><br/>Was the Revolutionary War really this horrible in South Carolina? There were elements of guerrilla warfare and civil war in that conflict, but I doubt if the British were as bad as portrayed in 'The Patriot.' It seems Hollywood movies today are not content with giving us conventional bad guys. They have to give us human flesh-eating serial killers (Hannibal) or military psychopaths like the British in 'The Patriot.'<br/><br/>Still ... the real groaner in 'The Patriot' is the way it distorts reality on the touchy question of slavery. After all, Hollywood can't make Mel a hero with feet of clay. They can't glamorize colonial America's fight for freedom while accurately portraying the slavery that made the Founding Fathers hypocrites. <br/><br/>Here I am on solid ground, since I recently read ""Slaves in the Family."" The book details the lives of a South Carolina plantation family and their slaves from colonial days to the present. Slaves in South Carolina were treated worse than draft animals -- bought and sold, worked relentlessly, whipped, and punished for running away by being branded or having ears or toes amputated. For most of South Carolina's history, it was illegal to free a slave.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is clearly a wealthy landowner in 'The Patriot,' with a dozen or more black people working in his house and fields. Yet when passing British trooops tell his workers they are no longer slaves, one of them declares that Mel's blacks are not slaves, but free men. <br/><br/>Huh?<br/><br/>And later when Mel and his family are running from the British, they seek refuge in an idyllic seaside village populated entirely by black people who are obviously not slaves. Mel and his kids are given refuge by Abigale, their former housekeeper and mammy. It's a touching scene when Mel's kids are reunited with Abigale ... and as phony as anything ever filmed.<br/><br/>The black character who gets the most screen time is a slave who fights  in Mel's guerrilla band. His master is too old to fight, so he sends a slave in his stead. Enduring the racial taunts of his ""comrades,"" the slave discovers he will be freed if he serves a year for the revolutionary cause. During that year he saves the life of one of the worst white bigots, and when his year is up he continues to fight for ""freedom."" <br/><br/>Fat chance.<br/><br/>'The Patriot' has some virtues as entertainment, but those are ruined for me by its completely distorted portrayal of slavery. The contradictions and glory of our Revolution deserve honest treatment."

","The Patriot is a film that I've always had mixed feelings about. After seeing it again recently, I think I have a more coherent idea of how I feel about this film.<br/><br/>To sum this film up neatly, it is a retelling of the story we know in Braveheart, with some alterations and being slightly worse.<br/><br/>From a historical standpoint, The Patriot is about as historically accurate as Braveheart - that meaning that it really isn't. By now, many have already meticulously picked apart its inaccuracies so I won't really dwell on it too much. But as a piece of popular cinema, I don't think this film's intention is to be historically accurate anyway.<br/><br/>The Patriot is an impressive looking film, I believe. The action sequences are exciting to watch and the scale of the battles are appropriate enough where there aren't noticeable CGI people also partaking in the fight.<br/><br/>Speaking of the CG effects, they are looking a bit dated now. Some of the computer generated blue screen backgrounds don't look very convincing, especially when they go to Charles Town at the beginning of the film. But since the shots don't dwell too much on them, it's not too bi a deal, I believe.<br/><br/>The acting performances aren't bad at all. Mel Gibson found his niche after Braveheart and went with it and his performance here translates incredibly well. The actors that portray the various British officers in this film do put on a bit of a James Bond villain performance and it does get a little distracting, but there is some complexity in the writing at times that makes up for that in those moments.<br/><br/>It's also to be noted that the soundtrack for this film is amazing. Of course, this is the work of John Williams and it goes extraordinarily well when paired with this film. It is the shining aspect of this film and I cannot compliment it enough. It has to be one of the more underrated works John Williams has done.<br/><br/>Where this film ultimately loses me is when it comes to the issue of slavery. I understand this is among the myriad of other historical inaccuracies with this film, but it's this particular aspect of American history that really hurts it the most. The most obvious example of this is when the workers on Martin's farm say that they work his land but are not slaves. It is also framed in this film that the British army offering freedom to any slave who serves with them is a bad thing, but later when the American army announces something similar, suddenly it's righteous. This, of course, wasn't the case and it's very misleading. There's a scene in the film where Gabriel makes a promise that once the British are defeated, the old world will be pushed out and a new world can be built; one where all people are free. This is so obviously untrue but the film ignores it. As a result, it feels like the one slave character shown in the whole film is duped into serving with the continentals just to be enslaved again once the eventual government decides, through inaction, that slavery is necessary. I get images of the American Civil War in my mind every time I see that scene, and it's that scene that really hurts this film the most- but ironically enough, maybe the most accurate part of it...<br/><br/>The Patriot is interesting. I feel it's a bit long. Granted, I'm just coming from seeing the extended cut but I do think this film could have gone without some things. Not horrible if you're looking for a fictional story that takes place in a real time in history. Just don't use it as an educational tool unless you're going to talk about the uniforms and clothing of that period."
"colinrfricke","8","0","0","2 February 2020"," Entertaining movie about the Revolutionary War
","The Patriot is a good Revolutionary War movie but it is fiction.<br/><br/>The story follows Benjamin Martin, a farmer in South Carolina with a checkered past whose perfect life comes crashing down in the turmoil of the American Revolutionary War. When a brutal British dragoon officer, Colonel Tavington shots one of Martin's sons in cold blood and torches his home he seeks revenge by joining a local militia. As Martin's militia disrupt British supply lines, Tavington resorts to sadistic acts of cruelty against civilians until Martin and Tavington do battle.<br/><br/>Excellent costumes, acting, and the fact that it really is the only war movie depicting the Revolutionary War make it worth watching.<br/><br/>The biggest grip with this movie is the historical inaccuracies. What makes it worse are that Martin and Tavington are loosely based on real people (""the Swamp Fox"" and Colonel Tarelton). First it is a movie so let's just calm down. However some of the scenes are so inaccurate it is disgusting. The fact that his African American workers are ""freemen"" and they eventually hang out with other free slaves is odd. Slavery was common in the South so dont sugarcoat it.<br/><br/>The second topic of controversy involves supposed British atrocities especially the scene with the church. This gets the Brits in a tizzy as there are no records of British troops killing civilians in that manner. But let's not try and dim the real atrocities committed by British and allied troops and the effect it had on the American people at the time (Americans were not angels at the time either). Between 1.5 and 3% of the American population died in that war (not including civilians). Civilians, like in all wars, were murdered by enemy troops albeit not on orders from high command. Homes were ransacked regularly and put to the torch. For example, Norfolk VA and Portland ME were both bombarded and torched by the British. British and their Indian allies massacred 300 American civilians at the Battle of Wyoming, 12,000+ American POWs died on British hulk ships of deprevation and disease with a death rate in excess of American POWs in WWII. More than 100,000 Americans became refugees and fled to Canada after the war. To put these numbers in perspective, that would be equivalent to the US today losing 5 to 10 million military members, 1.5 million in POW camps, having San Francisco and Seattle completely destroyed and losing 15 to 20 million people as political refugees. This war affected Americans like no other including WWII and the Civil War. Virtually everyone in the country came into contact with enemy troops, every state had battles and suffered occupation. This is not to say the British like Nazis but the horrors of war were there as they were in most wars of the 18th century in some form or another (the Seven Years War AKA French and Indian War in the US featured plenty of horrors in Europe and America). For many Americans at the time this war uprooted their whole lives and if Hollywood needed to portray that by exaggerating a single British officer's acts and the nature of war in general so be it."

"CinematicInceptions","6","0","0","24 February 2016"," Bleeds with themes, overdone drama, and domestic patriotism (and Braveheart).
","I seem to share the general gripes about this movies flaws. Most of the issues that people seem to have with it relate to its being too reminiscent of Braveheart, over-demonizing Colonel Tavington, and making most of the characters anti-slavery even though that issue was not very pertinent during it's time frame or at its release. While I agree with all of these points and have further negative critiques to add to them, I was still able to somewhat enjoy and appreciate the long story of war and family. Despite its length, the story moves along at a reasonable pace, though it might have done better to shave off twenty minutes.<br/><br/>By personality, Benjamin Martin feels almost exactly like William Wallace, and I probably don't have to list all of the reasons why. Mel Gibson gives an almost identical performance apart from switching from a Scottish accent to a less convincing American accent. I'm not entirely sure what Martin's arc is from beginning to end. Clearly he becomes more patriotic as a result of his sons' ardent patriotism, but it's hard to tell if he goes to war out of pure vengeance or because he believes in the cause. He never seems to renounce his old patriotism in which he sees his nation as having potential for flaws. However, considering how Roland Emerich glorifies his presidential characters in 2012 and Independence Day, it's probably a safe bet that Martin now identifies as an ardent American. Colonel Tavington is introduced from the start as a despicable villain, which is not a problem in itself. There are similarly detestable antagonists that are considered some of the greatest bad guys in fiction. However, Tavington's motives are never stated, making him seem more like those Disney villains that were just born evil. Also, his defiance of Cornwallis rules out the possibility of his being a representation of the the entire British army. So while his ongoing battle with the Martin family works well for the story, it is sort of an empty battle in our eyes. Gabriel is the character that we are meant to like and agree with the most due to his youthful energy and zeal. He sees his safety as inferior to his honor and national pride. Ultimately it is what does him in, though he likely would have died for his country if given the option. There are a lot of minor characters, most of whom I thought were written poorly. They add very little to the story and are not well developed even though they are given more screen time than minor parts typically get. I particularly disliked Benjamin's ten-year-old son Nathan, but that was more for his bratty arrogance than the way he was written. Colonel Harry Burwell (Chris Cooper) was probably the best written of all the minor characters and easily had the most overall importance to the plot.<br/><br/>The story is, again, very similar to that of Braveheart with the inclusion of a full-on villain and a reluctant protagonist. There are a few subplots that transpire away from the battlefield involving the Martin family, Gabriel's pursuit of love, and Benjamin's command over his soldiers. There is an overriding theme of loss throughout, but I think it gets overdone. Killing off characters that we have come to love is one thing, but we can only feel the other characters loss to a point. That point was well exceeded here. Sure I sympathized with Benjamin's various losses, but after a while I just stopped caring.<br/><br/>The audio and visual effects were good enough that I could appreciate them even fifteen years out of context. Apart from that, the execution was not praiseworthy. The directing and camera-work, while dramatic, did not come off as very striking, and much of it was pretty standard. The acting had no glaring problems, but neither was it impressive. The script was well paced, but the dialogue was too dramatic and had far too many instances of characters ending a conversation by storming off and throwing back a scathing remark or glance.<br/><br/>There is a pretty good amount of violence, and some of it is meant to be exciting some to be gruesome. There are some intelligent battle tactics involved, and this should also be reminiscent of Braveheart. The runtime could easily be boring to those who don't like long movies since the content is not of the same caliber as some other long epics. I know much of my review has been negative, but there are some good themes involving family and acceptable behavior during war. None of these resonated with me, but that doesn't reduce their value. Overall Rating: 7.2/10."

Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a farmer in South Carolina 1776 who served as a veteran in the French and Indian wars. He is reluctant to serve until a ruthless Colonel shoots his youngest son. This fills him with a desire for revenge resulting in a conventional climax. Fine setup becomes repetitious. Directed by Roland Emmerich who made such noise as Independence Day and Godzilla. Gibson becomes known as ""the Ghost"" after he hacks up twenty or so soldiers but it is obvious that he will kick ass on the Colonel in a dense scene lacking any sense of feeling. Superb performance by Heath Ledger as his revenge hungry son whose fate becomes another punch in the face to an audience not in the mood. Joely Richardson is featured as Gibson's wife in what results in the most standard role in the film. Jason Isaacs has the misfortune of portraying a stereotypical Colonel who gets his in the end. Chris Cooper is another fine actor laboring under flat material playing a commanding officer. The film is well made visually but would have been better with a rewrite knocking out the conventions.

","""The Patriot"" is quite an amazing mixture of the best and the worst in a movie. The acting is quite good. Mel Gibson is way better than in Braveheart as he does get to act and not just to do loud screaming, weapon waving and undergo physical and emotional torture. All of his children are excellent as well. And there is quite a bit of good humor and some impressive battle scenes.<br/><br/>However the script is far too predictable and sooo terribly stereotypical and too Hollywoodish. There are a few emotionally overcooked episodes, especially each time Gibson is striken by another tragedy (brrr, and I thought ""Ransom"" was bad!) <br/><br/>
My biggest problem, however, is the unbelievable historical inaccuracy of this movie. Yea, yeah, I know , this is not a documentary and the director should be allowed an ""artistic license"". However, no matter what artistic interpretation of historical facts the director makes, he has to capture the spirit of the time. Otherwise we are treated to a fairy-tale, which is exactly what happened here. In fact the ""Patriot"" is a particularly superficial and shallow fairy-tale.<br/><br/>Why did they have to demonize the British so much and present them as inhuman savages worthy of German Nazis? This was certainly not the case in reality and it was not the ""inhuman atrocities"" of the British Army that drove most Americans to fight in the Revolutionary War. Of course showing the Brits torch a church with the whole village locked inside is much more dramatic than trying to explain the whole ""taxation without representation"" thing! I am neither American nor British (in fact I am from Russia) but this film's treatment of the British seems very much like a slander.<br/><br/>The treatment of slavery in the movie is totally idealistic and has nothing to do with reality. In fact I am surprised that they chose to set the movie in South Carolina which, of all the American states, is the one most responsible for perpetrating the abomination of slavery in America.<br/><br/>
What makes it really bad is that most young Americans are so ignorant of their own history that they are likely to accept the historical caricature of ""the Patriot"" for the real thing.<br/><br/>Having said all of this, I have to confess that I rather enjoyed this movie. So go see it and then read a good history book afterwards!"

","....so this summer, after having seen Gladiator, MI-2, rented The Messenger (Joan of Arc through the sensitive eyes of Luc Besson), we come to see The Patriot. Perhaps it's the cumulative effect of all of the gore of all of these movies, but the final impression this movie makes on me is graphic violence raised to pornographic levels. Mel in the stream, covered with gore, chopping away. Slo-mo Mel being all Indian guerilla and popping lead through peoples heads. Cannon fu, as Joe Bob Briggs would say; knife fu, melted lead soldier fu (that was OK the first time it showed up, but give us a break!), beheading fu, ""lost my leg"" fu. And the final, totally predictable right down to every saber cut and knife thrust, fight with the Evil Brit - for this vengeance we have to wait two hours and wade through buckets of blood and mutilation?<br/><br/>Well, be that as it may, The Patriot is an expertly done piece of work (and if that sounds like damning with faint praise, you have good ears). The battle scenes recall Kurosawa and the director has a great sense of how to tell a story, a non-trivial job given the geographic scope and number of characters. I did like the members of Benjamin's family, and Joely Richardson, WonderBra and all, is convincing as Mel's future wife. And the start of the movie, up to the point past Farmer Martin's ""I won't fight - don't ask me"" speech, is moving and affecting. <br/><br/>But the moment Mr. Jason Isaacs (the head Bad Guy) appears you can pretty much tell what's going to happen right through to the end, (vengeance, baby!) and even though predictability isn't a fatal flaw in a movie, in this case, that plus the decision to never put in an ounce of subtlety, combined with the nauseating level of violence, and the absolute lack of any shades of grey in any important character makes this a loud, long, painful ordeal. This may be the first (and perhaps the last) ever hit movie about the American Revolution, and I'm sure it'll be one of the biggest movies of the year. Like politicians, we get the movies we deserve."

","As a huge fan of braveheart, I was looking forward to this movie for quite a while.  The acting was top notch.  I was very impressed by the acting that some of the kids pulled off, in particular Trevor Morgan (Nathan Martin). Despite the acting, the move as a whole was merely pretty good, and doesn't even come close to the braveheart level.  First off, there are about 5 different subplots that really make the movie into a mess.  The movie is at its best when it focuses on the main plot, and that of course is Mel Gibson seeking revenge.  My major gripe, however, was with the end of the movie. ***Spoiler alert***<br/><br/>Rodat had a great ending on his hands had he only ended the movie five minutes sooner.  The scene on the battlefield showing Mel Gibson about to die at the hands of the man who killed his two sons would have been great had the man killed Mel Gibson.  It would have fit together with the movie as a whole a lot better.  Even though Mel Gibson didn't get to kill him, it doesn't matter because the rebels have won.  It would have underscored Mel Gibson's change of values.  He no longer puts his desires above his ""principles"" as he calls them, but rather his principles above all else. Unfortunately, Rodat goes out of his way to make a feel good ending that doesn't fit with the movie as a whole.  ***End spoiler alert***.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a pretty good movie, and had Rodat changed a few things this movie could have been at Braveheart level.  Unfortunately, Rodat sacrifices quality in order to make sure that the audience leaves with a smile on their face."

","This is one of those films that you feel you have to see.  For those of you with discriminating taste in film, I'm letting you in on a secret: You don't have to see this.<br/><br/>This is a film for a mass audience appeal, not for those of us who want our history and action served to us with a touch of humility and a dash of realism.  This film attempts to capture the feel of two superb films: Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan.  While both were brilliant, and at times understated, this film is never allowed to be either.  Robert Rodat's script is average fair, borrowing heavily from Ryan, Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans.  This script is not terrible, but it is not a stroke of genius. It lacks depth but is full of breadth, trying to do too much in just under three hours.<br/><br/>Still, this movie could have faired better under the supervision of a better director.  Roland Emmerich, who in MHO has not made a good film since Stargate, bungles any of the chance Gibson or Ledger, or even Jason Issacs might have to make this film a classic.  He paces the film poorly, does not allow his characters to become anything more than catalysts for special effects, and leaves the audience wondering if the Brittish were truly that evil.<br/><br/>If you liked U-571 instead of Das Boot, then this might be the film for you. But if you are looking for a classic, go see Gladiator, wait for August 29th for Braveheart on DVD, or purchase Last of the Mohicans.  In those films, I promise you will not be disappointed."

As other people said, it is very much like ""Braveheart"", not only that Mel Gibson was in it, the style of the film was alike. The brutality of the warfare that was fought in the American Revolution was portrayed beautifully in ""The Patriot"". Not only was the style alike, the sounds and screaming of men while the two armies rush at each other with cannons blowing off just feet away. This film makes you think how could men want to go through, watching and killing men in that kind of warfare and all the bravery that took place in the American Revolution.

"dmnkeen","5","0","0","29 January 2001"," A missed opportunity.
","First things first: The Patriot is by no means terrible, but it could have been so great.<br/><br/>Instead of a powerful historical epic which, given its premise, should have been as gut-wrenchingly emotional as Braveheart or as visceral as Gladiator, we have a big budget movie which leaves the viewer surprisingly cold.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is pretty good to start with but then resorts to the old tried and tested formula of self-deprecating action hero a la Lethal Weapon. Heath Ledger makes a pretty strong impression, but like Joely Richardson in a thankless mannequin-type role, is given precious little to do. And as for Jason Isaacs: he has provided us with one of the worst cinematic villains in an age, all flaring nostrils and evil glances. This is a truly awful performance from a normally reliable actor. Only Tom Wilkinson rises above it all in another award-calibre performance.<br/><br/>Historical accuracy and dramatic liberties aside, I can only say that this movie fails because of its director. God only knows what talented screenwriter Robert Rodat's script was like before Roland Emmerich got hold of it, but it's safe to say that Roland is not exactly the right choice to combine human drama and epic sweep into one satisfying whole. He stages the set pieces predictably and with little visual imagination, and he seems more interested in his special effects than in the plight of his characters. Any memorable pictorial flourish is there because of the talented cinematographer, Caleb Deschanel, and not, I believe, because of any directorial insight from this Independence Day and Godzilla hack.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a shame. The Patriot should have been joining the ranks of classic American historical dramas such as Glory and Dances With Wolves. Instead, it just sits there, inert, uninteresting, occasionally striking, but mostly just average.<br/><br/>5/5"

","Good action, good story, good and gory special effects in the battle scenes. It always seemed to me that having men dressed in brightly colored coats with an ""X"" over the center of their chest, firing muskets at each other while standing at point blank range, was a dumb and inhumane way of fighting a war. This movie proves conclusively that the carnage was just as grisly during the Revolution as it was on the beaches of Normandy, man's inhumanity to man just as debased two hundred years ago as it was in the infamous twentieth century. Or maybe it just proves that the technology of war always leads to terrible suffering among the innocent who stand in the way. Some things seemed overstated, however: we know that in France the Nazis locked all the old men, women and children in a town inside the church and burned it with full loss of life, and it stands as a monuments today; but do we know that this was done by the Redcoats during the Revolution? Certainly, it's a first for me, and if untrue a gratuitous insult. Mel Gibson was fine, but maybe after twenty years or so he should try a different film personna.

","If you are looking for indisputable facts and accurate history about the American Revolution, you would do better to pick up a book than to see Roland Emmerich's epic ""The Patriot"".  However, if you're interested in seeing a stirring, beautifully acted entertainment set against the backdrop of America's most cinematically neglected war, you couldn't do better than checking out this film as soon as you can.  <br/><br/>Mel Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin, a veteran of the French and Indian War who has finally put his bloody past behind him (he's a fairly prosperous planter with seven children) when the rebellion against the British intervenes on his idyllic South Carolina life.  Gabriel (Heath Ledger), Martin's oldest son, goes to war against his father's objections; Martin wants peace, and is not willing to sacrifice his family for principles.  But when Gabriel is arrested as a spy, and another son gives his life in trying to free his brother, Martin realizes that the safety of his family and the freedom of his country have become intertwined, and he takes up arms to lead the battle against the redcoats and the evil dragoon (Jason Isaacs) that has taken his child from him.<br/><br/>This is a story rife with primal emotions:  the bonds of family, the tremendous conflict of interest when the personal clashes with the political, the very meaning of freedom, what it takes to earn it, and what it can cost.  Robert Rodat, whose work here I feel surpasses his screenplay for ""Saving Private Ryan"" (that was more of a director's picture, not surprising, considering the director was Steven Spielberg), does not shy away from facing these questions, and from the true horrors of war.  Rodat has become one of our most important historical filmmakers in giving us a chance to step onto the battlefield.  This one is radically different from the muddy beaches of Normandy, and it's stunning to see American blood staining American land.  We often forget what has gone on within our own borders, and this film brings war back home with a vengeance.<br/><br/>Though Rodat's achievement will, I think, surprise no one, I believe everyone will be shocked by the quantum leap which Roland Emmerich makes here (and this is coming from someone who actually admired ""Godzilla"", which I felt was a stylish and effective sci-fi thriller).  Emmerich is not a subtle craftsman, and sometimes his drama proceeds in fits and starts.  But he cannily guides his cast, his staging of the battle scenes is precise and immediate, and his work is most intelligent in that it uses visual pageantry without indulging in it.  There are many beautiful images in the film (Caleb Deschanel deserves kudos for his cinematography), but very few seem put into the film for their own sake; the story is really paramount here, and that is as it should be.<br/><br/>The technical crew does deserve plaudits.  Costume designer Deborah L. Scott follows up ""Titanic"" and ""Wild Wild West"" with another fine piece of period work, and David Brenner's editing of the action is punchy without sacrificing visual clarity (something which the editors of ""Gladiator"" could have paid closer attention to).  John Williams' score is serviceable, but it seems lately that in his desperation to get away from the ""popular composer"" mold, most clearly manifested in his recent scores' lack of definitive ""themes"", he has sacrificed some of the soul of his work.  I wanted a ""Patriot Theme"", and was left with something that sounded a lot like a lot of the stuff he's done lately. <br/><br/>Still, the real laurels on this picture go to the actors; there is not a moment from this cast that lacks effect or conviction.  Heath Ledger brims with the kind of passion that stoked the nation to greatness, Chris Cooper commands the screen with his weary determination, and Jason Isaacs' villainous British officer burns right through you with his blazing, dead eyes.  Still, Mel Gibson IS The Patriot, and he delivers maybe his best performance, full of gentle humor, forthright honor, action prowess, and breathtaking emotion.  It surpasses his work in ""Braveheart"" and stands as a sincere and honest tribute to the type of men who gave their lives in the kinds of battles that Martin wages in their honor.<br/><br/>""The Patriot"" reminds us that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are not just words on an old parchment in the Capitol Building.  They are ideals that young men and old gave their own life and happiness for, and that it is just that we honor that sacrifice by trying to uphold what they died for.  Pretty noble for a Hollywood Fourth of July; if this is the type of stuff we can expect from summer movies to come, it's going to be an awfully good season for film fans from now on."

","If you go to this movie with the aim of being entertained rather than being informed, then it's quite likely you'll enjoy this movie. This was my attitude, and I was not disappointed. As with his other films, Roland Emmerich has created a visually stunning depiction of combat on a large scale with the big screen in mind.<br/><br/>The main reason I was keen to see this film was to see Heath Ledger on screen again, and as Gabriel Martin, he once again does Australia and America proud. ***SPOILER ALERT*** I was quite upset when he had to make an abrupt and gruesome departure before the end!<br/><br/>Mel Gibson was in good form as Benjamin Martin, who becomes something of a ""Lethal Weapon"" again when his family is the target of the brutal Col. Tavington (Jason Isaacs). Indeed, Jason Isaacs was very good in creating a character so loathsome that you find yourself looking forward to his demise.<br/><br/>Above all, I loved the beautiful photography in the film. The film constantly looked great, and the scenes of the Colonials marching into battle against the Redcoats were stirring to see. While the film did have its flaws (Mel Gibson's family and the town folk were all too ""good"" and nice ensuring the audience to sympathise with them regardless of what happened, and Gabriel rousing the church to join him with a rather cheesy patriotic speech of which variations of it have been heard dozens of times before) it did not stop me from getting swept away by the story.<br/><br/>As for the depictions of the British being bad, this isn't really a new concept in American films, it's just that it's more obvious here. ""Gone in 60 Seconds"", ""A Fish Called Wanda"" , even ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" depict America at war with Britain one way or another."

","It's difficult to know where to start in evaluating this film. It is bloody and violent (but so were the times).

The musical score by John Williams seems an overly well-worn rehash of some of his other compositions, namely the soundtracks to ""Star Wars"" and ""Far & Away."" Although the period is, on the whole, faithfully rendered, there are nonetheless some jarring anachronisms. -- Yet, to focus on these elements is to miss the very real power of the central story, not the Revolutionary War per se, but a family drama. Mel Gibson is simply superb as Benjamin Martin, a former fighter in the French and Indian Wars who wants to place his brutal reputation behind him and focus on raising his large family in peace while war swirls around him. Mr. Gibson manages the conflicting emotions of his role with great mastery. Two of his scenes in the movie, quite frankly, moved me to tears. -- In addition, the other roles are well-acted, especially Heath Ledger as Martin's eldest son, and Joely Richardson as Charlotte, the gutsy sister of Martin's late wife.  -- Sadly, it's probably too early to talk about Oscar nominations, but certainly Mel Gibson deserves one for this acting tour-de-force!"

Watching this movie, I was strongly reminded of October (The Ten Days that Shook the World) (1927), directed by Sergei Eisenstein. Both movies only seem patriotic to those who are nationalistic and loyal to the country which the film is about. Outside of this group (and even inside, sometimes), most people find it violent and distasteful. Obviously, the British are not evil people (maybe scientific fact will refute me someday....). It seems unlikely that unrecorded atrocities would occur this frequently localized to a specific area and man. So, I am lead to conclude the evil British were concocted by screenwriters who labeled chapters 1 through 15 of their work, ""Mel bashes this man with an axe because..."" Spike Lee has lamented the movie's lack of regard for Native Americans and slaves. Sorry Spike; you just don't seem to understand that neither group fights with or against Mel Gibson, therefore are unimportant. These groups, historically, are important- but then again, no one picks up on the good teeth, Polyurathane-varnished chairs, very unused looking guns, etc. in this type of movie; and why add subplots to a movie that hardly has plot to begin with?? Despite all of these problems, ""The Patriot"" somehow managed to be enjoyable, if only for the few jokes and many action sequences, though the movie felt as if you should be thinking,""I'm glad I'm American; those British are really evil chaps."" - and I just wasn't."

","After all, what would summer be without blockbuster action movies. We've grown accustomed to it, and ""The Patriot"" fulfills all expectations of the genre: war, carnage, brief romance, and an underdog fighting against insurmoutable odds. Is it a totally realistic depiction of the Revolutionary War? I should hope not, but does it fulfill the summer requirment of being entertaining? I think so. Mel Gibson glibbly and reliably portrays the tormented hero, Heath Ledger gives voice to his eldest son(both having a relationship not unlike that between a master and his pupil as Gibson's Benjamin Martin teaches his son the likes of guerilla warfare), and Jason Issacs has the part of the deliciously wicked Colonel Tavington--commander of the redcoats. Tavington is a cliched villain, it's true, but I think that's a good thing because there is never any doubt that he is evil. In many films, the villain is often portrayed in a semi-heroic light forcing the audience to make a choice between who to root for, but like in all other summer action fair, the choice is simple: evil aliens or humanity? monstrous dinosaurs or amusement park goers? genetically engineered sharks or helpless victims? One shouldn't scrutinize the story, the characters, or their actions too closely--scholastic accuracy was not the point, mindless entertainment was. It's just been moved into a new historic period is all. Truly the best thing about ""The Patriot"" is Tom Wilkinson's performance as the aristocratic General Lord Cornwallis. He alone almost makes one sorry that the British lost the war. If you're looking for a great way to spend 158 minutes, some good action, a cast of delightful actors, and some good old fun then catch ""The Patriot."" It's worth the $8.00.

Here is a man that is dedicated to his job.<br/><br/>Now this is not to say that The Patriot is a sunken vessel.  It is a well-cast, well-directed picture with focus and a duel energy.  Not only are these characters fighting because their families are gone, but if they don't fight now they may lose their country.  Many compare this movie to Braveheart, and that is justified.  It's basically a retread:  Mel Gibson's family is murdered so he starts his own militia to seek revenge, etc.  It was better than Braveheart in that you felt the characters were more driven with their rage in The Patriot, they had more of a reason to be out for blood.  Worse in the sense that The Patriot's romance scenes bordered on cheesy and some of the dialogue from it left something to be desired.<br/><br/>All in all it is a recommendable film.  It seems accurate enough to be shown in a school history class.  There was no sex and no language to speak of, although the violence might be what sends the junior high kid home with a permission slip to be signed by his parent or guardian.  Those who trash the movie are missing the point, I think.  It's not so much about a bloody war movie as it is a story about a man who knows he can't justify his actions and sins, but knows no other way to go about it.<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)"

","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>As far as history went, I was either 20th Century or Medieval. But moving to Boston, and seeing this movie, is starting to change all that. Ok, sure, it was hokey  the whole thing with avenging Thomas' death with a bullet made from the melted lead of his last toy soldier..? Oh, how Perfect but it WAS pretty good (from what I know, anyway, since I just said I don't know much about this period) representation of what war was like, and what ordinary people had to put up with, while a war was going on. We don't get that with 20th Century wars -- they were all fought ""over there"" and not in our front yards (as was a battle in this film). This is like historical fiction - the period depiction is accurate, the people (aside from the obvious famous ones, like Cornwallis) aren't - though they may be based on real people, or reminiscent of real people.<br/><br/>It's not supposed to teach you the Battle for Independence, this movie. It's supposed to make you think about the costs and the rewards of going to war - any war. Sure, the whole race issue was sanitized (did you notice everyone expected the blacks to be able to read, which was illegal? but anyway), and did anyone notice any Native Americans? Because I sure didn't -- they were involved in this war, too. But hey, any movie that can make someone like me, who likes history but never got interested in this era, actually want to do things like follow the Freedom Trail and go to Bunker Hill and look at Paul Revere's house and Ben Franklin's grave, and the tree under which Geo. Washington gathered troops...and listen to the lectures at the monuments (!), that's gotta be a good thing. And really, if you have to have a major holiday blockbuster with action figures and all that...doesn't this beat something like ID4? If I had kids, I'd rather they had ""Patriot"" action figures..."

Laughably bad at points, this cliche-fest seemed to go on forever, with each scene making me more embarrassed for not just walking out of the theatre.  The battle scenes, I must admit, were impressive for the mere scale and volume they achieved, but despite all the sound and fury, they achieved no dramatic tension whatsoever.  As in another of Roland Emmerich's films, Godzilla, the only character who seemed interesting in the least was the ""bad guy"", and even he was so cartoonishly evil he belonged in Rocky and Bullwinkle rather than this."
"Trout-6","Null","0","0","4 July 2000"," I Had Such High Expectations...
","Maybe I shouldn't have.  (CONTAINS SPOILERS)  One can't expect every supposed epic to be one; after all, Kevin Costner did ""Dances with Wolves"" and then ""Waterworld.""  But I did hope for better from Mel Gibson, who had been pretty darned good in ""Braveheart.""  Maybe he should've directed this one, too...no, I don't think that would have helped much.  It was the writing that was most at fault.<br/><br/>I studied about Francis Marion when I was a kid living in South Carolina, and as I knew the movie was based (however loosely) on him I had hopes in that direction too.  Unfortunately I think the only thing they had in common was a residency in the state of S.C. and the last names sounded vaguely similar.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson has made most of his living from playing reluctant heroes, and like his character in Braveheart, this guy only wanted to raise crops and a family; like Braveheart, circumstances brought him into the war.  There were other things stolen from Braveheart, too...the guys running away and leading the soldiers into a trap; stealing the uniforms and using them to fool the bad guys, etc.  Of course the movie doesn't just steal from Braveheart -- I was shocked to see ""the Highlander"" so patently ripped off.  One of Duncan MacLeod's favorite tactics is to kneel, facing away from the bad guy, and then swing around with his sword just as the bad guy steps up for the coup-de-grace.  The climactical riding up with the flag looked like a cross between ""Gettysburg"" and ""Dances with Wolves.""<br/><br/>The movie wasn't all bad.  I liked some of the minor characters, such as the preacher (played ably by Rene Auberjonois, ST:DS9's ""Odo"") who left his church in mid-sermon to join the militia.  I just didn't like the politically correct ""give the girls something to do"" speech made by the teenaged girl that shamed him into it.  I liked the slave who fought for his own freedom, and everyone else's -- but I didn't like the inaccuracy of having most of the blacks in the movie portrayed as freedmen working on the plantations because they earned a good living doing it...let's get real...if they'd all been freedmen, for Pete's sake, there wouldn't have been another war less than 100 years later.<br/><br/>But the things I didn't like outweighed the things I did. One of the things I really hated was having telegraphed punches -- for example, the boy's wedding is so darned happy that one knows quite well something really bad is going to happen.  The bad guy is such a shallow, boo-hiss sort of fellow that as soon as you meet him you know he's going to die slowly and horribly at the hands of the hero.  And the hero himself, a fellow with a ""past"" that tortures him, is a mystery to his son -- who must be brain dead not to grasp the situation after he sees his father become a raging berserker the first time.  I wouldn't have wanted an explanation of the tortured past after seeing that.  And good heavens, in a more modern time Benjamin Martin would've spent a fortune in counseling for the two little boys (pre-teens) who participated in the oldest son's rescue, the scene which shows what kind of character Martin is capable of being.<br/><br/>There's another thing...the clothing, customs (well, some...though why provide a bundling bag and then allow french kissing is beyond me...) are scrupulously recreated but the dialogue is so modern I kept expecting the people to burst into ""wow, that was weird"" or something.  It's as if the movie didn't know what it wanted to be.  It didn't want to be an epic, just a really long movie.  It wasn't like ""Shenandoah,"" about a fellow trying to hold his family together in the face of war, though there were elements of it (too many family elements to be easily kept track of for that matter: the one son acted like he'd be damaged for life but was miraculously normal by the end of the movie; the little girl hated her father and withdrew from his touch and then, with no clue of why she changed her mind --or why she hated him in the first place-- she loved him).<br/><br/>It got confusing -- too many fingers in too many pies. It wasn't an action movie, or a war movie, or a soap, though it had lots of action, war, and lots of soapiness (""I'm not my sister!"") a really patriotic movie; even ""Independence Day"" had more patriotism than this one.  In the motorcycle business there are things called ""parts-bins bikes,"" which are bikes built out of leftover pieces. Some work great (the Yamaha Radian) and some don't work at all.  ""The Patriot"" is a parts-bin movie, and it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>For all one would think the American Revolution would provide a wonderful subject (or even a backdrop) for any movie, the definitive Revolution epic has yet to be made.  It's funny that ""1776"" is still the best movie about the Revolution, because that's the movie no one would want to take seriously.  But its drama is more convincing, language more realistic, and characters more deep and their motivations more understandable -- even in spite of the singing and dancing -- than ""the Patriot"" ever could be."

Mel Gibson's performance as an anguished father was quite believable and his interaction with his children really drew this viewer into the story.  The panoramic shots were spectacular, the battles gory and also glorious when Old Glory leads them into battle.  There were some delightful lighter moments and, in case you didn't already know it, the Williams score let you know when the villain entered the scene.  A must see, but, as with most movies relating to wars, not for the faint of heart and deserving of the R rating for the realistic battle scenes.

","First off, this will contain spoilers. I had high hopes for Patriot, and so I was mildly disappointed. Some scenes just didn't ring true for me. The whole subplot dealing with the lone black man in the cast was just another way to show how honorable Mel's character was. Simplistic dialogue and unrealistic for the time period. Another phony scene is when Gabriel's (Mel's son) honey gives her speech to propel the town's menfolk to take up the fight. Oh, she looks pretty, but the dialogue is lame and her acting worse. It's easy to make comparisons to Braveheart, which is a far better film. The Patriot is no history lesson, and I didn't expect it to be. But, there are enough genuine moments and exciting action sequences to make this a totally watchable film. Granted, all the set pieces are predictable: Son goes after villain, gets killed...father then goes after villian..but the cinematography is gorgeous and Mel holds it all together.<br/><br/>He works well with children. It's difficult when actors become stars to not compare one film to another, or one character to another. Stars become stars playing to their strengths. In one scene in particular, Mel's face is spattered in blood. I couldn't help but think of his painted blue face from Braveheart. Maybe Mel should go for the yellow next time and then he'd have all the primary colors covered. On a final note, the Patriot isn't GREAT movie making, but it's entertaining and even rousing in some scenes."

Francis Marion if anything is a criminal, I'm a citizen of the USA and I'm not afraid to say it. Just because he doesn't have the record to prove it, it doesn't say otherwise, it just means that he is a criminal who is getting away with it. And now with the launching of this movie, it will clearly blind the entire world into thinking that Francis Marion is nothing less than a righteous person which means, this criminal is really getting away with it. This man may have murdered Cherokee Indians by the hundreds maybe even thousands. Even after winning the independence he ruled his province as Governor or some sort with extreme bias. There are obvious reasons why they renamed the main character in the movie from Francis Marion to Benjamin Martin."
"Captain Ed","6","0","0","1 July 2000"," Good entertainment, muddy history ** SOME SPOILERS **
","Having read some of the reviews after seeing the movie, I would say that both the movie and the reviewers are lacking in knowledge of the American Revolution and its tactics.  Does this mean you shouldn't enjoy The Patriot? Absolutely not.  But it does mean that you should read your history to inoculate yourself from its ignorance.<br/><br/>The main character is a blend of two real-life South Carolina heroes, Francis Marion and Daniel Morgan.  Why the filmmakers couldn't just do a movie of Marion, known as the Swamp Fox, is beyond me.  The main antagonist, Colonel Tavington, is apparently supposed to be Banastre Tarleton, a rather obscure British commander whose name is still reviled in the South for his propensity to kill surrendering opponents, among other things.  However, as far as I can tell, he never torched a church, with or without civilians inside.  He often ran afoul of Marion's militia, who were extremely effective in disrupting British communications and were better organized and commanded than Gates' Continentals throughout most of the war.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson, as the blended Marion-Morgan figure Benjamin Martin, is effective in the role of a family man pushed into war by the maltreatment of his family (which didn't occur with either Marion or Morgan).  Mel, please, can we find some other motivation than family members being maimed or killed?  I mean, haven't you pretty much beat that to death in Mad Max, Road Warrior, Lethal Weapon 1 & 2, and Braveheart?<br/><br/>Heath Ledger follows up his good work in 10 Things I Hate About You with an excellent performance here as Martin's son Gabriel.  Chris Cooper is also excellent as a colonel in the Continentals and an old comrade-in-arms. Most of the rest of the cast are solid but not spectacular, and political correctness abounds.  The story gets pretty manipulative at points, but I felt the level of excellence from the featured performers overcomes this. It was very entertaining and I certainly felt it was worth my time (money wasn't an issue -- my son works for the cinema and gets me in for free!).<br/><br/>However, I will warn my British friends that they will NOT like the portrayal of British characters in this film, nor will they appreciate the attribution to them of the very real Nazi atrocity of burning a church down crowded with civilians.<br/><br/>The sad fact is that this unnecessary Hollywood muckraking will ruin this film's ultimate impact, especially since there are plenty of moving episodes in the American Revolution to build a real epic movie on.  History is hard to squeeze into a two-hour format, but making crap up only increases the difficulty.  When you set out to make a movie to remind Americans about the sacrifices our founding fathers endured to give us freedom, showering us with lies only serves to make us feel like fools for buying into it.<br/><br/>One wonders why Gibson wants to keep making films about historical figures that mangle the history that makes them interesting.  One also wonders what project Gibson will take on next where he can fight brutal British tyranny. Unless he decides he wants to make Gandhi II -- He's Back and He's P***ed (apologies to Weird Al), this seems to be his last opportunity."

The only people that have actually said that to me have a.) not seen the film and b.) said it because someone else said it.  Also, to those who said ""Civil War films usually do not do well, dude!"", I say, ""The movie is about the American Revolution, dude!""<br/><br/>Anyhow, getting back on track here, I was very impressed with this film. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have out done themselves.  They've opened the playing field for Centropolis Entertainment by doing something outside the realm of Sci-Fi.  The cinematography was just beautiful, the cast was ""right on"", and altogether, the film makes you loose track of time.  ""That was 3 hours?  No way!""  I heard some people of my generation outside the theater say that the movie was too long.  The people of my generation have a short attention span, folks.  I think we've passed ""Generation X"" and went strait to the ""A.D.D. Generation.""  This film was not too long, nor was Green Mile for that matter!  You can't get the overall point of the film in an Mtv ""Buzz Clip"" format.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson does a fantastic job (of course), and Heath Ledger is well on his way to becoming a huge success in the States, as well as world wide.  Watch for him.  Seriously!  Lisa Brenner was a nice addition to the silver screen as well.  Aside from the fact that she is just CUTE, she can win your heart with a smile and her big eyes!  She didn't get too much film time in The Patriot, but she will, and it will be worth it!<br/><br/>Brief description:  As I'm sure you all know by now, Mel Gibson plays Ben: a widower and a father of 6 or 7 children living in South Carolina in 1776. He used to be a ""Red Coat"", but has since then retired due to a dark secret plaguing him.  Despite Ben's vocalized opposition to war, his oldest son Gabriel, played by Heath Ledger, defies his father's demands and joins the war against England.  After many tragedies suffered by Ben's family in this time of war, he joins his son in the war to protect him.  Although I wish to stop here and not give you the entire film, I will tell film is more than just about Ben and Gabriel.  The movie runs much deeper than that.  I will leave you to find your own truths.<br/><br/>To sum up:  Good script, good acting, and good time!  Any one who even remotely enjoys films, should see this one.  Don't wait for video.

The acting was superb.  Mel Gibson (Benjamin)was stellar as a revolutionary war hero, striking emotion straight into the heart and mind of the viewer.  Heath Ledger stole the show as Ben's son Gabriel. The flow of his acting style never falters.  These two fine individuals did an amazing job with a worn-over script that should have hit the dirt hours ago.  Even the villain, in particular Jason Issac, was incredible.  Not many actors can take a role so vile and conniving and evoke such emotion to keep one satisfied.  And talk about support!  The children, in particular the two sons and the youngest daughter, exceptionally livened up the show.  I can't wait to see more films with the bravado these talented thespians exalted.  Now, the downers...Yes, some parts of the show were unrealistic, and fine detailing such as better attention to the era historically or even more English accents would have been appreciated.  Many parts were predictable, but I suppose most movies are nowadays.(One thing that did surprise me was how the Frenchman didn't criticise Benjamin's French oratory skills!) The love-story element was there, but at least they didn't go overboard with it.  The bloodiness could have been lessened, but war isn't exactly squeaky clean. Also if anyone came out hating the British after seeing the movie, I think you missed the point...the director did attempt to show conflict over the issues concerning and surrounding the war.  This sadly was not done to perfection as it very well could have been.  However, ""The Patriot"" remains basically an action movie with a message.  After seeing this movie I had something to talk about, which is more than I can say for the plethora of dull, quick money films the industry has wheeled out lately.  I'd give it an 8 for effort."

Not only is the movie historically accurate, it nails the source material. Gibson's character is based on the famous Swamp Fox, and plays the part perfectly. What makes his character unique is that he is human, and is flawed. The action sequences are well timed, and are not there just to keep the bored viewers entertained. I have seen this movie five times, four of which came from school. Every year in American government, we watched this film as a reminder of what history was like, and the people who fought for our freedom in the events leading up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

Whenever a Hollywood production is released, there must be drama, a protagonist as well as an antagonist, a hero and a villain. It must be a spectacular rendition of the story it tells and to remove the spectacle is to gamble with the Box Office returns. Benjamin Martin (M. Gibson) may be depicted as a ""larger than life"" figure, but isn't that the whole point of making a film, to elicit some emotion? As far as exaggeration is concerned, according to a previous review of the ""rescue"" scene, the reviewer seems to be the only one exaggerating.

He was a good villain. Without such good villains some movies seems incomplete. The patience of Benjamin is fantastic. Imagine yourself: Your son is killed but you taking no action at that moment. Benjamin waits for the good moment. The best scene that draws attention to itself is when: The dozen Redcoats approach, leading Gabriel on the rope. Marion waits in the thick undergrowth. On the hillside, Nathan and Samuel grip their muskets and exchange a frightened, troubled look. Marion waits, and then picks his moment and FIRES, killing the Redcoat Lieutenant with a shot to the chest. Marion runs to the wounded Redcoat, grabs his hair, yanks back his head and SLITS HIS THROAT. Then, without pausing, Marion wrenches the tomahawk from the Redcoat's body, and races back toward his sons. In a word, I recommend watching it. For approving of all this word is Oscar which was awarded."

","Sigmund Freud interpreted hysterical symptoms as part of the working out of repressed childhood memories. Someone pointed out that being sick also got you a lot of sympathy and attention. Freud -- no sociologist -- dismissed all that as ""secondary gains."" This movie, for all its epic sweep, doesn't really deal with freedom from King George's sometimes whimsical rules for the colonies. <br/><br/>It's the story of the rebels' revenge on the British redcoats who are snobs and sadists. Independence, freedom, representation -- all that nonsense is a secondary gain compared to the motive to kill certain individuals who have harmed the militia. It might as well be a Western, with the redcoats as Indians, except that here it's the colonials who use sneaky tactics and the Brits who march around in loud jackets in the open, inviting attack. I don't know why it's called ""The Patriot"" because patriotism has little to do with it. <br/><br/>The writers and producers always have to handle the Revolutionary War very carefully. After all, Americans and Brits have been allies in any number of wars, large and small, and have generally supported one another since 1812, when those damned sons of Albion burned down the White House in Washington. Maybe that's why there are so few movies about the Revolutionary War. Classics like James Fenimore Cooper's ""Last of the Mohicans"", John Ford's ""Drums Along the Mohawk"", and John Wayne's ""Allegheny Uprising,"" are all about the French and Indian wars, known in Europe as the Seven Years War.<br/><br/>The Americans at that time weren't Americans yet, just overseas British citizens. We avoid Revolutionary War stories because the mental gears begin to grind and a lot of cognitive dissonance is stirred up. The result is discomfiting. It's good that we don't have to extend this cinematic tenderness doesn't apply to the Germans or Japanese. If Hollywood had to do that, it would mean an end to war movies.<br/><br/>The film itself is rather routine, though colorful and filled with action and sentiment. Splendid scenery. Many slow-motion deaths, a hoary cliché long before this came out. There are good people and there are evil people. All the colonists are good. The Brits as a whole aren't really bad, just one or two rotten red astrachans in that crimson barrel. Tom Wilkinson as General Cornwallis (Kids: he was a British soldier) is perfect in the role. He plays it in the way of classic English actors, projecting thoughts and emotions without carrying on about them. He's been splendid elsewhere too, a fine actor.<br/><br/>Poor Jason Isaacs is the sadistic officer, tolerated but not approved of by Cornwallis. He has the coldest blue eyes known to man or beast, except for those of my ex spouse. I believe make up has clipped off his eyelashes to make his icy irises stand out more ominous, as in a comic book. He may be a good actor too but there's no way to tell because the script has him trapped in a swampy stereotype. Everything he does is pure e-vil. Why, man, he burns down churches full of innocent civilians! Burning a church is one thing, but with the whole congregation locked inside? He gets his comeuppance in the movie, which his real life counterpart never did. The real guy went on to serve in parliament and died in 1833.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is okay as the Homeric hero, wielding his tomahawk, teaching the farmers how to shoot and run away, to set traps for the enemy -- but no useless slaughter. He was never a very expressive actor but he's reliable enough and easy to identify with if you're as handsome and well built as he and I are.<br/><br/>The locations are splashy and evocative, nicely photographed. The sentimentality is less than I'd expected. I got rather a kick out of it, even though it was thoroughly predictable, right down to the smallest incident. If you enjoyed ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" you'll like this too, bloodier though it is."

"spydergoulash","1","2","5","22 January 2008"," Slanted, jingoistic, and just plain bad
","Top ten reasons this movie offends me 1. Historically inaccurate historical films are to be expected, but if I'm going to be so badly misled about how my country began, I don't want an Aussie doing it to me. 2. Sensationalized villains are to be expected in all shoot-em-up movies (and that's all this movie is, at best) but a war movie in which every single redcoat is willing to burn down churches filled with women and children is a joke. 3. Beatified heroes are to be expected in all braindead action movies (don't call it a historical epic- the term implies at least a single scrap of fidelity to the truth, which this movie eschews), but one in which all Americans are lay-down-your-life for the next guy heroes is a joke. 4. Suspension of disbelief is expected in all works of fiction, but even a moron could not suspend enough disbelief to choke down this hogwash. 5. Mel Gibson is the director, and plays the starring role as a South Carolina Plantation owner that does not own slaves. What a joke. 6. The blacks who work on Gibson's plantation love their jobs, and are willing to fight for the America that will hold their brethren in slavery in all the plantations next door to them. I find this deeply offensive. 7. What a wasted opportunity for real moral thought in a historical movie. Our revolution raises real issues about freedom and slavery, loyalty and independence. Someone who actually cared about the truth, and about moral quandaries, could have made a really good movie here- the movie I was hoping to see when I went into the theater that day. Instead I got Mel Gibson reducing our great history into a piece of propaganda (and dumb propaganda at that). It's like using a roller to put a new paint job on a classic rolls royce. 8. Little-known fact: every single historian who served as a consultant in this movie demanded to have their name removed from the credits after seeing the final print, in order to not ruin their academic reputation. 9. Gibson went on to make another movie about another important moment in history you may have heard of. I have not seen that movie. I was told it was good. It might indeed have been a good movie. But how can you believe it? This movie showed such flagrant disregard for objective truth that it undermines his credibility in everything else he makes of similar genre. How could I possibly believe that Mr. Gibson would make a true movie about Jesus if he did this to the history of my country? As R.W. Emerson said, ""who you are shouts in my ears so loudly that I cannot hear what you say"". This movie shouts that Gibson is a liar. 10. Gibson had already made a historical movie before this one. It was called ""Braveheart"". I really liked it. I even became curious about William Wallace, the hero depicted, about whom I knew nothing (like all Americans, really- for us, Wallace was not really a significant historical figure). But looking back at that movie, it's now clear to me that it followed the exact same formula- all Scotsmen are good, all Englishmen are bad, Gibson is a superstud, the bad guys lack a single shred of goodness-- your basic simplistic action movie that takes the easy way out every time the thinking and moral reasoning gets tough. Just like ""The Patriot"". So basically, ""The Patriot"" is a movie that is so bad that it can ruin other movies- it ruined ""Braveheart"" by showing an easily fooled moviegoer that a movie he thought was good actually wasn't, and it ruined ""Passion"" without my ever having seen it, because, after seeing this, I cannot trust Gibson to tell the truth about anything that matters. And the life of Jesus matters. So I will learn about it from someone I know will tell the truth."
"behoff","Null","2","5","20 November 2007"," The Patriot
","The Patriot depicts the American Revolutionary War. Benjamin Martin, played by Mel Gibson, was a previous war hero who promises he will not be involved in the war, although many people try to talk him into it. He claims his reasoning for not joining is because his wife had just died, and he had seven children he needed to take care of. He does end up joining the war for many reasons, mostly to fight for the freedom of his children. The move takes many twists, including the death of Benjamin's two sons, one of his son's falling in love, and many more. Through the movie, Colonel Tavington develops a hatred for Benjamin Martin because of his fighting technique. Through the many battles and all the action throughout the movie, it ends with an extensive fight between two of the stars. My personal views on this movie are it is the best war movie I have seen. The acting in this movie is second to none, and the story line is great. I like that the movie lets the viewers think it is going to be another pure action packed movie, although it does throw a curve ball in when Benjamin's oldest son falls in love. The love scenes, although a little boring, make the movie better because it does give a pause between all of the action. Another thing that makes this movie above average is the gore in the action scenes. In one of the battles, a cannon ball completely knocks one of the soldier's heads off, and in another battle scene, the cannon ball rolls on the ground taking off many soldiers' legs. After all the action, love, and gore is gone, another thing that makes this movie great is the suspense. The suspense created between the fight of Benjamin and Colonel Tavington. You can feel the hate between the two, and the final big fight of the movie has a long fight between the two, having Tavington eventually die. Mel Gibson's performance in this movie was great. The movie reminded me of a modern day ""Brave Heart"" because the story line and the action. The movie is not necessarily based in the same time ""Brave Heart"" is but the story line is similar I feel because it depicts a guy leading many to do what is right rather than what is expected. The movie not just a pure action thriller, it does have a plot, and it does have twists. The movie is also correct in the dress, talk, and fighting technique. The fighting style with the two armies walking towards each other face to face taking each other is correct for the time. Also, another part of the movie that sticks out to me is the way Benjamin Martin went about attacking the British. The British did not know how to react because he did not fight them face to face. He would hide! He and his men would never show their faces, and I think that was key to their success. Some critics will say this movie is long and drawn out and overall gets boring. Well, I feel this is untrue because frankly the action and story line. If you do not enjoy the ""older"" style of fighting, then those critics may be correct, and you may think this is a boring movie, although if you like the revolutionary style of life, fighting, and survival then I think you would enjoy it. This is a great movie because of these reasons, and I highly advise you to watch it."

","When i saw this movie the first time i was truly touched at the remarkable portrayal of the lead character Benjamin Martin by the limitless talents of Mel Gibson. brave heart was still better in some ways but this film took the tops in a few ways of its own. forget about how totally accurate this movie may have been historically speaking because when it comes to an action movie, this film i believe more than makes a place for itself. <br/><br/>The most movings moments of the entire film above and beyond all the others for me were the moment where he is trying to save his oldest son, then his next oldest son Thomas tries to save his captured brother Gabriel. colonel William Tavington of the British army takes it upon himself to shoot his son. Mel Gibson falls to his knees and catches him before he falls. the next thing you see as his son dies in his arms is that when Mel Gibson looks up at the colonel and says he was a stupid boy. you can see by the look in the eyes of Mel Gibson ""THIS IS WAR"" he forgets all about his wanting to forget his past, trying to hide from what he knew he had done. but no longer. <br/><br/>he took two of his three remaining sons and using his knowledge of the area he beat the British to the spot where they would cross. he and his sons attacked without warning. they started shooting. but once he was out of bullets he charged in with a knife and a Cherokee tomahawk. this was the most moving moment of this film not because of the motives, or any reason other than when Mel Gibson is fighting hand to hand with trained, armed and dangerous men and slaughters them. his sons watch in horror that the peaceful and loving father they knew could be capable of such atrocities. all of them are dead but one who holds a knife to his son Gabriel's neck. Benjamin martin takes aim with his tomahawk, he sinks it into the mans forehead. suddenly out of the blue a British soldier tries to get up and run. Mel Gibson drops him by the creek by retrieving his tomahawk from the last victim. then when you think that most movies would stop so those week stomached people who complain even in war films that ""theres too much violence."" well i give my thanks and applause to the film makers and most of all to Mel Gibson for this moment of the film as well as the film in general. he unleashes his rage for the loss of his son and for them bringing him into the war from what he had tried to leave behind...that war hungry monster within. he chops away at the man who lies helpless in agony as he unleashes that fury, with each chop he is covered in blood. his children watch from afar and watch him fall part. and like most people would in real life while that rage takes place that softer side comes out and he breaks down. i have only a few times in my life seen acting of such skill, and of all those more than half of those incredible moments were performed by Mel Gibson. <br/><br/>the reason i take so much time to recall that moment is because i never took movies seriously for the most part because they never were taken serious in a lot of cases of what could have made them incredible movies. this is one exception of only a few that i call perfect. this film shows you a glimpse of life in the colonies, the battles our American people fought so hard to win. the start and end of the war. brilliant acting, war, friendship, leadership, inspiration, patriotism. this film brought all that and more to the screen. if i wore a hat any day i would tip my hat to the makers of this film, and those who made it happen. if more movies were taken to such an extent of acting regardless of historical acting i think a lot more movies would be better for it. one of Mel Gibson's finest moments. hands down 10/10 two thumbs up."
"UACW","Null","2","5","4 September 2006"," Braveheart USA
","So Rolle's made more than Stargate, ID4, and Godzilla! And it's a nice cast too. Jason Isaacs takes the bad guy to a new level, paralleling Alan Rickman at his sleaziest and putting so much creepiness into the role - a method of portrayal far from what Max von Sydow does for example. Joely Richardson is excellent, as is Heath, as is Tom Wilkinson in a small role. And the music by John Williams, usually horrible, is almost palatable, save for the fact he seems to be plagiarising a lot of Xmas songs.<br/><br/>And you might wonder what for all the blood and gore or what it all is supposed to be about, for it surely doesn't make sense on any level, but then you'd be begging the obvious, for in the lead role you have the person who makes it all fall apart.<br/><br/>It's just impossible to watch a movie with that creep anymore and come away feeling good and not totally disgusted."
"rochvelleth","10","2","5","6 August 2006"," Exciting and emotional adventure, long but worth sticking with (one very tiny spoiler within)
","The Patriot is a very good film. It has what I think of as cinematic integrity. When you first watch it, you will spend at least half an hour (it's 2hrs30ish long) thinking it really isn't progressing fast enough and you don't want to know why Mel Gibson cares so much about rocking chairs. But bear with it, because it's exciting and emotional and worth watching.<br/><br/>Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a widower looking after seven children and being a peaceful family man when the American war of Independence is on the verge of breaking out; he does however have a good military reputation for some atrocities he now regrets committing during the French and Indian Wars. His oldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), joins up to fight for freedom, and then the next son is desperate to do so, and here the action begins.<br/><br/>I won't reveal the plot from here, because it's worth just being surprised by stuff that happens. But there are some things that should be highlighted, the first of which is the very good acting. Jason Isaacs makes a very good and completely amoral villain called Colenel Tavington (occasionally overacted but mostly very good), who manages to persuade General Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson, wonderful) that brutality can be a good idea sometimes. Gibson is outstanding - there is one point where he cries for a reason I won't reveal because it would spoil it, and if you're soft-hearted like me it's impossible not to start crying with him. Ledger is also very good and there's a very sweet romance between Gabriel and his sweetheart, Anne. One of the best things is the Martin children, though some of them are a little underused.<br/><br/>The second thing to say is that, on the subject of cinematic integrity, this is a film that doesn't shy away from bad things happening. A lot of bad thing happen, and people die and people are upset over it and sometimes it's quite depressing (this isn't spoilerish - I didn't tell you *who* dies!). This sense of gloom makes the stirring ideas about freedom and patriotism all the more potent - it's a time that Americans are proud to remember, and rightly so. This isn't about modern patriotism, however much the film's distributors might have had this in mind - it's much more relevant in the sense that it portrays that period in history with great skill.<br/><br/>What I was most impressed by was the attention paid to emotions in the film. Gibson was excellent in conveying anger (with a tomahawk) and grief and did a wonderful job of playing a complicated family man with a past and priorities. There are a number of very poignant scenes, going together to make the atmosphere very affecting. Another gem was the youngest daughter, Susan, who begins the film not speaking, and when she starts speaking still refuses to talk to her father - but, in a very poignant moment that *always* makes me cry, she runs after him shouting, ""Daddy! Please don't go! I'll say anything if you don't go!"" The film has something for everyone - excitement, adventure, pathos, moral reasoning.<br/><br/>Excellent film, and always a joy, if a slightly depressing one, to watch. Slow in places, but it more than makes up for this in excitement, depth and raw emotion."
"ksundstrom","5","2","5","12 December 2005"," Violence debauches the War of Independence
","A well made action film to please all those who like Mel Gibson's style and his full throttle action. The film fits in to his search for ultimate violence, from the Mad Max trilogy, through the Lethal Weapon series, then The Patriot and finally the ultimate excess in The Passion of Christ where violence thrusts shatteringly deep in to the heart and soul of the viewer, adding little except possibly rekindling the curiosity to know more about Christianity in the Bible. The Patriot fails miserably as a historical film as it warps and lies about people and events in the American War of Independence. For instance: Why lie about the English general Cornwallis as a person who condoned atrocities? Why insert a bestiality which did not occur in the war but in Europe from Nazi actions in the Second World War (burning inhabitants of whole villages in churches, to name just one example from France Odour-sur-Glane, 642 inhabitants, men, women and children burnt in the church and shot in barns by SS Das Reich, 10 June 1944)? Vote 4 out of 5 for the action and pace, 1 for the somewhat distorted role of the Militias and 0 for the history which should have been the most absorbing part."

","I expected this to be a good war film, and it had excellent reviews. Unfortunately, this wasn't to my taste. I wasn't pleased at all...<br/><br/>Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a hero from a previous war, but having lost his wife and with seven children to look after, he is reluctant to get involved in the American war for independence. However when one of his children is killed in the conflict and his home is set on fire by the British, he reluctantly joins the Continentals in battle.<br/><br/>He sets up his own militia army which brings fear to the British by fighting dirty and ambushing them in the woods rather than fighting them like gentlemen on the battlefields. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson portrays Benjamin properly, and Heath Ledger is perfectly watchable, although he has chosen the wrong movie to start his 'blockbuster' career. The battle scenes are well-filmed and all, but the history is inaccurate and the story is a shambles, moving at the pace of a turtle's walk. This and Godzilla all tells us Roland Emmerich obviously has trouble making a good movie. This could've made up for his past mistakes, but it is an addition to his list of awful films.<br/><br/>Over-long and boring at 160 minutes, The Patriot is an overrated and effortless attempt a blockbusting war film. <br/><br/>I rate The Patriot 5 out of 10."
"baumer","8","2","5","30 June 2000"," Mel, swords, bloodshed and those damn English!
","Films about war are always full of inacuracies.  They have to be.  When you have a hero with the face of Mel Gibson or perhaps Sylvester Stallone ( when he was big )or whomever, you are vying for box office dollars in a crowded market.  So you are appealing to the masses, and in this case, the masses are Americans and the timing is the Independence Day weekend.  Does it really matter how accurate this film is?  Does it really matter if it shows the Americans as nothing but brave patriots that are only interested in becoming independent?  Does it really matter if most of the English in this film are nothing more than blood-thirsty mongers that want to burn, and plague everything in their path?  <br/><br/>Of course not.  And I could really care less either.  This is the summer season and in the summer, in the big picture, all I ask to be is entertained.  I am not here for a history lesson nor do I care if this is nothing more than a xenophobic account of what may or may not have really happened to my neighbours to the south.  I want to sit in the theater and suck back a Coke, devour some M&M's and be entertained.  And so far, with average efforts like Shaft, MI2, Shanghai Noon and abyssmal ones like Battlefield Earth, the market and the fans, people like me, are ready to enjoy some ass kicking, and some entertaining ass kicking.  Mel Gibson and Roland Emmerich provide that here.<br/><br/>The Patriot is a simple enough story about a great war hero from the years past that has hung up his musket and sword and wants to raise a family.  He has done some heinous things in the past that he is obviously not proud of and he has a terrible and imminent fear that his sins are going to come back to haunt him.  The United States has decided to go to war with England for it's freedom and it's independence.  But William.... I mean Benjamin wants no part of it.  His oldest son, Gabriel, (in an amazing performance by Heath Ledger from 10 Things I Hate About You) is eager to join the battle.  Soon after, he returns home with battle wounds and Benjamin is tending to both countries wounded on the porch of his house.  It is then that Col. William Tavington comes along, and for reasons unknown, except that he is a sadist, decides to take Gabriel hostage and then hang him, kill all of the American wounded, burn down Ben's house and then he kills one of his younger sons. Quite a guy this Tavington is.  This, of course, gets Benjamin into the war. And it is this next scene that is one of the best battle scenes I have ever seen.  Benjamin and two of his young sons attack and kill the men that are taking Gabriel hostage.  The battle is great because the men that are being hunted and killed are not cartoon characters that pop out of nowhere only to die.  They are young, scared, boys, following orders and are just on the wrong side of the war.  You see the fear, the anguish and the sheer horror on their face as they are about to die patriotically.<br/><br/>The rest of the film has a few minor sub-plots of love and other boring stuff that only serves as a purpose so that when someone's wife or girlfriend dies, it gives the men a chance to seek vengence.  But the real highlight of the film is the battles.  They are bloody and brutal and I enjoyed them immensely.  When a cannonball is launched and it takes off legs and heads, it gives you the proper perspective of war.  It is just enough to remind us that as much as we are enjoying this ""film"", these events really did take place and just like Saving Private Ryan, they were brutal and final.  This is not like Commando, when Arnold mows down 95 men with an M-16 and they drop like flies.  This is violent, nasty and bloody.<br/><br/>The Patriot may be liked by Americans because it is about their fight for independence.  It may be liked by them because it shows how they fought for what they have.  It be liked by them because it shows how proud they are of what they had and what it took to get it.  <br/><br/>I like it because it is fun, entertaining and it is a great summer flick. That's all.  Nothing more and nothing less.  I'm very glad this film was made because here we are, now heading into July 1st, Canada Day, and so far this summer, we have had one amazing film (Gladiator), one truly hilarious film (Road Trip), two moderately funny films (Me Myself and Irene, Big Mommas House) and a slew of okay films (take your pick).  The Patriot won't top Gladiator as the best of the bunch so far, but at least it can be mentioned in the same breath.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

So the character of Francis Marion is whitewashed to be all sweetness and light, no mention of his racism, and brutality. In contrast the British are heartless, war criminals just too incompetent and wicked to be believable.

The pain and suffering which brought these people to the point of revolution, and which made the war itself so horrible, was perfectly portrayed.<br/><br/>Many may say that the monstrous things, the dishonourable things we saw in this film never happened, that they were devices to make us hate the bad guy more.  But the fact is, innocents were killed for no other cause than aiding their fellows.  Townspeople WERE burned alive in churches for aiding the rebels.  It was NOT a polite war.<br/><br/>In an age where we take our many and precious freedoms wholly for granted, when we believe that our very liberty is a God Given right, we need to be reminded that God Given or not, it was won for us, and to this day continues to be guarded for us, by men and women who are willing to sacrifice their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honours."

","If you want to watch a politically correct retelling of the American revolution, with exaggerated British atrocities, with horrible acting (except for the British villain),then this is the film for you. I'm not an expert on acting, but even to me this was hard to take. I couldn't believe it was rated 7.1 when I viewed it. Women lecturing men on the philosophies of declaring freedom and fighting for it. Blacks accepted as equals and fighting side-by-side in the militia (if you look closely, there's even a black soldier in the *British* regular army's front line at the start of the last battle). The dialog sounded like something from Father Knows Best. 2 hours and 15 minutes of it! Beautiful costumes and scenery, engaging musical score, but overall insulting to your intelligence."

"anselmdaniel","6","2","6","25 December 2018"," A silly historically inaccurate movie
","This review contains spoilers<br/><br/>The Patriot is a historical war movie that premiered in 2000. The movie is directed Roland Emmerich and written by Robert Rodat. The movie is set during the American Revolution in 1776. The movie follows Benjamin Martin, played by Mel Gibson. The movie is from the American point of view as the American revolution erupts.<br/><br/>The Patriot absolutely fails as a historical film. This movie is rife with historical inaccuracies. These historical inaccuracies continue to pile on and it comes to a time that shows the movie as an incompetent mess when it comes to historical research. One of the mistakes is that the movie frequently demonizes the British antagonists. The movie culminates in a scene where a church full of American residents are burned by the British. This scene should never have happened. If such an event had happened in history, this event would have been a massive rallying cry for colonials. The movie also paints the French as less helpful than they really were. The French help is simply glossed over until the end of the movie. The movie does these things to glorify the colonials and the United States of America instead of being truer to history.<br/><br/>History aside, the movie can be entertaining to watch. The action scenes feel authentic. The effects are good for its time and they still hold up today. These work to the movie's benefit as the scenes are fun to watch. The audience must turn their brain off to enjoy the movie. The British are portrayed as cruel and sadistic soldiers that it ultimately becomes laughable. The United States are portrayed as noble heroes and are ultimately shown to prevail despite all odds.<br/><br/>The movie does present its war scenes well. The movie feels epic as it shows various battles. for American independence. I wish the movie focused more on these specific battles or even only a subset of the battles rather than all of the war for independence. It would have been more fulfilling to watch a more researched movie than something that only scratches the surface of the entire war. This is however the reason why the movie is meant to be so casual. It is a mainstream Hollywood movie that simply uses its tropes to drive the narrative. Luckily the movie is not boring, but it could have been so much more than what the audience sees here.<br/><br/>The Patriot is not recommended. This movie feels like it could have been so much more. It also presents itself as a historical movie but has so many inaccuracies.<br/><br/>Grade: D"
"Leofwine_draca","7","2","6","6 October 2016"," Yeah, I thought it was good - AND I'm a Brit
","Mel Gibson's second stab at fighting the British follows on the success of BRAVEHEART for a historical epic that feels both similar and different to the Scots blockbuster. Once again, Gibson plays a family man who has no interest in war and fighting who faces personal loss and turns into a vengeance-fuelled fighter determined to make the enemy pay for their actions. THE PATRIOT doesn't have the scope, drive or excellent scenery of BRAVEHEART, but it is still a very well made movie. Despite the three hour running time the story is never less than engaging and the focus on an individual family (with the War of Independence as the background) makes it more than watchable.<br/><br/>I watched this on my Blu-ray player and was struck by the quality of the visuals and the excellent scope of the battle sequences. While not particularly gory, the bouts seem brutal and realistic, with the kind of money behind them to make them feel authentic (something the low-budget SHARPE adventures that ITV made could never achieve). Still, this isn't really an action or war film per se, and for the most part we stick with Gibson and either his family members or his men (there's a Robin Hood feel to the militia as they hide out in the swamps from the enemy).<br/><br/>One of the things that makes it so watchable is Gibson himself, reaching new levels of emotion as the guy struggling with overwhelming loss and his desire for revenge. He's backed up by a stalwart cast, with fine turns from Chris Cooper, Joely Richardson, Tcheky Karyo, and Rene Auberjonois as his allies and Tom Wilkinson and Jason Isaacs as the dastardly British. To be, the script isn't perfect, and historical accuracy is low on the list of priorities (the church burning never happened – at least in this war – while Benjamin Martin was far from the clean-cut good guy he's made out to be here). Nevertheless this is director Roland Emmerich's most mature and accomplished film, an old-fashioned war epic full of entertainment."
"ElMaruecan82","8","2","6","15 August 2013"," Following ""Braveheart"" to the ""Indepedence Day"" ...
","When the director of ""Independence Day"", the screenwriter of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the hero of ""Braveheart"" work together, a result like ""The Patriot"" isn't surprising. The summer 2000' blockbuster is a flamboyant, heavily patriotic epic relating the war between the Continental Army and the Loyalists to the British Crown, and the British Redcoats. The central figure of this American Revolution is Benjamin Martin, who couldn't have had a better incarnation than Mel Gibson, the eternal hero of 'David vs. Goliath' causes.<br/><br/>There' such sincere poignancy in Gibson's performance that he carries the whole film with the same confidence and pride as if it was the stripes and stars banner. In fact, the same film without him would have lost half of its effect; the role was tailor-made for Mel Gibson. And ""The Patriot"" has the perfect mix of action (the battles are as gruesome and realistic like ""Braveheart"") and emotion. I even wonder why the film didn't get as many accolades as ""Braveheart"" or its rival of the same year ""Gladiator"", both have their share of thrills, Gibson had nothing to envy on Russel Crowe, much more his archenemy, played by Jason Isaacs, is probably the only villain to match Joaquin Phoneix on the field of awfulness.<br/><br/>Action and sentimentality indeed, the film was both spectacular and surprisingly moving. It's like ""The Patriot"" tried to embody the two pillars of patriotism, muscle and heart: we fight for the country, but there's no fight without a heart to drive the spirit. We got the message on ""Saving Private Ryan"" but Mel Gibson's presence is here to remind us that the film borrows more from ""Braveheart"" than Spielberg's WWII epic. The comparison with ""Braveheart"" is even more inevitable because the enemy is the same, only this time, they're not incarnated by their king, but by one colonel, who's not less ruthless and cruel, but you can tell, they wanted to avoid attacks on historical accuracy, by showing that not all the English acted that way.<br/><br/>But Emmerich isn't a man of restriction and wisely enough, wouldn't trade thrills for objectivity, and Lord knows a movie like ""The Patriot"" couldn't have afforded objectivity. The more hateful the antagonist is, the more you support the hero, and even if he fights for a just cause, it's for the hero we care. We cared for Scots because it was William Wallace's people, not because we were eager to support them, the same goes for Americans. Granted they're the good guys in the film, but it's their personification by Gibson that creates our empathy, and it works precisely because he is unenthusiastic about the Revolution. This reluctance echoes the same plot of ""Braveheart"" when Wallaces states he doesn't believe in violence, but making violence undesirable doesn't prevent it from happening. <br/><br/>You know the rule, there are two ways to die in Mel Gibson's films, to be family or wife (he played widowers in more than 15 films, including the 'Lethal Weapon' and 'Mad Max' series) or kill his family or wife. That's the trigger to awaken the fierce beast and reopen the concealed wound. Benjamin Martin, the ex-veteran of the French and Indian war, coerced by his comrade and friend Chris Cooper to vote for the levy to support the Continental War, refuses first because he's got seven children and ""can't afford principles"". It doesn't take much for a movie fan to guess what kind of action will definitely make any English soldier an enemy for a man who adores his children more than anything. It even subtly questions the roots of a patriotism which is less made of abstractions, but as a sort of society's collective dream starting on its core: family.<br/><br/>But that's it, with Mel Gibson, no matter how predictable a plot point is, the acting wins our hearts, and it's impossible to resist to his on-screen charisma. What follows the turning point is a magnificent display of bestial savagery, but just because we root for the father as we despise the villain, just because Colonel Tavington (Isaacs) killed his son and ordered the soldiers to shoot the wounded Continentals, we savor the first vengeance. Watching the 'tomahawk ambush' isn't a sadistic delight, but the emotionally satisfying pay-off of a patient build-up and the sign of even more thrilling sequences to come. And still, ""The Patriot"", and that's why I enjoyed it more than ""Gladiator"", doesn't overplay the 'serious' card, this is not just an action film, there are characters, there is a spirit, and even some with guiding the action.<br/><br/>Indeed, there are many cute and moving moments that would have felt awkward in other typical action films, a sweet romance between Benjamin's idealistic son Gabriel, played by a young Heath Ledger and a sweet courageous girl whose father's deafness creates some funny moments. There is a subplot involving two stolen dogs, Martin's cute little girl who never spoke since the death of Martin's wife and who's responsible for a particularly moving scene (again, we know she will speak but it doesn't make her shining moment any less powerful). There is also the solid supporting presence of Ledger, Cooper and Tcheky Karyo as the grouchy but reliable French (holding some grieves against the British). ""The Patriot"" reveals Emmerich's capability to see beyond the limits of its patriotic plot.<br/><br/>Inevitably, the criticism it faced concerned Robert Rodat's screenplay and the portrayal of British soldiers, betraying the same superficiality I denounced in ""Saving Private Ryan"", but while it ruined Spielberg's film, because it was supposed to be realistic, it remarkably fits with ""The Patriot"" because the film doesn't have the same pretension, and easily avoid the 'propaganda' trap. Yes, the Colonel (again, it's not the whole British Army, but one individual) has a Nazi-like morbid aura, but what kind of other villains would match Mel Gibson? It's easy to find critical points in ""The Patriot"" but for each one, the alternative is rarely better."
"JockStein","8","2","6","21 May 2013"," Highly Entertaining Period Drama
","Judy Garland sang it best, ""A clown with his pants falling down, or the dance thats a dream of romance, or the scene where the villain is mean That's Entertainment!"" It is understandable that the Brits have disdain for this movie as it certainly takes liberties with the truth and shows them in a bad light. All directors have creative license to maximize the entertainment value even at the expense of rewriting history if it is necessary. This is a work of fiction loosely based on events and people at that time. It is not a documentary proclaiming that all you are about to see is factual. Gibson is great in the role of Benjamin Martin, but it is his adversary that makes the movie special. Jason Isaacs was masterful in his portrayal of the sadistic Col William Tavington. A supporting cast that includes the impeccable Tom Wilkinson, Joley Richardson and Heath Ledger only adds to the enjoyment of a memorable movie. That Is Entertainment!"

","There is a great old 1965 Jimmy Stewart movie called Shenandoah about a father that finds his family in the middle of the Civil War. The Patriot is basically the same story updated with a different war. They are both worth watching.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson plays the father (with a military past he is trying to forget) who is just trying to runs a farm and avoid conflict. Neesdless to say that is not going to happen as his sons get drawn into the battle. The old warrior comes back and starts fighting the British.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger plays one of his sons, while the ever lovely Joely Richardson plays his sister-in-law (wife is dead). Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy from Harry Potter) plays the bad guy. Is that a surprise? The cast list has several other great players, and you will likely find one that you enjoy.<br/><br/>Good movie about the period."
"captin_bobbles","3","2","6","30 December 2007"," My movie ""review""
","I'm just going to say it this isn't going to be about weather or not I liked the the movie it's going to be more about my reaction to what was going on when I was watching it. We were watching the film in class(history) because we were studying the revolutionary war, and I guess the only way any of us can learn any more is through television and not a book. OK so, I'm watching the flick stuff is happening children are dying(which I'm happy about because I hate children)and then Tavington(Isaacs) rides up and I'm like ""Oh, what'dya know Luscious is in this he looks good without the blond hair(trust me this is important for later)."" and I continue watching. So the movies going more stuff is happening and Mel Gibson admits his love for his dead wives sister. And that gave me this question if they were to get married what will Gibsons children call her because they've been calling her aunt all their lives and what will she call them because the're still her nieces and nephews and then she'll become mom (I'm going to stop that now because this becoming more confusing that that scene in Karas:the revelation). I don't know if that scene came before or after this scene but it's the scene where Isaacs kills Ledger, Back to the ""story"". I'm sitting there doodling I'm not even paying attention to the movie, I decide to look up and when I look up and when I look up Tavington(Isaacs) is shaving his shirt is open his hair is down and dear God he's HOT, so he's running around and ledger ""shoots"" him Tavington falls over and his butt is in the air and he has a cute butt too. And then the movie goes on and then I don't remember a single thing that happens except that I now love Jason Isaacs(more than a 16 should love a man who's as old as her father) and my friend who also watched the movie loves him now too so her and myself have created a day Jason Isaacs day where we watch Jason Isaacs flicks and you tube videos. And that children is the crappy story on the birth of Jason Isaacs Day. And I'm giving this movie a three only because of Jason Isaacs."
"mal80398","10","2","6","5 February 2007"," American war of independence
","A very enjoyable film but inaccurate in places. Portrays the English as rather fascist especially with regard to burning people in a church, something the Nazis did in France! I think with a little more research on behalf of the film makers this could have been an accurate historical drama. The portrayal of slaves fighting alongside continentals does make one think that they were forced into doing this as historically the English offered freedom to any slave of a rebel colonist. Also George Washington at this time still owned 250 or more slaves as did most of the signatories of the declaration of independence. The main character played by Mel Gibson was also a slave owner. On the causes of the war, taxation, the average American paid one shilling in taxes to the crown of england, where the average Englishman paid 25 shillings a year."
"jpchleapas","10","2","6","1 December 2006"," Outstanding movie that deserved a far better review at its release..
","This was one of the very best movies ever made about the American Revolution. This movie was panned solely by the elitist critics because it portrayed (shudder) ""children using guns."" Sorry to the people who did not like this sad but true fact of life, but that is the way things happened for real back then. The British really did commit countless atrocities against American women and children during that War. There were the infamous prison ships that captured Americans were sent to die on from slow starvation. Many of the original signers of the Declaration of Independence themselves suffered greatly at the hands of the British. That is a movie Mel Gibson should make someday. Sorry to the English but your ancestors were not prim and proper in the way they brutalized America back in those days. All Americans and immigrants to the USA owe it to themselves to read the true history of what really happened to the original signers of the Declaration of Independence. One General who signed the Declaration for real whose own house had been commandeered by the English soldiers asked why it was not being fired upon by their own cannons? The men under his command did not want to target his home. He then gave the order himself to fire upon his own home which was then totally destroyed. In real life he died a penniless pauper on the streets after winning the war. This movie should be required watching for all American School children. Sorry if any English people are offended but no offense to you but the outrage I read in print and I heard in audio clips from your side of the pond over the brutality portrayed in this movie was far less than what was actually done to many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. This movie was brilliant and very well done. Bravo to Mel Gibson for making this great movie for us."

It seems so classic and unique at the same time. I think that Mel Gibson did a great job in this movie. At the final battle, I love the part where he goes ""Hold the line! Hold the line! Hold! Hold!"" That quote will be in my memory forever. I will also always remember the scene when he is riding on his horse and holding the flag and you can see the sunset right behind the flag. I love how he is haunted by his past from the French and Indian war. I also love how the dad on grounded for life approves of slavery and doesn't like blacks but the black soldier in the militia eventually become good friends. This is not just an action film.

","This was a good war movie. It was about a family where one of the boys named Gabriel(Heath Ledger from Knight's Tale) is senteced to be excecuted by the British. This movie is based on the American Revolution in 1776. It explains what occured during that time on the Carolina part of America. This is a good movie for adults to watch if they are into history. The events of this movie is set 225 years before Sept, 11. People in America can watch the movie to know what tragedies occured back then during the American Revolution. The only thing is that the story has been changed around for a more fictiony type film. In real-life the Americans killed the British by burning the church down instead of the British killing the Americans. This movie offers action as well as drama. This movie is good to watch. This movie offers sadness as well as hapiness to this film. This movie should have been one of the most banned movies in the post-Sept,11 era because this movie was sad while the terrorism films such as Die Hard, and The Siege was at least happy and more on the enjoying side. Sept, 11 was a sad terrorist tradegy making people avoid The Patriot rather than Die Hard. But it is still good to watch to know the tragedies in America 225 years ago."

"Catalyst-3","10","2","6","12 October 2000"," See it for SOUTH CAROLINA!
","Say what you will about the historical accuracy, but one part was definitely true--South Carolina did, in fact, fight the hardest of the colonies for their collective independence.  Look in any detailed historical text about the war, and the truth is very clear.  British folks--I know that not all Revolutionary War British army people were like Tavington... but the real-life Tarleton, on whom Tavington was based, did a lot of things no self-respecting Brit would be proud of.  Sorry.  So did Americans.<br/><br/>I was very happy to see that the entire film was shot on location in South Carolina--I think the location is the best aspect of the film, actually. South Carolina is a very beautiful state and I think it shows well.  Watch it once just for the scenery and you'll know what I mean. <br/><br/>
The script was very good, with one line of exception: (INCONSEQUENTIALLY SMALL SPOILER) ""It's a free country.""  (END INCONSEQUENTIALLY SMALL SPOILER) That one line drew me out of the movie temporarily because it's so glaringly modern-sounding.  If nothing else, the plot was original--I've never seen a film willing to let the audience get attached to a character, only to knock off that character and cause major angst.<br/><br/>The directing could have been better, but it did a great job of showing off the South Carolina scenery.  The battle scenes were very well-done--I thought it was a little tame in terms of gore, though.  (Then again, I'm the only female I know who was able to watch all the battles in their entirety.)<br/><br/>I was unhappy to learn that, while the film was originally supposed to be about Francis Marion, ""The Swamp Fox,"" they changed it when some people alleged that Marion had hunted Cherokee for sport and raped slaves.  That's a load of hogwash.  There's absolutely no evidence to substantiate any of that.<br/><br/>In closing, see this movie soon, and visit South Carolina, because South Carolina and The Patriot both ROCK."

"austinlsweeney","7","1","2","1 March 2018"," The best American Revolution Movie Out There.....So Far
","So if you are looking for a movie about 100% historical facts, go watch a documentary. <br/><br/>If you are looking for the best representation of the American Revolution from a Militia standpoint. Then watch the Patriot. Though understand that the story is fictional in itself. However the uniforms, mannerisms, battle observations, military movements and procedures of war are pretty accurate.<br/><br/>
I think what the Patriot does it get to the heart of why and how the Revolution was founded. It was founded on a desire to get Independence and a desire to prove that the British were not all they were cracked up to be. The Continental Army was unorganized in large part and barley battle ready at best. Meanwhile the British Army was the main powerhouse of the world and their Navy, boasting ships with 80 guns. <br/><br/>If you want a movie that tells the story of a man who doesn't want to fight and then being forced to fight due to extreme measures taken by a reckless British Officer, then watch this. I think this evil officer in particular was inspired by the Scottish and German Mercenary armies who fought for the British and made the Americans run every time they got to the battle. They were also known for killing anyone who surrendered and raping American women. Not that the American hands were clean, but this inspired it for sure. <br/><br/>Were all British evil? Absolutely not, and they actually speak to that in the movie, Cornwallis doesn't like the way one of his Officers acts. Do they sometimes show the British soliders as not being as skilled as they should be? Yes, but at the same time, that is one of the ways the Americans started to win, was not fight the way the British did. With order and Officers leading the way and always giving orders. The Americans took to Gorilla style warefare. Go read 1776 for some good knowledge. <br/><br/>Overall, Good movie. Historically accurate in most parts. Does it show the British in a bad light at times, yes, but thats because its an American perspective on the war and we Americans don't really like being owned by another country."
"MeMyselfAndTheBeard","8","1","2","22 October 2017"," Another top job by everyone involved
","Set in the time before America got its independence from Great Britain.It baffled me that back in that era the way they fight in a war is just to stand there and wait to get shot.

Little DC connection in the film while I'm talking about Heath, Heath Ledger played the Joker and also in the film is Donal Logue who plays Harvey Bullock in Gotham. A very young Logan Lerman is in this and a young Skye McCole which her don't go poppa scene when you see her filling up and her emotions building up brought a tear to my eye. Chris Coopers in this too and he's good in what ever he does top quality actor. <br/><br/>Roland Emmerich directs another good film and Robert Rodat writes another good screenplay. Tough to watch at times but that's what went on back then and you can't believe it. Brilliant film FairPlay."
"smatysia","7","1","2","4 August 2015"," Largely a revenge tale
","This film takes the romanticism out of eighteenth-century/Napoleonic-era warfare and lays bare the brutality of musket and cannon fire into packed ranks. And then, of course, the bayonet charges and ensuing hand to hand combat is not really much different than the battles of Caesar's legions. The film is beautifully photographed and well-directed. However, the title ""The Patriot"" is quite unfortunate, given that it is largely a revenge tale (Mel Gibson's forte) that happens to have the Revolutionary War as a backdrop. Gibson is, by turns, charming and ultra-violent. Joely Richardson was lovely here, although I may not have recognized her in the period costumes. It is a well-made, obviously high-budget, if somewhat gory film, and overall, pretty good, if not a masterpiece."

However, Gibson also directed and co-produced that film, whereas his only part in ""The Patriot"" was the starring role. Anyway, I learned lot about this movie, reading both praise and criticism, before I rented it just yesterday. From what I had read about it, I could have been reasonably impressed, I could have been somewhat disgusted, but for me, it turned out to be somewhere in between.<br/><br/>Set in South Carolina in 1776, during the American Revolution, Benjamin Martin was a hero in the French and Indian War, and now lives as a farmer. He is still deeply tormented by some of his actions during his past experience in battle, and wants nothing to do with the war against Britain. When South Carolina enters the war, Benjamin's eldest son, Gabriel, quickly signs up to participate, without his father's approval. However, Gabriel eventually returns home wounded one night, and soon after this, the cruel Colonel William Tavington, from the British side, captures him and plans to have him hanged! When Thomas, another son of Benjamin, tries to free his brother, he is soon killed, and the house is burned down by British forces! After this, Benjamin finally decides to join the fight against the British, leading a militia into battle for the sake of his country.<br/><br/>One thing many people bash this movie for is historical inaccuracy, saying the vast majority of it is fiction. I'm no history buff, but I can believe that. It seems clear that it's filled with fictional characters, including our hero. However, I tend to find that any film I see based on historical events, no matter how popular it is, I'm bound to learn about significant use of fiction in it, so that's not my main complaint. What are my main complaints? Well, first of all, the beginning seems a tad sudden, and probably could have used more of an opening narration to introduce the characters and setting. Those who watch it with no clue what the story is about beforehand could easily find themselves lost around the beginning. Before I watched the film, I read about it being very one-sided, and that's definitely true. Basically, the story is saints vs. savages. I'm sure a lot of brutality came from the British side, but that doesn't mean every single one of them was equally bad and nobody who fought on the American side ever did anything wrong. When historical films are made, inaccuracy seems inevitable, but when the story is this simple, it can be a problem. I did find tension in this film, and some parts are supposed to be moving, but I didn't find them as much so as they're supposed to be, such as Benjamin's youngest daughter, Susan, suddenly begging him not to go as he's leaving to fight, after hating him and refusing to talk to him. Scenes like this seem thrown in just to play with one's emotions, without much effort. I guess another example of this is a scene where British forces lock innocent townspeople in a church and burn it down, which apparently didn't actually happen. The Nazis did this in World War II, but if such an event didn't take place during the American Revolution, then the church-burning scene in this movie is useless. Yes, it may bring out emotions in viewers, but what for? I will also point out that the film is long at over 2 1/2 hours, and may drag at times, an example being the tedious battle sequence towards the end.<br/><br/>I certainly can't exactly say I was bored the entire time when I watched ""The Patriot"", with quite a bit of tension and perhaps some mildly heart-wrenching moments, but overall, I found the feelings the film gave me to be worthless, as it was probably just trying to get the best of me. Also, late in the film, although it may have been hard to turn it off early, for me it was like, ""When is this going to end?"" I knew why some have been absolutely revolted by this action blockbuster before I saw it, and after seeing it, I'm not part of that crowd (I'm pretty much indifferent to the film, I guess), but I can understand the points of these people, and I guess I can understand the praise for it as well (after all, much worse has been done). If you want a long melodrama, ""The Patriot"" might do, but if you want a deep story with moments that could stir your emotions for a good reason, you could feel cheated by this film."

","The acting is good, the shots are beautiful and the battles look great. Unfortunately, this movie is amazingly inaccurate. I can understand distorting some facts in the name of art, or ""hollywood license"" but this film just takes it to another level. Another part I did not like was the score, it literally put me into a rage every time I heard it. This movie is unbelievably melodramatic (even more melodramatic than an episode of Greys Anatomy, and that's saying something!).<br/><br/>Despite that, it's still quite good. Before I saw this, I expected there to be a lot of ""go America"" Flag waving, but to my surprise this was a lot more subtle than I expected. Although, it does exist (to the point where Mel Gibson is actually waving a flag). The acting is good, especially Mel Gibson. I watched this film because I absolutely love both Tom Wilkenson and Chris Cooper, and I wasn't too disappointed. Watch this film for it's battle scenes, they are great (they pale in comparison to the 1968 adaptation of War & Peace, but are great nonetheless), and there is also some humor in this film at times. My one concern is the negative portrayal of the British. They are our close allies and are a nation of tradition, history and class, they deserve better than that. I understand that the movie needs a ""bad guy"" but they didn't have to go as far as they did. I hope the Brits understand, that this is just a good, old fashion summer blockbuster, nothing more. Other than those things, the film was better than I expected, I did enjoy most of it. I hope you will too. Unless of course, you're British."

","I am a history major at a university. I watch these movies for the entertainment and the costumes. I watch them even more to see people like Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger, and others including the daughter of Vanessa Redgrave. We know that historical accuracy may not be what sells tickets to movies. It is comforting to know, however, that at the end of the credits all due respect is given to The Smithsonian Institution for their excellent guidance. For total accuracy, check out the History Channel, though sometimes I feel that their presentations are none too intelligent.<br/><br/>That said, I am also an actor. I try to watch ""most"" of the gory scenes, knowing full well about the special effects, miniatures and fake blood and gore. I also know that no animals were hurt in this film, so when we see a horse stabbed we know that it is just an illusion for movie making. We must suspend our sense of reality.<br/><br/>I hate the phrase ""history buff"". That is for all of those armchair critics of the American Civil War (yes, there were/are plenty of civil wars in other countries). Getting a college degree in history is much more important than being on either the side of the Union or the Confederacy in the 1861-1865 conflict.<br/><br/>This movie shows the British war strategists to be brilliant. They obviously have access to an English treasury that will finance all of their trappings, ships, weapons, etc. They fight in formal rows, as do the Continentals. The Continentals get slaughtered big-time, until ol' Mel Gibson, in his anger, fires up his band of ragtag homeboys to eventually turn the war around around to the good-new U.S. of A., LOL. Mel (Martin) obviously learned this from being that great hero of the French and Indian Wars, being a British soldier but somehow noticing that the Indians/Native Americans never fought in neat rows like they were going out for a Sunday outing. Martin found out that to hide behind trees and dress in blah colors was a sure way to beat the Redcoats (the new enemy, circa-1776) who were his former compatriots. Besides, if animals could disappear from the environment and not be seen by predators, maybe Mel and his buddies could, too. Mel and his drunkards (pow-sock-bam-biff-bop) had several instances of line-fighting, even alongside the Continental uniformed regulars.<br/><br/>I figured early on that Mel would face Tavington and kill that redcoated scoundrel at the end (the big finale), but I didn't figure on Gabriel (Ledger) getting killed much less the younger boy getting killed also. That was heartbreaking, but remember folks, it's fake blood and bottled ooze. Tavington (Jason Isaacs, later of Captain Hook snarling infamy) finally got HIS, but kept refusing to die, first at the hands of Gabriel then at the fatal unmercy of ol' Braveheart himself. But of course, Mel outfoxed him, and lived to see his sons' lives avenged. Even Peter Pan (2003) finished off Isaacs by feeding Hook to the bloodthirsty crocodile. If you saw 'Peter Pan', you know that Hook/Isaacs went down ""old, alone, and unloved""). As far as Tavington and his annihilation, go figure. Cornwallis didn't like his sadistic tactics, and Tavington's officers figured him for a insane madman to boot. Maybe they were glad that Mel finished him off.<br/><br/>To see even humongously more fake blood and gore, visit Mel's 'Passion of the Christ'.<br/><br/>13/10."

","Having lived in South Carolina near the site of the battle of Cowpens, I can appreciate how the screen writer tried to come close to actual historical events. Tavington is based on Bannister Tarleton, a ruthless British Colonel Cornwallis appreciated having in his army, even though he found him arrogant and self-centered. The Mel Gibson character is more of symbolic figure of the typical militia patriot found in the Carolinas, the majority of whom did not want to get involved. Of course, the film could have adhered closer to the actual time-line and battle sequences and had an even more dramatic effect. The final battle in the movie is the Battle of Cowpens, which did not take place until January 1781. It was not fought in a large open field as depicted in the movie and was won because of the ground chosen for the battle and the strategy used by General Daniel Morgan. The Colonials under the command of General Horatio Gates suffered a horrendous defeat at Camden. Gates was relieved of command and replaced with General Nathaniel Green, Washington's most trusted General. General Green was considered the Command-n-Chief of the southern army. General Green placed General Daniel Morgan in charge of the Colonial Army and militia that faced a British force of 1,000 men under the command of Colonel Tarleton. General Cornwallis was not at the Battle of Cowpens. It was General Morgan that came up with the strategy of the militia firing two shots into the British line and then retreating back behind the Colonial line. Daniel Morgan chose the battle spot because of its terrain and the natural borders of a river and swamp, which were used to trap the British. Utilizing the militia, Colonial Regulars, and the light calvary under William Washington, Morgan struck a heavy blow to Tarleton's men. Tarleton escaped Cowpens and was actually at Yorktown with Cornwallis. He later returned to England and reached the rank of General in the British army and had a seat in Parliament. Morgan resigned soon after Cowpens because of health reasons. It has been widely accepted by many historians that if Cornwallis had been the Commanding General of the entire British Army in America, we would have been defeated early on, but because of William Howe's arrogance and unwillingness to pursue Washington after each victory and later, because of Henry Clinton's insistence on staying put in New York and paranoia and fear of losing his command to Cornwallis, Washington was able to escape after several defeats, benefit from an alliance with France, and prolong a war that should have ended before 1780. <br/><br/>The British's defeat at Cowpens led to the forced march of Cornwallis' troops to Virginia as he chased Green's army out of the Carolinas. With the arrival of the French Fleet at Yorktown and Washington's siege, Cornwallis surrendered.<br/><br/>The French Officer was another symbolic figure as many French Officers fought for the Colonials, most for glory and acclaim, but others because they believed in America's cause. Read about The Marquis De Lafayette.<br/><br/>This movie is mostly fluff with predictable Hollywood fare. I'm reminded of an earlier film about a Scottish Patriot: family member killed by a British Aristocrat, man seeks revenge in the guise of fighting for a cause, man wins battle, only this time he isn't beheaded and quartered. If you want know the actual historical events that took place in South Carolina, visit Kings Mountain Battlefield and Cowpens Battlefield. They are both worth the time, unlike this movie."

"eastie","3","1","2","1 June 2005"," Print the Myth
","Hollywood has adapted the history of many other nations to the myth of the U.S.A.'s birth many times (e.g. Braveheart, Ben Hur, any other film where a plucky minority battles for independence from a tyrannical empire), so it's interesting to see a film that goes back to the source. I don't immediately want to turn off any American patriots reading this review, so I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to be critical when I use the word ""myth"". What I mean is that the American revolution did not begin as a group of U.S. patriots fighting against a tyrannical empire, but rather, as a group of citizens fighting for their rights within an empire. That it turned into a war, and that the war ultimately became a rebellion against an empire (the myth is not a lie, but it is an exaggeration), and that the war then gave birth to the U.S.A. is one of history's happiest series of errors and misfortunes (mostly by the British).<br/><br/>The winners get to write the story of what happened, and in the case of the U.S., the story is written in terms of ""freedom"". It's one of the most powerful, influential, and for the most part, beneficial stories that the world has ever known. The spread of democracy in the world, emancipation and enfranchisement of millions of people, the development of human rights, the growth of capitalism, with all of the benefits that it has brought (lower infant mortality, greater longevity, higher material standard of living) - all of these things have to greater or lesser extent (often greater) been driven by notions of ""freedom"" that trace back to the U.S.A.'s nation-building, and to its attempts to live up to the ideals that made the rebellion justifiable - to live up to the myth.<br/><br/>U.S. citizens have lots of reasons to feel pride in their country. But criticising this film, and, for that matter, criticising America doesn't necessarily mean being unpatriotic, or mean that you hate America. The reason that patriotism stirs strong emotions is because where you come from is a big part of making you who you are, your opinions and values. Feeling proud of where you come from therefore makes you feel proud about yourself (by the same token, feeling shame about where you come from, or being told you should, tends to provoke a defensive reaction, as it's similar to being told you should feel shame about yourself. This is a lot of the reason why English people find this film so personally offensive). But if you're going to feel pride in your nation you should do it because there's something to be proud of, not just for the sake of feeling good about yourself.<br/><br/>I think that's the main reaon why the historical misrepresentation of this film annoys people from other countries. As I say, Americans have lots of reasons to feel proud without having to make any more up. The U.S.A. is not a fledgling nation any more - it doesn't really need the myth. Its values have become global, and it doesn't need a story to justify them any more - they stand on their own. It certainly doesn't need to take the truth behind the myth and distort it yet further just to feel good. Feeling proud of yourself because of something that isn't true is self-deceit. Doing it when you're already king is hubris.<br/><br/>I should also point out that pretty much every other country in the world has its own myths and self-deceptions, so this isn't an exclusive attack on America. America just has the biggest film industry..."

","This movie is yet another example of blatant American flag waving (perhaps ironically, the lead role is played by raised in Australia Mel Gibson).

The reason for this cheap plot device is simple enough - it makes us hate the English, and root for the American's. That's all fine if you're an American, I suppose - ""USA, USA , USA"" and all that. As a non-American, I can say I wasn't convinced. Actually it's the much same stunt (in fact much the same movie) Gibson also gave us in his own ""Braveheart"", again an anti-English propaganda film.

The movie is rather organized for a war movie, unlike Saving Private Ryan or others.  This one has a straightforward plot, a nasty villain who is detestable and completely vile in all ways (really makes you hate him--perfect for a villain!), and a good cast of actors and actresses.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson continues his war epics (starting with Braveheart) and, as always, does a good job fitting into his role.

Tavington is written more like a stock Hollywood Nazi than anything else, and everything he did was predictable.  With Cornwallis, written and played like a weak fop, rather than the able career officer and politician he was? Cornwallis may have lost the final campaign of the War, due more to lack of support from Howe and the arrival of the French, but he was assigned later as Governor of India. And then there is Martin.

Believe it or not, there are those of us out there who don't need to be force-fed when it comes to deciding who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, and yet Hollywood filmmakers insist on lineating plotlines to the extent that the ""heroes"" are completely spotless while the ""villains"" are all totally vile monsters, regardless of whether or not these portrayals have any grounds in fact.  This concept is exemplified perfectly in ""The Patriot,"" wherein Mel and his cronies save the free world from the evil clutches of the vile British Empire.  Don't get me wrong; I believe that the American cause was a just one and I'm very proud to call myself an American, but I'm also very proud of my English heritage, and the constant portrayal of the British as the antagonists every time I turn around tends to wear a little thin, especially when it's taken to the extremes shown in ""The Patriot.""<br/><br/>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW***<br/><br/>For example, no British officer would *ever* order the mass execution of wounded enemy soldiers, period.  It simply *would not,* and *did not* happen.  Any historian worth his or her salt will tell you the same. Also, the intentional firing of a church - especially with innocent civilians trapped inside - would be grounds for execution amongst the ranks of the British army, and certainly would not have been condoned by any British officer, least of all General Cornwallis, who was, by all accounts, a fair and honorable man (in the movie's defense, they did start his character out as such, at least).<br/><br/>Another issue I had with the film was the development of Gibson's character. Close to the beginning of the film, we see a side of him which promises some interesting development later on in the film (I won't say exactly what), but, surprisingly, this *rather extreme* side of his persona never surfaces again, even when you most think it might.  This left me feeling rather let down, and disappointed that a very promising sub-plot had been ignored.<br/><br/>Something that I *did* enjoy about the film was the constant use of John Woo-style action sequences.  Normally I'm annoyed by such shameless rips-off, but I felt that it was used very appropriately here.  It's been while since I've seen so many various weapons flying up to meet outstretched hands in slow motion (well, except for M:I2, but if you're a Woo fan like me, yuo're pretending that that one enver happened).  You might think that such things would be out of place in a historical epic; on the contrary, I felt that it breathed a much-needed new life into what could easily have been nothing but a collection of over-used cliches.<br/><br/>In short, this was by far Roland Emmerich's best film to date, and if you can take it at face value as a traditional 'good guy vs. bad guy' revenge tale then you won't be disappointed.  However, if you're looking for a historical epic in which the characters require a little more thought to decide who the good guys are, if there are any at all, check out Kaige Chen's ""The Emperor and the Assassin.""  You won't be disappointed."

","Never before has the American Revoloution been dramatized so well.  British forces engage the American forces in battles so vivid, you'd swear you were there.  But the battles aren't the only reason to watch this epic, Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances, and that's reason enough to go.  Gibson's Benjamin Martin is a veteran of the French-Indian Wars and he knows what warfare will bring.  After an incident that occurs at the hands of Col. Travington (wonderfully played by Jason Issacs) Martin resurrects a side of himself that he hoped he could escape.  Muskets flash and tomahawks soar through the air as Martin tears his way through British forces. The film has everything you could ask for in a historical epic.  A good attention to period detail, rousing action, wonderful cinematography and larger than life characters that pull you into the story and push all the right emotional buttons.  See it, and be moved."

","Such a shame. Clearly a good budget, great locations, wardrobes and potential. Everything looks really good, and then... aaagh. We seem to be using that old formula. Protagonist who is honourable and decent, with a shady past as his negative. Antagonist as evil and merciless as we can get away with, somewhere just shy of stamping on bunny's for the fun of it. And plot wise... the old classic I've been wronged, I shall have my revenge.<br/><br/>I was hoping for a gripping intricate mix of war, treachery, divided loyalty, cunning, ruthlessness, compassion and bravery. Unfortunately we got a bland obvious and very unimaginative tale of revenge.<br/><br/>It is all too easy to pull the film down in its realism. The actions of army personnel I cannot comment on as I was not there. But they do seem to have amazing shooting accuracy with incredibly inaccurate weapons. The slave issue clearly portrayed in a bit of an embarrassing way so as not to offend. I guess the question is: why set a story in such a time if you have no intention of recreating it accurately?<br/><br/>A point about this films set in history. I make a point of assuming, other than the arena in which it is set, that the rest is completely fictitious.<br/><br/>I suppose one truth is displayed, that revenge is the excuse of the evil, and only leads to more death and suffering.

Yes, it is a very well filmed movie, with fine constuming, but that seems to be but another method of lulling the viewing into believing what they're showing us could really happen. Sure, some of the stuff happened, but not enough to make it a historical drama. And in this guise of a historical drama does this movie attempt to tells the story of a man seeking vengeance.<br/><br/>My main complaint about this movie is its shear and unflinching attempt to manipulate the audience. All the actors do a good job of settling into their roles, but in the end it's the roles themselves that betray the movie. It is all too cut and dry. Good guy does this, bad guy does this, accept and move on.<br/><br/>I'm as patriotic as the next guy (american), but I will not enjoy a movie based soley on patriotism.

This movie goes from a simple minded mentality, to bouts with epic stature, back to childishness, then returning to quality film making.  My first sign that this was nowhere near as epic as Braveheart was when he quotes the often remembered ""No taxation without representation.""  That was a signal reminiscent of the iceberg as a signal to the Titanic!  This line was poorly executed and even more poorly placed in the movie.  A blasé attempt to recapture a moment in time.  The second instance of pure garbage comes when Charlotte says ""It's a free country"" as he sits beside her.  That was above and beyond the call of duty.  All alive on the moron front.  Pure, unadulterated tripe.  Gibson is quality, Ledger is quality, but the writing pushed this movie from what it could have been, into a steaming pile of pseudo revolutionary history riddled with poor clichés and predictable characters.  Jason Issacs was the only saving grace as the dastardly Col. Tavington.  He was riveting and powerful as a man with true intent and vision.<br/><br/>You never even felt that Gibson wanted to fight until the end and the mindless waving of too many colonial flags was over the top and unnecessary. Using the flag as a spear was also a terrible and expected touch.  Fight scenes were excellent as well.<br/><br/>I consider myself a devoted American and hoped for more than I was given.

","Unfortunately, those words are true. The acting was great but I didn't like the script.   It was a typical, `let's try to get a patriotic movie out for the 4th of July' and another one of Hollywood's blockbuster's that spits good (Mel Gibson of course) verses evil (Jason Isaacs as the devil in carnet Colonel William Tavington) in a nearly three hour time span.  At times the movie was poignant (SPOILER: the death of his son and the manner Mel Gibson goes for revenge) and the vivid luscious South Carolina scenery.  The battle scenes were vivid and at times I cringed as the cannon balls rolled.  When that wasn't catching my attention, I was restless and agitated as time went by.  Personally, for nearly two hundred years American has been brainwashing ourselves into believing we broke away from Britain to avoid the tyranny of kings.  Excuse me; if the colonists wanted to blame some body blame Parliament, if the blame should be on them at all.  Yes, they were the one's levying the taxes but those taxes were paying for the cost of the French and Indian War defending the Americans under British protection.  Americans, surprisingly enough did beat the British, but it was not because we used better tactics but because Britain was facing war with Europe as well as the Americans (When all of these countries helped us, why did we wait so long to help them) I often wonder what would have happened if Britain had been closer and been able to send more troops, and not had to worry about other countries interfering.<br/><br/>I think I could have really liked this movie if I didn't know the history behind it and wondering why can't Hollywood try and get it right for a change?  Maybe my annoyance didn't come from Hollywood at all maybe it stems from the fact that historical inaccuracies in movies go unnoticed because people don't take the time to point them out.

You may well of noticed,that I`m a Brit,so what!,I`m used to Hollywood making us the bad guys over the last few years,don`t know why?Are we seen as a threat to their capitalist nation? can`t see how,as we are capitalists ourselves!Forgive me,I digress,but the point I`m making,is,that at the time of the war of Independence,Brit(and German,as a lot of the soldiers used by British army at that time,were German,a point the film-makers did`nt even mention!) was essentially fighting Brit!How is this you ask,well,let me enlighten you.If you take,as a very good example,Johnny Depp`s ""Sleepy Hollow"".The film(as was the story it was based on)is,like the The Patriot,set in the 18th century,so how is it then that American accents are pretty much non-existent in ""Sleepy Hollow"" while VERY much prevalent in ""The Patriot"",I mean,even Johnny Depp`s character in ""Sleepy Hollow"" speaks with an English accent! Another thing,which I find quite amusing,is the arrival of the French.It is believed,that is if you believe ""The Patriot`s"" take on history,that they arrived in 1781,when in actual fact,they arrived in 1778!The French,were a pivotal force,as far as the Americans were concerned-if they had`nt helped,the U.S. would have been a British colony for a considerable time longer and would of qualified as Commonwealth nation,of which they would only of benefited. Then we have the tricky task of sorting out the flag!! I`m going to refer once again to ""Sleepy Hollow"".There is a scene quite early on in the film,where Depp is in front of a judge(played by Chritopher Lee).It`s whats behind the judge you should look for-a flag.So,it`s a flag,you say,look again....it`s the flag that history has pretty much forgotten.This flag had stripes,where stripes are today,but instead of the stars in the left hand corner,we have a canton of the Union Flag.This flag was also sported on BOTH sides of the war of Independence,albeit minus the Union Flag canton on the side of the Americans. I could go on and on about this jingoistic,flag waving film,but what i fear the most is,this is starting a worrying trend,and British actors are contributing to it,that is ""lets shove how great America is down everyones throat"".Everyone on this planet knows the U.S. is a fine and great country,I`ve been there many times myself and enjoyed it imensely.Surely they were a bit worried about releasing this film in the U.K.,because I can tell you,this film has bred some contempt in and around certain cities.By shoving the ""elitist"" U.S. attitude in peoples faces,is causing a wave of anti-Americanism"
"theD","Null","1","2","12 March 2001"," Little to feel patriotic about...
","Unlike many ""historical"" films, the Patriot feels more like a high-concept action movie.  For one, the ""history"" depicted is simply a setting in which the fictional aspects take place.  Yes, real people like Gates and Cornwallis are used, but such major sequences such as the battle at the end are not even named, leaving us to run to our history texts to find out what was going on.  However, people such as Martin and Colonel Tavington are fictionalized permutations of real characters who would have been much more interesting.  For example, the real Sir Henry Talton and his British Legion were considered so dangerous that George Washington himself planned an operation to wipe them out.  Furthermore, just on the merits of the film itself, The Patriot is packed full of every major war cliche, and is dragged on by scenes that do little to further the plot.  By the third time that Tavington wiped out one of Martin or his men's families, I decided that he was definitely evil and needed to be killed, but by the fourth or fifth time, I was starting to finger the fast forward button.  There were also several little plot aspects that were thrown in that did nothing to further the plot.  Though, I should expect nothing more from the director of Godzilla and Independence Day.  I need not mention that the first twenty minutes is almost point-for-point Braveheart.  The film does have one great aspect, however.  It is probably the first time someone has taken advantage of modern special effects to show warfare of the pre-Napoleonic period, showing the modern average public things like real cannonball behavior--though these same aspects would have done little for ""great battle"" films such as Waterloo or Gettysburg.  Now, if someone would make a truly historical Revolutionary War film, and not just another Johnny Tremain, it could be a great achievement."

","Really bad. That's about all I can say. I expected historical inaccuracies, but this movie outdid those expectations. Moviemakers seem to think they have the whole problem of anachronisms licked now that they have complex, expensive wardrobes and CGI. But that doesn't defeat anachronistic, bad, hammy dialogue. Statements like ""It's a free country"", and general manner of conversation are completely inaccurate for the time.<br/><br/>Another reviewer brought up the point that the women in this movie are horribly portrayed. I agree, but they are horribly portrayed in a way many people don't recognize. It's not that they weren't given anything meaningful to do or say - that's true of all the actors. The simple fact is that, at that time, no woman would have stood up in a church and verbally berated the men of her village. It just wouldn't happen. Sure, it makes everyone feel good and gets the women cheering, but it just wouldn't happen. If you're going to portray a period, you must portray that period as honestly as possible.<br/><br/>As for the concerns with the villainy of the British - believe it or not, that was rather accurate. I suggest the doubters read some of the documentation of the way British settlers behaved at the time. They were absolutely brutal. So that was an interesting element. But the way the filmmakers used their brutality - senselessly burning a village full of people in a church just to reiterate how evil the main bad guy is - that was pretty shameless.<br/><br/>What else is there to say? Oh, there's the standard cliche of the villain who gets mortally wounded, then the hunky hero (Heath Ledger - Mel 2.0) decides to stand unnecessarily near to his obviously undead enemy, and gets impaled. It's made even funnier by the fact that the villain then jogs away and gets into an even more intense battle. And Mel beats and stabs some people with an American flag, which actually caused my beverage to shoot from my nose.<br/><br/>I don't care if you see the movie, but I urge you not to pay for it.

"FlickJunkie-2","9","1","2","16 November 2000"," Masterful filmmaking
","War is horrific.  If there is one message that comes across clearly in this film that is it.  `The Patriot' is an extraordinarily graphic and compelling depiction of 18th Century warfare.  It is difficult to imagine a scene more terrifying than the sight of thousands of men leveling muskets at you from a distance so close you can see the sweat on their faces.  Woven into this revolutionary war film was a human drama about a man and his family and the devastating effect the war had on them.<br/><br/>In an effort to make the audience sympathetic to the hero, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan), wrote an overly melodramatic and sentimental script with excessively noble Americans and incredibly evil Brits.  Though I didn't have a real problem with this, I can see how many people would be rolling their eyes, especially the ones whose top priority was the war itself.  Still, for those who like a good human drama, this film grabs the emotions and makes one scream out in vindication when the bad guys get what they deserve.  It is also difficult not to feel a bit patriotic while watching this film.  I was put off however, by the preachy, politically correct pabulum regarding the slave soldiers.<br/><br/>Other than that criticism, which is more a matter of personal preference, this film was extraordinary.  It was brilliantly directed.  With this film, Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day) has moved beyond schlocky sensational films and actually assembled a substantial film with a story that wasn't tongue in cheek.  If there is one area where Emmerich excels, it is visual effects, and this film is another shining example of that.  He created graphic and grisly effects of decapitations and dismemberments that were disturbingly realistic.  His choreography of the combat with thousands of extras was magnificent.  In some cases, he used computer simulations for panoramic battlefield scenes that were indistinguishable from action created by real humans.  The costume design by Deborah Lynn Scott (Wild, Wild West, Titanic) was superlative.  She actually went to the Smithsonian Institution to use real revolutionary uniforms as her models for the patterns.  The entire period was fantastically rendered.  The five-speaker surround sound on the DVD was awesome, especially during the combat, with voices and battle sounds coming from all directions.<br/><br/>The acting was superb.  Mel Gibson was completely immersed in his role as the reluctant Colonel, for whom the war was a personal vendetta.  He had to handle quite a range of emotions, from the tenderness of a father to the rage and savagery of battle and the seething hatred of the murderous dragoon.  He was outstanding in every scene.  Heath Ledger (Ten Things I Hate About You) was also excellent as the Martin's idealistic son whose war started as patriotism and became personal in the end.  Jason Isaacs was supremely evil as the nefarious dragoon colonel who delighted in the murder of women and children and in burning settlers alive.<br/><br/>This was a masterful filmmaking achievement that went a bit overboard on the sentimental side.  It was highly entertaining with a strong and engaging story and characters with whom it was easy to identify.  I rated it a 9/10. Be forewarned; it's not for the squeamish."

","Perhaps director Roland Emmerich is trying to make up for Godzilla, which he also directed. Perhaps he's trying to show us all that the success of Independence Day wasn't just a result of magnificent special effects and a hefty budget. At any rate, Emmerich was taking on quite a challenge, for the last American Revolution movie was that 1985 Al Pacino disaster ""Revolution"". 1776 never seemed so distant as when Al donned that furry hat and passed himself off as an 18th-century trader. Oh, sure, with that accent, no less.<br/><br/>This time around, there's a foreigner at the fore. Mel Gibson's from Australia, as some of you might know. Wouldn't know it to hear him speak, of course, with an American accent that's more fluid than anything most of us will ever use in our own lifetimes. Get Mel behind closed doors, though, and I suspect he's all ready to put a shrimp on the ol' barbie. Here, of course, he's as American as he always is in the cinema. Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin, calm farmer, hero of the French and Indian War. Legend has it that Martin went crazy at Fort Wilderness (not the place in Disney World, I soon discovered) and killed a bunch of bad guys. But now he's older and wiser, and he's darn sure he won't be laying to arms against any ol' Redcoats, taxes or no taxes. He's got something like nine kids to feed, all by himself (all you single moms out there, feel free to either commiserate or express your outrage). Well, things tend to change quickly in movies, even if the movie's 160 minutes long (ouch!). Before too long, Ben's pitchfork-deep in the melee, helping the colonials to defeat the British, who are represented (rather haughtily, of course) by Lord Cornwallis. Those of you who remember your history know that eventually <br/><br/>(WARNING! WARNING! PLOT ENDING REVEALED! DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU LIKE SURPRISES ABOUT THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, WHICH OCCURRED OVER 220 YEARS AGO!)<br/><br/>
Cornwallis surrenders, and the colonists win their freedom. Ah, but half the fun is getting there, right? Luckily, the movie doesn't bog us down with historical details such as battles, dates, etc. Remember Braveheart, that movie with an Australian playing the part of a Scotsman who rallies his people to revolt? This movie's not like that at all, since we have an Australian playing the part of an American who rallies his people to revolt. But while both films are completely different (!), let's look at some wonderful similarities. Disorganized rabble? Check. Evil despot? Check. Gallons and gallons of spilled blood per person? Check. Gratuitous violence? Check and double check!<br/><br/>If this were viewed as a historical drama, there would be all sorts of problems with the accuracy of the plot (in fact, the British complained loud and often when the movie premiered, something about it portraying them as evil despots bent on world dominance, or something). Luckily, most of us don't care a whit about such stuff and nonsense, so we look at this movie to show us action. Pounds and pounds of action, preferably in the form of senseless violence. I mean there are decapitations! Who wouldn't want to see that? Many people, of course, but not too many - this film kicked butt at the box office. <br/><br/>As a morality tale of sticking to your guns, the film loses its way a little, I think. Benjamin Martin goes against his beliefs for some pretty solid reasons, but after he takes the plunge, all bets are off and we have a straightforward action movie. But as a chance to see Mel strut his hero stuff, it's golden"

","WARNING: This review may reveal portions of the plot.<br/><br/>When a film is done well, the length doesn't matter -- it can be long or short, and people will enjoy it. When a film is done VERY WELL, then the amount of time needed to tell the story should be used -- whatever that length of time. In the case of ""The Patriot,"" it takes almost 3 hours.<br/><br/>""The Patriot"" succeeds best by taking a story that we all think we know -- the War for Independence -- and making it personal. It succeeds in showing what the cost of war is, even when the ends seem just. It shows how a man can be pushed in war to a point no one in his family or friends -- including himself -- could believe he could reach.<br/><br/>But don't take this movie as historical fact. While wrapped around history, there was no Benjamin Martin. Martin is the war's everyman, the militia leader called into action to save a family that he desperately tried to save by staying OUT of the war and couldn't. He knew how bloodthirsty he could become, and it scared him. What the film will show is the historic events that created the war, the division of the country on both sides of the issue, and how close we came to losing this war as it dragged on for almost 6 years. (Be honest -- did you know that the War for Independence was more than 5 years long? Or that it only STARTED in 1776, not that it ended then?) It takes our history books and puts a face to them, although that face is the face of a fictional character. Somehow, that's okay, for it takes the statistics from history and makes them real for us today.<br/><br/>When ""Saving Private Ryan"" came out many veterans described it as the most accurate portrayal of WWII ever made. Roland Emmerich has attempted to do the same with ""The Patriot."" By showing the strain the war put on family and friends, he has succeeded valiantly. He also succeeds in creating some of the most gruesome and horrific battle sequences ever put on film. At one point, I found my stomach starting to churn in disgust.<br/><br/>As the father of the film, Gibson is concerned what his young children have seen him do. Likewise parents should be concerned if their young children see this film. It is bloody and grusome. Hand-to-hand combat is extremely vivid. Children are shot, stabbed, and burned to death. There are hangings and firing squads. This film does not withhold any of the horror of war, which is why it received the R rating."

","After I left the theatre, I was wondering why I went to see this movie in the first place; I think I was another victim of a movie trailer that seemed interesting. I'm quite happy I was able to secure student admission (5.50) as opposed to the 7.00 regular price because, in a sense, ""The Patriot"" was worth about 1/2 of every penny. I got the feeling that Gibson extorted the $15 odd million contract from the producer as a sort of insurance against the movie being a failure. In this case, it was a good idea on his part. I'd hate to see a decent actor's reputation get trashed...like the case of John Travolta and ""Battelfield Earth"".<br/><br/>the Bad about ""The Patriot"": (1)It's an inferior remake of Braveheart, set in America. 'Nuff said. (2)Dialogue. They paid Mel Gibson millions to spout cheesy one liners. Not just any one liners, we're talking about one liners of the same calibre of Harrison Ford's ""Get off my plane"" in Air Force One. One liners like you hear emanating from Bruce Campbell in ""Evil Dead 3, Army of Darkness"" (ie ""Gimme some sugar, baby""). Other characters, like the reverend, have the same problem: ""A shepherd has to defend his flock *meaningful pause* and sometimes fight off the wolves"". (3)Plot: Sappy and unoriginal. The beginning scenes with the boy getting shot, house burning down, for example, were presented with little emotion; their only purpose was to turn Gibson from pacifist farmer to raging Revolutionary Rambo (hence comes the movie poster shot of Gibson loaded down with lots of muskets). (4)Historical Inaccuracy. Ok, I'm pretty anal about history, just read my review of U-571. On the other hand, I can accept artistic license. But when Hollywood starts rewriting history to puff up the good ol' USA image, it becomes a bit more than artistic license. I mean, the Brits are already up in arms about U-571 and the Patriot! If World War III between Europe and the United States is started by Hollywood, I said it first! ok, on to a few of the inaccuracies: -I seriously doubt that Tarleton massacred a village by burning them in a church or was nearly as brutal as he was portrayed in the film.<br/><br/>-In a similar vein, the Brits were portrayed as pretty bad. I guess the directors were scrounging for 'villains' (when in the Revolutionary war there were none) and decided to just vilify the British. Hey, its easy, fast, and cheap. -Until the advent of rifling in barrels, muskets were not very accurate. Revolutionary warfare was basically portrayed accurately in the film; the problem came up in the scene where Gibson and Sons slaughter 20 red coats with their sniper muskets. Not to mention all the guerrilla warfare where the colonials kill a red coat nearly every second with no casualties.<br/><br/>Good things: -the Battle Scenes were incredible. Bloody, epic, and very very cool. -Good acting by most of the cast, including Gibson et le francais. -Neat-O special effects.<br/><br/>Basically it boils down to entertainment that is severely marred by unoriginal directing and writing (ok, this is the same team who made the American ""Godzilla"", what should I expect?). Don't see it unless it's a matinee."

","'The Patriot' is the kind of title that can provoke people to either love or hate this film.  Certainly taking some liberty with history, this film about a man who defies an empire and sacrifices some very important things in his life because of it is truly a marvel of great story telling.  From the team that brought brought us the somewhat dumb but grandly entertaining 'Independence Day' in 1996, director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin have fashioned a story with a legend like Mel Gibson and a strong new comer like Heath Ledger.  This is the kind of film that can only be made in America.  It has an unwaivering amount of sheer glory in the celebration of its conflict and characters who hate to lose.  It is technically flawless and another chapter in the great career of Mel Gibson who has long surpassed the fading Harrison Ford as one of the most admired and enduring move star legends in our present time."

And, of course, the American colonists winning their independence from the Red Coats, with the 'enlisted' help of the militia run by you-know-who and his French 'side kick'.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson played the part well, however (He was better in Brave Heart though). The fight near the beginning of this 3 hour long film, where we see him using a tomahawk to butcher the enemy, is almost reminiscent of Gladiator!<br/><br/>Scenes of what cannon balls can do to a human body, even those cannon balls that are 'duds', are also visually something. Scenes of cavalry men standing there blasting each other to pieces with bayonets made me think - duck! Why couldn't they use shields? <br/><br/>Unlike some reviewers, I did not feel that Colonel Martin was a one-man army taking on the English cavalry . He was supplying encouragement to the troops (with the all-important flag waving, of course).<br/><br/>I personally found the representation of the English over-the-top. It made me think: Vietnam?

"Philby-3","Null","1","2","31 August 2000"," Mad Max meets Braveheart - history a casualty
","I did not view this movie under ideal conditions (I saw it in a technically inadequate theatre in downtown Lima, Peru) and perhaps it can be enjoyed for the spectacle, but it is essentially a rather personal story that does not work. Martin, played by Mel Gibson, with various demons in his past, goes to the Revolutionary War (1776 and all that) to avenge the death of his son. We get American heros (apart from the odd loyalist traitor), English villains except perhaps for General Cornwallis (good work by Tom Wilkinson) who does come across as something of a gentleman. Martin wages a guerrilla campaign against the British as unprincipled as the  (now defunct) Shining Path in Peru. The British, under Martin's nemesis Colonel Tavington (a smooth and nasty Jason Issacs) hit back hard, the population suffering greatly as a result.<br/><br/>The tide is turned, not by Martin and his band, but by the intervention of the French and the battle of Yorktown. So Martin has killed a lot of people, and for what? What's the point of patriotism if it's motivated by personal revenge? (At the outset, Martin is all for negotiating with dear (not so old) mad King George). If it had been the filmmakers' intention to make that point there would be no point in complaining, but instead Martin is presented as a man doing what a man's gotta do. I also took great exception to the church burning scene when as far as we know nothing like that ever happened in the Revolutionary War, though the Nazis did a fair bit of that sort of thing in World War 2.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger does nicely as Martin's son Gabriel, and I'm sure we'll see him again. After this one though I'm not sure I want to see Mel Gibson again in a movie. His is a thoroughly wooden performance, though not helped by a script full of cliches and anachronisms (eg the reference to black emancipation). Even 6 soles (US$2) was too much to pay for this film. No, read a good book about the Revolutionary War instead."

And, additionally, why must the villain and the hero meet on a chaotic battlefield and fight and be totally ignored by everyone else?  How cliched every part of this movie seemed to be.

Oh yeah, dont forget when Mel Gibson tries his hand at comedy when calling out 'All hail King George' and were made present to a bunch of hollywood nobodys, each wanting to make sure they make the most of their limited camera time by acting truly upset by the comments made by Gibson.  The  proceeding constant references to how the Redcoats 'Deserve' to die, when each of those drunken yobbos lined up to answer their calling made me almost sick.<br/><br/>Im sure Isaacs character would really have been scared when Gibson goes 'before this war is over Im going to kill you' .........Im surprised he was able to contain himself<br/><br/>Oh dear and what else narked me about this film.............<br/><br/>The speech given by the girl in the church (mind you she wont be giving too many more)<br/><br/>The way the British Soldiers were portrayed.  I mean, this whole Idea that the American Revolution consisted of backwater rebels fighting lines of redcoats is a complete fallacy and Emmerich did history no justice in this film.<br/><br/>We're also lead to imagine the british soldiers simply as a bunch of rigid lines of muskets with legs.......who have no brains and are only good for marching in solid formations across completely open fields.......it makes you wonder how the hell they do the real complicated things like flanking and stuff<br/><br/>Im just really glad the British dragoons got their fair share of action, and that Heath Ledger copped a beauty by Isaacs (best death scene ever.........and funniest).<br/><br/>Hahahah oh yeah, and look out for the extremely very very very interesting and non boring beach wedding scene.............man, it was Pam and Tommy I tell ya!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dont waste your time or money with this load of crap"

Well for starters epics are always the best, this one better than May's ""Gladiator"", but of course there's more to it than that.<br/><br/>First, Robert Rodat's surprisingly good and well paced script, which was put together a lot better than ""Saving Private Ryan"". Very emotional and unafraid to hold back on the horrors of war, it never lets up. Of course, its still the same ""I'm a leader in a war even even though I didnt choose to be"" kind of story, but it pulls you in and keeps pulling the tears from your eyes with every time a loveable character meets their horrible, brutal demise.

I kind of expected to see flat performances and some-what boring photography, which were trademarks of ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"", but it was instead very much the opposite. Beautiful lighting was this film's trademark as well as Gibson's great performance, like he always does.<br/><br/>This film should definitely garner the oscar nominations this year.

Usually my emotions come into play during the emotional parts, but despite this movie's seemingly strong efforts to provoke my emotions, it simply did not and failed pretty miserably.

I didn't walk out of the theater thinking how entertained I was, or how happy I was to be alive. I walked out wondering if it would be better if we were all dead. Those people that found Braveheart to be entertaining will find this to be so as well. However, I am getting slightly tired of writers (directors?) who think that the ""bad guy"" has to be more than bad... You know, after he murders an innocent child, I think everyone was sufficiently ready and happy to see him die, must he get worse? As if the murder of one child isn't enough for us, the writer feels if the ""bad guy"" doesn't just KEEP doing horrendous acts, we might not feel he needs to die. Must he top every horrible act with one more gruesome and depressing to the audience? Every time the movie gave me hope that some semblance of happiness or justice might come out of the show, it tore it away in the most cruel manner. Every time I started to smile at the scenes of loyalty and love, I was stunned and shocked back into my state of horror, and despair for those in the movie. When it was over, unlike the teenage boys sitting in front of me talking excitedly about how much blood there was, I felt numb. The acting was superb, the sets and costumes lovely and the filmography, fantastic. The story left me numb by the end and today, when I think of it, I wish I hadn't seen it. A lot of reviewers (professional and otherwise) like movies full of despair and without hope when they are done well. For me, I see enough of that despair, death and misery in real life, that I want at least a glimmer of hope when I spend my hard earned money to be ""entertained"". So If you want great acting, sets, and action, and you don't care about being depressed, see this movie, it truly delivers the goods. If you DON'T want to spend your money to leave the theater with a feeling of despair, I wouldn't go."

","The patriot is a brilliantly realised film in which actors ranging from the world famous to the relatively unknown play characters who's strength of mind is titanic in their struggle to rid their homeland of the evil and inhumane enemy as portrayed in the film. Forget what you read in the press about 'The Patriot' being a racist propoganda tool which falsifies the true events of history. I am English and I myself realise that a film is not to be judged on its historical accuracy or on its fairness to all nations, but it is to be seen as a work of art where sometimes, as in the case of 'The Patriot' some poetic license is needed in order to acheive the first class dramatical effect and to touch the minds of viewers. I have seen many reviews that say it is too much like braveheart, so what if it's similar-it's still a brilliant production. The shallow minds that say it is 'rubbish' or 'the most unoriginal story of the summer' must have forgotten the similarities between, 'deep impact' and 'independence day' both movies were rated highly. The amount of thought, skilled research and pure grit hard work that goes into the making of 'the patriot' is phenomenal when compared to that of 'men in black' or the infamous 'jackie chan' films. If you give that awful waste of viewers money credit then why do you scowl at the patriot because it is remotely similar to other productions. Anyway enough criticisms a huge well done to everyone on the team for the patriot, it was two and a half hours of sheer brilliance!!!!!!!!!!!"

","As a British person, I am not in the least worried about the ludicrous fake history in the film.  What I have found is that you can instantly silence any American that raises the subject of The American Revolution with some hard facts:  The chattering classes in London supported the American revolution since they hated George III every bit as much as the Americans did.  That almost half colonists were against serving the union and were treated terribly by the rebels, and that the Boston tea party was a protest not against British taxes but against the removal of the duty on tea.  The men dressed up as Indians in Boston harbour were smugglers whose livelihood had disappeared.  Finally I would say ""the American revolution was a victory for the British since British settlers under the command of a British general defeated German mercenaries under a German King."""

It is not until his oldest son enlists and his 15-year-old son is murdered by a truly worthless excuse for a gentlemanly British officer (Jason Isaacs) that he joins the fight.<br/><br/>The battles are epic, as we would expect from a movie released almost exactly a week before July 4, and the story is relatively familiar ground.

","This is really quite good--a def. improvement on Emmerich/Devlin's last opus, Godzilla. That one was kinda poopoo. Here, they take trad. flag waving war films of the 50s, mix in a good miniseries feel(the families, character bits, etc, length), Mel's patented Lethal Braveheart moves, and tossed in big production values.<br/><br/>Quite flag wavy, hokey in places, sure--but you have to love it, plus the fact that it was based on a real guy makes it even better. Gibson was fine, solid as always. Got a big kick half ways through the film when it finally dawned on me who the baddie was-kept on asking Who Is that Guy? over and over. It's 'Dr Ronald Quincy from Research, pretty much the smartest guy on the planet-you may wanna listen to him'-from Armageddon!! Boys does he pull it off too, does a great job, in a role that in the olden days woulda gone to either Henry Daniell or George Sanders. We hate him, we root for Mel to get him. Simple as that.<br/><br/>Now, am sure this isn't exactly a documentary, the ghost was prob. as flawed a guy as Ethan Allen or Yassir Arafat for all I know. He killed for a living, at least as presented. Big deal. This is a Movie. Remember that first and foremost.Here you can put away the ugliness of real life and sink into a Hollywoodized Rev. War depiction that actually gets it right more often than not for a change.<br/><br/>I admire Emmerich for including the random acts of brutality and violence from both sides, so they can actually show what the Rev. War actually looked like. It wasn't just guys in red, all in a line, firing their muskets at guys in blue-with wigs and drums and pipes, it was also blood, decapitations, killed POWs, disease, fires, slaughtered innocents.<br/><br/>Devlin and co have put a good chunk of that into this, and for that you are better served.<br/><br/>I would give this *** outta ****-too long in places, somewhat over-mindful of 'Last of the Mohicans' or 'Braveheart' in others, kinda hokey-but over all, its the kind of flick that oughta be done more often by Hollywood.<br/><br/>Go see it."

","Considering the amount of time and money that Hollywood has invested in chronicling America's other wars on film, it is surprising that it has taken nearly a century to create the first great film about the Revolutionary War. The Patriot is a stirring epic that is historically accurate while remaining thoroughly entertaining (what happens to Martin's family actually happened to a number of the signers of the Declaration).  Mel Gibson gives one of his strongest performances as Benjamin Martin, a widower and former war hero who strives to protect his family from the horrors of war.  And as his son, Gabriel, Heath Ledger comes into his own following the promise he showed in his breakthrough performance in ""10 Things I Hate About You""  The acting is uniformly strong, the effects terrific, and the visuals gorgeous. While the film is weighted down by a couple of clichÃ©d themes (the black man fighting for his freedom and the white man who learns to respect him for doing so...I don't know if there was a certain amount of irony intended in this, but even so, it's a pointless sub-theme).  While there are some gory war scenes, ""The Patriot"" is really an honest love story between a father and his family, and is well worth the admission price."
"cutahotha","Null","1","2","7 July 2000"," Tired of the Whining
","The Patriot is an excellent movie and a definite must-see. I'm not going to bore you with plot details, etc., you can read that in countless prior posts. However, as to the constant whining that events like these never occurred during the Revolutionary War and that the British would never have resorted to such tactics is quite humorous.<br/><br/>The character of the evil Tavington is based on the real-life British officer Banastre ""Bloody"" Tarleton, who probably made the screen version of Tavington look like a saint. Where did he get the nickname ""Bloody"" from you ask?....well it wasn't because he donated blood to the Red Cross! In May of 1780 at the Waxhaws, South Carolina, Tarleton and his British soldiers slaughtered 113 Virginia Continentals by bayonet and wounded nearly 200 more AFTER the Americans had called for quarter and showed a flag of truce!! That is where Tarleton's legend began and it was how he became the most hated British soldier in the Southern theater of the Rev. War. It became known as ""Tarleton's Quarter"" and it was the first of many atrocities committed by the psychopath.<br/><br/>Paybacks are a bitch though, and at the Battle of Cowpens Tarleton lost 900 men killed, wounded or captured, about 90% of his force. The American forces lost 12 men killed.<br/><br/>The war in the South basically amounted to a Civil War among Patriots and Loyalists, and as everyone knows those are the worst and bloodiest kind. While it's true that most of the atrocities committed in that area were actually between the Patriots and the Loyalists,  the British regulars, most notably Tarleton, had a big hand in the activities as well.<br/><br/>It's also true that in ANY war there are atrocities committed by all sides, no one is clean in that respect, that's why they say war is hell. But for people to keep crying that events like those depicted never happened and were never perpetrated by the British are simply wrong.<br/><br/>Others have talked about the unbelievable scenes where Gibson singlehandedly kills several British soldiers like a Revolutionary Rambo. Well, I don't know for sure, but some of those occurrences may have been taken from the real-life Patriot named Peter Francisco. A very large man for that period in time, Francisco, at Guilford Courthouse in 1781 cut down 11 British soldiers with his five-foot sword, and later at Ward's Tavern in Virginia he held off 9 British dragoons single-handed.<br/><br/>The ""Patriot"" is a movie and that's all. If some of you people want to watch a documentary tune to the History Channel. It's the same thing with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" where so many British or Canadians were crying that, ""They didn't even mention anything about us;  why weren't we featured?; they just want to make it look like America won the war all by themselves. Cry, Cry, Cry!!""  It was an AMERICAN film about AMERICAN soldiers on an AMERICAN mission for God's sake! Again, if you want to watch a documentary go to the History Channel, or better yet, make your own films about the events. I promise we won't cry if the Americans aren't mentioned!<br/><br/>While there are several ""inaccuracies"" in the ""Patriot"", the events and characters in the movie have a lot of basis in truth and actual history."

","Just wanted to note that not everything you see in this film is true. The most controversial one was the rounding up of women and children and putting them death. This alone spoiled the film for me as it was not only not true it was grossly unfair to the British and how they conducted war. Does anyone in their right mind believe that the Americans would have come into WW2 to save the British if an event like that had really taken place. Not a chance.<br/><br/>More likely it was a crude attempt to compare the British with the Nazi's who did in a very famous incident round up women and children and burned them in a church in Ordouver France. That was the most glaring inaccuracy. The other most glaring inaccuracie was the treatment of the people who became the United Empire Loyalists and emigrated to Canada after the war. Yes there were soldiers but remember they were soldiers in the British army taking orders. They were not brutal monsters as the movie would have us believe. Nor were others who were eventually made up the United Empire Loyalists. They just supported the losing side. In fact there were well documented brutal attacks by the American patriots on the United Empire Loyalists after the war. So who were the brutes?<br/><br/>Most of the others were dumb like firing muskets in the rain. Sorry you can not light a musket in the rain. The movie was reasonably good but the glaring inaccuracies spoiled it. Unfortunately the vast majority of people will blithfully accept it as the truth. It appears the first casualty of a war movie is also truth. The makers of the film should be taken to task for this."

This was a war fought for wealthy land owners, by the poor who were told they would be much better off with independence, and the government that created was NOT one where 'everyone is created equally under God' despite what a character says in this movie while sewing an American flag.

It followed the same boring Hollywood formula of a ""really nice guy who once did some bad stuff now has to do something he really doesn't want to do because forces conspire to leave him no option"".

"Chowdah","Null","1","2","3 July 2000"," Devolves from a good start, into dumb action, then finally insulting your intelligence
","I had high hopes for the Patriot coming into the film, but was disappointed after the first 30 minutes.  The movie starts with an intriguing premise. Mel is a guy who doesn't want to fight because he has personal demons from the past, and is a single parent raising a large family.  Obviously, at some point the British push him too far, and he gets Revolutionary on their red-coated behinds.  There is a very well done, hair-raising rescue/ambush scene which kind of sets up that the movie won't just be a simple revenge melodrama, but that Mel's war will really be one about overcoming personal demons, and holding his family together.<br/><br/>But just as quickly, they toss all this good setup out the window.  It becomes a simple revenge melodrama.  They tick off Mel, and he grabs his monogrammed tomahawk and turns into the terminator.  Now I like these kind of movies too, so I was prepared to shrug my shoulders, relax and see a dumb summer action movie.<br/><br/>But then they don't do this right either.  The movie devolves into a series of extremely violent but hokey situations, fakey relationships, cliches galore, and trite attempts at tying up all the plot's loose ends.  The worst thing about this, is that it's all done in the name of ""historical accuracy"".<br/><br/>The film, IHMO, is *not* historically accurate at all.  And I'm not saying that as a stickler for getting a proper history lesson at the expense of seeing a good movie.  I like dumb action movies as much as the next guy. But the story is so cliched and manipulative that the what little historical accuracy is achieved on the part of the Smithsonian-advised production designers/costumers (etc) is wasted on situations that are totally implausible.<br/><br/>For example, Mel's slaves are ""conveniently"" freedmen working for wages. Joely Richardson's plantation slaves are very accurately costumed, but seemingly happy (yes happy!), and only exist in the film so the British can blow them away (to alert the main characters that they're in danger, kind of like the pack-bearers in a Tarzan movie who get killed off so the main characters know to duck).<br/><br/>Finally, Mel's family escapes to a real place, Gullah island, populated by escaped slaves (real-life historical reenactors who sing Gullah-dialect songs and practice traditional Gullah crafts).  All this ""historical accuracy"" is a bust, because when Mel's family arrives, none of the islanders even asks what a bunch of white slaveowners are doing in their village, or who the heck they are!  All they do is provide happy, singing local color, and imply that America was racially harmonius and united against the British.  But mostly, Gullah island is just like the Ewok village in Return of the Jedi.  I kid you not!<br/><br/>And how come the movie takes place over 7 years time, but at the end, Mel's kids haven't aged a day?  How come a bunch of swamp-based guerilla fighters always seem dressed immaculately?  Especially Mel in his suit and starched collar?  And why do battles always take place at dawn or dusk, and the sun always backlights everyone?  And how come after he totally alienates his kids, they all suddenly love him because it's convenient to the plot?<br/><br/>And the cliches!  The British are the usual bunch of stereotypical effeminate jerks.  There are three scenes in which British leaders are told bad news while being dressed or shaved.  Then they have a tantrum.  The evil villain has no depth.  All he does is kill stuff evilly.  If there were baby seals to club and whales to harpoon, he'd do it in each scene.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT:<br/><br/>he even gets shot, and while seemingly dead, suddenly springs back to life to kill a major character.  Is this cliche?  Just rent Halloween 1,2,3,4; Friday the 13th 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 & 8; and all the Freddy Kruger movies to find out!  Oh yeah, and Mel pulls the same move later on.  Twice in one movie. Yecch.<br/><br/>ANOTHER MINOR SPOILER ALERT:<br/><br/>And the worst thing that happens in the Patriot, is that LOTS of people die (probably a higher body count than the actual war).  Mel loses half his family.  A guy loses his wife and child so he blows his brains out.  An entire church full of the guerilla fighters' loved ones is burned to death. Yet at the end, everyone is way too happy, AS IF NONE OF IT EVER HAPPENED! Un-freakin-believable.  And the attitude of the film makers is ""see, you're seeing something really profound and moving"".  No I'm not!  I'm just seeing a blah action movie with characters who use Freddy Kruger-Fu in lieu of intelligence or a good plot.<br/><br/>There are so many more problems like this, they are beyond counting. There are so many, no matter how much I wanted to like the Patriot, I couldn't ignore them.  After 2 hours and 40 minutes of trying to like the Patriot, all it did was make me want to grab a monogrammed tomahawk and exact vengeance on the film makers."
"Pelagia","6","1","2","4 July 2000"," Too Many Bad Laughs, Not Enough ""Heart"".
","***Spoiler Alert***<br/><br/>Besides its many faults, there are actually a few scenes that really shine in this movie.<br/><br/>No doubt this is an action movie, and looking back to the  previous Mel Gibson movie ""Braveheart"", the audience is revved up for some intense, gore-filled scenes.  The first action scene which involves Gibson's character and his two young sons ambushing a small band of British soldiers was ingenious.  The cinematography was spectacular.  Its a shame to say that the following action sequences were lacking in color and originality, and even seemed to be quite repetitive.  No doubt a  bad guy that seemingly defies death time after time is almost comical in a place where comedy doesn't fit.  What is this guy, a cat?  How many lives does he have?  Its like the Super Mario game, where you keep throwing Koopa into the lava, but the sucker keeps coming back!<br/><br/>Another scene that stands out in mind is a brilliant ""battle-of-wits"" between Gibson and the much-feared General Cornwallis.  The dialogue hits right on the spot, and the last shot of the general's aide walking in with the ""released officer"" was film at its best.  No doubt this is when I figured out that the movie worked best with it worked on its comedic elements, when used properly, however.  There is quite a bit of material here that is unfailingly prone to bad laughs.<br/><br/>Gibson fares very well amidst the chaos of a script that tries too hard to hit the audience's emotional and patriotic buttons.  It is important to notice that the bright spots of the film are those run by Gibson and his natural acting ability to cover every possible range of acting (he is quite remarkable at that).  The rest of the film is too overbearing with shallow melodrama and ""cardboard characters"".  The actors that take up the small parts do little but play into stereotypes and little virtuosity is exhibited.<br/><br/>To have made this a better movie, the filmmakers would have been wise to spend a little more time in the editing room, cutting out the unnecessary melodrama bits that make the movie so long, create a little bit of character intrigue in the antagonists, and most of all focus more on Gibson; the large band of characters and their adjoining, uninteresting subplots drain away from the focus of the film.<br/><br/>Which reminds me, what was the focus of the film?  Oh, thats right, patriotism.  Since we live in a society that holds such cynical regards to such words as patriotism, couldn't a better theme or title been aplied here? Nobody bought that silly Hulk  Hogan ""say your prayers, eat your vitamins, and salute your flag"" slogan, so why should anyone now?<br/><br/>There was that other war, called Vietnam, that put a big damper on that patriot stuff.  Ok, you can say I'm reading too much into the themes here, but at least take a second to think about it.<br/><br/>6 of 10."

","I didn't expect it to be astounding.  After all, 97% of the movies that are released during the summer are meant to appeal to anyone possible, except those who expect films to bring out more than trite surface emotions.  This movie pulled out all the stops, man's son dies, man seeks revenge, bad-guy (who is inherantly evil and shows not a shred of humanity) dies a bloody death, little girl cries, boy and girl fall in love and die... on and on and on.  There's nothing you haven't seen before.  I was disappointed for the same reasons as the others, so I won't bore you by basically repeating their comments.<br/><br/>I would, however, like to comment about the voting on this site.  It seems that many who believe their opinion is worth more than the rest of the voters have decided to compensate for those whose votes they disagree with. 20 people (last I checked) scored this movie a 1 out of 10.  Now, unless these people honestly think this was among the worst movies of all time, it is obvious that they thought the average score was too high, so they decided to bring it down a bit.  Are you saying that The Patriot is as bad as movies like Superman 4 or Billy Jack Goes to Washington (both of which I STILL wouldn't give 1's, maybe 3's...)  I doubt it.  So vote YOUR opinion, regardless of others, and quit trying to sway the average score to fit yours."

","First of all, there is nothing about patriotism in this movie, except some motivational speeches that are glued into the movie especially to remind the viewer about the patriotic feeling that he's supposed to be experiencing, like the rallying up the men discourse in the church, when half of the audience in the theatre was laughing out loud. <br/><br/>The movie is about primal reactions in the face of cruelty and violence inflicted upon your beloved or simply upon innocent people. That's what has driven Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson's character) in the previous war, when he became a legend, and that's what drives him now. He first reacts to save his elder brother from being hanged and to avenge his other son's death, and keeps on fighting in order to protect his son, and later again out of the wish for revenge and for not letting his son's ideals die with him.<br/><br/>The scenes in the movie seem artificially connected, and the moral speeches actually disturb the mood and the pace the movie is managing at some point to settle into. <br/><br/>Instead of being a good action movie, set in the Independence war period and showing some of the drama that happened then and the way people reacted (or actually how they were forced to react) to it, the movie resorts to the overused and overhyped american virtues and places them at the wrong moments and in the wrong tone, destroying also the quality of the action flick.<br/><br/>In spite of good cinematography, and good performances by Tcheky Karyo and Jason Isaacs, I only gave the movie a 4/10 which I might change later into a 5."

","By far one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. I was expecting so much after all the hype and the good reviews I had seen by so many other people. This movie fails in so many ways: There was way too much extraneous footage;It could have easily been an hour shorter.    So many of the scenes were so cheesy. They tried to make them sentimental or emotional and it just plain failed e.g. the scene where Mel's youngest daughter starts crying, ""I'll say anything you want just don't go."" It felt so fake.   The dialogue was poorly written also. The only well done scene in the whole movie IMO was when Mel goes after and slaughters the 20 red coats. That was the only scene that can even be partially compared to the greatness of BraveHeart."

","Mel Gibson stars in this year's Braveheart, The Patriot,directed and produced by the two guys that brought ID4 and Godzilla. It also stars Heath Ledger, Joely Richardson, and Chris Cooper. Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a French and Indian war hero, father of seven, who doesn't want to fight in this war but when the war comes home, the only thing he can do is fight. And if you've seen a Mel Gibson action film, when something happens to his loved one he goes crazy, real crazy. The film is a very good history lesson in the Revolutionary War. It goes over a lot of historical moments and talks about a lot of people. This isn't a war movie without battle scenes and they are intense. They are extremely bloody and get the ""war is violent"" point across very well. They have a John Woo type quality to them(a lot of slow motion). Mel does what Mel does best, good acting, brings a coolness to the screen and kicks a lot of butt. Heath Ledger does a good job as well as Gibson's oldest son. He proves that he can do a big budget action film and can hold his own with a huge superstar. The one thing The Patriot falls short in is the dramatic gaps between the action. They run very long and make this film longer than it should be. The Patriot is a fantastic film that is a must see but it's  long(over 2 and a half hours) and one very bloody film."

","This movie is one of, if not THE most brilliant movie I've ever seen! The screenwriters were obviously trying to show the harsh reality of the Revolutionary War, showing women and children being killed along with the soldiers. The scenery was incredible, the music score breathtaking!<br/><br/>But note, behind the ""Action Epic"" exterior of the film, there is a heartbreaking story underneath. Although the previews may not show it, nearly EVERY emotion the human body has, will be expressed while watching this film: Rage and fury were expressed most by me when British officers put the innocent to death right before the eyes of their loved ones; along with sadness and sympathy (shall I say flowing tears?) when the characters you loved were unexpectedly killed. This movie is not a predictable war story, where the ""good guy always wins"" ... Although the monsters in the story get what's coming to them, the good guys have definitely lost something.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is FABULOUS! The whole movie is you seeing out of his eyes...You see the horrors he sees and feel the anger he feels. Heath Ledger was the reason I saw this movie, and it was definitely worth it. Both actors were incredible!<br/><br/>I'd say that this film is for the 15+ audience, for it is extremely violent and graphic, but with NO swearing (2 words at the most) and no sex (although, romance certainly blossoms). The camera work in the film is Oscar-worthy! The battle scenes show constant impaling, decapitations, and endless bloodshed. The scenes can easily be compared to those of Saving Private Ryan: both films written by Robert Rodat.<br/><br/>I give this movie a definite 4 stars! A brilliant film ... and heartbreaking story.  ****"

I even vowed to name me child 'Gabriel' after Heath's character.( By the way, Heath Ledger is unmistakably HOTT). <br/><br/>My only problem with the movie is that, after my uncle committed suicide, I didn't find the scene in which one of the militiamen commits suicide proper to enclose. It was too hard to watch after witnessing it in real life. However, no respect for the movie was lost, and I felt that I could relate in many ways.

","Not so many movies tackle this part of the American history/world history.<br/><br/>The script and plot are far more subtle than some would have it.For instance, look at and listen closely to the convention held in Charleston at the beginning of the picture. It is magnificent drama and magnificently rhetorical indeed (a treat!!) . Mel Gibson is overwhelmingly brilliant. ""Would you tell me please, Mr. Howard,Why should I trade one tyrant 3000 miles away for 3000 tyrants one mile away?"" (Mel Gibson's ""why""is still echoing..). I find no weakness in the plot, of course some are ill at ease with good sentiments and patriotism, but the film is much more than that. The encounter with Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson is ever so impressive)is superb. The stark contrast between the English side and the American one may seem a caricature, but I am convinced it does reflect the profound differences that could be found at that time. As for the cast, the fact that all the red coats are played by English actors enhances the quality of the whole undertaking. The French actor Tcheky Karyo also adds to the compelling dimension of the film. Every part is brilliantly acted and we must not underestimate the quality of the performance of Heath Ledger or that of the colonel of the British cavalry. Watching this film only once is a crime.

","Films like this one are hard to review because most all of them, if not all of them, have inaccuracies. History films are quite a bit misleading.

These types are just a movie and not a history lesson.<br/><br/>The film itself is good. Has an interesting story, good characters (and the actors playing them), great visuals, good effects, beautiful cinematography, super sets and costumes etc... everything needed for a good movie - it's just not historically accurate (like other films in the History genre).<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","As many have said this movie isn't historically accurate. What most haven't told you, is that is the least of this movie's problems.<br/><br/>The story was clichÃ© and predictable. Which is fine for many popcorn action flicks, but for a historical epic, you expect to be told a fresh story that makes you feel something. Braveheart was a great movie, even though it wasn't historically accurate at all. Braveheart and moving scenes and gave you something you weren't expecting.<br/><br/>The characters were either bland or simply poorly developed. You never got attached to any of the characters, so it was hard to really feel for them. Mel Gibson's family was a big part of the movie yet we knew little about them. Only Heath Ledger's character even got legitimate time for the audience to know him. His relationship with his wife to be was rushed and you knew little of their history or why they fell for one another. Mel Gibson's relationship with his ex wife's sister was laughable, and seemed to be thrown in just so Mel could have a kissing scene.<br/><br/>All of the characters in Mel's group were just thrown in except for his French sidekick who did get at least some time for development. That was really the problem with this movie. Few of the characters were developed properly, and their relationship towards each other was done poorly by the filmmakers. It is hard to get excited about a movie when you don't feel for any of the characters like this movie."

","Foreign readers: Don't blame America for this movie! It's got a German director and an Australian star - Gibson. And Gibson has a track record of anti-British movies.<br/><br/>Most Americans know this movie is not accurate. It's sad that some foreigners might form opinions based on this vile, hate-mongering manure.<br/><br/>To watch this movie is to learn what it feels like to be covered head to toe with sweet smelling vomit.<br/><br/>The British soldiers are portrayed as 18th century versions of Nazi Storm Troopers, and Jason Isaacs playing a fictional Col. William Tavington as an unbridled sadist who kills, burns and pillages just for the fun of it.<br/><br/>The high point of the movie, so to speak, is when Tavington locks the townspeople in a church -- after they tell him what he wants, ratting out a fellow patriot -- and burns the entire town, women, children, men, boys, to death. <br/><br/>I know something about the history of the Revolution, and had never heard of this. Apparently, it is based on a Nazi war crime, not anything done by the British. The movie is directed by a German, Roland Emmerich, which perhaps tells us something.<br/><br/>The movie seems to follow the Mel Gibson formula of ultra good guys vs ultra bad guys (usually the British) with lots of graphic blood and guts violence. It would be technically interesting to count how many times we must witness a musket ball hitting a body and blood spurting out, for someone with a strong stomach. Is there a point here? <br/><br/>The acting in the movie, overall, is nothing special, but Gibson's performance is by far the worst. Witnessing this travesty by Gibson kept bringing to mind the parodies of silent picture acting from ""Singing in the Rain."" People all around him are dying, yet the best Gibson can summon up in the emotions department is empty, over-blown gesturing. This might have qualified as acting in the 1920s, but not today.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson could act, once. He did it in The Year of Living Dangerously. But now apparently it is too much work for him, despite the $25 million they paid him for this performance. <br/><br/>I don't mind a good old fashioned movie with heroes and villains, and I'm sure there were heroes and villains on both sides of the Revolution. But this movie doesn't find them. All it finds are caricatures of heroes and villains."

","Having watched this film several times and also having an interest in the American War of Independence I must say that while it is very entertaining the accuracy and portrayal of both the British and Americans was very inaccurate...For example although Tavington who was loosely based on Tarleton 'Bloody Ban' as he was known was not as bloody as he was portrayed in the film..The only real occasion that a church full of people was burnt in the war was at Gnadenhutten when American forces killed over 100 peaceful Christian men women and children of the Delaware and Munsee tribes.Scalped them for the bounty and then set fire to the church where the bodies were buried! A second really bad portrayal is of the way slaves were treated...The British under Cornwallis recruited runaway slaves in the South to serve in the army and as a special Pioneer Corps ( Rather creatively called 'The Black Pioneers') and when the war was lost a main sticking point for the British government was that freed slaves who served the British were not returned to their owners but allowed to go to Canada...Also the coastal village was a real place settled by free slaves however it was destroyed by the Americans towards the end of the war and all the people either killed or sold back into bondage!! The American war of Independence was also far more of a civil war with the usual atrocities committed on both sides but generally not by the British army. Although the whole skew of the film is very pro American it is an entertaining romp with good battle scenes and strong characters--Although Mel Gibson does seem to either be 'folksy dad' or 'Mad Max' the end battle based on Cowpens is quite an accurate portrayal of the engagement. If anybody this side of the Atlantic wants to see this film I would recommend it with a strong 'this is not history' warning!!"

","As a ""blockbuster"" US film of nearly 3 hours long it is visually interesting and has a number of superb and gory battle scenes. A number of scenes are highly sentimentalised and improbable for my taste,the killing in the woods by Gibson with his sons, culminating in the tomahawk attack on the redcoat in the river, the massacre of the townsfolk in the burning church and the highly emotionally charged speech of Anne Howard, earlier in the film, in the church, shaming the men folk into rallying for the cause. Women of this time wouldn't have done that; it would take another 200 years of change in society for young women to be able to come close to doing anything like it. <br/><br/>The British are filmed as a murderous, butchering race with a complete lack of morals, mainly down to the portrayal of Col. Tavington. There is a sense of British fair play in the form of Cornwallace but this disappears as quickly as his dogs, when he realises the colonials have duped him on the prisoner exchange. Gibson, as an actor, doesn't seem to like the British too much, revelling in this Braveheart in leather knee britches outing. <br/><br/>Well worth watching as a film, but should be viewed with your tongue placed firmly in your cheek and your disbelief in its highest suspension!"

","The more often I saw this film the better I liked it. Obviously it is a work of fiction but it wasn't hard for me to see that two key features were based on actual events from the Revolutionary War--first, Mel Gibson's character was loosely (very loosely) based on the exploits of Francis Marion, an American revolutionary hero who conducted guerrilla warfare against the British in South Carolina, the same setting as in the movie. Interestingly, the real Francis Marion fought against British dragoons (cavalry) commanded by a Sir Banister Tarleton and Mel Gibson's antagonist was a dragoon commander named Tavington. Second, the climatic battle at the end of the film is clearly based on the Battle of Cowpens, and yes, the real Sir Banister Tarleton actually led the British forces at Cowpens, not General Cornwallis, but escaped the defeat. And the real American victory at Cowpens did, in fact, lead directly to the final British defeat at Yorktown. Actually I think the real history was more exciting than the movie. To my mind, the only real downside to the film was the characterization of the British officer, Tavington. I think the film went way overboard in making the character out to be a hateful and sadistic villain. The atrocities shown were so extreme for a British officer of that age as to be unbelievable. All in all, though, I enjoy watching the film."
"fisherforrest","9","1","3","2 December 2004"," It's an exciting example of historical fiction
","The main foreground characters and action are mostly fiction, but the spirit of the partisan actions in the Carolinas during the Civil War is honestly stated. ""Benjamin Martin"", a veteran of the French and Indian Wars, in which he apparently committed some acts of which he is now ashamed, is reluctant to get involved in the American rebellion against British rule. He has a large family of which he is very fond and caring. When a very over zealous and sadistic British colonel murders his next to oldest son, he goes berserk. Single-handed, he kills a patrol of 20 solders and frees his captive oldest son. After that, he becomes a partisan leader and there is no stopping him.<br/><br/>We see the English campaign in the Carolinas mostly through ""Benjamin Martin"", and we follow him to the final defeat of Cornwallis. The ""Martin"" family affairs are fiction, but there is little doubt that tragic incidents like those portrayed, i.e. house burnings, killing of civilians, etc. actually occurred. The character ""Martin"" is probably based in part on the real life partisan Francis Marion, famous as ""The Swamp Fox"". Along with several other similar guerrilla leaders, Marion dealt the redcoats some serious blows, similar to those portrayed in the film.<br/><br/>I found this an excellent semi-docudrama, with the fictional family serving as a canvas on which to paint the hellishness of war, even in a good cause.

"cpkoeneman","8","1","3","17 June 2004"," Hero Holds Family Together
","The film begins with Benjamin Martin, played by Mel Gibson, foreseeing the coming of the Revolutionary War. Martin was a hero for the Americans in the French and Indian War and has a personal knowledge of what war is like. While he supports the ideals of the rebels, Martin does not support the war because he fears for his family. One of Martin's sons is then killed by a British Colonel (Jason Isaacs), and this inspires him to join the war effort. Martin and his eldest son form a militia and carry out a series of guerrilla-style attacks on the British. Martin is motivated by revenge on the Colonel and the film culminates in a battle between Martin and the Colonel.<br/><br/>The central idea of the film is to show how war affects people on an individual level rather than on a broader scale, and this approach is very effective. It presents Martin as a man who struggles to hold his family together in the midst of a war. Within the family, the movie focuses on the father-son relationship between Martin and his eldest son, Gabriel, played by Heath Ledger. Through the battles that they fight side-by-side and in their conversation about love, Benjamin and Gabriel become closer than they had ever been. This theme of the family is an aspect to which everyone can relate and allows ""The Patriot"" to hit close to home.<br/><br/>Many elements of the film are outstanding, including the director's use of the beautiful South Carolina countryside. Also, many scenes are shot at dusk, which causes the viewer to pay more attention to detail. The casting is excellent-Gibson appears to have a connection with the children that only a real father could portray. Especially commendable is the way in which the director uses camera shots to focus on what he wants the viewer to see. Many times in this movie the actions between the characters show us more about their relationships than does the dialogue. ""The Patriot"" uses these aspects and more to superbly show the effect that the American Revolution had on this family."

","After four years, this film still draws comment.  I suspect the negative comments/reviews are no longer plentiful, as these viewers have moved on. On the other hand, there are the fans who still care a lot about PATRIOT in a way that could be described as ""cultist"". I love military history, along with how it is depicted in films. The American Revolution has had very little exposure, but the few efforts were memorable...Pacino's REVOLUTION and THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE (Lancaster, Douglas, Olivier? What a great cast! Oh yeah, and written by George Bernard Shaw!).  The plot line in PATRIOT is fairly standard stuff, as are the visual trappings (REVOLUTION looked good, too.).  The battle scenes (Camden and Guilford/Cowpens) are truly magnificent.  For the first time, we get a view of 18th century warfare as it was.  The details are many, and the flaws are few (British cannons the size of siege guns?  Not being dragged around the Carolinas!). Computer-enhanced battalions looked great...just think if they had Peter Jackson's computer program!  Pellenor Fields meets Saratoga!  I served time during the Bi-Centennial as a British military re-enactor and can recognize and sympathize with the British line infantry in PATRIOT.

"JAM-31","Null","1","3","13 February 2002"," More of an action film than historical fiction (Some Spoilers)
","The Emmerich-Devlin-Rodat team set out to accomplish a great deal when they began production on ""The Patriot."" The American Revolution is full of great stories and dramatic events, but surprisingly there aren't many films on this period. The film makers wanted to fill this void and also dispel many of the myths about the revolution, and present the truth that, as Dean Devlin said, ""the revolution started in the north, was fought in the south, and was won by the French."" <br/><br/>""The Patriot"" isn't a horrible movie, but it fails on many levels. First, the issue of slavery: Well, while his sister-in-law has slaves, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) has black ""workers"" who work for him out of their own free-will. This is a difficult issue to deal with. Francis Marion, the character whom Benjamin is based on, did have slaves, and he was guilty of many other horrible things. Depicting Martin with these workers is basically a white-wash of the period--so much that it's offensive. Although at the time freedom, separation of church and state, and free speech were considered revolutionary ideas, audiences could not root for a slave-owner. Perhaps it would have worked better if Martin had neither slaves nor these `workers' employed for him.  As presented in the film, it doesn't appear genuine--it's a cop-out.<br/><br/>Second, the raw brutality of the film is so manipulative that it's almost flat out ridiculous. Nobody, we learn early on, is safe from being killed off, just to get a rise out of us. ""The Patriot"" premiered at a time when unflinching realism was politically correct and popular with audiences. In some ways it seems as if Emmerich, Devlin, and Rodat wanted to cash in on this phenomenon, if not to at least add their own entry to the genre of shocking, harsh war films. Jason Isaacs as Col. Tavington gives a completely monstrous performance, having no sympathy for anyone, in one scene stuffing all the inhabitants of a village into a church and burning it to the ground. Many atrocities were committed during the American Revolution, but this scene is not an accurate representation of events that occurred at this time (Dean Devlin admits on the commentary track that the scene was complete artistic license.) But the scene wasn't even necessary--in fact, all Tavington needed to do to appear a ""monster"" was shoot prisoners of war (in which case, ""Tarleton,"" the character he is based on, did.) Another embarrassing scene that (thankfully) didn't make it to the final cut had Tarleton torturing one of his defiant victims, brazenly claiming to him that he `always' does his worst.  American audiences do not need to be convinced that the Revolution was necessary. In fact, ""The Patriot"" would have been much more successful if it had been ambiguous--tough, uncouth, and unsaintly militia taking on a more humane British enemy would have been more intriguing. Many of the militia members are rough and unmerciful, but the general black and white theme is present at all times. Other problems include various inaccuracies, like those amazingly accurate pistols from the 18th century, that always seem to find their targets.  A monologue from Mel Gibson about one of his past atrocities is so clichéd it fails to have any impact.  A character plays dead, faking out his opponent, dating back to action films of the 80's (or before.)  And let's not forget that unforgivable line, `It's a free country or at least it will be.'<br/><br/>These strong weaknesses definitely demote the film, especially considering that it was created to earn prestige and acclaim.  But `The Patriot' does succeed on some levels, and it is worth seeing.  Mel Gibson claims that he strongly identified with his Benjamin Martin, being that he is also a father of seven children.  This strengthens his credible performance.  The period sets, costumes, and a great assemblage of character actors create awesome spectacle, and the film is photographed very well.  Many of the film's most obvious exploits do work: A moment between Benjamin Martin and one of his daughters is truly touching, and Heath Ledger's apology to his father about one of his past mistakes is a very moving scene.  The sound and visual effects are very good, and so are many of the battle scenes.  The theme that militia tactics were a large factor in the defeat of the by-the-book British is what works best.  <br/><br/>I enjoyed ""The Patriot,"" I just wish they did better.  Grade: B-/C+"

Unfortunately those few moments were ridiculous anyway.<br/><br/>  Good points: Gibson was good and the cinematography was beautiful.<br/><br/>   The Patriot was long, tedious, cringe-inducing, and did not make me feel Patriotic in the least.

I've read that this was something Mel Gibson pushed through, and that the original script intended Gibson's character to hold slaves. I agree with director Spike Lee in his criticism that this is an obvious false representation of history.

Yes, he apparently has secret state-of-the-art rapid fire rifles, which he shoots and reloads with insanely fast speed for the time period and the weapons he was using.  And the silliest part is that the writer manipulated the audience very unsubtly by including scenes where the Torries run around raping, pilaging, and unremorsefully killing any colonists they can find.  Therefore, we have to clearly know that the enemy must be the British, and Benjamin Martin must kick their a**, because then the audience could get their money's worth of satisfaction.  Blah!  Show the viewers something that surprises us.  The Patriot wasn't at all surprising."

In every war there are victims and butchers, but I don't consider it necessary to collect all the bad things in the world and put them together in one person. The result is something like an incarnation of satan.

","Never have I been more proud to be an American than after watching The Patriot.  The American population should really appreciate this film for how it portrays our early settlers.  The Patriot shows just how much the opportunity to be free from the British meant to the colonists. <br/><br/>
Mel Gibson is wonderful as Col. Benjamin Martin, the leader of the militia that single-handedly defeated the advancing British legions one by one. Gibson is by no means a newcomer to period movies such as this, but in my opinion he did a far superior job this time around than Braveheart.  He is more convincing in The Patriot, and he really shows his emotional side on several occasions with one of his daughters.  I couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role, and quite frankly, I'm glad I don't have to.<br/><br/>
Heath Ledger plays Col. Martin's son Gabriel.  I must admit that I didn't particularly like Ledger in this role.  He seems more of a wimp, than a great hero for his family.  He never comes across as the strong, revengeful type that needs to be portrayed in his role as the son that goes to fight for his newly formed country, then turns personal when the `enemy' kills his brother.<br/><br/>Upon first review of this film, and I use the term film very loosely for this film is more than that, it should be referred to as an epic, I thought it to be put together very well, very free flowing with no holes or slow parts.  I was conversing with a friend of mine about this film, and it was his opinion that it was filled with everything that we ever heard about this period, and they might have thrown too much into its 2 ½ hour running time. I don't necessarily agree with him on that, but I do believe that not enough was said about Col. Benjamin Martin's time spent fighting before the movie starts.  <br/><br/>All in all I believe The Patriot to be a great epic film about our early beginning here in the United States of America, and I feel that it was a convincing portrayal of the moral of the early settlers early on.  It most definitely deserves my 10 stars, and should be considered for Best Picture come this March."

","Nearly all of the comments posted here address the issue of the historical inaccuracies that run rampant throughout The Patriot.  The film's detractors attack the loose approach Emmerich and Devlin have taken with regard to American history, while fans of the movie dismiss the inaccuracies and say that the film never tried to follow the history books.  My theory is that, if the movie had been good enough to justify taking those liberties, no one would ever even mention them.  Rarely does anyone complain about the inaccuracies of Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, Apocalypse Now, Lawrence of Arabia, or any of the other great historical period films, because those movies are effective enough to make such historical goofs irrelevant.  The Patriot, by contrast, is set right here in America, in a time period that nearly all of us have learned about in school, so the inaccuracies are bound to be noticed.  But even without going to school, any thinking viewer will easily see that no real war has ever been this cleanly divided between Good and Evil.  It's painfully obvious that the colonists weren't really that lovable and virtuous, and that the British were not as hissably evil or comically formal as they are in this film.  This isn't some fantasy like Independence Day or Godzilla, this is a movie that tries to be about a real event that took place and involved real people who fought and died for what they believed.  I think it really is a sign of a bad film when it tries to depict real historical events, and ends up being even less believable than ID4.  One more minor quibble-- the movie gives us no sense of geography.  We never know where the hell any of the screen action is taking place once things really get going; wouldn't it have been more effective to give us an idea of the real places, many of which still exist today, where this struggle took place?"

Not only are we expected to accept that 85 years before the civil war, and 185 years before LBJ's civil rights act, that black Americans could experience emancipation, it also appears that The Patriot can only justify America's stand against the British by suggesting that brutality was the motivation for America's response in the 1770's.  Gibson might be holding the American flag in the final battle, but by then it is all sound and fury, signifying nothing.

","Sorry folks. A clearer case of ""bummer"" I have never seen. This film takes on an unbelievable air of self-righteousness, and the cheesy staring, the sappy one-liners and the awfully narcissistic view of the world is just barely contained. It is not an awful film, but it's very far from good. It reaches an embarrassing 3 on my scale.<br/><br/>The problem is not the actors. I can't stress that enough. They all do very well in their respective roles. Mel Gibson is, as always, beyond any criticism - his range of furious anger all the way down to heart broken sorrow is impressive. There is simply no one who cries like he on screen. And his mad gaze would give even Clint Eastwood a real scare.<br/><br/>Neither is it the story itself, although it seems a bit empty to me. It works well, and is believable, despite the fact that this movie suffers from not being true.<br/><br/>It is the abundant sorrow, the dropping of awfully cheesy comments and the depiction of the patriots as the only good guys, when in fact they behave almost as badly as do the British. That they wave American flags I have no problem with, it is after all the war for American independence. There were probably a lot more flag waving going on than shown here. But why oh why does Hollywood see the need to emphasize so much on the lone hero, his sorrows, his strong beliefs and his almost unsurpassed cleverness? It's cheesy. I'm sorry, but I really feel it is.<br/><br/>The theme is so abundant in the Hollywood movie business, it's almost scary. There are literally hundreds of movies with almost the exact same plot, same feeling and the same heroics. I for one am getting tired, so maybe I should stop seeing movies that are clearly of the same breed.<br/><br/>Well...I guess it works well with Americans. But as a European, I must say that this angle is getting tiresome. There is nothing new in this movie. Nothing that hasn't been done before, dozens of times. In fact, both the plot and some scenes are very reminiscent of ""Braveheart"". And that film was a LOT better. Maybe because Gibson himself directed it, instead of ""Mr. Independence Day"" - the director most prone to American cheesiness. Hmm...maybe that's why he was picked?"
"quigleydoor","Null","1","3","29 June 2000"," Exploits destructive myths about the American Secession
","One might hope that two centuries after the United States seceded from the United Kingdom, its society would be sufficiently intellectually mature and secure enough with its position in the world not to wallow in the puerile and ridiculous mythology of its founding. Particularly because so much of this mythology serves to justify the violent anti-social tendencies that hamper the effectiveness of government and produce so much misery throughout the country today, it would be constructive for Americans to learn the historical reality of the 1770's.  Instead, Sony Pictures chooses to trade on our ignorance and delusion with ""The Patriot"", attempting to make a quick buck by releasing a sloppy mess of lies and warmed-over two-hundred-year-old propaganda to stir up the most brutish feelings of blind jingoism.  That the film contributes to the unthinking demonization of the English which Hollywood in general and Mel Gibson in particular are so inexplicably keen to beat into the American consciousness becomes a mere footnote to an epic of lazy stupidity.<br/><br/>Anyone whose understanding of the American Secession has progressed beyond ""Schoolhouse Rock"" ditties into the high school classroom knows that the ""taxation without representation"" and ""inalienable rights"" rhetoric used by the traitors was a smokescreen which the frustrated colonial elites fulminated to mask their otherwise naked grab for the political positions which would allow them to wring their own spoils from political sinecures. With the possible exception of Tom Paine, none of the Founding Fathers of the United States was a revolutionary with any sincere interests in the rights of man.  No dead horse of American history has been flogged harder than that of the rank hypocrisy exhibited by those men who instigated riots, terrorism, and cop-killings on the simon-pure justification that people ought to be free to govern themselves - men who turned around to ordain and establish a form of government of, by, and for property holders; a government which was immediately, specifically, and continually construed as powerless to protect the rights of its citizens from whatever infringements state governments might see fit to impose; a government whose defining document famously spends three paragraphs on the administrative niceties of slavery.  The fatuous malarky Gibson's character spews in the trailers about being rankled by unfair taxes and harms to his liberty ought to have been made suspect, if not finally put to bed, by the work of Charles and Mary Beard eighty years ago.<br/><br/>More disturbing and dangerous is the film's treatment of the colonial militias.  Again, the commercial hype makes it clear that this movie will toe the conventional, fairy-tale line that local militias of yeoman farmers defending their property from sadistic Redcoats won the Revolution with privately owned muskets, amateur soldiery, and righteous pluck. Already, the forgettable cipher who reviewed the movie with Roger Ebert on national television gushed boneheadedly on how the film taught her about the new style of guerilla warfare pioneered by the American rebels.  But in truth the militias were untrained, unequipped, undisciplined agglomerations of conscripts and mercenaries who not only tended to bolt after receiving their signing bonuses, but actually got in the way of the Continental Army.  Garry Wills recently summarized numerous historical sources to conclude that the most that can be said for the militias is that they effectively oppressed blacks, Indians, and Loyalists away from the front lines.  It's too bad that his useful and enlightening scholarship will be overwhelmed by irresponsible Hollywood make-believe. It's even more unfortunate that this bit of hack fiction glorifies and sentimentalizes a group that served as thought police and goon squad. It's worrisome that it perpetuates popular misunderstanding of the merits of an organized army relative to bunches of local hotheads with guns.  And most of all, it's downright irresponsible and hazardous to succour the addled paranoiacs of the modern militia movements with utterly false representations of history.   Their political fantasias regarding private ownership of weapons, hostility to the police, and rejection of civil society are quite twisted and lunatic enough in themselves without potboiler smut that conflates patriotism with treason getting dished out as an inspiring story of heroism.  Sony should be ashamed of itself for investing millions of dollars in a maudlin, meretricious, two-hour-plus incitement to riot."

After suffering the indignities of Emmerich and Devlin's pathetic Independence Day and Godzilla, The Patriot truly is an aberration. I have no problem with Mel Gibson, as I thought that Braveheart was actually a very engaging epic, but here he proves that his range is rather limited. Surprisingly, screenwriter Robert Rodat was responsible for the far superior Saving Private Ryan. The battle scenes do look impressive but that doesn't make up for the historical inaccuracies (the English soldier played by Jason Isaacs in history led a gang of brutal murdering AMERICAN Loyalists and the idea that black people who worked on a plantation or farm would not be slaves in 1776 is a laughable one) and telegraphed plot. From the very beginning, you know how the film is going to proceed. Gibson's attempts at emotion look ridiculous and overwrought and ironically, only the British actors, especially Jason Isaacs, manage to get anything out of this. The British were responsible for atrocities while they occupied the USA, there's no denying that, but this is such a one sided film that it really made me angry."

If anyone studies American History, they will find that there were errors on both sides of the Atlantic during the time surrounding the events taken place in this film. The English were portrayed unfairly and ridiculously... it is feasible that men that belonged to the world-wide spanning English Empire would run their troops over a  hill when they couldn't see the bottom? Hmmm... Emmerich should be in the military with his tactical abilities.<br/><br/>The characters were two dimensional... the sub-plots were extremely tedious and unbelievable, the conflict supposedly in Gibson's character was practically nonexistent. And the story was perhaps one of the most uninspired threads since Godzilla.<br/><br/>Emmerich has a lot of technical skill in film making, he can craft quite impressive sequences and has a real eye for action. But he can't quite understand that people no longer are entertained by faceless action... look at Mission Impossible 2... terrible, purely because Woo's style is getting old and used.<br/><br/>Overall, I was terribly offended by this movie, so much to the stage that I actually was cheering the extraordinarily evil bad guy on. This film takes into account none of the back story to the war and concentrates purely on an subjective US view. It completely dismisses US atrocities like slavery and later, segregation, and there is no hint of the massacre of Native Americans. The French are also portrayed in a false form, their motive for helping the American's was pure revenge for the loss in their previous war to England. Plus, no one believed the colonies could function independently and therefore they would be in a prime position to take them over.<br/><br/>This film really instills a sense of patriotism within you, especially if your English.

Still, ""The Patriot"" outdistances itself from ""Gladiator"" and ""Erin Brockovich"" as the only other two Best Picture Oscar caliber movies of the year 2000!!!  Way to go Mel!"

","I thought this movie was going to be good. But I was sadly mistaken. It had some good parts, but they were nothing in comparison to plot holes, cliches, and total predictability of this movie. You could see everything coming a mile away. The Gladiator was a much better movie, and a true epic, not this pile of tripe. I thought the sound was phenomenal and the special effects were fantastic, but that doesn't make a good movie. Don't listen to the other reviews saying that it was the best movie ever made, they didn't go any further in the movie than at most a scratch. 3/10"
"tjchi","2","1","3","4 July 2000"," Another typical Hollywood movie
","Director Roland Emmerich's hamfisted direction was great for a campy movie like ID-4, when you should oversell things, but is much more frustrating when he tries to play it straight (i.e. Godzilla which could have been very over-the-top entertaining). This movie is basically a tin-ear rendition of Braveheart: Mel Gibson takes a really long time to fight British war criminals for revenge and family. There is some small mention of larger causes for the war, such as, oh, taxation without representation, but being a Mel Gibson movie it has to make things personal.<br/><br/>Like Braveheart, the battle scenes were the most interesting - showing how battles from the Peloponnesian War to WWI were won and lost by morale and discipline, rather than through superior machinery. Unlike Braveheart, the plot and many supporting characters are uninteresting and shallow. For example, a minister gets his rifle and joins Mel Gibson on his quest for vengeance. Why? He gives a nice pat answer (he must protect his flock from the wolves), and goes merrily on his Brit-killing way. A local Tory who has joined the British Army is ordered to commit a horrible atrocity against his neighbors (no spoilers here), and hesitates for all of five seconds before doing so. Does he feel any guilt whatsoever? Who knows. There are far too many characters like these which are Hollywood shorthand for in-depth characters.<br/><br/>Supposedly the filmmakers took great pains to make the movie historically semi-accurate, but they neglected to hire a speech coach for these revolutionary rednecks. The 90s PC-ness gets nauseating during every scene featuring slaves, who apparently were well-treated happy black Ewoks, also speaking modern American English with no accent or dialect. No wonder slavery wasn't abolished for another 90 years, they were happy as it was. There is also the token slave fighting for freedom, whose white comrades at first treat him with disdain but develop a respect for him by the end. I would rather have not seen any black characters at all than have this Hollywood version of slavery shoved down my throat.<br/><br/>Obviously you know who wins the war, but the rest of the plot is equally predictable. Within about fifteen minutes you know the main love interest, the primary villain (who has apparently been transplanted from 90s Rwanda or Bosnia), and who will live and die. I will say there was one point in the plot which REALLY surprised me - for all of ten seconds, before the villain pulls a Jason and comes back from the dead. If you want to watch a war movie that makes you think, rent Glory (or better yet read Thucydides). If you want a war movie that offers mindless flag-waving fun - some guy's head gets taken off by a cannonball! Dogs like Mel Gibson better than fat old Englishmen! Mel's kids do not visibly age or grow for five years! - go see the Patriot."
"sohi.hiro","10","1","3","3 July 2000"," Its a good time at the Movies (Contains possible Spoilers)
","It seems a great many of the negative comments here are the rather simpleminded idiocy that comes from the usual people that take any excuse they can to do some America bashing (probably out of jealousy).  I'd like to remedy this a little bit.<br/><br/>CAUTION:  This contains material that some may consider spoilers<br/><br/>This was an enjoyable (if graphically violent) movie about the bloodiness of the revolutionary war in America, and its impact on the ""regular people"". War is hell as Sherman said later - and this shows it.<br/><br/>A few points that were missed by those of you who apparently went in with an axe to grind rather than a movie to watch.<br/><br/>You must remember that the ""Martin"" character had fought for the Crown in the ""French and Indian Wars"" (See the movie ""Last of the Mohicans"" for a semi-historical but bloody tale of that), which were savage and brutal fights right in amongst the families of the American frontier (with casualties from the families including women and children).  Thus his character was quite reluctant to bring the same down on his family -- which might explain the reluctance shown by that character at the beginning. And as ""corny"" as the ""daddy dont go"" stuff was, it actually happens and is often said just that way - as it did to many of us leaving for the Gulf War.<br/><br/>Secondly, the ""Tavington"" character was based on Lt Col Tarrington I believe, whose nickname was ""The Butcher"".  The English were capable of atrocities in the name of the crown - from the Scots to the Irish to the Americans to Indians (India and the Sepoy rebellion) to the ""Wogs"" in colonial Africa and again to the Irish.  Britain's record as a near savages in war is unabated from the early ages of the nation up though the early part of this century (the Irish being the last major victims of British slaughtering the unarmed).  Americans are rightly sensitive about their behavior in Vietnam, but at least they eventually owned up to it, unlike perfidious Albion whose despicable record speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the slavery issues were admittedly ""softly"" handled considering that it was S Carolina and slaves were a solid part of agrarian culture in the southern colonies (and few had things as easily as those shown).  But most people overlook that Washington decreed that any slave that served in the war for 12 months was to be given his freedom and paid for his service. If you want a movie that addresses slavery and war, try renting ""Glory"" and learning about that American war.<br/><br/>Finally, if you are looking for an accurate historical movie that explains the American revolutionary war, this isnt it.  Its a ""period piece"" that tells a story set in that time period, that's much like Gone in the Wind in the limited respect that it tells a story of a family swept by a bloody American war.<br/><br/>Go into it with those expectations, and you will like the movie.  Go in carrying the heavy anti-American bias or bigotry that a lot of posters here have - or expecting ""Gettysburg"" - and you will likely not enjoy it."
"askemp","3","1","3","4 July 2000"," Mad Max meets the Terminator - American History per the WWF
","I enjoyed the first part of this film.  As the story unfolded, it presented incredible potential for plot development (as well as a lot of period eye candy). A man torn between family security and convictions. A community torn by conflicting allegiances. A man haunted by a past mystery. The eternal enigma of the justification for going to war. A youth's illusions of martial glory.  An honorable officer's conflict between his own convictions and the orders of a superior. All followed by an incredible combat scene - and not one ending nobly. ...and finally, children having to cope with premature exposure to killing.<br/><br/>But for all of its potential to develop into an incredible historical epic, ""The Patriot"" simply spirals into a ""Mad Max"" vs. ""The Terminator in a Redcoat"" WWF grudge match. Even down to the public, verbal, pre-match threatening.<br/><br/>From a promising start, ""The Patriot"" evolves into a TV movie with a big special effects budget.  Instead of expanding on any of the solid plot teasers thrown out in the beginning of the movie, the film resorts to tried and true cliches.  The human issues of war so carefully crafted into the film's beginning are ignored. The complexities of the war in the Carolinas, loyalty to family, loyalty to King, loyalty to personal convictions, bitter dissension within a community (and families), obeying orders vs. moral obligations, etc. all disappear into a two dimensional, jingoistic, politica lly correct, cartoon.<br/><br/>As entertainment, ""The Patriot"" works.  But on the same level as professional wrestling.  We cheer the good guys. The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad.. really, really bad. We don't have to know, or care why. And then, there are some really good special effects....(if only the WWF could figure out a way to simulate decapitations and flying limbs)<br/><br/>And historical accuracy? as one group puts it... ""If this isn't the way it really was, it should have been.""<br/><br/>Oh well... that's Hollywood."
"jhclues","9","1","3","3 July 2000"," An Entertaining, Important Film
","A hero of the Fort Wilderness campaign, now a widower living in South Carolina, with seven children to raise on his own, is once again confronted with war, this time in 1776, in `The Patriot,' directed by Roland Emmerich, and starring Mel Gibson.  When his oldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), joins the Continental Army and soon thereafter runs into trouble from which he cannot escape without his father's help, Benjamin Martin (Gibson) is drawn into a conflict he opposes and would rather stay out of.  Though patriotic, and while believing in the cause in principle, Benjamin is troubled by the prospect of leaving his children orphans if he goes off to war, and since Fort Wilderness he has had enough of war and killing.  Circumstances dictate otherwise, however, and Benjamin finds out that to save his family he has no other choice than to fight. Gibson gives a commanding, Oscar worthy performance here as Benjamin, deftly capturing the inner conflict of a man torn between principle and necessity.  He imbues him with the stoicism needed to shoulder responsibility, but also with the human touch required of fatherhood. Most importantly, Gibson makes it all credible; his Benjamin is real.  Jason Isaacs is also outstanding as Colonel Tavington; there's a depth to his performance that truly brings out the bitterness and evil that dwells at the core of the man.  Also notable is Leon Rippy, as John billings, a member of the militia.  There is nuance he brings to the character that makes him memorable.  The supporting cast includes Joely Richardson (Charlotte), Chris Cooper (Colonel Burwell), Tcheky Karyo (Jean) and Tom Wilkinson (Cornwallis). Emmerich has crafted an emotional, well-paced film that brings to life a time of which most of us know mainly through history lessons and books, and which has for too long been taken for granted by too many.  As with all wars that are behind us, they too soon become mere footnotes to our lives, as with each new generation the significance becomes that much more diluted, and therefore under appreciated.  So many of the people who lived through any particular war would just as soon forget about it as tell the tale. That's what makes such movies as `The Patriot,' `Saving Private Ryan,' `Schindler's List,' and `The Bridges At Toko-Ri' so important.  They keep alive infamous and heinous aggression that we, as a society, dare not forget, painful as it may be to many who actually fought in these conflicts. Historically, whether or not `The Patriot' is accurate in detail is not really important.  It is, after all, one man's story, a dramatization set against the backdrop of this particular conflict.  That it conveys a sense of time, place and importance is what matters, and that it does.  What is also important to remember, is that when a movie is as well made as this one, it not only entertains, but can educate as well; there is inspiration here that may well become the impetus that leads one to other sources for factual accounts of the Revolutionary War.  This is the importance of movies, and it's all a part of the magic of the cinema.  This is an emotionally charged, action packed, memorable film that is at once both intimate and of epic proportions.  It is artistically rendered, beautifully photographed, and well acted; I just don't think there's a whole lot more you can ask of a movie.  This is absolutely one that should not be missed."

After Gibson gave one of the greatest performances ever in 1995's ""Braveheart"", I was hoping there would be another movie like it where Gibson just goes berzerk. Finally ""The Patriot"" arrived.

After one of his children is killed by a British officer by the name of Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), Gibson gets a little wired. But once his eldest son Gabriel (played by Heath Ledger in an Oscar-worthy performance) decides to fight for the States, Gibson realizes he is losing his family and decides to join his son and fight for the States. This film also stars Chris Cooper (October Sky,Great Expectations) as United States Colonel Harry Burwell, Tcheky Karyo (Wing Commander,Bad Boys) as French soldier Jean Villeneuve, Joely Richardson (Return to Me,Event Horizon) as Gibson's sister-in-law, Rene Auberjonois (Inspector Gadget,Batman Forever) as Reverend Oliver, Lisa Brenner (MTV's ""Undressed"") as Gabriel's love interest, and Tom Wilkinson (Shakespeare in Love,Rush Hour) as British General Cornwallis.

PATRIOT has more noble passion, heart, soul, honor, emotion, loyalty, character, warmth, drama, faith, romance, blood, tragedy, sacrifice, honor, dignity, and glory than Hollywood's released in years, perhaps the entire past decade.  While it is not perfect, PATRIOT is a cinematic showcase of everything movies should be!<br/><br/>PATRIOT is always going to remain controversial; many people will love it, and far too many snobs will hate it (even refusing to see it!) Congratulations to PATRIOT's makers for having the courage to make this precious movie, especially considering how much their deluded & elite Hollywood neighbors will bash them with hatred and malice.<br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal...everybody from Heath Ledger to the precious little daughters deliver stellar performances.  The feeling and tone are mesmerizing....stirring sensory poetry.  Cinematography too beautiful for words.<br/><br/>If you liked Titanic, Last of the Mohicans, Glory, Braveheart, Forrest Gump, Clear & Present Danger, First Knight, and you're a fan of soap operas or historical romances, PATRIOT's right up your alley!<br/><br/>Screenwriter Robert Rodat, Director Roland Emmerich, Producer Dean Devlin, and star Mel Gibson each top their previous career achievements here... PATRIOT may lack the financial success of their previous works, but this is a movie they can be most proud of...an accomplishment of such pure heart and soul that future generations will cherish this on video forever.  I only wish I had paid MORE money for my ticket, to help PATRIOT's Summer 2000 box-office coffers approach the levels of its certain eventual video popularity.<br/><br/>For all of PATRIOT'S minor artistic flaws (all of which are expected for a movie - after all it is just a movie - including the hysterically snotty elitist bigotry of DH's totalitarian-fascist ranting, which hypocritically engages in revisionism and hate-filled stereotypes of its own), this movie is more genuinely heroic and emotionally sincere than I ever expected out of this Tinseltown bunch.<br/><br/>Roland, I love ya babe!  Don't let your snobby industry rivals get you down - keep up the good work.  Millions of Americans are honored to have you as a friend, neighbor, and fellow soulmate.  No matter what certain critics may say to hurt your feelings, you have nothing to be ashamed of... and this movie easily amends any previous blemishes.

","I don't know the exact reason but the American Revolution have always interested me (more than mine in 1789). Maybe it's because as a kid i had a wargame called ""Yorktown"", that was unfortunately unplayable but with a board and pieces fascinating. Last year, i read the novel ""New York"" from Rutherfurd and the years of this war were among the best pages of the book. In movies, i recall only ""Revolution"" with Pacino that i sadly rate ""1"". Thus, my expectations were high with this movie, all the more that it included my best actor behind Pacino, this is to say Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>Mel differs from Al in the sense that Mel is more fatherly but in the meantime more torn by inner madness. Here, his two traits are brilliantly exposed but the movie is far more interesting by the fact that it makes understand how it is to be a civilian victim of war.<br/><br/>Today, war is a TV show and we are faraway of any threats. Here, the battle happens in your garden, your house is destroyed by the first belligerent that comes, your community is shot to make up for the lost battles.<br/><br/>Next, the movie is a great lesson of history: it recalls that France had really been decisive in helping the colons and that it was the only army before 1950 where whites and blacks were fighting together.<br/><br/>With all those facts and a beautiful cinematography, the movie is a very strong drama.

","""The Patriot"" is hardly a ""patriot"". Even director Roland Emmerich admitted that the title doesn't make sense in correlation with the storyline since ""the patriot"" is actually the least patriotic of everyone around him. He's the only one of the rebels who doesn't have any interest in fighting, being too much of a family man. Harrison called the storyline, when offered the lead role, some type of ""melodrama about one man's revenge"". It focuses too much on Benjamin Martin's personal revenge instead of the war as a WHOLE. Also, at the part where Tavington takes Gabriel prisoner to have him hanged, he never explains to Benjamin what ""the rules of war"" are. When he asks him if he'd like a lesson about them, all that comes of it is Benjamin telling him that ""no lesson is necessary."""
"vincentlynch-moonoi","9","1","4","6 March 2016"," Forget the footnotes in the texts, just enjoy a superb STORY about one chapter of our history
","If we could only preserve one film about the American Revolution, I would nominate this film. I know some here rant about historical inaccuracies, but I'm not sure merely the facts really tell the story of what I think is most important -- but not always as visual as is needed for a motion picture. There are many ways to tell the story of the American Revolution. Non-fiction. Fiction. Biographies. Film. All (and more) tell a part of the story. And the important story that this film tells is of sacrifice for country. I can read casualty reports, but numbers don't tell that story as well as personal accounts or even fictional accounts. So some of you could dwell in your boring history texts and argue over tiny maneuvers on battlefields (and I've probably visited as many Revolutionary War battlefields as almost any of you), but I'll take human stories...even if they are just stories.<br/><br/>I was a little sad watching this film because I was reminded of what a fine actor Mel Gibson WAS. Not really one of my favorites, although he rarely let a film audience down. Don't misunderstand me. All of his troubles were a result of his own actions and words, and for that I have no sympathy. But still, he turned in a number of memorable performances in his acting career.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson's acting here is excellent. Perhaps the best of his career, although ""The Year Of Living Dangerously"" is another favorite of mine.<br/><br/>For my money, this is Heath Ledger's best film, as well. What a shame he left us so soon. Tom Wilkinson is excellent -- as always -- as Lord Cornwallis.<br/><br/>I'm not going to single out the child actors, but they were all very good.<br/><br/>Jason Isaacs is excellent as the most-hated Brit in the story. Chris Cooper is very good in his small but important role as a Continental Army colonel. Tchéky Karyo is interesting French officer. René Auberjonois, as the pastor, over-acted, as usual.<br/><br/>So, sit back. Forget the textbook stuff about the Revolutionary War and just enjoy a finely written and performed and filmed story that is dedicated to sacrifice."
"marcin_kukuczka","7","1","4","15 August 2008"," Exceptional Epic that Requires Right Intentions and Interpretations
","Having read a lot of comments on this movie, I have to admit that I felt confused because the criticism sometimes seems to cross the ""borderline of acceptance."" I am aware that someone may not like this movie, may see some serious flaws in it; however, it does not mean that the film lacks all possible merits. Let me, therefore, make a just analysis like all the commentators who assess Roland Emmerich's production objectively retaining a positive attitude.<br/><br/>There is no need to say once again that THE PATRIOT is no history lesson. That fact appears to be unquestionable. I would move even further in this case saying that it seriously simplifies history, its significant period for America, the war which brought the country a dawn of independent existence. This historical inaccuracy not only refers to the factual errors but misinterpretation of that reality. Showing the British as wretched villains and American militia as heroes who have to escape and fight the absolute regime is a false picture that leads many viewers to a wrong perception of important aspects in the historic war. Let me mention here the character of Col. Tavington (Jason Isaacs) who appears to be absolutely evil and...who is the royal soldier, the English noble. As a matter of fact, from the psychological point of view, there are no such people who are absolutely good or absolutely evil. In this respect, if we analyze Benjamin Martin's (Mel Gibson) acts, he is totally justified when slaying those soldiers as, metaphorically speaking, he kills the army of evil people who bring only death or captivity (of course that was not the point in history). Therefore, those distortions in THE PATRIOT might make the film an inaccurate epic and a sort of ""easy going fairy tale"" for childish viewers. However, that moment does not end the analysis, does not hold the ""last word"" condemning the production entirely. What are the merits of the film? <br/><br/>THE PATRIOT is a fine cinematic work. If you consider the stunning cinematography, flawless action, rich sets, strong storyline, impressive costumes and genuine performances, it is a movie that deserves attention. Here, I would like to mention Mel Gibson who does a very good job in the main role portraying a noble character, the southern farmer who does not own slaves, a good father who is on the verge of terrible acts caused by tragedy. Some even overrated his role as ""American Braveheart"" but there was some truth in that ""exaggeration."" Jason Isaacs also impressed me with his performance depicting his unrealistically cruel character and, I must admit that he really fits to that role. Heath Ledger is fine as the stubborn and a bit fanatical son, Gabriel Martin. Tom Wilkinson is memorable as cold hearted Charles Cornwallis. Female cast include terrific acting from Joely Richardson as Charlotte and Lisa Brenner as Anne. But, except for the artistic merits of the movie, THE PATRIOT has something more to offer.<br/><br/>It is the film that truly addresses modern viewers conveying the significance of two most precious pearls that humans have, values that are much talked about in our times but usually distorted: family and peace. In most parts, the content appears to deal with war but stresses its gore, its monstrosity and the harm it does to humanity in general, attacking its core of healthy existence, the family. It makes the main character ask the question of importance, the choice between state and family, follow love to countrymen or love to the closest persons. He is bound to make critical decisions after experiencing the real gore of evil. The horror of war's effect on people that Benjamin Martin warns against during the assembly held in Charleston is beautifully depicted in two scenes for me being the key moments of the film. First, it is a shocking, perhaps most disturbing and indeed historically exaggerated scene when Col. Tavington orders his men to burn the church and people closed inside. Second, it is the moving scene when Benjamin's little daughter Susan bids him Goodbye. These two lead us to the gist of whom hatred, whom war attacks most: the good, the children, the peacemakers, the innocent. Those who prayed to God were killed by this world, the reality which is ruled by fire of hatred; those who loved their closest with childlike hearts were bound to face parting and fear of death.<br/><br/>Yes, I am aware that a lot of commentators will not agree with my opinion on THE PATRIOT. Yet, I do not impose my viewpoint on anyone by any means to become preachy. All I wanted to say was: try to see it deeper, try to find a hidden pearl within the gray commonness. I rate the film 7/10: 2/10 its historical content but 9/10 its cinematic merits and message.<br/><br/>Yes, Benjamin Martin seems to shout out loud like once William Wallace did: ""FREEDOM"". Yet, his message appears to go further: ""FREEDOM FOR FAMILY, FREEDOM BUILT IN PEACE"" being a father who strives for a happy smile on his child's face, for a peaceful, free heart with no more tears of parting."

The only point against the film's cinematography is an exaggerated use of slow motion shots. As with ""Braveheart"" (1995), the story of this film cannot by any means be taken as history. The film exaggerates the virtues of the continental army and the atrocities committed by the British. If you can get past that, it's possible to enjoy this film. The story follows a good pace and the action scenes are excellent and well-staged, even if some of them are over-the-top. ""Braveheart"" (1995) exceeds ""The Patriot"" for interesting story developments and characterization, but ""The Patriot"" is still solid.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson essentially reprises his role with William Wallace and does it with the same energy for another good performance. The members of Benjamin Martin's family are all well-played and as is Charlotte, the sister of Benjamin's dead wife. Jason Isaacs plays Colonel Tavington with smugness and audacity that would later be seen again in Lucius Malfoy of the ""Harry Potter"" films and creates a great villain. Also on the British side was Tom Wilkinson, who was enjoyable to see as the gentlemanly and proud General Cornwallis. On the revolutionary side, the supporting cast was decent. Particularly notable was Tchéky Karyo as France's representative and Rene Auberjonois of ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" fame as the preacher. With this cast and its story, ""The Patriot"" is an entertaining, though not historically accurate film in the spirit of ""Braveheart"" (1995)."
"Horror_Icon","Null","1","4","13 March 2006"," Great war movie! Even if it is historically inaccurate.
","War movies have always been big at the box-office and movie critics alike. Something sparks our emotions when we see men battered and bruised in the bloodiest of ways. We feel deeply saddened for the main character when he loses brothers and/or friends in the war, and root for him throughout. So, how does The Patriot continue this trend while staying fresh, entertaining, and even educational? The answer to the aforementioned question is that it brings something new to the table. That new ""thing"" as I'm going to call it is honesty. Now, what could I possibly mean by honesty? What does being honest have anything to do with The Patriot? You see, The Patriot isn't the most historically correct movie that you might think it is. I'm no a history buff, but I do my research when going to review a movie. And, my research told me that The Patriot wasn't historically accurate. But, the director Roland Emmerich knows this, and doesn't hold it back. Yes, he keeps some aspects of the original war in the story, but he also brings the emotions with it and a well-written main character to boot! That my friends, is honesty.<br/><br/>Also, like I mentioned before, emotion is a major theme in this film that is characteristically heartfelt. The emotion these actors and actresses bring to the table is undeniably heartwarming and heartbreaking. This is a huge theme to pull off, and a lot of these actors aren't well known, so it had to have been hard to deal with. But, they managed to pull off an outstanding job in this category. As did Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger, because just because you're well known, doesn't mean you don't have anxiety when you're about to perform you role. That's basically having the weight of the world on your shoulders when you know everybody is depending on you.<br/><br/>Another theme of the film is, believe it or not, brutality. Now, when I say brutality, I don't mean ""ruthless, unforgiving"" brutality. I mean real-life brutality that wars can have on people. The worriment of knowing that you just might die when you're defending your country. It's all dealt with here, and in an abrupt way. There's no asinine feeling to it, just raw brutality. The realism of brutality shines here.<br/><br/>Another major theme is family matters. I'm talking about the family matters that we all face today. Family issues, arguments, pain, it's all here. As we go through Benjamin's life, we also meet up with his family and see how they react to his time in war. It's very visible that this family is in pain over their loss of their father. Sure, he's still alive, but his family doesn't know for sure. He's out there defending his country, he doesn't really have the time to write them a letter. Also, you can see how the kids react to this too. Especially his daughter Stephanie, who bawls her eyes out just at the thought of her daddy being away for home, maybe not to return at all. It's truly emotional. I take off my hat to this.<br/><br/>Now, as I mentioned before, the film is not historically accurate. There are a lot of little things that get tweaked around here in The Patriot. Such as that the French did not wear red coats in the French and Indian War. Does it matter that much? No, not really. But, for the history buffs, it could ruin a whole chunk of the film. I mean, you don?t want to see something you truly love and study be tweaked to a minority, but still have a major effect on you.<br/><br/>This is where the honesty I mentioned earlier in the review comes into play. The director Roland Emmerich and the cast of the film know it's not going to be the most historically accurate film of all time. So, they put that out there. They give a fair warning to all of the history buffs out there that they might not see what they expected of the film. And I admire this. This actually reminds me of the advertisements and promos for the release of the movie Doom. The Rock and the director assured everybody that the movie Doom would stay relevant to the video game. But, this proved to be false, as a huge amount of monsters were nowhere to be found, and it played more like an episode of The X-Files. This disappointed the fans of the game, and it didn?t go over too well (though, it still made millions at the box-office). Now, only if Doom would've taken notes from The Patriot's book, it might've went over well with the fans.<br/><br/>Overall, The Patriot is worth a watch. It's good for it's entertainment in the action section, and delivers the goods. and, if you're a history buff, you can go in knowing this film isn't going to be historically accurate, but it isn't asinine in any way shape or form. It's good quality entertainment. The acting is a measurement of perfection in this film, as is the emotional charge of what a war can do to someone and his/her family. Clocking in at three hours, it holds its head up high and gallops forward to the end with nice pacing of action and storyline. It's well worth your time, no matter who you are. No matter what you fancy!"

","I'm not a big war movie fan and not a big Mel Gibson fan but i was both happy and surprised to be enjoyed by the film. the blood and gore did not bother me that much because it is not like i have not seen it in movies before. i thought the movie was very informative and had a lot of good characters and villains. it did not portray history as a bad thing but as something that happened that we should be proud of and yes some bad things happened during history and we can hope none of them to be repeated with time. i thought Mel Gibson did a great job and there were many young actors who got more career opportunities. i found the movie to be overall good but not great. i think war type movie fans will greatly enjoy this movie."

","This, like Braveheart, is a good entertaining movie, not a history lesson. It does capture the essence of feeling which history demonstrates was expressed in colonial America, complete with the reluctance of approximately 1/3 of the population to revolt and the outright opposition by another 1/3. I especially enjoy watching it after hearing the British press bash the US, or the French trying to cover up their culpability in so many underhanded schemes.<br/><br/>Many people posting here seem to take the popularity of this movie as a signal of hatred for the British. As an American, I do not hate the British. (I feel sorry for them that such a literate country can have a press as bad as, or worse than ours.) The revolution was 228 years ago, and a great deal of international cooperation has taken place since then between our countries since then.<br/><br/>Certainly we are upstarts, loud, cowboys and disobedient to British interests. We are mostly descendants of Christian zealots who left Europe due to the persecution our ancestors encountered there. As a descendant of puritans, Huguenots, German and Dutch reforms, I am forever grateful for what they have given me, and will strive to pass this on to my grandchildren. If this is misconstrued as hatred of the British, I would suggest that the hatred comes from the opposite side of the Atlantic. Hitler called us a mongrel nation - to this and current criticisms I reply, that's who we are, get over it."

Vieira, Jay Arlen Jones.<br/><br/>'Braveheart in Breeches' or a prequel to 'Independence Day' could've been the pitch made by filmmakers Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin with this rip roaring period piece tailor-made for Gibson in Mad Mel mode. Gibson gives another compellingly, macho yet vulnerable turn this time as a former soldier turned furniture maker family man whose decision not to fight in The Amercian Revolutionary War circa 1776 (that's the spirit!) costs him dearly as his eldest, headstrong son (new heartthrob Ledger who holds his own) enlists to embattle the redcoats only for them both to regret their respective decisions. With his family endangered and his good name thrashed through the proverbial mud, Mel gets Mad and eyes for revenge in the form of his newest nemesis (Isaacs hissably evil adding himself to the great pantheon of Eurotrash villainy including Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber in'Die Hard' and Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List', and my vote for Darth Vader in the final chapter of the 'Star Wars' prequel trilogy, by the way!), which inevitably leads to bloodletting of those wig-wearing, crumpet monkeys (read: the King's army!) Could have used some trimming but why gripe although Robert Rodat's screenplay gleans from his own 'Saving Private Ryan' (in some gnarly battle sequences  dig that cannonball scene! YEAHH!) and 'The Last of the Mohicans'. Exquisitely gorgeous cinematography by vet Caleb Daschenel and a stirring score by old pro John Williams sets the jerry-rigged, crowd-pleasing epic into motion."
"sawyertom","Null","1","4","3 February 2003"," Very Entertianing Revolutionary War Film
","The Patriot was a very entertaining Revolutionary War film. It was  very good but not great. The thing that a lot of you are missing is that you have to remember Hollywood has a habit of making the bad guys in these things even worse than they actually were. Gibsons' character wasn't as saintly as he was portrayed and Issac's character wasn't as bad as he was portrayed either. That is from what I had read about them. It was to make the story and the movie more dramatic. No big deal. As for the critics that mentioned about our involvement in Vietnam and Korea. No defense on Nam, but Korea was a totally different matter. It was sanctioned by the UN to defend South Korea. We did not go willy-nilly in there like Nam. Read your damn history before you comment on it. As for portaying the English as on a higher ground because they gave up slavery before us. Remember, they were the premier colonial power for many years from India and the Middle East, Africa, America and Asia. They managed to rob and take anything of value to their empire for a lot of years. As for resorting to guerrila tactics, that was unconventenial warfare that worked best against the British then. You don't stand toe to toe with a superior force or army and expect to win. You fight to your strength and their weakness. The movie had its cliche's and moments that were incredulous to say the least. But it also had its powerful moments too. But in the end it was just a movie.A pretty good and entertaining one at that."

","This movie is simply incredible! To all those people who look for all the mistakes in the movie, both historically and in the story line, I say you have too much time on your hands....WAY too much time on your hands. Give it a break. This film is supposed to be fairly accurate, but not completely, because you have to add the element of drama to the history to make a movie. This movie is meant to evoke emotion, and in me, it does just that. The gorgeous and talented Heath Ledger gives an outstanding performance, as does the insatiable Mel Gibson and so many others in the fabulous cast of this movie. This movie is fairly gory, and while at first glance, I'd be ""grossed out"" and not want to watch the movie any further, this is a great thematic element. It makes you truly feel for the soldiers and think about how much is lost in each and every battle, in every war. It makes you appreciate more greatly what so many men and women have given of themselves so that we, as Americans, can be free. For all those critics out there who say this movie is unpatriotic, you couldn't be any more wrong. This movie makes you feel proud to be an American, which is exactly what the moviemakers set out to do with this one (other than make a few bucks!). That's the very essence of patriotism."
"brianlion","9","1","4","8 November 2002"," A MOVIE EVERY REVOLUTIONARY WAR STUDENT SHOULD SEE
","I didn't expect much when I first watched this movie. I really didn't think a movie set in Revolutionary times would be that entertaining. I left the theatre impressed. The producers obviously put much time and effort into costume design and script detail. Mel Gibson is great, and this was the first I had seen Heath Ledger, who was excellent as Gibson's son. Jason Isaacs is heinous as the British commander. He brought out feelings of anger, which must mean he did a great job. I'm not sure the British were as brutal as portrayed in the movie, but this is a war movie, albeit, Revolutionary War times. Tom Wilkenson is perfect as General Cornwallis, and the supporting cast added to the movie's quality. Every young student studying the early history of America would benefit from watching ""The Patriot"".  It would bring the pages of the history books alive. The battle scenes were gripping and harsh, contrasted by the gentle country side views. I am still amazed how a young, upstart nation defeated a force like Great Britain. Of course, the red coats in file formation made great targets. That had to be a great sight to see for the American sharp shooter, as was this movie for me."

"blobie45","6","1","4","3 January 2001"," An Amazing Movie, Depicting Accurately America's Proudest Moment
","What the heck are all of you people talking about when you say that this movie isn't accurate! It is by far more accurate than some I have seen. First, let me say that I'm an avid fan of Braveheart and I believe that The Patriot ranks right up there with it. The story is wonderful. It keeps you on the edge of your seat not knowing what is going to happen around the corner. I'm also one of those who believes that great special effects are not the only key in a good movie, but with The Patriot I was in awe.<br/><br/>Now, it's my opinion that The Patriot was very accurate. First of all, for all of you saying how cruel the British were, Col. Tavington was about the only one. All other depictions of the British, such as that of General Cornwallis, made them out to be good men only striving to be gentlemen and follow the rules of war. Cornwallis even chastises Tavington many times for his cruelty. Along with this point, I don't think the Americans were seen as ""god-like"" by any means. Yes, they were seen as idealistic and good-hearted in many cases, but Benjamin Martin (Gibson) was fighting with his utter cruelty during the French and Indian War throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>
As for the accuracy, the clothing, sets, language, and characters of this movie definately came close to perfectly matching those of American History. For example, while some the characters of the actual movie are not historical, most are based on men who did live. Mel Gibson's character is made up of many men who lived during the Revolution, including the ""Swamp Fox"". And for all of you who say Jason Isaac's character was depicted as too cruel, he was based on a historical British officer.<br/><br/>Now, I do agree that Mel Gibson's role in this movie was very much like his role as William Wallace in Braveheart, but he unfortunately, he is one of the best men in Hollywood to play the role. And for those who might say he shouldn't have played the role because he is Australian, Mel Gibson was born in New York. He didn't move to Australia until he was eleven. You might want to check your accuracy before you make that comment."

","I've read tons of negative reviews about this film and I must say that the huge majority of them are completely ridiculous and groundless. This is a MOVIE. The makers of the movie NEVER made any claims as to it being historically correct. For those  people who have criticized the scene where Gibson and his sons take out 20 men and complained that this was so impossible that it was comedic. Well, if British soldiers are dumb enough to stand side by side with their fellow comrades and make themselves such an easy target on the battlefield that only an idiot could miss them than I must say that they are just as likely to stand around in the open and let themselves be butchered by an invisible enemy as they are to letting themselves be butchered w/out defense on the open field. Secondly, I can understand how foreigners (not Americans) think the patriotism was over done. For Americas this was an excellent, patriotic film that made every one PROUD to be an American especially since it opened on the 4th of July. Then there is also the slave issue. The stereotypical idea of slaves is that every single slave, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, was a miserable beaten and unhappy wretch of a human being. Certainly, there were many who led unhappy lives but there were also those who either had their freedom granted to them by the owners or those who were not treated badly. The issue of slaves, as depicted in the movie is not impossible or inconceivable. All in all, if you disregard the ridiculous claims about historical inaccuracy, it is a wonderful and excellent film. I strongly recommend this film be watched, especially by Americans."

Mel Gibson really stretches the truth with this film. And I simply don't the movie because of this.<br/><br/>Why I Don't Like It:<br/><br/>The movie centers around a man named, Benjamin Martin. Who fights against the British, after an officer murders his son. And this is one of my problems with the movie. Benjamin Martin never existed, and he's very generic in this film, after some evil people kill his son, he wants revenge. Is that a drama about the American Revolution? Or some stupid action film? The film also vilifies the British, treated them like they were evil. And claiming the Americans could do no wrong.<br/><br/>Like when the film claimed that the Americans offered any slave freedom if they joined the army, and saying the British didn't do that. When they did, and most of the time kept the promise. And it makes the film feel like American propaganda. As it glorifies everything they did in the revolution. It feels like an elementary school lesson on the Revolution, not a film made for adults.<br/><br/>Good Qualities:<br/><br/>While I don't like this movie, I think the film has a nice production design, great acting, and good directing. The main issue is with the writing, technically it's the a descent film, at least in these regards.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Even with the good qualities, I think The Patriot is still a bad movie. While I think Mel Gibson is a good actor, and has made some very good movies, I did love Hacksaw Ridge. But I didn't love this movie."

There is a lot of action in the film but for me personally it's also kind of senseless, I'd prefer to see things more realistic, such as the film being more historically accurate in many ways including the storyline (politics, reasons for the war, whats actually happening in the war etc), the actors (the way they look and things they do etc) and many other ways. It's a film which could be based on anything and it just so happens to be based in the American war for independence, but the basic plot is ""evil and more powerful people are defeated by plucky and smarter fighters, showdown with most hated bad guy, with violence some bad things happening which the bad guys do and good guys crying in between.""

","The Patriot is a fantastic fantasy war saga surely not to be mistaken as an historically accurate account. It takes on the American Revolutionary War and dramatically changes the story for big screen presentation. Mel Gibson's main character, Benjamin Martin, is closely similar to the character Gibson played in Braveheart, and just like Braveheart, The Patriot is a fictional depiction of a past war, a great war fantasy.<br/><br/>The Patriot is a family tragedy in a wartime setting. The film is considerably morbid, and nearly too much so. It has too much startling violence, but the film suggests that this may have been deliberately purposeful. War isn't pretty. The Patriot has limited scope, not completely encompassing the grandeur and majesty it attempts to achieve; it's singularly oriented around its hero's avengeful retaliation.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger supplies the strongest support in a role that allows for little maneuverability. Gibson is not quite in that most elite acting class that Ledger is in, or was in, even though Gibson is great as Benjamin Martin, but by Mel's strong measure this was a relatively moderate performance for Gibson, not one of his finest. I'm not sure that it was Mel's failing or if it was that of the written character, but Benjamin Martin shows little life. Jason Isaacs is well-cast and outstanding as Col. William Tavington. Isaacs acts as the main enemy, although I feel The Patriot would have been greater with Cornwallis as the primary antagonist and Tavington as the secondary villain. The Tavington character is too despised to be revered. Tom Wilkinson was excellent as he should of had a more prominent role. Joely Richardson is well-cast and adequate as the sister of Martin's deceased wife; she's simply stunning. Chris Cooper does a stellar job and I enjoy all of the moments that Cooper shows in The Patriot.<br/><br/>The Patriot has terrific acting, impressive writing, and specifically superb cinematography. One would be proud to have this movie as apart of any collection; it's a must-own. The Patriot is one of the best Revolutionary War movies, not counting too many. It's all fabricated, and it's all very, very good."
"hall895","7","1","5","17 December 2012"," America's birth, bathed in blood
","There have not been many films about the American Revolutionary War. That is somewhat surprising as there are so many stories there to be told. The Patriot tells the story of one man, Benjamin Martin, who fights for his family. If at the end of the fighting independence has been achieved that is all well and good. But for Benjamin Martin family comes first. He is reluctant to fight, unwilling to place his family in danger. He won't go to the war. But the war comes to him. Right to his front porch. With horrifying consequences. And so Benjamin Martin takes up the fight. And what a bloody fight it will be. Nobody ever said the birth of a new nation would be pretty. There will be tragedy, heartbreak and grief along the way. Nothing worth fighting for comes easily.<br/><br/>It is a blow to his family which drags Benjamin into the war. A blow which will be avenged quickly and savagely. The tone is quickly set for a film which will be bathed in blood. But there is more to Benjamin than brutal violence. He proves to be smart, cunning, an inspiring leader. Mel Gibson gives an excellent performance in the role, capturing all that makes up this very unique man. There is a quiet dignity and honor to Benjamin Martin and Gibson brings that out. But there is that brutal side to him as well and Gibson handles that with aplomb too. Speaking of brutal, there is the film's main antagonist, the unspeakably evil British Colonel Tavington. When first we meet him he commits an obscene atrocity. And it only gets worse from there. This is truly one of the most reprehensible film characters ever. Jason Isaacs relishes the role, embraces the evilness. It's a solid performance from Isaacs but the character really does go too far. He's too evil. He does things which simply are not believable. Yes there were surely atrocities committed in this war but this film takes the character past the point of no return. Bad things may have been done but not that bad. No wonder so many British critics were up in arms upon the film's release. It's good if a film has a villain you can truly despise but this villain is just too much. He leaves such a bad taste in your mouth that it detracts from the film.<br/><br/>The over-the-top villainous Tavington is not the film's only flaw. There is a lot of dialogue that is clunky and awkward. The film clearly goes on too long, approaching three hours and at times really struggling to sustain itself for that length of time. But despite the flaws the film does enough good things to be deemed a success. Gibson is excellent, Isaacs a worthy foil. Other winning performances come from Heath Ledger as Benjamin's son, so eager to join the fight, and Chris Cooper as an American Colonel trying to hold his ragtag army together. If you want a bit of romance there's that too, Joely Richardson and her absurdly bountiful cleavage paired up with Gibson and bright, young Lisa Brenner for Ledger. And then there is the war itself, the brutal battles. The film spares nothing in its gory accounts of 18th century combat. The close-range gunfire, the bloody bayonets, and the cannonballs that do truly grotesque things to a human body. There are two good stories here, the big picture revolution and the more personal story of the Martin family. Those stories are meshed together very well by director Roland Emmerich. We haven't gotten many American Revolution stories in films. This one, flawed and highly fictionalized though it may be, is ultimately a satisfying one."
"dr_strangelove_69","10","1","5","16 August 2006"," As a Movie..................
","This is an utterly superb film. The costumes are visually splendid, the scenery is to die for and the story line in a traditional good ol' 'Loving American guy gets wronged by an evil British guy and then during his hunt for revenge teams up with a comic Frenchman and in the end they win'. Exactly the right story line for a Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>The cast could not have been bettered, Jason Issacs, Tom Wilkinson, Mel 'Controversial' Gibson, Joely Richardson and Edward Woodward's son Peter. A really impressive gathering of talent, no doubt about it. The CGI FX are the best of their kind I reckon, who wouldn't want to see a man getting decapitated by a 24 pounder roundshot? All in all, As a Movie.........I'll rate this full marks. It is a quality watch and worth the Dollars/Pounds/Euros or Yen you want to spend renting or buying the DVD. As it is a movie, not a documentary, I will rate it here as such.<br/><br/>HOWEVER!!!!! When the accompanying feature claims that the film makers have 'tried their best to be as authentic and credible as possible', it is then I start to laugh very, VERY loud.<br/><br/>Let me take you through several historical errors I myself have noted.<br/><br/>The British Infantry seem, throughout the film, to be entirely devoid of Light Infantry. A prominent unit in the American War and would have proved a nice little counter to the 'Patriot' militia.<br/><br/>There is only ever one British Infantry Regiment seen in the entire film, despite three major battles being covered. This same Regiment carries the Colours of several other Regiments into action. A bizarre aspect indeed.<br/><br/>Smooth bore pistols and muskets take people out at several hundred yards, a range to make even the most skilled sniper amongst the ruins of Stalingrad gasp.<br/><br/>Gibson's character has 'freed' slaves work his land. That is a serious whitewashing of something that plagues the USA until this day.<br/><br/>In a similar vein, there is only one racist in the whole Southern Rebel army. Even he has 'seen the light' by the end credits. Despite it being a further 100 years until slavery was abolished and even that took a Civil War.<br/><br/>The British soldiers march into Battle like the SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler parading through Berlin.<br/><br/>Why the hell do most of the characters throw away their ramrods like javelins? This is just plain weird. I mean, for a Colonial Rebel with little experience, you might just think it plausible but when a British Colonel does so.............usually the ramrods are back in their hands seconds later. That is a real puzzler. <br/><br/>There is little or no mention of Native Americans, whom, you will understand, are the 'true' Americans and fought on both sides during the war. I think you spot a couple loitering about in one camp scene.<br/><br/>The 'atrocity' performed by Wilkins, under direction of Tavington is fiction, despite equally nasty scenarios being fact. Rebel atrocities on 'Loyalists' were far more cruel. At Concord bridge in 1775, the rebels scalped a British soldier and removed his brain. <br/><br/>The French Naval Officers at Yorktown are dressed in Napoleonic Uniforms complete with tricolour cockades. I think these fellows would be more at home at Trafalgar or the Nile.<br/><br/>The whole film is too 'squeaky clean'. There was no regular bathing then, even the King of France bathed but once a year. Cleaning one's teeth was far from an oft performed duty. The lack of top dentists would also hamper the eye shielding shine of the teeth in this film.<br/><br/>A man and his two young sons take out a section of infantry belonging to the best army in the world? Don't make me laugh. 'Aim small miss large' methinks.<br/><br/>I could go on but I've lost the will to live!"
"Darryl-Gonzalez","10","1","5","12 January 2006"," Well done historical fiction
","This is a work of historical FICTION, set amidst the Revolutionary War, the story of how a pacifist farmer (played masterfully by Mel Gibson) realizes through tragedy that the only way to protect his family is to fight for the freedom of a young nation. He had been a hero during the French and Indian War, but had seen enough of war's horror and was determined to stay out of the Reovlution until an evil British colonel kills his second oldest son Thomas, and threatens the life of his oldest son, Gabriel (played by Heath Ledger).<br/><br/>Remember, this is a work of fiction, not a documentary, and viewed as such it works well. There are areas where the script takes liberties with history (for example, a black slave fights alongside white men: in the South this would not have happened). It can even be argued that this movie succeeds as a history-related piece: it might just inspire the youth of America to read and learn more about the REAL heroes and history of the American Revolution. The acting is superb, the cinematography is excellent, and the soundtrack is well done too. Look for great performances by Rene Auberjonois (as a church pastor forced to go to war to ""fight off the wolves"") and Jason Isaacs (as the chief villain, Colonel William Tavington). <br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** I loved the scene in the end where Mel's character grabs a faltering American flag and uses it to inspire his troops on to victory when some of them have already started to retreat.<br/><br/>10/10 stars."
"shobill","8","1","5","20 October 2004"," What it does it does well
","In true Gibson style, Mel plays the leader of an American militia during the Revolutionary War and realizes his heroic role through terrible suffering and heartache. It is a very familiar theme, played in countless other films: former war hero tries to live a peaceful life with his family, attacks on him and them force him back into service with a vengeance, and while we know the eventual income (it's no spoiler to note that the Americans did eventually defeat the British and form a new nation), we are drawn into the personal drama of what happened to this particular patriot and those close to him. In many ways this film is formula: several British officers - the enemy - are presented unidimensionally as either stereotypically pompous or inhumanely evil, along with an oft repeated general storyline. Nonetheless, like any good war film, this one ends up saying things about all wars - the suffering of the common people at the hands of a ruthless invading military, the loyalty of comrades to each other as much as to their country, the sense of duty above all else, and more. Interestingly, I found myself drawing parallels to more current wars, namely Vietnam and Iraq, only in this case it is our forefathers (and mothers) who were the victims of an invading army in which ordinary soldiers were neither good nor bad men, but just soldiers. Many people will see this film as little more than another example of the Gibson prototype (although he is the lead actor, not the director) following tried and true Hollywood formulae. But that having been said, it is entertaining, full of action, and moving, and what it does it does very well."
"wgfinley-1","Null","1","5","5 July 2004"," Real History is Brutal
","While The Patriot never makes claim to being a historically accurate film I have found some of the reviews pretty interesting and thought I would take a moment to rebut. It's lovely how Michael Moore and his ""documentaries"" are so lauded and a film presented as entertainment gets held up to such scrutiny for the mere fact it celebrates American independence.<br/><br/>First, this film depicts the Revolution as it was -- an amazingly brutal conflict. Perhaps in the hundreds of years removed we prefer to think of an 18th Century war as something tame like our history books. The truth is when you're killing with swords, bayonets, and early firearms the result will be nothing less than brutal. Anyone who thinks this film is glorified gore needs a lesson on the French & Indian War, the American Revolution, and the War of 1812, the major conflicts of this era. The British took 1500 dead before they finally took Bunker Hill, just how do you sanitize that?<br/><br/>Others don't seem to understand characters patterned after or are composites of real ones -- this movie is filled with them aside from the higher ranking military officers. While it deviates from history some what is accurate is the guerilla campaign that was fought in the south that, along with French assistance, led to American independence. Washington spent the vast majority of his time just trying to keep his army together and the British occupied.<br/><br/>There also seems to be this en vogue anti-patriotism as if it is so passe to be patriotic. After all, this project is totally immersed with the great American actor Mel Gibson and the great American director Roland Emmerich. Seriously though, Emmerich's homeland knows a bit about the brutality of war, both in receiving and giving, it seems fitting he directed this film about the brutality of war and the high price of freedom.<br/><br/>Finally, British portrayed as brutal is propaganda? You don't become the largest empire the world has ever known without a little brutality along the way. We would be branded the scourge of the planet (okay, even worse than the scourge we are already branded as) if we burned, for instance, an entire Iraqi village with napalm because our troops were taking fire from a few people in the village. Yet, this is exactly what the British did at Charlestown, Mass. Nor did they have any problems firing into an unarmed mob in the famous Boston Massacre. The British employed brutal tactics in keeping their empire in 20th Century (see India), why would the 18th have been any different?<br/><br/>This film is full of great performances from Gibson, Jason Isaacs, Chris Cooper, and Tchéky Karyo. It gives us a small taste of what type of fight the Revolution was, as Charles Martin said ""this war will be fought among us"". Perhaps since we haven't experienced an invasion since 1812 that's why so many of us fail to understand it and need to see this film with their eyes wide open."
"kypioneer","10","1","5","24 January 2001"," A great, satisfying movie
","I viewed The Patriot eight times on the big screen, and it was the first DVD I ever bought.  For me, it is a great, satisfying movie-- exceptional in its depiction of colonial South Carolina upcountry family life and of 18th century warfare, not so successful in its minor ventures into romance and child psychology.  It is a big movie with beautiful cinematography, the kind of movie that you can move into. Performances were overall very good, with Mel Gibson's portrayal of the farmer/father Benjamin Martin, who one day discovers the American Revolution on his front lawn, of Academy Award nomination caliber.<br/><br/>The Patriot makes no claims to be entirely historically accurate, but I can attest to the fact that it does capture the kind of fighting they did in the South during the Revolution. The British did attempt to discourage partisan activity by a campaign of terrorism-- threats, hangings and houseburnings. Jason Isaacs' Colonel Tavington is based on Col. Banastre Tarleton who lost a couple of fingers in a minor skirmish in 1781 two miles from my home. His name is still a hissing and a byword in this community.  There IS a lot of flag waving in the film (were they thinking of the Olympics?), but that is no reason why this movie should be held to a higher standard of historical accuracy than any other studio product.  Just lean back, imagine how you would react if a War suddenly descended upon you and your family, and enjoy this movie. I did (and do) very much."
"bopdog","10","1","5","1 July 2000"," Historical quibbles aside-- a wonderful, and mostly accurate, historical movie!
","A lot of TV time has been given to historians and other scholars criticing this movie, a bit, for some of its ""factual"" lapses. Benjamin Martin, the Mel Gibson character, was really Somebody Else Martin-- an actual historical figure of that time known as the ""Swamp Fox."" Kicked a lot of English butt, and was a hero of his generation. As mores and values change over time, dramatic devices and details must also change to evoke the same feelings in the audiences of future generations.<br/><br/>That is, what might have thrilled the 18th and 19th century Americans to hero worship might now merely bore or even appall. Thus a few ""facts"" must be changed for dramatic purposes-- Martin is now NOT a slave holder, was goaded by personal tragedy inflicted  by the English, etc. But this does represent, perhaps, the same feelings. Thus, while the facts of the history might be a little bit different here and there, the realities for the people actually involved, their feelings, and thus the real lives of those depicted, is in reality very true, and very correct. This might have been what the author of the book this was based on meant when he said recently: ""I don't let the facts get in the way of the truth"" (or something close to that).<br/><br/>From a Hollywood standpoint-- a good movie or not, etc., this is top notch entertainment. And all the hub-bub over facts notwithstanding, much of the period was actually displayed quite accurately-- the movie was shot in the same locales as many of the events of 1776-1781. The uniforms, guns, and tactics of the opposing sides were also accurately shown-- much of the technical expertise coming from historians and ""re-enactors,"" folks who devote years of their lives to reproducing the military look and behaviors of historical periods.<br/><br/>In case some people wonder about Mel Gibson playing an early American patriot in the movie-- is there anyone left who doesn't yet know that Gibson was born and raised in the good ol' USA? He only went to high school and college in Australia, consciously learning and adopting an Australian accent to avoid being beaten by his teenaged Australian hosts. Upon returning to America, his accent has been flushed away, leaving his original New York state American standard inflection.<br/><br/>You might see a bit of ""Braveheart"" in some of the action. Hey-- when all is said and done, this IS a movie. I am curious about one thing-- Do the English allow Mel Gibson movies to be shown unedited in their country? Just wondering, given the rather unflattering portrayals of them Gibson has brought to the screen. I gave this flick a 10 out of 10. Go see it, you'll love it!"
"tauras-88243","1","1","6","15 July 2019"," Utterly inauthentic
","I'd looked forward to seeing this film but was cruelly disappointed by its utter lack of authenticity. As 'Bob the moo' observes in his 2006 review, the depiction of Col. Tavington as stand-in for the historic commander of the British Legion -- 'Bloody Ban' Tarleton, so named by the rebels because of his mounted unit's massacre of retreating Virginia infantry reinforcements for the already captured defenders of Charleston who were surprised after dark by the Legion who were mostly Irishmen, not technically British.
The uniforms of Tarleton's legion were Green, not red, as depicted in the film. Martin, as an officer, would have been mounted, not fighting on foot as depicted. Cocked hats were worn by both civilians & military, but what is depicted are tri-corned hats, popular 20-50 years earlier. Round hats would've been far more common headgear for most rural Americans at this time (1779-81). The ambush of the British military escort by Martin & his two very young sons is absurd, as is his dispatching of several regular soldiers with a vintage tomahawk. Utterly unbelievable in what purports to be historical. This could have been a tragedy, which is what the revolution was for ordinary Americans, but the poor screenplay, poor costuming, & ridiculous events & dialogue turned what might've been a serious examination of the horrific terrors of the southern campaign into a jingoistic farce. The worst scene in the film was the burning of a rural church full of civilians by order of Col. Tavington. No such made murder of civilians ever occurred during the war. That sort of genocidal barbarity was only practiced by Americans against native American colonists & citizens a century before & after the Revolution.
There are many other inauthentic aspects to a film that falls very far short of historic fact, and that's a pity because reasonably accurate depictions of this period are extremely rare in feature films."
"pcrandallfinance","10","1","6","22 July 2013"," From One Patriot to a Movie About a Patriot
","Mel Gibson had a string of movies with The Bounty, Mad Max, Lethal Weapon Part One, The Incredible Braveheart, The Passion of the Christ, The Patriot and We were soldiers that may not be seen again for generations. He is not a Hollywood Elitist and makes movies from the heat. Despite his problems with rage in later years it takes nothing away from his body of work.<br/><br/>The Patriot is a great depiction of The side of the American family during the Revolutionary War. Most Americans have no idea what live was like in the 1700's of the way that men might have been in the early history of our country. This movie sheds light on the way it might have been. From a pure drama standpoint the movie rates a ten or 5 Stars.... While not as great of an epic as Braveheart, Gibson's performance alone will leave you cheering at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Happy Viewing."

Together he pieces together a group of local citizens and make them into a fighting squad trained in all kinds of guerrilla warfare.<br/><br/>It's nice to see a Revolutionary War for a change when it seems like the Civil War and World War 2 gets way more movies for their stories.

"mfnmbessert-224-279128","8","1","6","14 April 2012"," 'The Patriot' (2000)
","'The Patriot' stands as a well-made and entertaining war movie. Although historically inaccurate in many aspects, the film is well-acted, and is *satisfying* I would say to the 21st century viewer. It is basically more a good old fashioned tale of revenge, using the Revolutionary War as a backdrop for this scenario. Our characters act out their parts well for the most part, and those who act and say their lines too extravagantly or over-the-top are not easily recognized as such. The dialogue is only vaguely reminiscent of how real Colonial peoples would have spoken, but all of this is easily overshadowed by Roland Emmerich's quite expertly done direction, and Robert Rodat's triumphant screenplay.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is quite notable. I have never seen 'Braveheart' but I don't imagine I would like it much, and 'The Patriot' is good enough for me, solidifying Gibson into the role of action superstar. It is also an interesting piece for the Heath Ledger completist, although this isn't his best role, it is definitely a step up from 1999's '10 Things I Hate About You', and he plays his part with determination. Most convincing though, would probably be Jason Isaacs who plays the main antagonist, a fictional (I believe) colonel of the British Army. I rather enjoyed this film, and I felt that there was a very perfect balance between the action and the drama, and using mostly fictional characters helped to propel the film along, with the freedom to liberally create our own back stories for most of our characters. Although people interested in the truth behind the story of the Revolutionary War might want to look elsewhere, as there is only once scene I believe where General George Washington even makes an appearance. General Cornwallis, played by Tom Wilkinson, was a real person, and he is probably the realest character we are going to milk out of this one, and he probably does it the best out of any of these people.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say 'The Patriot' is better than 'Saving Private Ryan', but I would say that it comes damn close.<br/><br/>THE PATRIOT -----8/10."

Many of the comments in the goof section are inaccurate due to the lack of knowledge of the writers concerning flintlock weapons. Comments about impossible shots are not true. Shots of farther than 20ft with a flintlock pistol are very possible. Flintlock rifles were the sniper rifles of the time and extremely accurate. None of the shots shown in the film were impossible.

The battle scenes were great and the cast was brilliant. <br/><br/>The scene where Mel Gibson and his two sons take out a whole British patrol is one of my all time favourite shooting scenes.<br/><br/>What was most impressive however was that the film concentrated on the American militia, and the influence they had over the war of independence. That was something original that I haven't seen done before. <br/><br/>There was a lot of melodrama in it, but i thought it was good melodrama. It was simple and it always underlying. To people who dismissed this, at least it wasn't totally in your face like the love story in Titanic. Seriously, I had to sit through that whole cringe fest which wasn't accurate in any sense, yet I know people who think the romance was the best thing about that film. It wasn't, it was the sinking scene, thats why it won Oscars. <br/><br/>Also, to people who are offended by the depiction of British brutality, this film had some pretty esteemed British actors. I'm pretty sure the likes of Tom Wilkinson and Jason Isaacs knew what they were doing when they took up their roles.<br/><br/>Overall I can understand that the film has its flaws, and it oversimplifies some of the issues and the general political situation of the US during that era.

","Director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow) has created an interesting story based on real history, and Mel Gibson has created another good history character nearly like William Wallace, but this isn't exactly the best example of a war film. I think it focuses more on Benjamin Martin's (Gibson) family (or at least mainly children/ boys) in this film, which is quite good for some action, but I want more battle. Basically the British or whoever are troubling Martin and his family, so after one of his son's dies, he decides to help in the war for freedom along with his other sons. Also starring Heath Ledger as Gabriel Martin, Jason Isaacs as Col. William Tavington, Joely Richardson as Charlotte Selton, Chris Cooper as Col. Harry Burwell, Tom Wilkinson as General Lord Charles Cornwallis, Independence Day's Adam Baldwin as Capt. Wilkins and Jurassic Park III's Trevor Morgan as Nathan Martin. It was nominated for the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Music and Best Sound. Mel Gibson was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Worth watching, at least once!"
"Aaron1375","8","1","8","3 March 2010"," Interesting movie about the Revolutionary War.
","I enjoyed this movie and for the life of me I do not see how the movie ""The Perfect Storm"" made more than this film at the box office. They both opened the same weekend and this one would make quite a bit less than that movie. A movie that seemed to be made only to show that scene where the boat met the wave while this one actually had an interesting story, good bloody action, and some rather humorous moments too. It also had Heath Ledger in one of his earlier roles as Mel Gibson's oldest son and he and Gibson paired up very well for this one. The story takes place during the revolutionary war and has Gibson as a father of I forgot how many children, but there were a lot. He owns a nice home and the African Americans that are on his land are not slaves, but choose to be there. Yes, I know this part seems unrealistic, but I am guessing they wanted to make the guy more of a hero than the actual guy this was sort of based off of and if he had slaves that would not have been good. Well anyway this guy is trying his best not to get involved with the war. Unfortunately, his eldest son joins the rebels and soon after he is being arrested and Gibson's second oldest son is killed while trying to get to his older brother. Well this sets a light under Gibson's character and you find out he was a rather super killer during his younger days fighting battles. He soon enlists the aid of others and they begin fighting the redcoats using tactics not seen during this era. Basically, instead of standing there taking shots at each other they ambush their enemy from hiding spots. The movie has a sad scene later, and ends on a rather more positive note after a fierce battle and great final line between Gibson and the villain of the piece. The movie works on a lot of levels, could use maybe a trim down on the run time of the film and perhaps a tad less tragedy and it could have been really great. Still, I enjoyed it and will never understand how this fine film got sank by that weak boat in ""The Perfect Storm""."
"swanningaround","10","1","8","16 December 2005"," This story had to be told
","This is the film we were all waiting for. It tells the history in a clear and concise way of possibly the most important war of all time..<br/><br/>Mel Gibson plays a humble farmer who becomes a patriot for his people in fighting against a brutal oppressor, in this case, the British Army. The film depicts the horrors of war, including the burning of a church by the British, with the poor women and children brutally burnt within it.<br/><br/>The movie contrasted the hierarchical and snobby ways of the British, with the down to earth manner of the American and French patriots. All were welcome to fight for the cause, whatever class, creed or race you were, all were equal under the flag of the patriots, the flag of the United States of America, which is the film's true hero.<br/><br/>The climatic end where good overcomes evil in the Battle of Yorktown is one of the greatest battle sequences in movie history. <br/><br/>The reaction of the movie on audiences in Switzerland was of note. People, mostly women and children, were crying, mostly in the scenes where the families were being oppressed by the enemy, and naturally in the scenes where house, farms and village buildings were torched. At the end of the film I watched in Zurich, the many people at the theater jumped up, clapped, and let out an almighty cheer. Others were still stunned at what they had witnessed and were still crying.<br/><br/>What a film for the master director! Bravo, Mel Gibson. You are the best!"

","The Patriot is an emotional, action epic. Mel Gibson takes on the role of a war hero and a father in a great performance. His acting really gets you into the movie. Heath Ledger as Gabriel, also does very well. Gabriel is passionate about war and fighting for freedom and 'staying the course' for the cause. The whole movie has a whole lot of different features put into one amazing film. It tells of a fight for freedom, revenge and families under threat. It shows passion and emotion exactly how I would imagine the American Revolution would be. Jason Isaacs who plays Colonel Tavington is a very good villain. Like Gibson, he is so into the character that you almost believe that's who he is. Tom Wilkinson also does a very good job. Even though he isn't the bad guy because it was a fight for land he portrays the mean spirit in a General that just makes you want to hate him! Some parts just make you wanna cry, because as I said, it's a very emotional film but it really is what it is, a story about patriotism. It might be too much blood for some people, but the reality of it is that that's what really happened. Wars were not nice things, and I really enjoyed the movie and how realistic they made it. This is one of my favorite's movies, it's legendary and it's a classic."

","With the name changes of Francis Marion to Benjamin Martins and Banastre Tarleton to William Tavington, director Roland Emmerich was free to take a whole lot of liberty with the southern theater of the American Revolution. If anyone is expecting to see a factual account of what happened in the south from 1779 to 1781 they will be gravely disappointed. <br/><br/>Mel Gibson is the Martins/Marion character and the biggest poetic license was taken with that character. Most basic of all Marion is presented as a family man who was a veteran of the French and Indian War and took up arms again when his plantation was sacked and son killed. Francis Marion was a bachelor, he got married and did raise a family after the Revolution was won. But that certainly would have knocked a very large prop out of Gibson's character motivation.<br/><br/>Jason Isaacs is the Tavington/Tarleton character and he's every bit as nasty a piece of work as Banastre Tarleton was in real life. The man relished war and killing and believed in waging totally against His Majesty's rebels. The phrase 'Tarleton's Quarter' came into the language after he massacred some colonial troops who had surrendered. He was real big on those kind of atrocities, Governor Thomas Jefferson of Virginia fled with no dignity when he got word that Tarleton's troops were minutes away from Monticello. He knew exactly what the author of The Declaration of Independence would have received at his hands.<br/><br/>It would have been poetic and nice if he had met his end during the Revolutionary War, but Tarleton went back to the United Kingdom and took up a seat in Parliament and was a noted defender of slavery and slave interests. You can see him at work doing that in the film Wilberforce which concerns William Wilberforce's campaign to halt the African slave trade.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger as Gibson's oldest son and Joely Richardson make a fine pair of eager young people looking eagerly to a new nation dedicated to what Jefferson espoused in The Declaration of Independence. Rene Auberjonois's character of a fighting parson is borrowed from George Bernard Shaw's Reverend Anthony Anderson in The Devil's Disciple.<br/><br/>Tom Wilkinson plays Lord Cornwallis and he appears in too many history books to give him a pseudonym. But for some reason Chris Cooper's character who was Cornwallis's opposite number is not called Nathanael Greene. He's one of the most remarkable commanders of the Revolutionary War, a man who never won a battle, but managed to hold the British army completely at bay in the southern theater due in no small part to people like Mel Gibson's Benjamin Martins(Francis Marion). There is mention in the film of General Horatio Gates who fled after the Battle of Charleston which the British totally routed the colonials and took the seaport of Charleston. It was Greene who was brought in to replace the mistakenly highly touted Gates.<br/><br/>Francis Marion is sometimes given the credit of starting the use of guerrilla war methods, but that distinction properly should go to Major Robert Rogers during the French and Indian War. Marion certainly was skilled in the art of it as The Patriot shows. As for Rogers he was a Tory in his political beliefs and offered to get a guerrilla outfit going for the Crown, but was not taken up on his offer.<br/><br/>The Patriot received Oscar nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Music Score, and Best Sound not winning in any of those categories. But the film deserved those nominations. John Williams in doing the music successfully integrated period songs with some modern themes and the cinematography, especially in the battle scenes showed what combat was like in that era. They were every bit as well done as Ted Turner's Civil War trilogy or Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>The Patriot if not the story Marion and Tarleton who probably never met face to face in real life is still a good depiction of the issues surrounding the American Revolution."
"lkaram","10","1","9","30 July 2000"," An instant classic
","Mel Gibson delivers again in this wonderful and inspiring epic that will become a modern classic to all true patriots. The Patriot gave me a deep appreciation for the heroes of that long-ago war that I had never gained in any history class. It's, at once, the grand story of the birth of our nation, and the small story of a man struggling to save his family. Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger were magnificent in their scenes together and alone and John Williams masterful score soars throughout. One not to be missed!"
"shamrocked123","10","1","10","8 November 2012"," A revolutionary movie-British critics beware
","This is an absolute, heart wrenchingly wonderful movie. I am American. And yes this movie tugs at my heart strings. I have watched reviews like this for years without ever saying a word... But now is my time. Mainly aimed towards movies such as Braveheart and this, these reviews often disgruntle if not disgust me. Though I see a common pattern. Each review that bothers me is the product of one of some British loser bitter in his nature. Let's get something straight. This movie as well as Braveheart were not mean to be historical teachings. It has never once been claimed that the events in these movie are historical facts. This is not a history lesson you stupid British. This is Hollywood California. These movies were made to appeal to the masses who provide the main income for those involved in the making. And guess what, that main source of income, the masses thereof, come From the United States of America. Because guess what? That's where the money is. True that in this film the British are made out as the bad guys because guess what, the majority of viewers of this film call themselves Americans. So forgive us please for creating a fictional Hollywood film portraying our country as the ""good guys."" But as I said that is Hollywood. The movie was created in this way to appeal to the emotions of our people. And all factual evidence shows that some Of your countrymen were very inappropriate in their handling of certain situations in this war. And so were ours. But we as Americans aren't here to whine about it. If Britain were to create such a fabulous movie portraying us as the bad guys we would probably clap our hands and enjoy it because we have the courage to respect your viewpoint and enjoy the movie. We know that it is not real. We as Americans realize the flaws of our ancestors as well as yours. This is a movie. A fictional Tale for our entertainment. And yes it makes us feel good about our history because.... that's right... Our rebellious, cocky ancestors whooped your British butts in the revolutionary war. And you can talk all the smack you want but, we are still the victor! Most of our states are larger than your entire country and we have 50! Get it Brits? We don't care about historical accuracy in our Hollywood films! It is meant for entertainment! We know you aren't all that bad! It's just a story! And the film even portrays most British officers protesting certain Actions of the bad general. This is not far from Historically accurate. There are always good and bad guys on Both sides of the coin. And last of all, remember this... We are still allies you idiotic redcoats! We fight and bleed together. If it wasn't for the support of the USA your tiny country would not hardly matter in the entire scope of things so show us some respect. So yes maybe some of our movies make you feel bad about your culture, but we do not look at these movies as fact. We know that they are only entertainment meant to inspire our American pride. Get your heads out of your tails and do the same. Try to remember we ARE allies now. We beat you, but now we are friends. Hollywood is just entertainment. Get over it. We will protect you when your puny tails are attacked. This movie is amazing from every logical aspect. 10 out of 10. Forget your national pride and watch this movie as an unbiased viewer. If the story doesn't touch your heart then you do not deserve to have one."
"BHilkster","Null","1","10","30 March 2011"," Propaganda film? I think not
","The Patriot is indeed a film that has sparked controversy among American and British viewers. I feel that it is necessary to clear some of the air that surrounds this ""propaganda"" . A great deal of people have come away with the impression that this film is perhaps a unrealistic piece of trash that portrays the British soldiers as Nazis. Thats right Nazis. Viewers have settled on this opinion because the British troops in the film are seen committing evil acts like, executing wounded men, or burning down a church full of civilians. So what? Its a movie, get over it. Is every American officer an insane killer just because Colonel Kurtz is in ""Apocalypse Now""? No. Besides the antagonist, our ""Nazi"" British officer who leads these evil acts, is a fictional character. I hope anybody who wants to see this movie reads this review first, and can watch it without crying fowl. I'm an American and I do realize the historical in-accuracy, and the Rambo like action. But it's simply a movie and a great one too. No one American or British should come away from this feeling insulted, remember its just a movie."

","Movie: African Americans work of their own free will and have to be forced into British service

Movie: The British locked people inside a church and burnt it to the ground
Reality: This wasn't done by the British in the Revolutionary War it was done by the Nazis in WWII
Movie: Stand in for Banastre Tarleton is a butcher who knows no mercy (as is taught in American public schools already
Reality: The closest thing to an atrocity that can be attributed to Tarleton was an incident where a musket accidentally discharged from surrendering American forces and hit Tarleton's horse pinning him to the ground. Tarleton's troops thought that the Americans must have been faking their surrender (They were known for defying the traditional rules of war) and opened fire.
This movie could have focused on real atrocities committed by the British like the prison ships, but apparently that's not enough to sufficiently demonize the British."

","CAUTION -- THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS --<br/><br/>On DVD is really the only to see and appreciate this film. Not only are the picture and sound perfect, with John Williams music, but the DVD extras give additional insight into the making of the movie.  Much effort was taken to make it historically accurate, from the costumes to the battle techniques to the outcomes of the various battles.  Some military men, like Washington and Cornwallis, were genuine. Others, like Gibson's character, were composites of 2 or 3 genuine soldiers. Research at the Smithsonian was the source of authenticity for this film. The film was set and shot in South Carolina.<br/><br/>DD 5.1 sound is used very effectively, especially during the battle scenes where you almost duck to avoid flying bullets. Also the early scenes, in a house, with battle explosions in the distance, in the left or right backgtound.<br/><br/>Overlaid on the historical period from 1776 through 1781 is a fictional story of a man who did not want to fight this war. After his son was executed by the dastardly British officer, and later his oldest son killed in battle at the sword of the same officer, he vowed to help win the war, and to kill the officer. As an audience, we know how it will all end, yet the film never gets dull.  <br/><br/>Although they obviously were two separate efforts, ""The Patriot"" and ""Gladiator"" are very similar films - in both a brave and expert military man just wants to be with his family, but ends up tracking down and killing the man who is responsible for harming his family.<br/><br/>This film is great entertainment, and a great reminder of how much our ancestors gave to establish the US of A. And what a key role the French played at the end to ensure vistory over the British.  The English may not enjoy this film as much. I rate it a strong ""8"" of 10."

","All the while, Mel Gibson's character Benjamin Martin kept reminding me of the historical Francis Marion, more colloquially known as The Swamp Fox during the American Revolution. He operated guerilla style in South Carolina which is this picture's location for the most part, so I was surprised to see only one review mentioning it out of about twenty or so I read before starting here on mine. With the torching of Southern homes and plantations throughout the story, this had the feel of a Civil War movie more than the Revolution, but the brilliant red uniforms of the British kept bringing things back into perspective. Historical inaccuracies aside, the movie is decidedly adventurous with Gibson's character focused in equal parts on revenge and a patriotic cause. The British are portrayed as almost one-sidedly vicious murderers, although if you listen to Benjamin Martin's description of the part he played in the Fort Wilderness campaign, you'll realize that the pendulum swings both ways in time of war when man's humanity is pushed to the brink. With Gibson's prior involvement in 1995's ""Braveheart"", the comparisons between the two movies are almost to be expected, but at least for my money, I wouldn't have bet on a repeat of the victorious American forces mooning the British in their final consequential battle."

","This is a misfire from Mel Gibson. I won't use the director Ronald Emmerich here as we all are well aware of his prowess. This is a derivative and relentlessly mediocre motion picture. The Patriot suffers from a series of potentially fatal flaws: poor character development, a lack of tension, stifling strains of political correctness, a rambling screenplay, manipulative and emotionally untrue ""big moments"", and wretched pacing. Most war films, no matter what their setting, build gradually to a momentous climax. This doesn't happen during The Patriot. There is a big skirmish at the end, but it doesn't seem like the culmination of all that has preceded it. Great battle scenes in movies stir the blood; this one left me cold. Overall, the pacing is uneven and the tone monotonous. With only a couple of exceptions, Emmerich fails to generate tension. The Patriot is a disappointment. Caleb Deschanel's gorgeous cinematography and John Williams' score give the film an impressive sheen but that's about all the good I can say."

Indeed, as the film happens during a war, there are a lot of fights and so many deaths.

","Directed by Roland Emmerich, this ambitious war drama set in 1776 in South Carolina during the American Revolution stars Mel Gibson as Benjamen Martin, a widowed French- Indian war veteran haunted by his past experiences in the the war and roots to live a peaceful life with his children: the youngest Susan (Skye McCole Bartiask), Samuel (Bryan Chafin), William (Logan Lerman), Margaret (Mika Boorem), Nathan (Trevor Morgan), Thomas (Gregory Smith), and the eldest Gabriel (Heath Ledger), wanting to take part in the war against the British military. However, his oldest son Gabriel goes against his father's wishes and joins the continental army himself. When the British army led by the sadistic Colonel William Tavingtom (Jason Isaacs), launches an attack on Martin's family and murders one of his children in cold blood, Benjamen finds himself pulled into the war to protect his family and exact revenge on the British army.<br/><br/>This is second war film with Mel Gibson who starred in the critically acclaimed 1995 hit Braveheart. There is no doubt that to say that director Roland Emmerich does an spectacular job with his movie. The performances by Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger are nothing short of fantastic, and the script does an magnificent job on portraying the grim atmosphere of the revolutionary war. Most of the characters are beautifully written and quite likable, especially Heath Ledger's character. Jason Isaacs makes an impressive (and scary) on the main antagonist Colonel William Tavington, who leads the British Red Coats against the continental army. When we first introduced his character, he is extremely unlikeable with his cruel and sadistic demeanor against Mel Gibson and his family, committing some of the most horrific acts against the American civilians including shooting them at point blank range, burning down their houses, burning down churches, etc. The only thing that may upset viewers is the depiction of the British Red Coats. This is best demonstrated in the scenes when a Catholic family is locked in a church which then burned down by Colonel Tavington and his army, and the scene when Benjamin and his family's houses are set in flames. While these scenes are powerful and put the story in motion, they are sadly over dramatized. The film tries to inaccurately portray the British army as German Nazis from World War II. However, unless you are big history buff, it may there is a good chance you will let this slide. I wasn't particularly bothered by this.<br/><br/>The Patriot is one of Mel Gibson's best films behind Braveheart and We Were Soldiers, the acting was great, the story and atmosphere is very well done, and the battle scenes are portrayed quite realistically. Now as this is a war film, it does get a bit intense at times and very emotional, though not on the line of films like Saving Private Ryan. Nonetheless, this film is a must-watch for all."

","I admit, I enjoyed this film when it was released. Fifteen years on and I found it still fresh. Thought that came to me this time was how our British viewers reviewed this film. After all, both Ledger and Gibson were Australian. Australian is perhaps a bit separate in attitude but still part of the ""Kingdom"". Would they view the film as entertainment and critically as many American view let's say ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" with it's telling of the racial south or perhaps Platoon which illustrate our failures in 'Nam? Or would they say it's simply revisionist against the British Government?<br/><br/>Myself, an avid BBC America viewer with Great British Railways and Top Gear not to mention a lifetime of Dr. Who has never understood the resentment by many British against this country. After all I grew up thinking we as a Nation considered the British our brother. Especially myself with my mothers ancestors coming from Kent. To be honest I expected that some of the British to be shallow... after all, not all admit the racism in the south or the wrongs of Vietnam in this country... But in fact, I was kind of shocked..<br/><br/>I searched for a bit.. looking for Old British reviews and to be honest.... it did not take me long to find ONE.. Predominant and on BBC's Site. The page with the review appears to be locked for comments and had NO OTHER REVIEWS.... Basically it stated that Mel Gibson must hate the UK.. This film showed the British in the worst way and not only that.... He had previously made BRAVEHEART another film that portrayed the British in a bad light!!!! <br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong. I would expect some reviews like this. Reviews that ignore history of how and why both of these conflicts grew and why so many rallied against the Empire. A I said, ignorance can be found for many who ignore facts over prejudice! What took me is that this appears to be the SELECTED REVIEW OF THE BBC TO MAINTAIN! Maybe I now understand a bit better the attitude of many Brits. Just a few weeks ago I meet some vacationers at a local beach. When I told them my father family came from wells, they laughed and the woman said ""there is nothing good in Wales""... Ir took me by surprise, why would they comment so on there own country. I was not until later I was told the Welch are not considered truly British??? I was also told that it was meant as an insult to my family? Guess I am a bit to dense.. Oh well... Guess I am happy to be American, part English, Welch, Irish and German and proud of all parts or my heritage and my country it's past glories and failure have made this county great. Shame that this great, beautiful and proud UK empire can not always say the same without feeling they must insult and belittle. I can only offer the BBC a proof. http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/07/13/the_patriot_review.shtml"

","I hadn't seen this for several years and I remembered why I avoided it when it was on TV (other than the length) Jason Isaacs is just such a bad, bad man, he's like Hitler bad in his portrayal of Col. William Tavington. Cold, calculated, brutal as he rides in and destroys lives, spouting off orders to kill the prisoners, hang your son, burn the barn, burn the house, and shoot the ""silly boy."" Just an epic bad guy on a level that's hard to watch.<br/><br/>I found the movie itself pretty much without faults, sure its a bit too long in it's sweeping saga and is essentially 'Braveheart' in 'America' but Mel gives a great performance as peaceful farmer Benjamin Martin, who is driven to take up arms takes up arms and lead the Colonial Militia during the American revolution after a sadistic British officer murders his son.<br/><br/>The entire cast is great (sigh Heath Ledger) and the cinematography is gorgeous, I mean like every single frame in this is beautiful. The attention to period detail is also flawless, the costumes, set design and battles. -which BTW drove me crazy, what a ridicules way to fight a war; walking in formation to the beat of a drum and just standing there while the other side shoots at you ""ready, aim, fire"" and then you shoot back at them while the generals look on. The battles do get bloody here too. 7/14/14"

","The Patriot takes place during the American Revolutionary war against King George of England. Filmed entirely in South Carolina, per the credits, that provide a realistic background on which Emmerich painted the story.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin is a man who wants to eschew violence, knowing what the price is, and what it can do to your soul. This is usually a very good basic theme for films, because you see the person struggling against himself, and no one does it better than Gibson. He finds himself pushed headlong into something that he knows he should avoid, but cannot. <br/><br/>His son Gabriel, played by Heath Ledger, wants to be like his Dad. Dad fears that his patriotic son will undergo the same fate as he. Dad loves his family of 7, and protects them fearlessly because he is a single parent.<br/><br/>The battle scenes seem realistic for the time. I think the costume design and direction was terrific, adding to the bloody realism. That's the one negative from the film - it's in your face blood - left, right, center, back, forward. Maybe that was necessary to impart the stark realism, I am not sure. But it is there, so be warned.<br/><br/>There are not too many happy moments in this film, and the ones there are bittersweet. There are many sad moments where you can't believe what is happening. Hollywood provides a Hollywood ending, no fear. But still, you walk away stunned and saddened at the whole somewhat tragic story.<br/><br/>Patriot won 3 Academy awards, and is a fine picture. It's only the excess blood and somewhat long story at 2 3/4 hours, that makes me give it only a 7/10. The acting is top notch, as is the story, direction, and costume design. You will be moved by this story. Enjoy."

","In the opening of the movie, Mel Gibson can't make a decent rocking chair. He made many attempts, always ending up in failure.<br/><br/>I like this scene, and always think that this was quite creative in portraying a former war-hero.<br/><br/>Yet, recently, I found that probably another movie gave Mel Gibson the inspiration for this opening.<br/><br/>Just watch Unforgiven (1992), look at how clumsy the former William Munny was in separating his hogs, :-) By the way, in the very beginning of The Patriot (2000), Captain Martin put his weapons used in the last war into a box, to bury his ""sinful"" past. In Unforgiven (1992), East Clintwood talked about his passed-away wife, when Schofield Kid came to invite him for a bounty-hunter. William Munny said that his wife cured him of drunkenness and wickedness. Note the parallel here."

","I just got through watching this movie a second time. I've been such a big fan since my first time watching it in high school that after watching it again I was curious to see what it's ratings were online. I was shocked when I saw how low this movie was scored! It appears to be mostly because of inadequate portrayal of how exactly the war happened, which may or may not be true. I will admit that I am not as educated in that area of our history as I should and would like to be. However, I feel that the storyline and events are realistic as well as attention grabbing and emotional, I've teared up more than a few times throughout the film as well! Like I mentioned, this was my second time watching the film, and both times I've been glued to the screen! Whether or not it shows exactly how the war occurred, this is hands down one of my favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone!"

","Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a widower farmer and veteran of the French-and-Indian Wars. He doesn't want to fight in the Revolutionary War until a British soldier (Jason Issacs) kills one of his children and he changes his mind.<br/><br/>Good actors (like Mel, Heath Ledger, Jason Issacs, etc), the characters in a film set in the 1770s were pretty good, the firefight/battle scenes were done well, and the film is actually historically accurate in some spots (like the Battle of the Cowpens).<br/><br/>Sure, not everything in the movie is historically accurate, but that shouldn't be a reason to not like it. One part I didn't like was when the British burn down a church with civilians inside. I know that didn't actually happen during the war, but I guess the filmmakers needed another reason for the characters to continue the fight.<br/><br/>Overall, The Patriot was/is a good war film that gives you a feeling of war, peace, and family. Also, it shows that people will fight for something they believe in, like being a free nation."

","It's a lot cooler than people give it credit for. While it's not a flawless epic, it's extremely fun and has Mel Gibson in full rage mode. It's an easy to follow story with great visuals and a very realistic quality. Jason Isaacs portrayed a villain that will have to go down in movie history as one of the most evil. Historically inaccurate it may be, but frankly I don't need to see something that's 100%. They took the Revolutionary War and shaped it into a really interesting and powerful narrative.Love Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger in this movie. Everyone did such a great job!This is one of my Favorite Movies. Health Ledge, Mel Gibson and the cast is just Top's They couldn't have cast a better cast of actors.

"mnirem","6","0","9","9 June 2011"," No, It's not accurate, but...
","I first saw The Patriot when I was 7 years old (yes, a bit young, but compare that to when I saw the Godfather at 4). I remember as this being one of the first truly well made films that I'd ever seen. Watching it today, I'd say it still holds up. However, seeing what people have to say about it here on IMDb, I suppose I'm part of a certain minority.<br/><br/>First off, I'd like to look at the director's work on this movie. Emmerich is probably not what most people would consider to be a ""good"" director, seeing his several movies following the exact same formula as his most famous film, Independence Day. However, this film truly shows his true potential. The cinematography is amazingly done. Emmerich captured the war sequences perfectly. I think everyone who's seen this movie remembers the moment where a soldier takes a cannonball to the face. -shivers-. Another good thing to remember is how well the scenery and costume design are. Just how good are they? Very.<br/><br/>Also, the acting is very good. As much of a jerk Mel Gibson has shown to be in the public light, he still does a great job acting in this. The rest of the cast does a good job as well, though few are necessarily remember worthy, except maybe the main villain. I believe this is how I segue into the controversial part of this movie.<br/><br/>The writing. And no, it's not lazy or poorly constructed or full of plot holes or rushed or anything along those lines, it's problem is how it paints its heroes and villains. The heroes are shown as valiant, proud rebels who love freedom, and the villains are just short of fanged beast that despise the very thought of equality. People complain that it's not historically accurate and that it has a bias. My only response is: so? To be honest, it's a movie. It didn't pull a Human Centipede and say it was ""100% historically accurate"". The movie was just that: a movie. Yes, it was dramatized and twisted from reality, but it's not any sort of documentary. Though it starts to get absurd, that's not enough to make the movie bad. Not even close.<br/><br/>One thing to keep in mind: forget that I was 7 when I saw it, this movie is gore-filled and violent. Kids under 11 would find it near terrifying.<br/><br/>Overall, if you get bothered by historical inaccuracies, either don't watch it or remember, it's not a documentary. 8 out of 10."

"Scriptorius","9","0","8","2 May 2010"," History and Fiction: Aim Small in Detail Miss Small in Detail
","The movie is clearly fiction in the greater sense, but the themes it aims to explore in fine detail are the themes of the American Revolution. It paints the war with a brush of strong contrast and the moral differences and struggles of the people involved. The sense of moral strength and weakness is not academic. The participants are shown applying their moral theory and the consequences thereof. The war began after an extended period of increasing tension and the feeling by the American Colonists that their rights as Englishmen were being denied. This movie begins with Benjamin Martin, the protagonist, expressing his views regarding joining in conflict, having seen it first hand. The movie introduces the viewer to hostilities and the frustration of the characters. These frustrations have real historical roots; for example a British officer in 1778, Col. Charles Stuart wrote: ""Wherever our armies have marched, wherever they have encamped, every species of barbarity has been executed. We planted an irrevocable hatred wherever we went, which neither time nor measure will be able to eradicate."" The movie explores the conflicts between armies, citizens, neighbors, and family members as a consequence of the times. The movie is accurate in the small details of history and it hits its mark. It also works at good continuity; one small example: at the end of an ambush of the British by Martin and his sons, we see the scene fade but it looks like one of the dead sits up. Later, we find there is indeed a seriously wounded survivor of the ambush. The chief bad guy in the movie, the thoroughly ambitious and ruthless Colonel Tavington, is portrayed splendidly by Jason Isaacs. The Tavington character is loosely based on the history of British officer Col Banastre Tarleton. The very real Tarleton was boyhood best friend with Henry Mouzon. On August 7, 1780, Tarleton burned Mouzon's home to the ground. Tarleton apparently liked to burn things. This site shows the historical marker for the church burned by the British under Tarleton's orders: http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=27903. So yes, the war in history brought out the worst in Tarleton's heart. The participation by black volunteers and the slaves who served on behalf of their owners in the American militia depicted in the movie likewise traces to real events. After his surrender, in history Cornwallis was surprised to find in the American camp what he thought was one of his own men, James Armistead. Armistead was the key intelligence agent the Americans had for spying on Cornwallis. They say history is a fiction written by the winners. The Patriot is a fiction written by the winners and a good one at that. Those who fought for freedom did feel the plight of those enslaved. The very few who found their way to new freedom did so by serving their new nation with the highest honor."

"pethelpers","8","0","8","17 March 2010"," Decent film attempt
","Being a huge historical buff, particularly concerning the American Revolution, I will watch any movie about that topic. There are far too few considering that it was the greatest event in history giving birth as it did to contemporary modes of popular democratic government. I was therefore interested to see that many reviews discuss the issue of its historical authenticity. Having read mountains on the history, I pronounce the movie interesting in that respect because it tried to incorporate important historical issues. The final battle scene, for example, is a rough allusion to the Battle of Guilford Courthouse which the Brits technically won (the Americans left the field first) but which in effect was a strategic disaster for the British who lost half their army. The British Whig leader James Fox said in the house of commons that 'another victory like that would spell the end of the British army. The movie version makes reference to important facts from that battle - like the militia leading the Brits into charging an line of Continental regulars hidden over a hill + Cornwallis, who wasn't at that battle, ordering artillery to fire into his own centre (which included his own troops). So even if historically inaccurate in detail, it gave some important information about how Cornwallis managed to lose the war. Regarding the much maligned image of the brutal Brit who burned people in the church - there really was such a monster - Colonel Banistre Tarleton ('bloody ban') of the British Legion. The atrocities he actually committed were even worse than those shown in the movie. <br/><br/>For these, and many other reasons, I pronounce the movie a credible piece of fiction but what I really wish is that someone would make a comprehensive film history of the American Revolution along the line of HBOs 'Band of Brothers' and 'Pacific'. It was an event of the greatest importance in history, crammed with heroes, villains, great events etc. Giants like George Washington and Alexander Hamilton are nowhere to be found in the world these day."

Benjamin Martin, masterfully played by Mel Gibson, is a hero of the French-Indian war, who witnessed such cruelty during the many battles he survived that he has decided to live by peaceful means and not get involved in what he augurs to be a rather brutal fight that shall not take place in a remote location, but that will take its toll in every backyard of the residents of the town where he lives with his six children.

","I had to watch this for my US History class, despite that my school doesn't allow any movies rated R.

His two oldest sons, the eldest Heath Ledger's character Gabriel, want to join the Rebels and fight against the British. When one of Benjamin's sons is killed, he goes hellbent on fighting against the Redcoats, bringing back his soldier instincts and fighting with the other Rebels to fight for American's independence.<br/><br/>However, I do think that some of the other reviewers have a point. The Redcoats were portrayed a lot to be like the Nazis. Would they have burned a church filled with innocent people to the ground? Would they have really killed more innocent people like children, too? I know that the British were trying to fight back against the Americans, but this movie kind of got them out of hand.<br/><br/>Either way, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes historical movies, but beware that this movie is rated R for good reasons.

"occ165","10","0","6","11 December 2008"," Patriot Summary
","The Revolutionary War epic, The Patriot (2000), is a story of a father forced to revisit his aggressive nature when his country and his family are threatened by the British Empire. Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a widower living on his South Carolina plantation with his seven children, when the British Empire attacks the American Colonies in one of the biggest wars in American history. Martin is stuck between being the violent war soldier that he used to be and being a proper father to his children when they only have him to rely on. He eventually decides that his country and his family need his protection and once again he will pick up his rifle and bayonet. The plot of the story is pretty basic and understandable. Martin wants to stay out of the conflict and let others do the fighting for him. He feels he has a loyalty to his family that is more important than his loyalty to his country. But when the time comes that his son (Heath Ledger) is killed by the British army in cold blood, Martin will return with a vengeance that no British soldier will be able to defy. The Patriot has a number of shots and camera angles, but the director, Roland Emmerich, seems especially to love the long shot that gives the viewer a long range view of the scene and then zooms into the real action that is taking place in the story. For example, there is a scene where Gibson and Ledger are staring out a window at a battle; at which point, the camera zooms in and shows a closer up shot of the battle. He also uses the medium shot that gives the viewer a view of the upper body and makes you feel almost like you are a part of the story. The director uses many different camera angles that give the viewer an idea of who the main characters and whom they should keep a look out for. Martin will remain almost always at eye level and gives you the feeling that not only is he an important character but that he is a decent man with a high moral standard. Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), the man who murders Martin's son, is always shot with a low angle; this tells the viewer that he is someone powerful and in this case very threatening. This would cause the viewer to be afraid of Tavington and to see him as the villain. The movie has some gore and may turn off some viewers. I thought that it had just the right amount to show how deadly war really is, but also keeps in mind the real story behind the war. The story is meant to show the viewer that a man can be loyal to his country, his family, and his beliefs all at the same time and that some things that you don't think are the right choice can sometimes help you in the long run. I suggest The Patriot to any person who can appreciate an action movie. I would give it 5 stars. The movie has a remarkable story line and it takes a look into the history and the making of the United States of America. Overall, this movie is excellent. It's never slow and will always keep you excited and even at times laughing. So if you're feeling patriotic go out and see, The Patriot."

","In my own theories about the modern world of film-making, there are lots of obsessions with making films that contain depressing details of savagery and slaying and they can be very tricky that it isn't everyones' taste and it can be told better in documentary programmes. In the classic case of the film titled The Patriot, I can imagine it being in around the late 1770s prior to the fall of British control on the USA. There are lots of good features about the film and the times are well reconstructed here and they are very much like Yorktown and Williamsburg with the architects and this is what I particularly like about this film and it reminds me of my visit to these places. I think most of the characters on the silver screen are fictitious and the casting of Mel Gibson is quite good while Jason Isaacs is excellent as a brutal army commander having already starred in a mini series called Civvies. As already stated, there are weaknesses about the film and its plot along with some depressing battlefield scenes and some overacting but in fairness, it actually happened around that time."
"jkebttn71","9","0","4","30 October 2008"," the most underrated film ever
","People say it's too cheesy (like Godzilla (10/10)) but it's not. The cinematography is phenomenal and the acting top notch. So what if it's historically incorrect; it's a movie not a history lesson. Mel Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin; an ex- war hero for the confederacy who has decided (after the death of his wife) to hang his musket up. But when the American people rebel for freedom against the British (by the way, I am British and was not offended at all by this film) his eldest son (heath Ledger) goes to fight. still he remains silent until an evil British colonel (Jason Issacs) shoots one of his sons. He then proceeds to kill high ranking British officers in a bath of blood and limbs. It all builds up to an epic battle. If you don't like Mel Gibsons style of directing then watch this because he does not direct it which some people seem to think is the case. His acting is outstanding and heath ledger gives a strong performance. But one of the best villainous performances ever given must be Jason Issacs in this film; I wanted to kill him from the start, brilliant. The cinematography was genius and the directing from Roland Emmerich was very good. This is easily one of the best war films ever made; up their with saving private Ryan, full metal jacket, Braveheart etc. widely underrated."
"Boromir28","8","0","2","6 June 2008"," Yes it is a BAD movie....
","....but my word it's entertaining.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson portrays a farmer Benjamin Martin who's greatest goal in life is to live peacefully and taking care of his children...and to build a rocking chair that doesn't break. When the colony of South Corolina enters the revolutionary war he reluctantly sees his eldest son Gabriel (the late GREAT Heath Ledger) join the regular army. By the cruel hand of fate his second eldest son is killed and Gabriel is taking prisoner, from here on Benjamin has to take action in order to save his son and finds himself drawn into the fight for a free country.<br/><br/>Yes it is a bad movie and it is by no means historically accurate, far from it, and that is not really it's purpose. The purpose of the film is to tell a compelling story about a man doing extra ordinary things under extra ordinary conditions, and as such it works. It does not have the same feel to it as Braveheart, which it clearly tries to copy. Where Braveheart to some degree was very serious and took itself very seriously.<br/><br/>The Patriot tells roughly the same story but here ""Braveheart"" has grown a little older and has a family who he fights for. The movie has two parts: part one where it goes really well for the militia Benjamin leads along with his son and a French officer (Tchéky Karyo, who I think they got because Jean Reno isn't fat and Gerard Depardieu is too old) sent to train the militia. Part two the militia is being hunted by Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs) and who uses very un-gentlemen-like methods to drive them out.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson has played this part a lot in recent years and it shows as he most of the movie runs on auto pilot and relies on his eyes and his Lethal Weapons mannerisms. Jason Isaacs is also very stereotypical and one wonders if really wanted to be there.<br/><br/>This was a lot of bad things, but really the movie IS entertaining because you can watch it without having to think...at all...I know Roland Emmerich has been criticized for making such films, especially his Armageddon epic The Day After Tomorrow, but i really think there has to be room for that kind of movie as well. <br/><br/>As a movie critic on Danish television so rightly said today: sometimes you have to watch the bad to appreciate the good...<br/><br/>...I like to watch this movie anyway...it's just good entertainment."

","The Patriot takes place in South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War. The main character, Benjamin Martin, is a revered man in who fought bravely in the French and Indian war, but has become a family man and does not wish to go to war with Great Britain.<br/><br/>Once the basis is set, the movie gets right on to the drama. Benjamin's son, 18, joins the soldiers to fight for America against the wishes of his father. Shortly thereafter, the son stumbles home injured and is miraculously healed by their slave lady who happens to be a Medical Doctor or something. (Oh yeah, it's supposedly OK he owns a slave because she's happy). Benjamin has his house burned down because the slave lady is healing soldiers from both sides of the war. Ben's 18 year old son is sentenced to be hanged. To add to the drama, Ben's 15 year old son tries to save his 18 year old brother and is shot in front of his family by a redcoat who does everything in his power to be as evil as possible. He even calls Benjamin's son a ""stupid boy"" as he dies in Ben's arms.<br/><br/>That's when Benjamin goes berserk, takes his 6 and 7 year old kids, who are expert marksmen or something, and kills 20 bumbling redcoats in order to save his son who is being led off to be hanged. It's a cool scene, but it's a bit ridiculous. Benjamin runs in with his little ax and kills at least 8 guys who have guns before hacking up the body of a random redcoat in front of his little children just because he's angry.<br/><br/>After this, he decides to go to war (surprise surprise) where he leads a militia and uses his high rank to advance the rank of his son (because he knows the woods). They split up for some arbitrary reason, taking different paths in the woods, and meet back up in what seems like 5 minutes. The inexperienced kid retains his high rank but never uses it to do anything. Their group runs around killing and outsmarting many redcoats despite the fact they are just a posse of farmers lead by a smart man. Eventually the British illegally pursue Ben's militia's families. One crazy fat man finds his home burned down with his wife and child laying outside the fiery houses, dead with their bodies in perfect condition. He of coarse kills himself, because that's the most dramatic thing that could happen.<br/><br/>Speaking of drama, the British soldier's lock all of the movie's familiar towns people in a church and burn them alive (including the 18 year old son's wife that we hardly get to know). Speaking of never getting to know characters, the 18 year old gets stabbed by the same evil redcoat who killed Ben's other son. You have a hard time caring when he dies though, because although he has been present during the entire movie, you barely know him.<br/><br/>Oh, I forgot to mention the one black guy in the entire militia is there to gain freedom from slavery (which was actually a deal offered by the British rather than the Americans). Only one man in the militia gives him trouble for being black but they of coarse become friends in some single cheesy quote of respect during the final battle.<br/><br/>The final fight between Ben and the evil redcoat who he's been seeking revenge against the entire time is really drawn out (it's also in slow motion). Ben of coarse wins and leaves the evil dead redcoat propped up on his musket. It was a clichéd scene that had a fun and clichéd ending."

","Though I thought that overall it was a decent movie, ""The Patiot"" did lack in historical qualities. The battle at the end is supposed to be the Battle of Cowpens. And so on and so forth. But, what I really am sounding off on is those who have commented on this movie who aren't even American! Of course they're going to say that it was inaccurate. Let those who actually know what happened awaken those to the truth. Inaccuracies are numerous in the movie. Take that from an actual American citizen. For example, the British Army (namely the Green Dragoons under Col. Tarleton (who Tavington is modeled after) never burnt the church in the small South Carolina town. Also, the movie portrays the Green Dragoons as Englishmen. However, the only Englishmen were those in command. They were called the Green Dragoons because they were an army of loyalists distinguishable by their red AND GREEN uniforms. I could point them all out but you must watch ""The Patriot""."
"exellentfilms","3","0","2","26 March 2008"," The underlying reason why people like this....
","Now, lets start with the technicalities of this film, and its floors, before i go into the politics, and the reason why i think people actually like this. <br/><br/>Their are just so many floors which are mainly due to the script: <br/><br/>The thematical issues such as, the son who worries his father but really is just like his father. The widower, who is still mourning his wifes death. This film however, has pretty nice cinematography, and some quite good acting from Heath Ledger (RIP), and it also has ummm, not much good to be said actually....<br/><br/>It does have a lot of cheesy, and old fashoined clichés, such as the old good vs evil, and the good guy wins, but with a sacrifice. The dialogue is corny, it is historically inaccurate so much so, that it could very easily mislead someone into thinking its history, because its portrayed in such a confident way. <br/><br/>So why do people like this film? I will tell you why: It is adrenaline pumped, patriotic crap, which i think Americans, and Anti Colonial Britain people just love, because firstly, the Americans win (which they obivously did in the war, but they did not win it as handsomely as the film portrays) our hero lives, and bludgeons a few Brits to death. And all round, just pleases the audience, because lets face it, Americans for some reason, love to see Brits die on screen, and Brits are always portrayed as the bad guys. <br/><br/>But this arises the question? Does it have to be a technically sound film, to be a good one. Can a film have a crappy script, and terrible acting, but entertains the masses, and be regarded as great? <br/><br/>Well um, i dunno, but lets just admit all Americans, and the odd Indian who has been spreading hatred around, this film is just corny patriotic trash."

","Recently George W Bush shocked a sedate audience in the White House by thanking Queen Elizabeth II for the assistance the British gave in celebrating American independence back in 1776. The shock on Her Majesty's face and the stunned awe that spread over the gathering tell it all. Mr Bush maybe a little short on his history: the American Revolution was a grisly spectacle which lasted eight full years until the last of the Red Coats departed.<br/><br/>The story of the seminal event still rankles Merry Olde. When this film was released as Mel Gibson's magnum opus, the English couldn't keep a stiff upper lip. The Independence Day the epic The Patriot, was scorned as ""Gratuitously anti-British"" and a Hollywood vision of ""excessive violence is all too real,"" Brits say Mel Gibson emerged from playing the Scottish rebel Wallace as a stock anti-British character. Seemingly all the sneering, smirking, evil villains speak the Kings English. <br/><br/>Certainly, The Patriot's considerable emotional force stems from sheer rage, an unforgiving anger, but as the story opens Mel's character Benjamin Martin was hardly a rabid patriot. As a South Carolina legislator Martin joins a small block which opposes independence, warning of the tremendous military power Britain can bring to bear. Martin's frightening prophesy of the war coming home comes true; the Palmetto flag is replaced by the Union Jack when the colonial capitol of South Carolina falls to the British. Even so Benjamin Martin might have been content to have sat out the war on his farms perfecting his woodworking skills until atrocities force Martin who to arms. The struggle devolves into a personal feud with a surly British Colonel Tavington whose nasty deeds would make him an able accomplice of PFC Lynndie England, supposed ringleader of US warders at Abu Grave.<br/><br/>Are the British entitled to cry foul?<br/><br/>The Patriot to some extent tracks the struggle between British Colonel Tarleton and American Francis Marion for control of the Carolinas. <br/><br/>The Patriot's Colonel Tavington is based on the very real life exploits of Colonel Banastre ""The Butcher"" Tarleton. Dubbed ""Bloody Benny"" Tarleton's slaughter of surrendering American cavalry at the Waxhaws made him one of the most feared Brish officers. <br/><br/>The historical Banaster Tarleton is a complex character,,, Yet Tarleton the defender of the monarchy was no aristocrat but of the same general merchant class that supported the revolution <br/><br/>Excesses sometimes cow an enemy ; sometimes they encourage resistance,,, <br/><br/>Tarleton certainly scared off many faint of heart, but what remained behind to fight him in the swamps and forests were uniquely determined to fire off a few shots melt away and send The Scarlet Wonder Tarleton charging aimlessly about looking for a vanished enemy already in position for its next ambush <br/><br/>Yet British critics are correct in one sense. The historical ""Swamp Fox"" Francis Marion who in the William Cullen Bryant poem sent a shiver to the timbers of the British foeman with his very name, discouraged personal feud. There was none of the in-your face repartees. Contact with the British was so distant that Marion's sword rusted into his scabbard. <br/><br/>This core message about the origins of the Republic, however is its historical roots in real-time, real-place communities. <br/><br/>As far as the violence, this was a Revolution chock full of it. The Revolution by no means was a series of parades, speeches and declaration. The Revolution was a violent, divisive event which divided all classes and races. <br/><br/>To Mel's credit, The Patriot makes an interesting point concerning the soldiers of the Revolution. They were good men recruited in church, as well as denizens of the taverns. Some were slaves enlisted by masters. The Revolution divided all classes and races. Some American Blacks fought for the British; some for the Americans. On the American side some were enrolled by their masters or tagged along with them, some were recruited and promised freedom and some were just counted as white."

","There is a great old 1965 Jimmy Stewart movie called Shenandoah about a father that finds his family in the middle of the Civil War. The Patriot is basically the same story updated with a different war. They are both worth watching.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson plays the father (with a military past he is trying to forget) who is just trying to runs a farm and avoid conflict. Neesdless to say that is not going to happen as his sons get drawn into the battle. The old warrior comes back and starts fighting the British.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger plays one of his sons, while the ever lovely Joely Richardson plays his sister-in-law (wife is dead). Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy from Harry Potter) plays the bad guy. Is that a surprise? The cast list has several other great players, and you will likely find one that you enjoy.<br/><br/>Good movie about the period."

Mel Gibson's character was supposed to represent Francis Marion the Swamp Fox and show how he used guerrilla warfare. In the movie Benjamin Martian did not want to fight for the revolutionary war because he thought it was just as bad to have one horrible ruler 3000 miles away then have 3000 one mile away. He changed his mind when Col. William Tavington shot his son while trying to save his older brother Gabriel. Then in anger he takes his two sons, kills 20 British soldiers and saves his son who ends up going back to the continental army anyways but this time instead of watching his son ride away to his doom he goes with him and becomes commander of part of the army. The person who controlled the army knew about what happened at fort wilderness. He had Gabriel transferred to be under his fathers control."

"maccrowus","8","0","1","16 October 2006"," Accuracy in The Patriot
","To expect accuracy of Hollywood is a bit much. You object to the portrayal of Tarleton, but not to his being killed. You don't object to Tarleton's father being described as a wastrel when he was Lord Mayor of Liverpool and it was actually Tarleton who squandered his own inheritance, only saving enough to purchase a commission. You don't object to Cornwallis being described as a genius when he clearly wasn't. Do only some parts have to be accurate to satisfy you? If so, which parts? Honestly, I usually consider film an excellent jumping off point to begin research and discussion. What I do find ironic is that a Scot is defending an Englishman. But then the Scots have been doing a rather good job of fighting battles for the English for a long time. As to whether Tarleton was a nice guy was one of the only one of the officers of the British Army not to welcomed to dine with American officers after the surrender at Yorktown. He was that despised during the Revolution. Testimony of his unjustified cruelty at Waxhaw massacre came from members of the British Army, and that very cruelty may have led neutrals to rally to the American cause. But the main point is that The Patriot is a movie, not history. God help us if we are depending on Hollywood or Pinewood or Bollywood to teach us history. Last time I checked they just wanted us to buy tickets and rent DVD's."

","This movie is very entertaining if you don't get hung up on the excessive violence and 'cartoonish' characterizations.

If you think of the American Revolution as Lexington and minutemen 'provoking' gentlemanly British soldiers, this movie may not be for you. It clearly shows the reluctance of the people of the Carolinas to get involved in the war until the British start using terrorist tactics on them.

Mel Gibson created Guerilla warfare, Mel Gibson kills 10 guys with a Tomahawk) but overall, I felt this movie really did a great job of showing SOME history while being ENTERTAINGING at the same time. If you're looking for a movie to really explain things, you should probably look elsewhere. If you're looking for a movie whit a historical setting that manages to entertain, then this is for you. The acting was top notch. Mel Gibson is in fine form as usual, the annoying Heath Ledger is even quite good. However, Jason Isaacs is phenomenal as the villain. He truly makes you despise his character. This movie was great all around and should have won an award of some sort. I really recommend this!!!"
"danielstackhouse","10","0","5","31 March 2006"," The most patriotic movie I have ever seen.
","The Patriot is a glorious historical epic that highlights what was risked and lost in the American War for Independence. The action, acting, emotion, cinematography and music are excellent. Mel Gibson brings the emotion and passion that he is known for to the title role.<br/><br/>Some have criticized the movie as historically inaccurate and too violent. However, the violence is realistic and accurately portrays the nature of eighteenth-century warfare. This may be hard to watch, but that is the way it was. The charge that the movie simplistically depicts all of the English as evil brutes is completely false. General Cornwallis (portrayed by Tom Wilkinson) harshly reprimands the villain, William Tavington (in an Oscar-worthy performance by Jason Isaacs) for his brutal tactics. In addition, the Tavington character is based upon an actual English officer named Banistre Tarleton, who shot surrendering American soldiers.<br/><br/>The Patriot helps to remind Americans of their glorious origins as they ""made the world anew."" It is a welcome relief for those of us tired of the negative portrayals of Americans and American history in popular culture."

"DICK STEEL","8","0","6","24 November 2005"," A Nutshell Review: The Patriot (2000)
","Brought to screen by the creative team behind Godzilla, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin bring on board 2 actors of Australian descent (Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger) to tell you a tale of the American Revolutionary War, set in the year 1796, where the British are whipping the Continental soldiers real bad. It doesn't dwell too much on the big picture, but focuses on a smaller details which might stir your interest to read up more on that part of history.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a retired soldier, now farmer, who has a war reputation of being a brutal, efficient man of war. He tends to his land and brings up seven children, of whom the eldest, Gabriel Martin (Heath Ledger), goes against his father's wish and enlists in the Continental army to pursue his ideal of freedom and just cause.<br/><br/>As Benjamin warned, this war will be fought not on some faraway place, but at their doorsteps. And true enough, he finds British soldiers on his land, who finds fault with him, murders one of his sons in cold blood, and taking away an injured Gabriel. Enraged, Benjamin massacres an entire platoon of soldiers, and earns himself the nickname ""The Ghost"", in one of the more intense battle scenes in this movie. It's satisfying to watch how one man (and his two other children) plan an ambush and take on their enemies, while showing no mercy in their quest for revenge.<br/><br/>Drawn reluctantly into the war by his personal unfortunate episode, Benjamin volunteers for service and links up with Gabriel to recruit a band of militia Patriots to take on the well organized British soldiers, using guerrilla tactics to ambush and contain the British in the south, stalling their plans to move up North to crush Washington's troops.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that the British general Lord Charles Cornwallis (played by Tom Wilkinson) was portrayed as a gentleman who fights fairly in his own opinion, and prides himself in doing so. But when the desperation for success creeps in, he sanctions guerrilla tactics against the civilian townfolk in order to get to the Patriots (sounds like modern day terrorism?). You can't help but laugh at his naivety when being conned by Benjamin in one prisoner exchange scene.<br/><br/>As with most war movies after Saving Private Ryan, blood and gore get a fair bit of air time, and back in the 18th century, war is fought almost face to face. There is the musket, which fires only one shot, then requires a reload, and a long bayonet affixed at the tip for that bayonet fighting in close quarters. But what really is terrifying is the artillery's predecessor - the cannon. Many scenes in this movie show how a simple cannonball can decapitate human limbs, and even rip a human head off the torso. Pretty gruesome stuff.<br/><br/>Running close to three hours long, this movie doesn't bore you with its many subplots about family and relationships, but rather, these elements enhance and bring forth the horrors of war, that everyone out there is a brother, father, son, and highlights that not every war is meant to be for a honourable cause. It could be as simple as fighting for, and with, the person beside you."

I think Mel Gibson's performance in this film was his best since 'the Bounty' although i haven't seen 'gallipoli.' The scene where Mel is talking to Chris Cooper trying to justify death and war after his second son dies, is just masterful, if you aren't moved by that you're stone-dead, it's as good as anything 'Gladiator' or 'Bridge over the River Kwai' has to offer.<br/><br/>Jason Isaacs was born for his Tavington role, and i hope he gets discovered, because he also shined in 'Blackhawk Down.'

Scotland has a parliament now, but this movie has absolutely nothing to show for its existence. I was surprised that The Passion of the Christ didn't star Mel Gibson as Jesus himself fighting off English troops.<br/><br/>In summation, this movie has an extraordinarily tenuous relationship with history and with reality, and even offers little entertainment value beyond a few scenes of bloodshed.

","I have read other comments people have left and what a lot of them are not getting is that this isn't a distortion of the truth. This entire movie is American HISTORY. In a sense Benjamin Martin was a real person. One of the greatest American heroes during the revolutionary war was a man named Marion Francis, or commonly referred to as ""The Swamp Fox."" In this particular movie he's ""The Ghost."" Why they used a different name, I couldn't tell you, but they did. The Patriot was based on Marion Francis. Marion Francis is my 4x grandfather, so I know pretty much everything about him, his family, what he did to the native Americans, his life, all sorts of good stuff.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie puts A LOT of emphasis on the fact that Benjamin Martin is trying to be a peaceful family man, because that's what he wants, he wants to live in peace without witnessing anymore war. When peace and freedom are challenged he does what he has to do, fight again. This movie is in no way a distortion, it's much like a documentary of the life of Marion Francis. I think it's one of the best movies too see. You can say that there are slow parts, but they're not slow parts, it's character building, and this movie wasn't made for a warmonger. No movie is going to be filled with action, death, and destruction. I highly recommend this film to anyone."

","Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, or ""the ghost"" - a one man army, family man and a colonel in the Continental Army. He joins the war against the Britts to get vengeance for his sons death, and to look after his oldest son, who joins the fight despite his fathers disapproval.<br/><br/>The Patriot is an OK movie, but it lacks the feel of realism, as it is soaked with Hollywood clichés and overflowing heroism, without the grim look of real war. Racism in the south is shrugged upon by small disputes of skin colour in the start of the movie, and ""honor to fight with you"" in the end.<br/><br/>Battles are well done, with the red coats and the blue coats marching against each other on open fields in the old ""honourable way"", but the war itself is not the focus of this movie. The focus is put on Martin and his militia, hiding in the swamp and fighting against the Britts on their own terms, ambushing supply wagons and chasing the evil Britt cavalry Captain responsible for Martins son's death.<br/><br/>In another words it seems the war for Americas Independence is only in the background, while these two - the hero and the antihero - fight each other. Gibson's character being the perfect family man, who can look beyond skin colour, a man of principle, and of course legend among soldiers. The British cavalry captain is apparently the First Anti-Christ, burning down churches, killing women and children left and right, and of course enjoying it! What I'm trying to say here, is it is not even trying to be historically accurate, and it is not trying to give a statement against war, as all good war films do.<br/><br/>But it is worth watching.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The Patriot is set during the war of Independence and is about a man seeking revenge for his son, who was killed by a sadistic British soldier.<br/><br/>Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a peaceful farmer raising seven kids alone, as his wife has died. His eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) immediately signs up to go to war, however, he is later captured by Colonal William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), a British soldier notorious for his brutal tactics and sentenced to hang. When Benjamin's second eldest son, Thomas (Gregory Smith) goes to help his brother, he is shot down and killed by Tavington in cold blood.Taking his younger children to live with their aunt (Joely Richardson), Benjamin sets out to avenge his sons death.<br/><br/>The Patriot is a very entertaining movie and unlike most war movies, doesn't last for about four hours. It runs just over two hours. Mel Gibson as always, is very watchable as he is blessed with a lot of screen presence and electricity on screen. Jason Isaacs captures Tavington's cold heart perfectly and is enjoyable to watch. However, the scene stealer is the young actress who plays Benjamin's youngest daughter Susan, Skye McCole Bartusiak. Just eight years old at the time of filming, she has delivered a performance that could put to shame some of the greats. The depth and emotion she brings to her character is unbelievable and their is one scene involving her that will have you crying your eyes out.<br/><br/>If you're an American, you will particularly enjoy it as it is very patriotic (as the title may suggest), but even so, it is a very enjoyable movie."

Of course the history of America's Independence does not involve ultimately among Mel Gibson's character. So are the roles in the played by Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet in 'Titanic' generally apply to the story in the actual sinking of the HMS Titanic?

This movie was very accurate with its facts and depicted the war very well. The conflict between Tavington and Martin is beautifully portrayed and it was the glue that held the story together. Family bonds was also a big issue that was brought out the the picture. The war that was brought upon this family had many pros and cons. All though two sons were lost during the war, they became so much closer and I thought that was a great story. I give the Patriot TWO THUMBS UP."

""Braveheart"" is known as one of Gibson's best movies (well deserved recognition), however I do believe that ""The Patriot"" was extremely under-rated. Unlike Gibson's ""Braveheart"", The Patriot does not only deal with the war aspect, but instead drifts off to explore many more underlying plots. This movie is not only ideal for a war-movie buff, but also to a woman who is known only to like the ""chick flick"" type movies. Be prepared to cry and laugh..(stock up on tissues!)."

","I feel this film lives up to its expectations in all aspects. It carries foreword a story in the same manner as Gettysburg, Gods and Generals, Glory and some of the other 90s and later films about wars to safeguard American Independence. While it may be ""fashionable"" nowadays to bash Commanders and Presidents who have led these battles for American independence, I will take no part of it. It shows that war is not always gallant and pretty and achieves this with a measure of realism in the way Hollywood has chosen to depict. Thankfully it does not have scores of scenes with tremendous explosions possible only with large amounts of gasoline, explosives and pyrotechnics not a part of any conflagration achieved in war. I guess some can be entertained only with such overkill, as evidenced by the large number of films achieving box office success nowdays with that requirement being met. In my opinion, too few films exist about the American wars of Independence. Mel Gibson's performance gets a 10/10 on this one. Since I have it on disk, I am sure I will enjoy it many times, along with aforementioned films."

He is an ex-soldier who fights to overcome a memory at Fort Wilderness, and a militia leader who fights for what he believes in during the Revolutionary War.<br/><br/>The critical intention of this movie is shown in a way we can all understand. The message is to make us see what the brave men of the colonies did to win our freedom from England for all of us. If it was not for the French getting there at the end, we may be a part of England today.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was superb. The looks of the faces and in the eyes of the actors made me feel they were actually living their roles. The camera work was up close and personal. I felt as if I were on the battlefield along side of the soldiers. All of this lead to graphic pictures of a head being blown off by a cannon ball; a second soldier loses his leg the same way. Stab wounds looked amazingly bloody and life like. The dialogue was easy to understand even, though the actors used accents such as French and King's English.

"jsmithso","7","0","2","8 March 2004"," Not the best Gibson film, but a classic still.
","`The Patriot' is a great film with a little bit of everything. The acting is good, especially from Mel Gibson. The special effects are pretty recent, making for a great battle scene or two. It's historically accurate, so it's even educational to a certain degree, and it's very authentic feeling. It's not Gibson's best film, and there's a boring moment or two, but overall this is a great film that I highly recommend.<br/><br/>The most noticeable thing about this film is the authentic feel it gives off from start to finish. The costumes and buildings and sailboats and war tactics and everything else are very impressive, and really do the job of transporting you to the Revolutionary War. The film was shot on location in South Carolina, and there are some really beautiful scenery shots. I hear the costumes were all copies from authentic ones lent from the Smithsonian, and they certainly seem like it. They acting isn't always of the best quality, but it does make you feel like you're really seeing the past through this film.<br/><br/>This is basically a war film, but the war was very well chosen. The reason for war films is to make you realize how terrible war is so that you will be educated enough to avoid them should that power ever come to you. It has to do with the old saying `If we forget history, we are doomed to repeat it.' The problem with most war films is that they are not very entertaining, since really they should not be. `The Patriot' does function as a War film, especially since it puts an emphasis on how negatively it affects family, but it also seems to function as your basic tearjerker as well, and it does pretty well in both departments.<br/><br/>There are four scenes that really go for the tears in this film, and I think I have cried during all four at one time or another. One especially involving the main character's daughter gets me every time. There is a bit of good humor now and then, but mostly there's just an overwhelming sense of dread the whole film that builds up to these horribly emotional scenes. It's very enjoyable, if you like that kind of thing.<br/><br/>
Jason Isaacs plays the bad guy in this film, and he does a terrific job of it. He is ruthless and terrible and you hate him so much that it really makes the movie important for you. His performance is very noticeable, along with Gibson's, though Heath Ledger's may have been over-rated.<br/><br/>The battles are great, utilizing the best combination of extras and CGI to be seen for a while. They do get moderately bloody, but that's to be expected in a war film, and there isn't any language or sex at all. Though there are too few battles for this to be called an action movie, but when it does come it comes in spades. The only real problem with this movie is that it is a bit on the long side, and tends to drag in one or two areas. These spots aren't horrible, though, and don't take away from the rest of the film. If you aren't into the whole emotional aspects of movies, it's still good as long as you don't mind a few additional boring scenes. I would defiantly recommend this movie to you, whatever you expect in movies, as long as it isn't comedy."

","'The Patriot' is a good film by the norms of Hollywood, belonging to the genre of the historic epic drama. On the positive side it is well done, well acted, with quite a complex action line. On the bad side all is very expected,  many of the 'memorable' lines as well as the characters behavior belong more to low grade history books rather than to an artistic film.  It looks like cinema art did not develop after 'Gone with the Wind'. The film is also very one-sided in its historical approach, pro-American and anti-Brit. Being quite well done, no wonder that American viewers are moved and resonate positively, while British viewers may find it ultrageous  - see some of the IMDB comments. Mel Gibson is on some kind of programatic path with his creation lately, and I like less and less what he is doing. He seems to forget that art is more valuable and durable when political or religious propaganda are played lower key. <br/><br/>Over all I watched the film with a mix of cinema enjoyment, and lack of comfort because of the too obvious historical and political message. Too much message, too little emotion. Curiously enough, 'The Patriot'  reminded me some of the films I saw in my younger days, in Communist Romania, where the propaganda machine was enrolling the cinema industry into making films in service of the official ideology. Worth seeing, but controversial for me - 7 out of 10 on my personal scale."

","How does war ever solve any problems, this film wants us to consider, because hideous though the business may be for those in the fighting, it is infinitely more ugly and tragic for those merely living where the fighting takes place.  What glittering abstraction could possibly be worth all that suffering and destruction?  Democracy?  Even ""then"" the film is not so sure, as it has Mel Gibson's character asking his peers why he should trust less the authority of one tyrant three-thousand miles away than three-thousand of them one mile away.  Indeed, the tyranny of the lowest common denominator, which is what democracy has become in America, is every bit as onerous to individual efforts to rise above it than the rule of any king.  Perhaps even ""more"" so, because where one can always hope for a better king, only the most conspicuously mediocre ever rise to the top under democracy.<br/><br/>Of course, that is probably to read more into the films message than the writers of the film had in mind, but nevertheless it sets the stage for considering such questions.  War not only brings out the worst in the best sort of minds, but also allows the worst sort to realize their darkest desires.  That much is clearly the point of this story.  What might have been ""gained"" as a result of all the horrors endured in the winning is assumed to be self-evident, but whether it was or was not remains a question of considerable interest.  So although that additional concern may not have been meant as pivotally significant, it underlies an important part of the story, deserving of more comment than it typically receives."

It's not quite up to the level of either of those films, but that just means it is merely very good. A couple of the film ideas look like direct lifts from Last of the Mohicans, and Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin is only slightly less bent on vengeance than William Wallace, while still greatly desiring to kick British butt. I also thought a couple of the combat sequences were too contrived, like big time wrestling and very formula. Still this film has is moments that make it worth watching, and it is beautifully filmed. If the greens were any greener it would be on another planet. The battle scene sound effects play well on a surround system. The acting is generally solid and the film pacing only threatens to flitter away the emotional involvement a time or two, so from beginning to end a film watcher with just a little tolerance will be engaged."

","As a RevWar ""buff"", I am very grateful this movie was made, no matter what anyone says. It's about time the RevWar got some attention in film (or anywhere else, for that matter). I guess this makes about 4 feature films that have *ever* been made in the history of movies (and I am a movie fan - oldies, not so much today) completely devoted to the fighting itself.  I saw the movie 3 times in 11 days - and I am not at all a contemporary movie fan. (I also saw it later in a 2nd-run joint.)  That's more than I usually visit a theater in a whole year. There are indeed problems w/the film and I could go on and on; but they are mostly details, some of which aren't so important. I'll review by opposing the lambasting critiques it got when it came out.<br/><br/>1st, the historical ""snobs"" (I can't come up w/a better term for it, I got so tired of the nit-picking). Yes, there are many details wrong, or omitted. Wrong flags/too numerous, too many clean pretty-boy tents and uniforms for what should be down-trodden rebels, failing to recognize that indeed there were myriad kinds of ""uniforms"" (including civilian clothes) for the rebels NOT blue-faced-red, red coats on green-coated Loyalist dragoons, no actual mention of any battle that occurs here (don't look at the DVD cover - you'll see they never mention a battle/place name for any of the action in the movie except an occasional printed intro - and at best any of them are amalgams of several battles), not allowing real-life Continental (not militia) officer Daniel Morgan credit for ""shoot twice, then scoot"", slaves vs freemen on Gibson's farm (still don't know the truth there), using giant siege pieces on battlefield, British marching like baton&drum parade corps, etc, etc, etc.  But the basics really aren't too bad, considering it is a fictional account. At least they had fewer of those powdered wigs than really existed, and the action was somewhat realistic. And they showed that slaves could earn their freedom (not to mention the freemen who fought). And like it or not, Tarleton (Tavington) <i>was</i> really hated and feared, church-burning or not. The feel of the movie is less fake than any RevWar or such-period movie I've seen.  Of course, there haven't been many, but still, it felt very real, despite all I can criticize.<br/><br/>2nd, the political snobs. I won't even get into this; let's just say self-flagellating Americans hate this movie because it represents the birth of a nation they seem to despise, and they despise most the people who gave it birth. They hate that it seems so clear-cut that ""Americans"" (rebels) could be the ""good guys"". The British can be mad if they want, but oh well, what is to be expected?  Why do Americans have to make nice-nice w/their own stories involving enemies?  Every other nationality gets a pass, don't they? As a fictional John Adams said ""this is a revolution, dammit; we have to offend <i>some</i>body!"" Of course, everyone ignores the fact that no one in this movie is shown to be a monster <i>except</i> Tavington; Cornwallis and the colonel and other of the British officers are shown for what they were: basically civilized gentlemen in a bad situation. They are reasonably sympathetic characters.  I also liked that this was set in the southern colonies, rather than the stereotypical New England (which had hardly any major fighting other than starting it).  Now, there's some new and interesting realism!<br/><br/>3rd, the violence snobs. As if desperate to keep people from seeing the film, cries went out about how ""violent"" this movie is.  Nonsense.  This is 1 of the tamest movies which naturally involves violence in ages.  There is no glorying in gore, no zeroing in on some disgusting detail and holding there for 10 seconds+.  The most gruesome for me frankly, was Mel going to town on the poor British guy - yet even that was more old-style movie, merely showing blood spattering on Mel rather than even once showing the hapless victim at all.  As for the much-bemoaned head-lopping, that is fleeting, as is the identical leg-lopping from another skipping cannon ball. They are shown for 1 second, hardly counting as gory, but enough to impact you on how bad this was. On this last part, I find it interesting how this movie was panned for being ""too violent"", yet ""Saving Private Ryan"" wasn't. Well, guess who wrote it?  Yup, same guy. Yet Rodat's ""SPR"" was <i>much</i> more gruesome than his ""Patriot"".  There was deliberate focus on the horror of wounds. (Ever forget that guts-spilling episode w/blood coming out all over the guy's torso and out his mouth as t he others tried to help him after an ambush? We had to watch his wounds for upwards of 3 minutes. It was horrible.) Yet that Spielberg WWII movie was hailed as ""merely showing the true horror of war; it's good for everyone"", whereas apparently a RevWar movie w/minimal gore is not allowed to do that.<br/><br/>Outside these facets, I'd also mention outside the violence (minimal, of course, considering) that there is absolutely nothing patently offensive about the movie, a miracle in this day and age. There is no sex or any such situations, not even foul mouths. Amazing. It's OK to watch it on a date; no embarrassing and humiliating situations!  And no fear about children walking in on it - only the stressful situations and fleeting violence make it unsuitable for younger kids to watch the whole thing. I can wish for a better, more accurate, more comprehensive movie on my favorite war, but this was a keeper. It did very well by me. I was so afraid I'd be cringing, but I wasn't. In fact, it's a great emotional story, too.  When I can cry about the death of a character only 20 minutes into the film, that's pretty good. A very good movie, 1 of my all-times."

","If the viewer expects ""Braveheart"" relocated to Colonial America, think again. This is not directed by Mel Gibson, but is brought to you by the duo of Emmerich and Devlin whose earlier work includes ""Godzilla"" and ""Independence Day"". And in ""The Patriot"" they show a similar disregard for American history as they did for logic and the laws of physics in their science fiction films. Surprisingly it was written by the screenwriter who wrote ""Saving Private Ryan"". But now he slathers mounds of Political Correctness on already inane dialogue. And the rest of the story is pure clichÃ©, from the utterly contemptible British villains to the perfection of the (slave owning) Americans. They should have let Gibson write and direct it. As it is, it's pretty mediocre stuff. Unfortunately, historical dramas set during the Revolutionary Period are few and far between.

There are similarities in the ""weak vs formidable"" struggle, where the weak has emotion and passion, and the formidable enemy is as coldhearted as it can be. The 'ghost' fight scene is extremely good. Gibson's raw emotion is always a treat to watch. (Minor spoiler)Throughout the movie, Gibson looses two sons.

","The Patriot is full of American History.  This is one of my favorite movies, and it is wrong to say Mel Gibson was disgracing the American citizen. The character Benjamin Martin never actually lived, however, he is a combination of several real life American Revolutionary heros.  These include General Francis Marion 'The Swamp Fox', and two other gentlemen, whose names I presently cannot remember.<br/><br/>""Tinkering with the notions of democratic self-determinism and collective deliberation is something else, especially when replaced by personal, uncontrolled vigilantism.""<br/><br/>Obviously sir, you are not a student of history, so do NOT attempt to explain to people what you don't know in the first place!  Just because you an articulate MIT alumni does not mean you know anything about history.<br/><br/>""It was fine in Braveheart to just make things up -- that was a mythical time and a relatively magical place.""<br/><br/>I hope you are trying to be satirical, because you can't possibly be serious when saying something like this.  From what I can gather, you find Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace to be some stroybook fantasy made up by the writers and producers of Braveheart.  Again, do NOT comment on what you do not know.  William Wallace is one of Scotland's greatest heros. He lead a rag-tag Army against the might and power of the English War Juggernaut.  Although the Battles of Stirling and Edinburgh were true, Mel Gibson's portrayal of them were in fact fictitious, but William Wallace was most certainly real.<br/><br/>I would like to end by saying that The Patriot is one of the best movies ever made, and the only major differences between real history and hollywood was that (1) Col. Tarelton (not Tavington as it was in the movie) was far more crueler than the movie portrays him as.  (2) In the Battle of Camden, the British had deployed Heavy Artillery which was firing on the Colonials, actually Heavy Artillery is immobile and cannot be moved into the field. (3) Just the fact that Bejamin Martin never lived, but the character was based on three real-life men."

","This is the film-maker of ""Independence Day"", Roland Emmerich who made this historic adventures movie which the action takes place in the eighteenth century during the Independence War of the United States. Emmerich manages rather well from this epic movie. Anyway, the result is better than the conceited ""Independence Day"". This is a movie rather well made and careful, especially at the level of the (bloody) sequences fight.<br/><br/>There's also an honorable performance that owes a lot to Mel Gibson, brave and lucid when it's necessary. Heath Ledger, eager to join the army so as to defend his country against the English soldiers. On the other hand, Tchéky Karyo isn't equal to his role. I'm under the impression that he was hired only to make the spectator remember that the USA gained their independence with a little help from the French. Otherwise, he isn't really equal to the performance and he's there just to be decorative.<br/><br/>It's also obvious that the screenplay was inspired of several movies. You think about ""the Last of the Mohicans"" when Gibson sets an ambush in order to set his elder son free. But also ""Robin Hodd"", and above all ""Braveheart"". However, the screenplay doesn't succeed in hiding a certain manicheism: sadistic English soldiers face Americans settlers filled with good feelings. You can also notice a shy but pointless presence of humor. At last, you find in this movie, some beloved subjects to American movies: strained relationships between a father and his sons but an unexpected event will bring them closer (here, it's war). But also, the difficult choice to join the army, the question of the honor and revenge.<br/><br/>This movie only relates a minor episode of the Independence War. In spite of its weaknesses and its slight lack of inspiration, this is an epic movie, sometimes violent but never boring."

You are free to choose any one or all three over which to take offense.  Viewers who enjoyed this film are likely to know what I am talking about. I did not watch this movie hoping for a history lesson. I watched because it promised two things: a patriot and Mel Gibson. It delivered well on both. It did not glorify war but it did glorify those who did their duty and fought in war, as is only fair.

","Don't believe anyone who says this isn't a good movie.  You must see it for yourself.  I may sound like I'm going off on a tangent, but hear my story:<br/><br/>I can remember that when this movie was in the theaters, I kind of wanted to see it, but then changed my mind.  My best friend invited me over her house to watch a movie and my choices were Gladiator and The Patriot.  I told her I had no desire to see the Patriot so we watched Gladiator(very good movie). Afterwards she kept telling me to watch the Patriot because it was so good and there was this really hot actor Heath Ledger in it(who I didn't know at the time).  I'm so glad I finally saw it.  I cried the first time(but I'm not going to tell you what part of the movie) and i guarantee; if you tend to cry in movies, you'll definitely cry for this one.  But don't worry, when you consider that this IS A WAR MOVIE, it's not too sad.  And as someone has said in a previous comment, it is a VERY GORY movie.  It's definitely more gory than Gladiator.  But that just adds to the realism.  But why would you expect anything less from such a movie?  this is how war really is. I give this movie a ~9/10~<br/><br/>Flaws in the movie: I liked this movie so much I saw it several times in a short period.  I found a few unlikely things.  Here's the big one to me:  Benjamin Martin is a SOUTHERNER living in SOUTH CAROLINA in the 1770s.  What do you think the odds are that he would have free black people working on his farm?  Think about it.  It would be understandable if he lived in a northern state, or even Maryland, but not South Carolina.  That state wanted to leave the union in the 1800s because they wanted slavery.  Another one which kind of goes hand in hand is that Gabriel talks about a free world after the war where blacks and whites are equal.  well, it's 2003 and unfortunately there still isn't equilibrium.  So what are the odds a southerner would dream of this in 1776?  Even many northerners didn't believe that.  they wanted African Americans free, but not equal.  There are some other things which are unlikely but they are also spoilers and i hate telling spoilers.<br/><br/>So all in all a great movie which everyone may see **sensitive moviegoers, don't forget your tissues and barf bag**"

"lorelei1-1","10","0","3","2 January 2003"," It's not a documentary, folks
","Mel Gibson laid himself on the line emotionally in this film, as the father caught between his need to nurture and protect his family and the deep well of savagery he has subjugated years before. This is brought to a test by the pressure of the Revolution finally appearing literally at his doorstep. I think he is wonderful in this film. Acting kudoes should also have gone to Heath Ledger, Tom Wilkinson and Jason Isaacs, as well as numerous other character actors in the film. People have quibbled about the historical accuracy, but this was made as a fictional story about a family during the American Revolution, not a documentary. In little details they were scrupulous as to accuracy. Mel's fictional character was BASED ON a composite of three separate people in real life, including Frances Marion, ""The Swamp Fox"". The battle at the end was BASED ON a composite of two different battles, one of them being Cowpens. I didn't expect to care much for this movie, ordinarily being more interested in the Civil War than the Revolutionary War, but found this story very compelling. In my humble opinion movies made today have to have unbelievable action in them to satisfy 95% of the movie-going public and they usually require a great leap of faith somewhere in the film during an action scene, sometimes more than once. (""Well, that was impossible in real life, but we'll just ignore that and move on""). I've heard and read complaints about scenes in this film that were sort of unbelievable, too, but I think that this film was no different in that respect from many others I've seen that are considered wonderful movies. Evidently because it's placed in an historical context they consider this a major flaw but again I feel they are expecting a documentary and not a movie. I went back to see this movie 3 or 4 times and dragged different friends and family every time who all went out afterwards raving about what a great movie it was. I got the DVD for Christmas. I have minor complaints, like some anachronistic phrases sprinkled throughout during humorous scenes. But these are so minor. I still think it's a fantastic movie."

If your sick of movies that rely on lame/cliche'd character development, mushy dialogue, and sub-par stories coupled with amazing set design, special effects, music, and all that jazz, then by all means avoid this, and any other film that Emmerich has ever directed.

Little skirmishes of a band of rebels stopping the british while they mosey down the road while riding and guarding a carriage filled with the king's goods.  Even the hatchet moves that Gibson uses.. all right out of the first battle in Mohicans.. right down to the ""throwing the axe in the victim's back while he runs away from you"" scene.  This  coupled with the usual montage scenes that Hollywood often uses, gives you that been there done that feeling.  Let's try something new, OK?<br/><br/>I wanna see battle scenes that last 15 minutes at a time.  I want the ship scene in the end to be the entire climax of it.. to go on in the background while Mel Gibsin cuts the heck out of the badguy redcoat.  I wanna see not just one of his sons, but the little girl and the maid-servants get killed also.  Shove him down a really deep, dark hole that he'll never get out of emotionaly.  Show us the WAR!! Don't show us Hollywood fluff!  When Mel uses the hatchet on the redcoat while he's rescuing his son, and hacks away at him over and over again.. I wanna see the guys face when he does it.. and the Conanesque blood splirts on the camera lense.  Make it raw, like your there.  Get rid of the usual colonial speaches.  We can see all of that stuff at Colonial Williamsburg and tours in DC.  Let's just get right down to the chase.. and give us our money's worth!  War films should be war films.. not dramas highlighted by battles.<br/><br/>I don't want the redcoats to be the usual stereotyped, civilized Brits.  I want to see the rebelious redcoat have the shakes.. like Michael Beihn in ""The Abyss""  I want him to grip his pistol.. to see his arm shuddering and the sweat dripping off his forehead when he shoots Mel's son in the back.

Mel Gibson's character is abruptly brought into the war.  The events that force him into the war are compelling.  The viewers get to explore the emotional and psychological nature of Mel Gibson's Character. 3.  The guerilla war.  This is very interesting because the movie takes the viewer from the very beginning of a guerilla band through the end of the war. 4.  Tom Wilkinson.  He is a joy to watch.

This movie is trying to portray the as the bad guys to the endth degree.  This is not WWII and there aren't any Nazi,SS, or SA troops in the Revolutionary war!  The British were actually fairly humane and reasonable throughout  the war, for the most part. 2.  The battle of Cowpens.

","The Patriot is a well balanced movie that has good amounts of drama and action. It is about a war veteran in the 1700s famous for leading an attack on the English. He regrets his actions because he sadistically cut the english soldiers to pieces. Now with the American Revolution on the rise, the veteran's life is starting to crumble as his sons are enlisting to fight and no matter how hard he tries he cannot stop them. To protect his sons' lives, he has to enlist himself and fight against the English again.<br/><br/>The movie is 3 hours long, and it uses these 3 hours effectively to build the characters' personalities. Mel Gibson gives a terrific performance as the moody, humorless ex-killer who is always reluctant to fight, but will fight well when the need arises. Heath Ledger is the patriotic son who has his father's fighting blood in him. Jason Isaacs is the English dragoon leader, and his voice and appearance is suitable for the devoted, power hungry antigonist. They are the main characters, and the movie spends a good deal of time showing you their personalities and how the war affects them. The battles have fantastic cinematography, and they portray the way armies fought in the most realistic, gruesome truth.<br/><br/>Another thing i liked about The Patriot is how masterfully done it is. If you like the movie like I did, i strongly recommend getting the DVD and listening to the audio commentary. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin provide very interesting facts on all the scenes, and as you listen you'll learn to appereciate the camera angles and various scenes which you might dismiss easily. My particular favorite was (SPOILER) how heath leadger takes out his knife after shooting Isaacs, and Emmerich says that Leadger is starting to follow in his father's footsteps as he is going to stab at Isaacs's body just like Gibson hacked the British soldier with his axe, and BOOM! Isaacs gets up stabs Ledger(END OF SPOILER).<br/><br/>So anyway, grab the dvd if you like the movie. I can assure you that it will be worth every cent. After listening to the commentary, I like this movie a lot more.<br/><br/>So overall, The Patriot combines great acting, great cast, a good story, and excellent movie making techniques to make it one of my top 10 favorite movies. The Patriot isn't your ordinary 'hero kills all the bad guys and he lives happily ever after'. It has lots of anti-cliches that makes it different. So there."
"pzylik","9","0","2","9 August 2002"," Well worth watching
","While I understand that this movie is not a 100% accurate historical portrayal of the American Revolution, it is educational and touching nonetheless.  I enjoyed everything about the movie - the acting was outstanding, as were the costumes and plot.  There was terrific suspense, drama, laughs, action, and one total tear-jerker of a scene where Benjamin Martin's youngest daughter finally breaks her years of silence and cries out for him as he rides away back to the war.  I just start bawling every time I see that.<br/><br/>The violence and gore was very graphic, but I'm confident that the real battle was even gorier than that which was on the screen.  While some may find it too much, I think it does us viewers good to be reminded of the gruesome cost of war, in lives lost and in horrible injuries.<br/><br/>This movie was emotionally demanding, and yet inspirational.  I rated it 9 out of 10, and give it a high recommendation to see."
"floridawar","Null","0","1","30 July 2002"," Not history, but still a just a movie.
","Okay, the Patriot is not a great historical document, and it sits better to watch it realizing that it is just a movie and not a history lesson.  This movie's main critics seem to concentrate on its historical inaccuracies, which are indeed plentiful.  When it comes down to it this is indeed just another Mel Gibson vehicle, but like all of his action flicks there are some meanings embedded into the story as simple as they may be.  Like Braveheart this one tackles rebellion from an oppressive power. In both Gibson is of course cast as the hero, but it is notable that both portray historical rebellions, albeit in an historically inaccurate light.  Contrast this fact with the thousands of action flicks with the same righteous rebellion theme which mindlessly occur in the future, or in a galaxy, far, far away.  At least Mel & Co. have the guts to stand up and admit that people HAVE fought for real causes, even if those causes are unclear from this flick. Another criticism of this movie concerns its soft touch on the slavery issue. Thematically this is explained by the statement of the son while repairing a torn US flag.  The country they are fighting for, all of them be they black or white, will grow from the ashes of the old world (an obvious reference to slavery, the principal US inheritance from its British roots) This process was not instant, and the movie does not suggest it was. It merely foreshadows the advances made to the present.  As far as the evil British go, it is a shame the movie chose a cookie cutter snarling ""Tavington"" bad guy.  Indeed, the real ""Tavington,"" Bannaster Tarleton, was a reckless and murderous daredevil who executed prisoners left and right, and it would have been better to see his alter ego here commit such acts with the suave air of the gentleman the real Tarleton bore.  Propaganda? Sure! but in the end just a movie, and not half bad at that. Many, even here in the US, complained of Mel's character arming his sons for battle.  Children have always engaged in war, and our revolution was no exception, take our former president Andrew Jackson, who lived the truth represented here.  As a boy he engaged in the guerrilla war in the Carolinas against Cornwallis etc. and he wasn't the only one.  What the movie lads are shooting down aren't people (real soldiers wouldn't behave under fire as they did) they are figurative representatives of imperialism, monarchy, oppression etc."

","The Patriot is the story of Colonel Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a man driven by vengeance to fight in the American Revolutionary War.  Plagued by a barbarous act he committed during the French and Indian War, the once stout patriot Martin wishes to remain neutral, in spite of the fact that it betrays his convictions.  When one of his sons, Thomas (Gregory Smith), is murdered in cold blood by British Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), Martin enters the fray, thirsty for Tavington's blood.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson delivers the high quality performance audiences have come to expect from him.  Rage, sorrow, happiness  all are evident at some point in facial expressions, voice and body language.  Gibson remains one of the many talented performers who have yet to receive an Academy Award for Best Actor.  Jason Isaacs is delightfully detestable as Tavington. Merciless and a cool lover of carnage, Isaacs is perfect.  Heath Ledger, playing Martin's eldest son, Gabriel, brings a youthful sensitivity and naivete to the film.  It is fortunate that Gibson (who handpicked Ledger for the role) saw Ledger's potential for powerful emotion.  His previous films, most notably the teenybopper movie Ten Things I Hate About You, lacked the substance to give him the chance to display these talents.<br/><br/>It was a pleasant surprise that Ronald Emmerich, the director who brought us such atrocities as Independence Day and 1998's Godzilla, managed to pull together such an entertaining and moving story.  One must assume that Emmerich, who wrote both ID4 and Godzilla is a better director than writer. In The Patriot, Emmerich's skills as a director are evident, never failing to keep the film visually stimulating.  The battle scenes are exciting but not confusing.  Telephoto lenses are used effectively in these sequences when a wide-angle lens would cause the main point of action to blend in. The talented Robert Rodat of Saving Private Ryan fame penned the screenplay. In The Patriot he seamlessly weaves tragedy, action and a degree of comedy that build a well-rounded story.<br/><br/>In addition to excellent direction, story and acting, The Patriot also marks yet another triumph for composer John Williams.  For example, when the film opens on the Martin family's farm, the music is nothing short of inspiring, as if everything is right in the world; but when Thomas dies, a symphony of violins seem to weep, and a church bell sounding in the distance serves as a death toll.<br/><br/>Benjamin Martin only agreed to fight when his noninvolvement cost him the life of his son.  He wanted to love his family, be a good father and live a peaceful life.  He felt he had served his country and he did not want to reopen the painful scars left behind.  Ultimately, the message declared in The Patriot is that you have to defend your beliefs, because as Martin himself says, `the price is more than I can bear.'<br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars"

In the movie we see a man who fights for his family and country against the evil British empire. In today's world life is held in little esteem and the God that our nation was founded upon has been thrown out of our schools, our courts, our homes and even our churches. Men were willing to fight for family and freedom because of their belief in something more important than themselves. We have forgotten that. This movie gives me hope that we can remember that again, that there is a cause bigger than the individual, that there is something more important than ourselves. God, family and country...in that order.  Mel Gibson also seems to have that sense of priority, and I saw his sense of family and loyalty to God shining through on the screen. He may be a good actor, but that is not something you can fake. I pray that every man, and woman, would come away from this movie realizing that same sense of priority and that we would prepare ourselves for the fight that is going on in our backyards right now.

","Mel Gibson, Chris Cooper, and Tom Wilkinson are great actors, but too many clichés and a heavy sentimentality keep The Patriot from being a good movie.<br/><br/>Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a plantation owner and hero of the French-Indian War, is pulled into the War of Independence when the British, led by the goon Col. Tavington, threaten his family, kill one of his sons, and burn down his home.  Col. Tavington is a villain more fit for a Batman movie than a historical drama.  He spends most of his time killing civilians and gives speeches before his fights, sort of like the folks on WWF.<br/><br/>The movie is too long, and one of the movie's sub-plots, a romance between Martin's son Gabriel and a local girl, made me cringe.  Especially unbelievable was a wedding scene in a village of ex-slaves that felt like a remake of the Ewok's victory party at the end of Return of the Jedi.<br/><br/>Director Roland Emmerlich has no problem delivering a movie with great special effects and realistic battle scenes.  Too bad he can't keep his movies from being corny."
"mistman42","4","0","1","30 June 2000"," Braveheart, this isn't!
","During the month of June, 2000, Mel Gibson has had the good fortune to be the lead actor (or lead male voice-over) in two movies which opened in the same week: The Patriot and Chicken Run. If anyone, regardless of their age, were to ask me which one they should see, I would answer Chicken Run in a heartbeat, despite the fact that The Patriot is twice the length. It was just that bad a movie. There are a few positive aspects of The Patriot, including startlingly good acting by almost every cast member, as well as some very impressive cinematography. Unfortunately, the bad far outweighs the good in this case, as even the hard work of Mel Gibson and Tcheky Karyo, one of Europe's most beloved actors, could not overcome a severely poorly written script and remarkably bad direction. The problem with the screenplay is that it lacked everything Braveheart had: believability, emotion, and raw power. The Patriot was a huge, jumbled cliche from beginning to end. The ""bad guy"" was far too sinister to evoke any kind of emotion other than apathy. The combat scenes were reminiscent in their scale of Saving Private Ryan, only The Patriot did not offer the same level of startling realism, so the excessive violence was more nauseating or comical than powerful. Each advancement of the plot was crafted to either make you shed tears of sorrow or tears of joy, except that an hour into the film, one wonders when the ride is finally going to end. Thus, comparing this movie to Braveheart seals this movie's fate forever. Where Braveheart is visually stunning, The Patriot only tries to be. Where Braveheart is an emotion-evoking masterpiece, The Patriot is a hackneyed, two-bit story. Where Braveheart is unforgettable for its dramatic and inspiration character, The Patriot is unforgettable for its remarkable example of how to write and direct the perfect cliche. I gave this movie a 4."

Finally, a movie with more patriotism and flag-waving than Independance Day (or ID4 to those with short attention spans), I didn't think that was possible. <br/><br/>This is Mel Gibson's American stop on his 'Free the Planet From the English' tour. Let's see, we have Scotland, America... now if only he could free us Canadians from the tyranical rule of the monarchy! Now that's a movie! Him and Bob and Doug McKenzie, drinking beer and fighting the English! He's an Aussie, you know?<br/><br/>Okay, I'll try to control myself. Mel plays a cheeky fellow who gets mad and goes on a killing spree (what, again? how many killing sprees can this guy go on?). That's what we want to see, and that's what we get, so in that sense the movie works. Sure, the fight scenes aren't as entertaining as Braveheart or as thrilling as Last of the Mohicans, the battles aren't as well choreographed as they could be, but it's fun non the less. I know it's the period, but there is something very dull about a bunch of soldiers standing in a row waiting for bullets to hit them (some of them just looked sleepy, ""Oh, is it my turn to fall down now?""). Almost hard to believe wars were ever fought like that. <br/><br/>Col. Tavington (Isaacs) is a lot of fun as the villian, and I hope to see more of him (I only remember him from Event Horizon and a bit part in Armegeddon). He's a nasty little poofter, yes he is. Mel hates him because he slowly roasts and eats Mel's children before his very eyes (no, he didn't do that. He's evil, just not Mike Tyson evil). Mel gets revenge though when he beats him to death with an American flag (again, not quite, but almost). The rest of the performances were all cardboard. When there wasn't a battle going on I didn't care much for what was happening on screen. Sorry, it just didn't stir my emotions, move me, or do much of anything to engage me, not matter how hard it tried.<br/><br/>This was written by Robert Rodat of Saving Private Ryan fame? I guess Ryan was one of those rare cases where having a dozen ghost writers actually worked, because this has none of the emotional impact of Ryan.<br/><br/>I know, I'm making it sound much worse than it is.

"bigbadbrian","Null","0","1","16 April 2002"," imbellished but otherwise a great film
","The Patriot is one of the best war movies ever made. The entire cast knew exactly what they were doing when they filmed this masterpeice of a film. It has all that people go to this genre for. The Patriot has just about everything, such as realistic combat scenes from that time period and charecters who reflect exactly the way people thought at the time. The way they captured the friction between patriots and loyalists was great and it was the only thing they could have done more with, however what they did depict was almost enough. As I said above, the battle sequence were some of the best I have ever seen filmed, next to Saving Private Ryan.(also a good movie)<br/><br/>Now thought there were many imbellishments in the main context of the film itself, one common complaint I heard about The Patriot was about it's over the top villain, Colenol William Tavington. What very few people know is that the charecter, Tavington was loosely based on a real person named Tartelton, who would order the shooting of anyone from Colonial Officers, surrendering troops, and even innocent civillians. Although, he never actually to my knolledge burned churches. The same goes for Mel Gibson's charecter, Ben Martin. Ben Martin was based on Mariam Fox who lead militia forces against the British to the point where they actually did give him a nickname (Swamp Fox) and put a price on his head. So though they used different names for both charecters and imbellished their deeds a bit, these were still real people.<br/><br/>In retrospect, is The Patriot the best war movie ever made? No, not by far. There are some scenes in there that will make you think you're watching a soap opera. Besides which the film makers could have done a much better job of portraying slavery in a more realistic sense, and not as sugar coated. However put all the flaws in this movie aside and you'll see what a good film overall that it really is. Here's some sound advice: Wait for the fourth of July and after you're done watching the fireworks and having a BBQ, sit down and watch The Patriot. It is a movie that boldly asks: What would you sacrifice to be free."

","Before the end of Braveheart, my ass started to ache against the cheap hard theater seat. I was much less comfortable watching Patriot (at a drive-in), but I noticed it less. I would not have noticed my sore butt, the crick in my neck, etc. etc. even if Patriot was six hours long. That's a great film. Great on all counts. It's four stars. I would go out of my way to buy this film. Braveheart? I'd go out of my way to watch it...not really to buy it.<br/><br/>Why is Patriot better? Front-to-back, it is dedicated to dealing with primal human concepts that existed long before we were here, and will endure long after we are gone. After you've seen it a few times, you begin to realize this is not a story so much about American independence, as about a tug-of-war between life and death. The story about the Revolution is a sidebar. Want proof? Watch it beginning to end - at no time does any stretch of fifteen minutes pass, without the advantage shifting from one side to another. Life wins, death wins, back-and-forth, beginning-to-end. This is great storytelling.<br/><br/>I think the criticism for playing fast-and-loose with history is valid, but not valid enough to tarnish the reputation of the product. Taking license with history is dangerous, after all, only to those of us who don't bother to read up. Failing to read up is decisional. You don't like how Mel Gibson invents people, covers up things, makes slaveholders look like heroes and decent people look like ogres? Fine. Go read about how it really was, and take his movies with a grain of salt. Everyone else isn't doing that, but if they're being mislead by Gibson's efforts, the deception pales in comparison to what HBO does to them every night. Cut him some slack. There's nothing in Patriot that compares to having an English princess knocked up by a Scottish bandit who really never lived in the same country as she did at any given time, and died when she was thirteen years old.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is you can watch it three, five, ten times or more and still see more detail you didn't notice before - detail meaningful to the story.

","The Patriot (2000): Director Roland Emmerich's surprisingly entertaining work stars Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin (loosely based on war hero Francis Marion), an American farmer abstaining from the Revolutionary War after previously fighting in the French and Indian Conflict. But when one of his children is murdered by British Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), he changes his mind at the flip of a switch and takes up arms alongside his eldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger). It sounds schmaltzy, but the plot plays well and, despite the lengthy running time (2 hours, 45 minutes), keeps a steady pace that is fueled by Robert Rodat's solid script, which is a nice combination of suspense and humor and is acted out by a strong cast. The one serious defect is the unflattering portrayal of the British, which becomes excessive and unnerving at times. Sure, it's a fictitious work, but the filmmakers really should have known better. 8/10"

","""The Patriot"" is the latest film about the ugliness of war. True, if it hadn't been for this brutal war for independence, there wouldn't be a Here. Had we not risen up against the British, where would we be now? Worse off? Better? Is that so unimaginable? ""I will not fight,"" are Benjamin Martin's words (Mel Gibson) to the South Carolina Colonial legislature. He knows that any war with the British will be fought not in some far away place away from civilians, but in cities, in communities, in people's back yards. He holds that he and his seven children are just fine with the way things are. Or maybe he foresaw a future filled with Jerry Springers, Howard Sterns, Newt Gingriches, and Bill Clintons and decided it just wasn't worth it. If only everyone else had this kind of foresight.<br/><br/>Despite Martin's urgings, war breaks out. Everything he feared soon becomes reality: the war spills over into his home. Imagine walking out into your back yard and watching hundreds of men in opposing lines, hundreds of rifles exploding in unison, cannons firing, blood splattering, heads flying. Freedom has a high price. The same kind of war against the innocent is being waged right now in other countries.<br/><br/>When his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), is exposed as a dissident by the ruthless British General Tavington (Jason Isaacs) and taken away to be hanged, Martin hunts Gabriel's captors down and slaughters them (with the help of two of his surviving sons). Beneath Martin's gentle exterior is a savage warrior capable of laying waste to several men with nothing more than a hatchet. This was a well staged, well cut scene. From here, a vengeful Martin wages a one-man guerrilla war against the British to minimize the body count of his countrymen. Okay, well not quite. This is what is set up, but is not the direction the story takes. Martin's warrior rage never resurfaces. Instead, the story settles into a demonstration of how vengeance and bloodlust have no place in a war. Not that I'm disappointed--it's just that there's a difference between misdirecting the audience (for surprise) and misleading them. To put it more simply, pick a story.<br/><br/>Benjamin Martin is portrayed as a man with an ugliness inside of him that he will do anything to keep in check. War tends to bring out this side of him and so as a result, he fears war. Once this side of him he keeps down, though, this unstoppable ""instrument of warfare"" (to quote another Robert Rodat script, ""Saving Private Ryan""), is established, BECAUSE it's what the character doesn't want, the best thing for the story is for it to resurface. Didn't Mr. Rodat ever watch ""The Incredible Hulk"" on TV? Or how about ""Unforgiven,"" about as close to perfect as a film script gets? Will Munny hates the man he used to be. The more he talks about it, the more we want to see that side of him. We do. Payoff. It's that simple. Writers live by many mottos and one of them is this: Don't introduce it if you're not going to use it.<br/><br/>The story offers up one innocent victim after another in the interest of drama and to create as much emotion as possible. It all feels so manufactured for some reason, like some characters are only introduced so they can be sacrificed. Just when you start getting involved with a character, they get killed. After a while, I gave up trying to like anyone in this movie. The story is an endless cycle of killing and revenge, and isn't much fun, at least not for me. I know there's a point in there somewhere and I think it's this: protecting what you love and fighting for what you believe in are the same thing.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich isn't my favorite director. To his credit, he does does have a shining moment here and there in this one (the cannonball flying right at the camera, for instance...nice). But after films like ""Universal Soldier"" and ""Godzilla,"" I wasn't optimistic. He's not quite in the big leagues yet. Maybe next time.<br/><br/>Why didn't Mel direct this himself? It must have been torture for him to be in front of the camera all the time. During the battle scenes, when Emmerich wasn't setting it up right, Mel must have been ready to go off: ""No, no, no! You're doing it all wrong! Look, man, I know what I'm talking about! Want to see my Best Director Oscar?""<br/><br/>Grade: C-"

","The Patriot is the thrilling story of one man's battle to avenge the murder of his son at the hands of a British officer...his fight against British forces, in battle after battle, drawing closer and closer to the man he wants to fight with the aid of his men and another of his sons.  It is the story of a man's struggle to keep his family alive in a time of war and destruction...war and destruction?  Oh, yeah, that American Revolution thing. The American Revolution takes a back seat in this story, which is a good thing, because quite frankly we know how it ended.  The main plot of The Patriot is Martin vs. Tavington, with the rest of the war running along in the background.  This results in a stunning story of a hero who never wanted to be a hero, whose strength threatens to run out at every turn, but who pushes on through trial after trial, hoping to fulfil his goals.  It is a brilliant story, with masterful acting from the cast and intricate fight sequences that mix tactical combat, huge armies, and single man-to-man fighting as few films can.  That is to say, it's done well. The Patriot is a great film, and one that I would recommend to anyone."

","Undoubtedly, this film brings to life a very interesting period of our history, and as a Brit, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>Two notably ridiculous scenes though need mentioning. First, where Mel Gibson (as Martin) singlehandedly ambushes and kills an entire column of British Redcoats; and second, where Mel Gibson whistles for General Cornwallis's dogs to follow him from the fort. These scenes are Hollywoodisation gone silly.<br/><br/>Other than this, the film is great. Good cast, good score, good pace, & good scenes. Two characters that were under used in my opinion, are Tom Wilkinson as the British General Cornwallis and Peter Woodward as British General O'Hara. But the performances we see from both these men, for me, stand out.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, I felt 100% admiration for the 'American' men who decided to stand upto us colonial Brits, all those years ago. But I also felt a sneeking admiration for the Brits of the time, who as a small nation showed admirable ingenuity & remarkable ambition...even though our methods weren't beyond criticism...the movie made me ponder for a while what America would be like today if things had gone our way....maybe you'd all be drinking cups of tea!!!"
"dung_rat","6","0","1","9 January 2002"," A polished tale...
","Ok, ok, ok...I may be English but unlike many of my myopic friends, I went to see this film twice and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's been around a year since I last saw it, so forgive me if I seem a little rusty.<br/><br/>I've read enough literary sources on the American War of Independence to direct my own film on this topic (*laughs*) but I just couldn't dislike this film. I guess many British viewers perceived it as a follow-up to 'Braveheart' and, therefore, a swipe at them and their history...again. It seems strange though: the British are shown winning enough battles in 'The Patriot' and, if you recall, director Roland Emmerich is German. Now who were Britain's biggest and most trusted allies during the War of Independence...yes, Germany! Let's not forget either, Mel Gibson is Australian!!<br/><br/>'The Patriot' is concerned more with family values than war itself, but that doesn't strictly mean that there is any lack of bloodshed. The battle scenes are gory, don't get me wrong, but satisfyingly action-packed. There is also a worthy degree of authenticity here: the accents seem polished enough, if not a little too polished, the costumes are splendid, and the colonial scenery/architecture is impressive. It also seems unusual and refreshing that the film focuses more upon militia skirmishes rather than full-blown battles.    <br/><br/>Mel Gibson's performance is great too. His character has many facets: caring, romantic, warm, loyal to his family, and almost comical at times. However, this is contrasted by his more brutal, barbaric and blood-thirsty side which we see in battle. Gibson manages to pull each and every one of these facets off in a decent enough manner.<br/><br/>While historically speaking the film isn't totally true to life ( - but then again, what is?) it will keep most watchers entertained. The film is most authentic and true to the war when characters are discussing it. Overall 'The Patriot' is a very enjoyable and touching movie if not a little too 'pro-American' for some viewers, especially us Brits! -'7'-"

"Uncle Dave M","10","0","2","29 December 2001"," Great Movie in a ""historic"" setting
","Rant, rant, rant ... Reading some of the other ""reviewers"" leads me to shake my head. I don't recall anywhere on the movie jacket it saying ""this is a historically factual documentary"". In fact, it is loosely based on ""The Swamp Fox"", Francis Marion, a true historical figure, but you would only know that by reading from the Professional Reviewers.<br/><br/>Granted, the feel is very similar to ""Brave Heart""; Reluctant farmer-type goes to war and wins his country's freedom. However I just watched it again tonight (12/29/01) and I can not help but notice the great measures the crew went to in depicting historical accuracy in the costumes, the sets and the general ""feel"" of the movie. I came away with a real feel for the fear and stupidity of being on a 18th century battlefield which, 100 years later, had not changed much by the Civil War. I don't know anyone who would debate that war is a dirty business.<br/><br/>On that note; I'm sure atrocities occurred on both sides. Who is to say if the British burned a church full of Innocent Civilians. I read several ""reviewers"" ranting about this depiction, but not one mentioned character Benjamin Martin's ""un-gentlemanly"" targeting of British Officers or the killing of the poor Brit's trying to surrender ... as was mentioned in the movie. And for those bringing up the point about slaves; I think we are all well aware of those atrocities, did they NEED to be brought up again in this movie? Slavery was not the topic of ""The Patriot"". I venture to say it was covered very well in a movie that made slavery the topic: ""Glory"".<br/><br/>Viewing the bigger picture; The greatly out-numbered American Rebels used gorilla tactics, citizen solders and woodsman shooting skills to defeat a professional army supplied by a world super-power (at the time). The American Revolutionary War was a David & Goliath in modern times.<br/><br/>Considering the questionable education primary, junior high and high schools are communicating to our young people. I would gladly substitute this film for several weeks of an American History class. I can only imagine (and hope for) the questions and conversations teens and pre-teens might have after viewing this film. Which, hopefully would lead to further reading and research. Personally, growing up with a 1970's high school education and some 1980's collage, I was just barely aware of the French assisting us. I thank the film makers for this reminder.<br/><br/>Beyond the history aspect, there is emotion on many levels, great digital effects, action and romance ... you know; ENTERTAINMENT. Its not full of sex, so you can watch it with your kids (OK, some violence and gore). The pace keeps you interested. But most of all, in this turbulent world, it reminds us that this country did not just ""pop"" in to existence ... That it IS OK to fight for Freedom. Not to mention it received 5 Academy Award nominations ...<br/><br/>So what if every scene was not EXACTLY historically accurate and it did not cover all of the Politically Correct angles. It was FUN! and it got you thinking!"

As a person with several degrees in history, I know there wasn't a British soldier who went around and burned churches full of people, and shot little boys for no reason, but nobody said this actually happened. Anyways, I can understand why some English people would not like some of the events in this movie, but I do not understand why people sit around and critique this movie from a historical standpoint.

"Jay_Mac","Null","0","1","23 October 2001"," Hardly a Braveheart, but a worthy film nonetheless.
","I'm pretty sure of what the makers of this film were trying to achieve here and it falls well short. Their goal of course was to make a bigger, better version of Braveheart.<br/><br/>This film which made one reviewer 'proud to be an American' is about Benjamin Martin, 'legendary' hero of the war of Independence. The movie tells the story of Martin's relationship with his sons, most notably the eldest one Gabrielle, as they fight in the battle to free America from the tyranies of the British Empire. Eventually Benjamin's heroic exploits come to the attention of the ruthless Colonel Tavington (Britain's finest Jason Isaacs) who is the films  antihero.<br/><br/>You can argue all you want about  the Patriot and Braveheart being totally different films but let's face it, there are many obvious similarities. Firstly they both star Mel Gibson playing a patriotic warrior fighting to free his land from the English. In both films Gibson's character is reluctant to go to war until the life of a loved one is taken, and also in both Gibson plays a brilliant but unconventional leader. Having explained my somewhat whiny sounding opinion I will now try to talk about the film on its merits.<br/><br/>There are several great moments, one of the best being when Martin walks into a bar to recruit men for the infantry and yells out 'Long live King George!'. The scene where Martin single handedly takes out a convoy of British soldiers who are about to execute his son is one that will long live in my memory. The direction is nothing you wouldn't expect from the Hollywood epic, but it is the performances of Gibson and Isaacs which make this film a standout.<br/><br/>The battle scenes take turns at being well done and annoyingly overdone. The big battle near the end of the film is very well done, but sadly they couldn't resist the temptation to put in a schmatlzy Hollywood ending where Gibson's character gets the girl.<br/><br/>Overall I must admit that this is a very good movie with more than a reasonable share of blood and guts and enough character development to look past the flag waving and appreciate a great movie. 8 out of 10."

","Well, after coming off Braveheart in 1995 giving pretty good reference to history for Sir William Wallace, can Mel do it again?  No, now I have to say that I do enjoy Most of Gibson's films, and I didn't hate this one at all, but it if it were a term paper handed in to the college profesor for grading, it would be around 79-82%. SPOILER ALERT  First, this movie like most movies had started out great with solid potential.  The first gun battle was impressive.  Then, it had lingering unexplained plots started, numerous cliches, un-funny drgged on comedy not to mention very predictable scenes (black slave fighting for his country after his 12 months are up, hmm who wouldv'e guessed).  What was so funny about the ink in the mouth, that was not funny and that was drug on too long.  Oh, also, cannonballs bouncing on the grass like bowling balls visible to the eye taking off legs like swords was kind of out there.  Plus, the cannons used throghout the war scenes appeared to me that they were just thrown in the scence for realism, when hardly any ever hit targets.  Did anyone else find it funny that the entire contenintal army relied on Mel Gibson leading them. This movie could have used a bigger budget to help portray more of the history of the war and not such a lethal weapon drama ( Villain p***es off Mel Gibson by messing with his family, Mel Gibson gives him his in the end by avenging his son's death with final fight scene with head butts and everything! hmmmmm, sound like any Lethal Weapons you guys know?) Also, what's with him not crying over his first son's death, but we get so teary eyed over his second's son death?  What was with his young daughter not talking and hating him, then wanting him not to go back to war?  What was the movie doing there?  Also, when he was melting those toy soilders for bullets, that fire was pretty weak for melting metal that fast, maybe I was the only one to notice that.

Although, I don't think I'm really giving anything away here in saying that the closing of the film has symbolism of one of the subjects ahead of the nations history is abolishing slavery.  Then there's the other possibly controversial part of perhaps the British being offended.  Well, with that, I really don't care.  I believe that they were probably an evil force then all over the place, trying to ruthlessly rule the world.  So, I find that pretty arrogant.

I certainly wouldn't object to any films showing that.<br/><br/>
Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a farmer living a good life with a seven children.  His wife is diseeced.  His oldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) is full of ambition and wants to join in the war that is springing up.  When they are called to Charlston to vote on the levy of having South Carolina be the seventh state to enter the war for independence and to visit their aunt, Martin's wife's sister.  To everyone's surprise, he greatly apposes the levy.  When the levi is passed twenty-eight to twelve, Gabriel is most pleased and immedialtey gets in line to inlist.  When he faces his father, he states ""I thought you were a man of principal.""  He reponds with ""When you have a family of your own, perhaps you'll understand.""  Then his son finally puts ""When I have a family of my own, I won't hide behind them.""<br/><br/>
Two years later, the family continues their prosperity while Gabriel suffers the conditions of war.  Eventually, battle gets close to home.  Gabriel, who is carying dispathes for Rebels, comes to the house, wounded.  They give care to both the Rebels and the Redcoats.  When an army spread out with the officers to colect their men, Colneil Tavington (Jason Issacs) orders that Gabriel be killed for his treason of being a spy with dispatches.  In an effort to save his brother's life, the second eldest son without any thought of consequence, runs to free his brother from the Redcoats.  Tavington, withut haste, fires his pistol, giving him an exit wound from the back.  He dies within awhile.<br/><br/>
After the British have cleared out, Martin runs into his burning house to get a good number of muskets, some pistols, and his trusty tomahawk from the French and Indian War.  He takes two of his sons to a forrest where he almost surprisingly to us says ""I'll fire first"" as if t weren't expected to put them in their positions.  There are twenty British soldiers they are looking at.  The shooting is very well done and many of them are shot down. As for others, it is the will of the tomahawk.  While his kids watch, he knacks them down.  When they're are four Brits left, a soldier keeps hostage Gabriel with a knife to his throat.  Martin knack one of the last three. The other, he knocks down with a musket and then as he rises he shoots him through the head.  Then there's the very tense moment of taking care of the one on Gabriel.  Martin brings the tomahawk back behind him and swings the tomahawk into his forehead.  The one left is scared to death and runs away. An obsessed Martin throws the tomahawk into his back and when he gets to him, hacks hims to bits like a savage.<br/><br/>
Gabriel insists on joining back with the Continentals.  Martin joins up also and becomes eader of the South Carolina Malitia.  Another commander is a French soldier who lost his family form the Brits in the French and Indian War.  Because of good leadership, the malitia is a great success, hidding and coming out to shoot.  These battle scenes are some of the great direction of modern cinema.<br/><br/>
The script is written by Robert Rodat.  In his earlier years, he wrote the Disney film ""Tall Tale"" and ""Fly Away Home"" whcih I consider possibly the worst film ever made.  His most recent work ""Saving Private Ryan"" is, as we all know, incredible.  This has similarities with the battle sequences. They're both extremely gorey with blood.  This is exactly showing war whether then extravigating it like early war films or not actually showing combat, but just screwing around too much with backrounds that get boring like Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>
John Williams' score is brillaint and patriotic.  Roland E. Emerech does a fascinating job in directing a wonderful American film while being German himself.  The acting is great.  Gibson does a great lead.  I don't think it's a con if this may be considered an exact sequel to ""Braveheart"".  I can see why The British might not adore him.  The cuts of the editing drive this film a lot.  They are superb.<br/><br/>
This is a film that patriotic Americans should cherish.  This has gotten a lot of good hype and bad hype.  It should get good hype from the Americans. It is mostly accurate.  It's a war film done the way a modern war film should be done.  It brings reverence and loyalty to the veteran of the Revolutionary War and the colonists who suffered so musch from the appression of the British that DID take place.  This is a film that certainly should have been more of an oscar contender.  It bears sililarity to a lot of great films like ""Braveheart"", ""Gladiator"", and ""The Last of the Mohicans"" which in a lot os since, preludes this story.  This film is emotional, well put together, and right for a film about thsi war.  A great film that leads it's title ""The Patriot."""

","Sometimes I think that Hollywood critics suffer from the ""too much success"" syndrome.  No one typifies suffering at the hands of this syndrome better than Mel Gibson.  (The syndrome goes something like this: ""Hey, Mel's had a couple of hits in a row; time to bring him back to earth and pan the next one."") You see, Mel had enjoyed three reasonably successful performances in a row - Conspiracy Theory, Lethal Weapon 4, and Payback (plus his delightful voice-over character in Chicken Run.)  So, following the syndrome, the next big movie HAD to be a dud.  Out came ""The Patriot,"" and sure enough - critics generally cut it to pieces. Not me. It's a bit over-long and could have stood up to ten or fifteen minutes worth of trimming.  It was only tagentally historically accurate; but for gosh sakes, this is the movies, not the History Channel. Who cares? Finally, there's the take that Gibson was indulging himself with the character and side-stories about 'what happened at Fort Wilderness.' But to me, it was that 'side-story' that made the whole movie richer and his character more interesting!  The conflict between father and son, made sense thanks to that aspect of Gibson's character.  Without it, we would have had another historical bollix worthy only of running on cable's also-rans.  Gibson and virtually the whole cast gave solid performances; the direction (particularly of the towns and villages) was superb, and set decoration fascinatingly accurate and rich.  No, this is not a five-star movie; but it captures some essence of the time very well, and the plot generally keeps moving at a good speed, bogging only a couple of times, and then briefly.

On the other hand, you have Ute and Roland Emmerich. The same duo that brought you ID4. Great effects. Stupid movie.

You have Cornwallis who seems to be fairly smart but you've got his sidekick Tavington who seems like a bad guy plucked out of a 1940s crime drama. Shallow writing indeed. Case and point: the black soldier who wants his freedom and the lame ass militia man who mocks him with the obligatory ""gee, I came to my senses, it's my honor to fight with you"" epiphany. That should have either been cut out or developed much better. I also have issues with Heath Bar's love interest who seems to only know how to stand and smile like a goober.

How can a movie be made where in one scene they show a young man being sewn up in a bag to spend the night (historically accurate) and the next scene they're sucking face like a couple of horny teens in public (historically very unaccurate). It is possible to make historically accurate movies that are interesting.<br/><br/>
Just listen to Roland's comments on the making of this movie (on DVD) and you'll get a sense for how out of it he is. He knows how to direct major action sequences but is this the guy you want telling the story of how this country was created ? <br/><br/>Lastly, I will say The Patriot has its merits, but ultimately it plays out like a ... like a... another edition of Thunderdome !!!

"rmr311","Null","0","1","29 June 2000"," Great Movie, Not So Great Critics
","I recently saw `The Patriot' the other night and I thought it was a remarkable movie.  True, it was not `Braveheart', but it was an exceptional work done by Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin (ID4, Godzilla).  The only problem I saw in the movie lies within the critics and the people who choose to criticize this movie for all it's worth.<br/><br/>One review I read said that some of the scenes and parts in the story were `unnecessary'. (SPOILER)  They claimed the scene in which Col. Tavington torched the church with people inside should not have been carried out, but merely threatened.  We as people in these times forget that feelings and emotions in times of war, especially in the revolutionary times around 1776 were not and are not as fragile and forgiving as they were back then. Tavington would have probably given up his entire family for victory against the Continental Army.  This man was pure evil and obviously had no remorse in killing anyone who dared to tread in his way; it was only a matter of time before he annihilated an entire community.<br/><br/>(SPOILER) Another scene in which Gabriel (Heath Ledger) met his demise was also controversial to some.  People wonder why he was the one who dies in the end and not Gibson's character, Benjamin Martin.  It would only be natural that youth would conquer and Gabriel would follow in the footsteps of his father Benjamin if he met his end, but this was not the case and here's why:  Warfare in colonial times was not as tactful as it is today. Age, experience, and patience were about the only strengths one had engaging in battle.  Gibson's character had all of that and then some.  His son Gabriel was young, foolish, and naïve.  He carried little experience with him and only acted upon his rage and impulses for revenge as he pursued Tavington that ultimately led to his death.<br/><br/>And yes, of course there are the historians out there who doubt its historical accuracy.  We also forget that this is a movie and not a history lesson.  I don't think the writers of this particular movie had the intentions of making this epic 100% accurate, either.  This movie was about a man who was forced into the Revolutionary War because his family, community, and all that he lived for was being threatened.  It's not supposed to be a `true story', but a story based among truth in that there were people like Benjamin Martin who fought because of the urgency and necessity that called upon them to fight for whatever they believed in because they had to, or they felt they had to.  Some of us forget that movies are for entertainment purposes, and not intended to be mistaken for a history book.<br/><br/>I thought that this movie was great and not given enough credit than what it is due for by some critics and people.  The direction, screenplay, and acting were excellent.  I definitely intend on seeing it at least twice more.  The casting and performances were great, all the way from Mel Gibson, to his youngest daughter in the film.  Mel Gibson is on his way to being part of another great classic epic.  I absolutely loved this movie and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who intends to see this movie with an open mind and not for `historical accuracy' or parts that are `necessary'. Every moment in this movie was necessary."

","This movie is riveting.  I have been a user of the IMDB for several years and this is the first occasion in which I have felt compelled to comment. The subject matter has wide appeal, (either for, or against, it is the American Revolution which influences the world still today - like it or not) the characters are very interesting and the actors portraying the characters are extremely talented.  Mel Gibson, goes without saying, can portray any character he chooses.  Heath Ledger is now a name to be watched, a name not to be forgotten, since he can act as well as any who have gone before him. This story transcends, in my opinion, the debate over historical accuracy versus the filmaker's rights.   Most reasonable people understand a movie is a movie.  Enjoy it, learn what you can, but understand what you see is an interpretation by somebody of what actually transpired.  Of course this may not be what actually happened, that the British in this case were not as evil as portrayed, is clear.  Victory over oppression was the objective, and it was achieved.  I am Canadian, and I salute the Americans for winning their independence and for their victory in the war of 1812, where England had to sue for peace thanks to the effectiveness of American frigates such as 'Old Ironsides', the Constitution, the United States, et al...  Let history decide the path that man will travel, there is no need to claim victory in a conflict that ended nearly 200 years ago.  I abhor ignorant claims that are solely based on ill informed people.  The truth remains, had the war of 1812 continued....England would have been forced to sue for peace, thanks to the blockade of the British Isles.  But I digress, the Patriot is a movie worth seeing, despite any disagreement why, see the movie and enjoy what it has to offer."

","The American War of Independence is a story worthy of telling. A people wrest a nation from the world's greatest military power. Simple people wanting to decide their own destiny. A great story. Then there's the Patriot. This is the story? This is what happened? Sure war is hell. People get killed, sometimes innocent people. Good people do bad things and vice-versa. I think the Nazis had a lock on herding women and children into churches and setting them on fire. Doesn't seem British to me. Happy slaves saying all men are all of a sudden created equal ignores that a hundred years after the Patriot, battlefields would be in vogue again without any evil foreigners. And a hundred years after that there would be finally the civil rights movement. Can't someone tell this story with a little factual content? It would be a great story. The birth of a nation has to be dramatic. Not melodramatic.<br/><br/>Oh and while your at it, why not make a movie about the War of 1812: where we Canadians kicked American butt?"
"brian2dope","Null","0","1","19 May 2001"," Enjoyable
","Explosions, Gunfire, and heads being ripped off by cannon balls and plot of course. The Patriot has everything that a good war film needs and is an excellent war film in my book. The Patriot is such a great film because it boldly asks:  What would you be willing to sacrifice for freedom? Though it is not the absolute best film I have ever seen I still think it deserves more credit than it earned when it came out. The Patriot shows how battles were fought in that time period and how the Brittish were defeated by using the militia forces. In a way it was one of the first times that guerilla warfare was used.<br/><br/>The movie begins shorty after the decloration of independance is signed and the American Revelution begins. The movie just gets better and better after that point. Mel Gibson is excellent in his role as Ben Martin who is based on an actual person who fought the American Revelution known as the Swamp Fox. Not only was Mel Gibson great in this film but also the supporting charecters gave an honest effort too. I was especially impressed with Heath Ledger's performance as Martin's son Gabriel. It was nice to see him in a serious role and I see big things for him in the future. All he really needs to work on is hiding his accent. A few times in the movie, his Australian accent kind of just came out of no where.<br/><br/>One element in The Patriot that many say cheapened the film's quality was Colenol Tavington who serves as the villain. In some ways he did cheapen the film just a little mostly because his actions and life throughout the film were imbellished. But you must understand that he was also based on a real person who was basically like a Brittish version of Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>
One thing that many say cheapened the movie and took away from the power was it's somewhat overwhelming similarity to Brave Heart. That is partly true but it didn't really ruin the movie that badly. This may not have been a problem if they had cast someone other than Mel Gibson in it but Gibson has a curtain presence in these types of films that cannot be matched by any other actor. Some how I don't think that it would have been as good had they cast Russel Crowe instead. I mean don't get me wrong, Crowe is great and all but this role some how seems just right for someone like Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>All in all this movie deserves an 9.89 for realism, but points had to be taken off due to the striking resemblance to Brave Heart. The Patriot will leave you with a feeling of more patriotism then you can imagine ever having. My suggestion is watch it on the 4th of July and then go out in your backyard and hanging an American flag on the side of your house. Then cook some burgers on your grill and watch some fireworks. The Patriot is about men who sacrificed more than they could bear and must be remembered."
"Rubber Soul","Null","0","1","16 May 2001"," Fun, but mediocre, cliched & often unbelievable
","I watched ""The Patriot"" expecting an epic --- something along the lines of ""Braveheart"" or ""Last of the Mohicans"".  I left the theater feeling perplexed.  It was still a fun movie, but it's far from being a ""good"" one. ""Mediocre"" and ""cliched"" are the best words to describe this movie.<br/><br/>There were parts of the film that were simply unbelievable.  You can't take a film seriously if it shows you 1 man and 2 children (8 yrs & under) annihilate over 20 trained British Soldiers.  The movie is ridden with cliches.  Evil bad guys hunting down innocent children.  Children outsmart trained military officers.  The Person You Thought Was Killed But Really Wasn't.  <br/><br/>Too many characters in the film are portrayed as one-dimensional caricatures.  The sadistic villain is about as believable as Dr.Evil from Austin Powers.  Seriously --- he's so evil, it's cartoonish.  He enjoys shooting little boys in the back while repeatedly tounting him ""Stuuupid boy!""  He likes to burn churches, execute innocent slaves, and kill all the women & children in a town.  He takes great pleasure in trash talking his enemies while he's killing them.  <br/><br/>I felt sorry for the African American actor in the movie.  He's a talented actor I've seen in other shows, like ""The Rock"" or ""The X-Files"". Unfortunately, in ""The Patriot"" he's given the thankless role of ""token black guy"".  He's got not much to do, not much to say.  His role felt like it was tacked on in the last minute.  You *literally* could've cut out all his scenes and it WOULD NOT CHANGE THE MOVIE one bit.<br/><br/>Basically, Roger Ebert said it best when he wrote that British officers in the movie come in two flavors: Stupid but Gentlemanly, or downright sadistic.  Americans also come in two flavors: Brave, and Braver.  That's how much depth this film has.<br/><br/>I rate this 2.5 out of 10.  It probably deserves 5.0 as a fun movie, but only 2.5 as an epic 2 1/2 hour movie."

"jmillerdp","8","0","1","8 May 2001"," A Rousing, Well Made War Film
","A compelling Revolutionary War epic, ""The Patriot"" largely succeeds because of Mel Gibson's impassioned portrait of Benjamin Martin, a former warrior who's chosen a peaceful life with his family, but is called back into service when things around him begin to fall apart. The most riveting part of the movie is Martin's dark past and what drive's him to do what he does when he once again takes up arms. This results in a grisly, horrific passage that speaks to the horrors of war. This is extremely effective and harrowing. Robert Rodat, who wrote ""Saving Private Ryan"" knows what he's doing when it comes to portraying the darkness of war.<br/><br/>Also adding to the film are yet another great film score by John Williams, who, with each score he writes, shows today's young composers how the job should be done. Plus, the film looks gorgeous, thanks to Caleb Deschanel, easily one of our best cinematographers.<br/><br/>The one element that  doesn't work as well is the character of Colonel Tavington, who's extremely brutal in everything he does. This means a villain who seems to be from a different movie, one of those snarling types who's only role in the movie is to do evil. While there are plenty of evil humans in this world, they usually don't make endless pronouncements about it or have a sole purpose in life to constantly try to see how they can top one brutal act with another. This kind of drags the well-crafted movie into ""Lethal Weapon"" territory, and into a slightly cartoonish realm.<br/><br/>Ignore this element, however, and you have a very good movie. The film comes from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin (who, of course, did ""Independence Day""). It comes as a surprise, then, that they would make this film. But they do a good job and ""The Patriot"" is the result, a rousing, well made film that is a great tribute to all of the courageous, dedicated people who fought for and founded our country."

This movie shows very clearly why the war took a physical and personal toll on some people and Gibson's character makes the best example.  Also, Robert Rodat writes a solid script, the score by John Williams is fresh and moving, and Caleb Deschanel's priceless cinematography is breath-taking.

The setting is slightly before America gained it's independence from England in the south. Mel Gibson plays a colonel who has decided that fighting a war is not the best way to gain something, but then changes his mind when the British kill some of his family members and are rather brutal in their methods.  To me this was a confusing film because it's not about Patriotism, it's not a history lesson about the civil war, but rather a way of putting a revenge movie in a different setting.  We are never given enough time or information as to why Gibson doesn't want to fight until after he starts fighting again. I believe the picture was trying to show that love for family should be greater than love for a cause, but I honestly don't think it did a very good job at this either.  Emmerich seems to have a ""hit or miss"" directing style and this one for me was a miss.

","THE PATRIOT is a flag-waver to be sure, but that's not such a bad thing these days when a lot of Americans have forgotten their own history.  The film has compressed historical figures such as Francis Marion and Elijah Clark (both American partisans) and particular battles (most notably the Battle of Cowpens and The Battle of Guilford Courthouse) for dramatic license.  The War for Independence was a bloody affair and the film does a magnificent job in recreating the era and dramatizing its incidents.  Those who sneer at the anti-British portrayal have either never learned their history or choose to ignore it for their own agendas (take that Canadians and Brits!).  The character of the British Dragoon Col. Taviston was based on the true and infamous Col. Banastre Tarleton, whose massacre of unarmed American P.O.W.'s and wounded at Waxhaws, South Carolina earned him a reputation as a ruthless butcher.  Similar sorts of incidents occurred throughout the war, with Loyalists and Patriots alike enacting horrendous savagery upon each other.  But that is the nature of a war fought between neighbors.  Seen from the amoral perspective of today's apathetic, feel-good political correctness, I'm sure its hard for many Americans to understand how the passion for liberty and freedom, imperfect as it may have been, could fire men's souls to put their families, fortunes and lives on the line for what they believed.

Eventough it's mostly the same point as the other patriotic movies, the United States can prevail over anything, this benefits from great performances by two Aussie's.  <br/><br/>  The two Aussie's in question are Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger. Gibson puts in a performance which stands as some of his best work, while Ledger(in his first major role) proves he can hold his own with even the best actors. All the other actors in this movies acquit themselves quite well. Led by a scary performance from Jason Isaacs as the main villain. Tcheky Karyou proves that with the right material he can also be excellent.<br/><br/>  The plot is based on the Civil War and eventhough the main character and most of the other characters are all made up the story stays loyal to the source. One thing this movie does well is put in a right mix of action and drama. At some points I was nearly crying and at others I actually stood up and cheered. The character of Benjamin Martin(Gibson) is very intelligently written, while his Gabriel(Ledger) is at times under-written but comes off very convincingly. The only character that I didn't specifically like was that Colonel William Tavington(Isaacs). Eventhough the movie made me hate the character like it was supposed to, Tavington was just a bit too cartoonish in his evilness and it was hard to believe that he was a real person.<br/><br/>  But overall ""The Patriot"" overcomes it's small flaws and becomes one of the best films of the year. I highly recomend ""The Patriot"" 9/10"
"itoft","4","0","1","22 February 2001"," strong theme, ruined by clunky Hollywood sentimentality
","This film has a strong central theme, and is beautifully shot, but its plot and dialogue are hopelessly cluttered with Hollywood focus-group nonsense. Contemporary sensibilities about single parenthood, racial equality, sexual equality, and anti-war sentiment (war and killing are unambiguously evil) do considerable violence to the delightful fiction that we are witnessing events of more than 200 years ago. As if this weren't damaging enough, the film's director appears to have lifted important images and action sequences directly from Michael Mann's 1992 adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohicans. The only important differences are that in The Patriot, Gibson's action sequences seem clunky and oafish as compared to Day Lewis's in Last of the Mohicans. Overall what should be a strength of the film turns out to be a major disappointment. Finally, the film is burdened by a mannered style which insists on lingering on Mel Gibson's pain and grief: Mr. Gibson is an actor more than capable of communicating powerful emotions on the screen, but here his direction forces us to witness something akin to an interminable series of acting workshop performances. And the pain and grief are excessive in relation to the demands of the plot, which is essentially a B-movie Kung Fu plot: (1) retired hero commits to non-violence and tends his garden, (2) evil man kills his friend, family member, and/or master, and (3) provokes non-violent hero to abandon pacifism in favor of righteous violence, (4) the two confront each other, and (4a) the hero at first suffers defeat, but then (4b) rallies and kills evil man in spectacular and poetic manner. Here we have an already motivated hero (patriotism, death of family member) unnecessarily remotivated, and an evil man killed twice. Add to this an opaque sub-plot about a little girl who is voluntarily mute and you get a stone around the neck of this film that all but sinks it. Ridiculous."

","The Patriot might be a movie worth watching, but it has a major flaw: Every single ""good"" scene has been there before - in Braveheart!!!<br/><br/>This movie is far away from Braveheart quality.

In many scenes, you know exactly what will happen next, for instance the (very, very, very) bad guy not being dead but only faking it to start a counter attack. This is just one example of way too many movie cliches that are used to make this film very, very, very long and certainly NOT well-dosed as far as strikes of fate that hit the main character go. When in Braveheart, Mel Gibson was taking revenge for the murder of his wife, in the Patriot there are way too many reasons to take revenge for to longer care for the Main Characters pain.

","I was in Australia when I first watched The Patriot and again I was fully prepared for a bit of anti-English bashing , because Mel just couldn't resist to give that winning formula up after Braveheart.I sat down and as the film unravelled , the most impressive aspect of the movie was clear , the special-effects. As the film trotted on and the American Revolution broke out , we had Mel Gibson babbling on about replacing one tyrant with another , therefore Im going home and others can risk their necks so I can live in freedom , our hero was born. A big battle breaks out and soldiers from both sides are assisted by Mels ""slaves"" in his farm , and the victorious British Army ride in  , saving there own men but killing the American Revolutionaries...well something had to be done. Mel then goes on a personal war of vengeance(any commander worth his salt would've restrained such a man) and as the story unfolds we are given the distinct impression , that Mel comes to his senses and kills the Brits thereby winning the war of independence. There are many points to this film that is quite simply nauseating , the way Blacks were compliant ""Uncle Tom's"" was one of the worst , but the burning down of The Church...well Ive seen Come and See aswell. This scene put British soldiers on par with the  SS Einzsatgruppen squads in Russia...This was a disgusting spectacle served up by all concerned , but more importantly , why didn't the British Actors remonstrate with Mel Gibson , The producer and the non-British  cast? OK it adds villainy to a film , but the War of Independence in 18th century as seen from Britain's point of view , was very much a polarized issue. The Battle of Saratoga was a better demonstration of what each side did in that conflict , and it was the hallmark of honour in conflict as British troops , though defeated were treated pretty well after surrender and each side respected the others rationale. What Mel and the boys quitely forget or want you to forget , is that one of the true heroes of the War of Independence was Thomas Paine who wrote The Rights of Man and Common Sense and he was English. Also the Earl of Chatham (the most respected British politician of his age) implored George III to let the New World go...even the arch-conservative philosopher Edmund Burke supported American Independence. The Patriot can only be summed up as a shameful distortion of history , that simply rips up the concept of poetic licence and puts in its place  lies and more lies. This film is worth no more than 2/10...Special-effects considered."

It's rife with stereotypes such as the ruthless Tavington (obviously modeled loosely on the Tory dragoon commander Tarleton, for whom was coined the term ""Tarleton's Quarter"").<br/><br/>Some of the special effects are a bit hokey and gratuitous.

"zombizilla","Null","0","1","23 January 2001"," Flag-waving, ""God-bless-America"" epic; as well it should be!
","""The Patriot"" is one of those films that draws a line in the sand with no middle ground; you either love it or hate it.      I loved it! This is one of those movies that John Wayne would have gave his left tooth to be in.  Instead, we have Mel Gibson as our flag-waving hero, Benjamin Martin, a single father whose wife passed away a few years from something I didn't pick up on. A veteran of the French/Indian wars, he has seen the ugliness of battle and feels a sort of remorse for the tactics he used and the lives he had taken.  Now owner of a plantation with indentured servants, not slaves, he doesn't want any of that to change, no matter that he is taxed unfairly.  He is at peace with himself. However, his oldest son, played by Heath Ledger, is caught up in the fury that is building against the British and a resulting revolution. Benjamin forbids him from joining the cause, but being a teenager, he disobeys him and is soon joining the Army as a dispatcher. What follows is pure Hollywood patriotism.  I only have 1000 word limit, and by now you've read other reviews here.  Gibson does, for the most part, play it straight, i.e. brave and heroic.  However, there are some parts that he shows his ""Lethal Weapon""-style humor, i.e. cocky and audience-winking.  The scene where he meets with Cornwallis, with the two Great Danes he captured in the first battle scene, is accurate in ways of Officer/Gentleman behavior during that time.  But when he orders the dogs to sit or come or stay, is pure Mel (Reminds me of one scene in LW2 or 3 where Mel is schmoozing with another large dog who is about to attack him). Hilarious! The battle scenes are awesome and well-choreographed.  Being from South Carolina, I appreciated the filmmakers for combining the actual Revolutionary war heroes Francis Marion (The Swamp Fox) and Thomas Sumter (The Gamecock) into the character Martin.  America Rocks!"

","Now what can I say about the Patriot? Well, it was a good film, no doubt about that . The cast was excellent and the special effects, although not breath-taking were certainly good . And then we come onto the storyline . It's war, fine the Americans verses the British . But it's not just that is it! It's the amazing, heroic, God following, church going Americans verses the evil, children slaughtering, Satan worshipping British . To say that this film is a bit bias towards the nationality of the directors is a bit like saying Hitler was a bit naughty! The film chiefly follows one American who brutally slays countless British (might be considered wrong but they are British after all - they murder children!). To begin with it's just him and his two sons killing a mass unit of British . Before he effortlessly slays the lot of them he says a prayer to God, indicating that even God hates the British as supports the Americans! The film made a historical event seem as cut and dry as British=Evil, Americans=Good which as anyone with any historical sense will know is not how history normally happens . It's not black and white! I understand the desparation of the American people for their well deserved freedom but to make it that bias was just blind patiotism and deserves the terrible reviews it got over here in England! As if the Americans hadn't insulted us enough with U-571...."

","The whinging of the folk complaining about this film's unabashedly pro-U.S. sentiments got me angry enough to respond.<br/><br/>First of all, if the British WERE so blasted wonderful, sweet, gentle, etc., WHY EVER did we revolt from them?  I've read the accounts of the time and the grinding truth of it was that Americans did not have and were not going to get the rights of Englishmen in any other way than by taking them at the point of a gun.  Oh, right, guns are icky... Freedom is icky... The U.S. is icky... Keep repeating the lies until everyone believes them, and don't let the truth near the schools.  If any of the self-assured boors who deny the ferocity of some of the British even know the names 'Banastre Tarleton,' 'Simon Girty,' and 'Jane McCrae, then I'd be stunned--and then call them liars instead of uneducated.<br/><br/>Sets, costuming, scenes, all superb.  Acting, uniformly good.  Score, wonderful.  Some telescoping of historical events, some historical characters (such as the brilliant Nathaniel Greene and Lafayette) not quite as prominent as they should have been.  Battle scenes staggering, and well executed, scenes of every day life very well done.<br/><br/>It is a shame when patriotism is something some find objectionable in a film.  I was amazed to find it at all."
"jiangliqings","1","0","2","12 January 2001"," The year's biggest disappointment (yet still watchable).
","** 1/2 stars out of ****<br/><br/>It pains me to give The Patriot anything below ***.  Simply put, with Mel Gibson in the title role of a man fighting for his family and his country, I was expecting an historical epic that could somewhat reach the heights of Braveheart.  It didn't happen, but that's not to say The Patriot was a bad movie, which is not the case by a long shot.<br/><br/>It's around the beginning of the Revolutionary War in America (specifically, South Carolina for this film), fighting for independence from England. Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a widower and father of 7, hopes to shelter his family from the horrors of war, but his attempts are rendered futile when his oldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), disobeys him and enlists.<br/><br/>After a few campaigns and battle defeats, Gabriel manages to return home, but insists he must go because he had been ordered to send dispatches. The British also arrive at the Martin residence, led by Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs), who takes Gabriel prisoner and has Martin's second child, Thomas, killed.<br/><br/>Enraged, Martin ambushes the men escorting Gabriel, frees his son, and has them sheltered in the home of his sister-in-law, Charlotte (Joely Richardson).  But Gabriel refuses to stay, and returns to the army, with his father following aside.  Both eventually join and form a militia, which now has the assignment of trying to slow down General Cornwallis as long as possible and hold him in the south so the French can arrive in time.  At the same time they are taking down the British with ambushes, Colonel Tavington plans of a way to take down Martin and his colonial militia.<br/><br/>The Patriot has so many things wrong with it that I'm surprised I didn't give it ** stars instead.  First off, the storyline is dull and cliched. Oscar-nominated screenwriter Robert Rodat's script is often unengaging and lacks the depth so vital to an historical drama.  He and director Roland Emmerich seem to be more concerned with ""inspiring"" subplots and cliches than real drama.  Consider the unnecessary side stories involving a slave who has to prove himself in battle, the daughter who won't speak to her father, etc., and you've got a movie that wastes too much time on material that really isn't all that important.<br/><br/>Another flaw in the script is Rodat's obsession with injecting a lot of the humor into the film.  I have no problem with that, but only 1/4 of the humor actually works, and it wears out fast after the first viewing, thus making the humor look out of place and even corny on a second viewing.<br/><br/>But let me go into what is good in the movie.  The action scenes are impressively choreographed and the first ambush attack-with Gibson rescuing his son-is simply a magnificently done sequence, a white-knuckle set piece with true emotional power.  Had there been more scenes like this, The Patriot would have been a fantastic film.  The last battle itself is an exciting and long sequence, but features lttle compelling power or drama. Emmerich proves adept at handling action scenes, but does little to create true depth, instead often resorting to manipulation.<br/><br/>The Patriot does have more action sequences than The last of the Mohicans and Glory, but you'd be surprised by the sometimes sluggish pace (as compared to the tight pacing of those aforementioned films).  When the movie's not on the battlefield, it can get quite slow moving (and even during the skirmishes, the annoying overuse of unstylish slow motion gets on your nerves after a while).  The fact is, the story is simply not executed well enough to maintain tight and undivided interest for 165 minutes.<br/><br/>The performances are actually quite strong and help to lift the movie above its flawed script.  Mel Gibson is as great as ever, and his terrific portrayal of a man torn by family and country is one of his best performances yet.  Jason Isaacs is equally good as the villain.  His Colonel Tavington is convincingly cold and calculating.  Heath Ledger turns in a stellar performance, and his co-star/love interest Lisa Brenner is decent (though her church speech is almost over-the-top).  The lovely and underrated Joely Richardson is good as Gibson's love interest but doesn't enough screen time to flesh out her character completely.  She also tends to speak rather slowly, as if though she's having a hard time trying to dispell her British accent.  The rest of the supporting cast is adequate, though some of the militia characters can get quite annoying.<br/><br/>On the technical side, Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is at times gorgeous and the costumes and sets are convincing.  John Williams score is a mixed bag.  The haunting and foreboding elements of the score-particularly in the scene where Isaacs knocks the tomahawk out of Gibson's hand in their fight-work very well and is at times a terrible beauty to listen to.  The patriotic score, however, is too overly jingoistic and just too cheery.<br/><br/>So, The Patriot didn't quite turn out to be that glorious epic I was hoping for, but it's by all means a watchable movie, one that I recommend with and/or despite some reservations.  This year's true epics are really Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Gladiator, but The Patriot is a decent outing for those looking for some sweeping spectacle."

","Why are people so quick to judge historical inaccuracies in films?  So the two lead males aren't American.  So it's got a tone of nineteen hundreds mentality.  So Mel Gibson can take on twenty men singlehandedly and live to talk about it.  Why don't people focus on what makes this movie so good?! *BEFORE PROCEEDING, MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS THAT GIVE AWAY PLOT* There are many accurate aspects, the British aristocracy at its finest- (the portrayal of Cornwallace was dead on accurate), the cold calculation in the murder of innocent women and children(the church fire left me speechless and in tears), the fact that this man lost more than one child, and not necessarily in battle (also not uncommon in the Revolutionary War), the idea that many slaves were there by choice (also something that has been historically proven accurate in both the Revolutionary and Civil Wars-while slavery itself is an awful and prejudicial idea, the mentality of the time was that many could not have lived better independently; many were also granted freedom for fighting in the Revolutionary War), and finally, that in the south (the area the movie talks about) some of the bloodiest battles were fought; not by ""regulars"" but by militiamen fighting more guerilla than elbow to elbow.  As for violence, if you want a clean war movie go rent ""the Longest Day.""  Movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" prove that today's moviegoing audience is more moved and reached by grandscale acts of violence.  Finally, to say a German shouldn't direct, or Australians can't represent Americans, is prejudiced and as un-American as can be.

","Just by chance, a CD of John Williams' film music was still playing on my CD player when the DVD entry screen of 'The Patriot' first came onto my video screen and for a moment there, I actually thought that the music I was hearing from 'Saving Private Ryan' was the theme music for 'The Patriot'.<br/><br/>
My mistake had merit. Because, sadly, while being an admirer of John Williams, his work on this film seems to have caught the producers' disease of flat commercial repetition. <br/><br/>No doubt someone early in the piece was inspired by the thought that there hasn't been a good War of Independence film for a while and saw a commercial opportunity. And the idea of paralleling the long, difficult and bloody struggle of a father with that of the young American nation was roundly applauded in all the pre-production meetings. But the script is appalling: a little 18th century rhetoric with a lot of midday television kitsch. And the chosen director, Roland Emmerich, has as much emotional finesse and subtlety as the cannonballs hurtling towards camera. <br/><br/>My conclusion is that the producers milked the historical connection for what they could make of it; it barely managed to come second compared to the lavish attention vested on the battle scenes (really the only cinematic reason for seeing the film at all). What triumphed here at the end was not freedom and independence, but another repeat dose of action with digital sound and digital fx. Producers like these should be forced to make films for 10years with budgets of under $100,000 and on a low wage so they can relearn what honest filmmaking is all about."

Over the course of three hours, The Patriot presents a panorama of interesting three-dimensional characters, spectacular battles, and a relatively tight plot.  For a change, there are no weak performances, and the film manages to break away from the Braveheart mould (something I feared it wouldn't do).<br/><br/>However, there are one or two flaws.  While the beginning dealt with the actual historical issues behind the conflict (such as taxation without representation), modern patriotic rhetoric appeared every now and then in the middle (lines such as ""Soon this will be a free country"").  Also, for the first time in ages, the score by John Williams was less than inspiring, making me wish that Emmerich had used the music from Gettysburg.<br/><br/>All in all, though, The Patriot is a very decent film, and well worth seeing.

The special effects are pretty good, but this is a Blockbuster...so they had a big budget, and they did the same mistake than the awful Godzilla and the very boring Independence Day (and by the way, it's the same director in this one). This is a part of history that wants itself to be shown on a golden plate, but the bad quality of the script and directing make the plate cheaper. I compare this film to Braveheart a lot, and I realize how good Braveheart was, and how deceiving The Patriot is. It's the same kind of  situation that brings the hero to react and create an army to destroy the bad guys and get back their freedom. Some scenes try to be pathetic, but Mel Gibson isn't convincing at all. The whole film seems like a modern reproduction of the old times because of the costumes that seem too clean, the backgrounds that don't put the viewer in a mood, etc. It all looks fake and superficial. Made in USA, as they say, and proud of it. 5/10"

","This is an excellent movie.  For script reasons, Martin is a composite character, but the movie otherwise is a good portrayal of the ugliest part of the Revolution, which was South Carolina in 1780 - 1781.  Partisan war, civilian reprisals and retreating militia were all part of that scene.  The staging of the battles of Camden and Cowpens were quite convincing and the character of Tavington (who is like the historical Banestre Tarlton) was quite true.  Only serious problem was that Tarlton and the Washington relative (who actually fought Tarlton)both survived their fight and Tarlton become a member of Parliament.  The spirit of events though was quite convincing and the movie an excellent portrayal of that very violent phase of the Revolution."

There are a few inaccuracies also. By this late in the war, the Continental Army and the Militia were in dire need of all sorts of military equipment, such as uniforms, shoes, etc. None of which is reflected in this film, with everyone being well fed and dressed. The acting is pretty fair, with surprisingly strong performances from the children. Jason Isaacs as Col. Tavington, also gave a very good performance.

"Ezreal","Null","0","1","12 December 2000"," Entertaining fiction
","I normally do not comment on films that have been reviewed to death, but I had to comment on ""The Patriot"".  Part of the reason is because too many of the bad reviews on here have nothing to do with plot (which, yes, was a tried and true formula), acting (which was generally outstanding throughout) or filmmaking (I have finally been vindicated in my opinion that Roland Emmerich is a great director, as long as he doesn't write the script). Unfortunately, most of the opinions have to do with badmouthing America.  I expected the Brits to be upset about their portrayal, but, unfortunately, I find the usual chorus of American whiners upset because the Americans are portrayed as good guys.  Heads up: This is not the worst, most evil country in the world.  Quit apologizing for everything some dunder-headed ancestors may have done.<br/><br/>Soapboxing aside, Tavington, though historically being a decent person and surviving past the Revolution, makes a great villain, and it is him and the character of Benjamin Martin that make this film.  Otherwise, it is true that it would have just been beautifully shot fluff with some great battle scenes.  The most glaring error I found (being a straight historian rather than an expert on military and footware minutiae) was that, since the director is German, he failed to portray the fact that it was German mercenaries hired by the Hanovers who were responsible for the real atrocities committed against the colonists.  Also, the Tory sympathizers were worse than portrayed, and were traitors in the most heinous sense. <br/><br/>
Still, the movie never claimed to be a history lesson, and succeeds as a big-budget crowd-pleaser.  It also the best movie that Emmerich has made so far, and here is hoping that he wisely sticks with filming other people's scripts."

Also historical figures were mentioned, but never portrayed in the film.  The accent could have also been a little more historical.  The actors were devoid of any accent, which is laughable.  Why would France only send one military official to train a small band of militia?  The main character only became a ""Patriot"", when his son was murdered by an English soldier well into the war.  The true Patriots of America were involved in the war effort before it became personal.  The main character was not a true Patriot, but a man bent on revenge.  The only time he embraced the American flag was when he recovered a battered flag from his eldest son after he had been killed.  The flag meant nothing to him, except that it was his sons flag.

On top of that the film is predictable and cheesy.  I like a good cheesy film like Army of Darkness, but that knows that it cheesy, this doesn't.

"Buddy-51","Null","0","1","18 November 2000"," good battle scenes, sappy drama
","`The Patriot' is at its most authentic when it concentrates on the ugly brutalities of its Revolutionary War battle scenes and at its least authentic when it focuses on its own dramatic, storytelling elements which are, all too often, marked by heavy-handed contrivance, bathos and plain old-fashioned corniness.  Alas, for those of us who approached this film with high expectations and high hopes, the bad news is that the latter aspect takes up far more screen time than does the former.<br/><br/>
This latest directorial effort by Roland Emmerich at least has the advantage of novelty working in its favor in that few films of recent times have even bothered to chronicle and recreate this particular period in American history.  All too often we think of the people who helped found this new nation in almost plaster saint terms, and `The Patriot' seems, for a while at least, as if it is going to try to portray them in a more complex, well-rounded light.  Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is presented to us as a reluctant warrior, a man initially opposed to the war because he wants to protect his family from harm yet who, after one of his own sons is brutally murdered by the British, suddenly takes up arms, as much out of a sense of personal revenge as out of a commitment to cause and principle.  So far so good  yet as the drama unfolds, we become more and more skeptical of what we are seeing on screen.  As a director of crowd-pleasing extravaganzas in the past (`Independence Day,' `Godzilla'), Emmerich just can't seem to resist indulging in all the requisite Hollywood touches that end up trivializing the seriousness of the film's subject matter.  For instance, the scene in which Martin almost single-handedly slaughters a group of fully armed Redcoats plays like the typical action scene in any conventional Gibson vehicle.  Nor is the director much more successful in his attempts to humanize the characters.  The scenes between Martin and his son, for instance, as well as those between him and his dead wife's beautiful sister or between his son and the girl who becomes his sweetheart all reek equally of phoniness and sentimentality.  This is not helped one whit either by the syrupy, bombastic symphonic score provided by John Williams which sounds, quite literally, as if he lifted it directly from the soundtrack of his own `Jurassic Park.'<br/><br/>In an effort to turn this epic struggle for freedom into a simplistic rah-rah action film, Emmerich and writer Robert Rodat have created a British commander so villainous that he stops just short of twirling a handlebar moustache every time he utters a command to mow down injured prisoners or set ablaze a church filled with unarmed men, women and children sympathetic to the rebel cause.  This character, who also plays a major role in the death of Martin's son, provides the protagonist with a rather cheap foil against which to fight and the audience with a convenient target at whom it can hiss, boo and jeer.  Thus, the filmmakers reduce this complex battle for liberty to the level of conventional, lowest common denominator melodrama when what we crave is the kind of hard edged moral complexity we find in war movies like `Glory' and `The Last of the Mohicans.'<br/><br/>Visually, `The Patriot' is a knockout, filled with widescreen images of glorious autumnal landcapes with or without battling armies in the foreground.  Structurally, however, the 165-minute film suffers from distention and attenuation with a screenplay that involves itself with far too many subsidiary characters to keep the drama neatly in focus.  The pace often seems languid as we wile away the time between impressive, but sometimes all-too-brief clashes between opposing armies.  For it is in these scenes that `The Patriot' manages to excel.  Those sensitive to movie violence may object to the graphic nature of these depictions of brutal wartime carnage.  Yet, it is in just this refusal to sugarcoat the horrors of the blood-soaked battlefield that `The Patriot' finds its one element of validity and truth.  Unfortunately, the realistic nature of these sequences only serves to further emphasize the phoniness of much of the rest of the film.  The overall failure of  `The Patriot' is a shame because the Revolutionary War remains fertile territory for a filmmaker willing to provide a less pandering, audience-friendly approach to the subject.  We eagerly await that future film's arrival."

","This movie starts slow and takes awhile to build up steam, but thankfully it's not as long as Braveheart. It threatens to drag on too long and lingers on things like an obligatory romance here and there. There are also moments that are more bloody than necessary, I assume in order to attempt more authenticity. However, it read more like shock value. <br/><br/>Is it historically accurate? That would take a historian to confirm. It tells a good story, and builds a few chills of patriotic pride in any viewer with a courageous heart. The tale focuses on the battles of the revolutionary war, and how the Americans finally bested the British redcoats through what we would today call ""guerrilla tactics."" Actually such tactics were learned from Native Americans of this soil. It's an insult to Native Americans that they didn't focus more on that. <br/><br/>There are some powerful fight scenes, though none match the efforts of Braveheart. There are many opportunities for humor which help the slow points a bit. I enjoyed the show quite a bit and recommend it for anyone who enjoys Mel Gibson's performances, or anyone who likes war movies. I wish there were more movies which dealt with the Revolutionary War actually. Rene Auberjonois gives an exceptional performance as a priest. It is very much worth a rental."

","Apparently he can, for I really enjoyed this movie. OK I am not American, but that is probably why I just thought this movie is good (otherwise I would have thought it was great or excellent). You see, this film is the same as every other war movie that was made: It appeals most to the people whose history it is. For me it was like that with Saving Private Ryan (thought it was good (nothing more) cause it was not my battle')). Other feeling I have had though with Stalingrad, Das Boot and also (but less) with Die Brücke. I really liked those movies, because it shows the history of my people in World War II and I can imagine that as an American you think Saving Private Ryan was the best war movies ever made. But for me, the best American war movie ever made is Platoon. To get back to this one, this one is really good and I despise all of you who did not go and see it at the theater, and went to other idiotic films instead (like Mission to Mars or the recently released Little Nicky). You could have spent your money better.<br/><br/>
By now you are probably wondering what was so good about this movie. Well here it comes, there were great war scenes, good emotional scenes, good directing, good music, good acting, funny parts, there were no slow or boring parts plus it was different than other war movies made recently (since Saving Private Ryan). What do I mean by that you wonder, well to understand that you have to acknowledge that this war was very different from World War II in it's whole setup. Here there were ideals involved in which men strongly believed and thought these beliefs were worth fighting for, so they enlisted in the army out of free will (almost all of them). In World War II it was just about to eliminate a threat, which was not direct to most Americans, seeing as the battle was not fought in their own backyard. It is the origin of the War that makes it so different, the whole history behind it and the motives of the people to either be on one side or the other.<br/><br/>
The film itself has great scenes in it, my favorite ones are when Mel Gibson Rides off to leave his family for the second time, the two cannonball scenes and the ghost scene. Those scenes were great. The rest was all good, except for a few predictable / unrealistic ones at the end and that revenge scene. But after seeing such a good film, who cares about those minor mistakes'? This is no Braveheart but it still is good. I thank Mel Gibson, Roland Emmerich (for making a great comeback after Godzilla) and of course John Williams.<br/><br/>

This was a textbook attempt to bring out raw emotions in the audience.  It would take about 8 pages to list all of the terrible, sentimental techniques of the film.  For one thing, the orchestral music was continuous throughout the movie.  The villain was a one-sided static evil commander.  The plot crudely tried to get its viewers emotionally opposed to this truly evil villain. It even seemed like the screen-writer (maybe director) tried to incorporate a wanna-be-intelligent theme (""sins of the past"") but was not up to the task.<br/><br/>I am not a good judge of acting; maybe it was ok.  I also am not sure of the movie's historical accuracy.  Even if I were to give the movie the benefit of the doubt, its literary value would still rank somewhere among that of Hudson Hawk and Jaws 3.

The British come off best in the acting department even in the small roles, probably because villains are notoriously easier (and more fun) to play than the saintly types.<br/><br/>
I have heard some mothers say that they are going to rent the video as a history lesson for their kids. Be careful. The historical inaccuracies have been well documented by now and there's some very bloody moments. All you may be teaching, as you see Mel Gibson training his sons to kill, is that kids can look pretty cool with guns.<br/><br/>I give it three out of ten."

","Just read the last few reviews of this movie and some people seem rather upset. That, to me, is very interesting. Is it because they despise portrayals of heroism? Is it because they cannot get over their phony hatred of romanticism? Is it that they hate to see men portrayed as noble? Is it that this movie is a mirror reflecting their own decaying souls? I am not being overly dramatic here. To dislike this movie is to dislike humanity. What this movie portrays is the ability of individuals to stand up for themselves and their families and their country and to do so without apprehension. This is something that does not happen very often anymore (in war or peace) and this movie is a simple reminder that it is okay to believe in something and stand up for yourself. And not to mention the fact that it was beautifully filmed, well-acted (yes, Mel Gibson did a very good job, even if it's not cool to say so), and absolutely entertaining on all levels. I recommend this movie to all people but especially to children (hey kids, watch this and learn some real values before your friends and parents drain the life out of you). This movie gets my highest rating and then some for the fact that they actually managed to get it made in America 2000. Watch it and feel good for a couple of hours."
"bee-17","Null","0","1","2 October 2000"," unoriginal film
","I've got to hand it to Mr. Emmerich... this is his least clunky, most American-looking film to date. That said, it still was a piece of garbage. He must have watched Mann's Last of the Mohicans a dozen times but was unable to figure out why its battle scenes worked. As a director, Emmerich has no patience to let an action scene unfold at a natural pace-- you can imagine him hammering the square into the round hole back in nursery school. The only time he allows the camera to linger is while admiring the pumping lungs of a corset-enhanced woman. In addition to his trademark single-purpose composite characters and rapid, disjointed, filmed-on-different-day cuts, he has now added to his arsenal an obnoxious use of slow motion (a la Renny Harlin) and Saving Private Ryan-style fast motion/high exposure/low frame rate footage.<br/><br/>As for the script, there are several fleeting original, interesting moments, ==== MARGINAL SPOILER ==== such as how the anxieties of battle show on his two youngest boys' faces. However, these moments are far too rare. Instead, we are stuck with historical and popular sound bites: ""Taxation without representation,"" ""All men are created equal,"" and, at one laughably placed moment, ""It's a free country!"" I was surprised not to hear ""Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes!"" or ""Remember the Alamo!""<br/><br/>When the bit characters were looking to the director for tips on motivation and period behavior, I'll bet he handed out copies of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. The film's treatment of black people was an incredible insult to blacks and the intelligence of the audience as a whole. Are we such simpletons that we can't handle complex, contradictory heroes?<br/><br/>Other critiques have suitably ripped apart the authenticity and historical accuracy of the film better than I ever could. Unfortunately, I don't have any suggestions of better revolutionary war movies. Maybe the one good thing to come from The Patriot is that other, better films exploring the period might be coming soon."

Emmerich knows how to catch the attention of the spectator with fantastic fights, well orchestrated and very impressive.

","Some say it encouraged Americanism.  I disagree with them because it is about the war that seeks for independence.  It is from the history event that had reviewed in script.  If people go and seek independence, they must have feeling of belonging.  Then, that helps them to grow their intention.<br/><br/>Yes, I think Roland is a wrong person to direct THE PATRIOT because he is just a man eligible to make some unreal scientific fiction.  He spoiled the movie, especially when comparing with Mel Gibson, because he tried hard to imitate BRAVE HEART but Roland can't get his soul.  The situation just like what Robert had done on WHAT LIES BENEATH.<br/><br/>It gets the point that parents should sometimes let their children do something wrong and then demonstrate them the mistakes (of course, if they try to commit a crime, we should stop them).   Like Gabriel, he is a nice guy that saved the foes...he should knew that.   His kindness led him to this mistake.    He was politically correct because life is indeed precious. Why didn't he go and save these wounded soldiers? He don't see how bad the consequences would be beforehand.  Benjamin never stopped Gabriel because he had done the right thing, but at a wrong moment.<br/><br/>And as we always quote, ""like father, like son"", it is true.  It is because we all had been young and careless.  Our fathers have been the same.  They also neglect advice and learn from mistakes afterwards.  Yes, parents try their best to protect their kids but sometimes acceptable mistakes should be made to help them to see the real world.<br/><br/>Yes, fathers are much considerate because what they decided will probably affect the whole family.<br/><br/>However, a young man would bear a greater risk because he could just live on his own, without the responsibilities from his own family (I mean his own marriage).  That's why he could be quick-tempered and childish.<br/><br/>Susan is the most remarkable part in the film even if she just appeared only for a few minutes.  That illustrated what a little kid expected from its parents.  They hope to beloved.  Like Susan, she got provoked with Benjamin because he always spent his days in battles, without talking with her. That widened the gap between them.    Fortunately, she finally understood him and broke the barriers.<br/><br/>Maybe the history is being rewritten but I think THE PATRIOT was a great family drama, with plenty of human nature that you should not have missed."

","Mel Gibson is the evil ringleader of a bunch of retarded, violent thugs in this highly watchable war of independence epic.

I'm not sure how American audiences would have reacted to seeing their ancestors portrayed as mindless, violent, flag-waving knuckleheaded buffoons, but I enjoyed this movie. The film ends with nasty Mel triumphing. As he returns to rebuild his life, I was left with a distinct impression that a sequel was in the offing. Be nice to see Mel as the good guy next time round.

","Warning! A few spoilers!...Roland Emmerich directed this film, which is the reason I was skeptical as I walked into the theater. Then as the ending credits rolled I realized that I had wrongly underestimated Emmerich. His films have had very good direction, just lackluster screenplays and careless editing (Independence Day was written in less than a week by Emmerich and Dean Devlin while the two were vacationing in Mexico, and a good portion of Stargate was removed which resulted in Act III lasting only 10-12 minutes). Now, working from a screenplay from Saving Private Ryan pen man Robert Rodat, The Patriot works well with Emmerich at the helm. Most compare it to Mel Gibson's Braveheart. Why support a film that glorifies another country's independence more than a film that glorifies our own? British actor Jason Isaacs finally gets to show off his fine acting skills in a good film, and I thought he was wonderful as the evil Redcoat Colonel (Many British were offended by this character, but he was based on a real officer under Cornwallis's command). He played an evil man almost as effectively as Ralph Fiennes did in Schindler's List. Isaacs would be the perfect bad guy in a Bond film. I loved the vicious ""cannonball to the face"" shot, and the slo-mo attack on the Redcoats led by Martin's eldest son. And I heard more sniffles when Martin's youngest daughter begged for her father to stay than I did when Leo sunk to the ocean floor at the end of Titanic. The only thing I didn't like about this film was John William's score. It was cheesy and gave some of the ""serious"" battle scenes an almost cartoon feel. I wish David Arnold, who usually scores Emmerich's films and the new James Bond flicks, had done this one. Arnold is an overlooked talent and is (in my opinion) the best composer in the business today. And although it effectively and brutally showed us how young children saw the carnage of this war up close, I seriously doubt that Martin and two young sons could have killed that many British soldiers. We also never find out what happened to the loyalist who, like a coward, succumbed to carrying out Tavington's order to burn the church. Overall, it's a film worth seeing, and it shows us what those flute and drum-fanfared History Channel specials couldn't quite get across about the Revolutionary War, even though the film uses the war as a backdrop to the main story."

","It has been proven that Roland Emmerich makes good movies. It remains to be seen however, if those movies are milestones of modern film making.<br/><br/>The Patriot, although lengthy at parts, is a good movie. It aims to shed a light on the birth of American history. As such it contains the usual clichÃ©s: Women's opinion was heard and respected (although later on women had to fight for their rights), white people respected their black slaves and were honored to have them fight and die for their cause, etc. I believe these fairy tales are necessary for any film to be politically correct and thus make a good performance in the box office. Speaking of box office, I think the most important factor in the success of the movie is Mel Gibson. His performance here is reminiscent of Braveheart and will surely make you forget about the minor discrepancies of the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to add a small remark. The Patriot is Emmerich's second movie (after Independence Day) whose release coincides with US Elections, and here again the movie comes to the favor of the Democratic Party. Does this mean that Al Gore will become the next US President? Let us wait and see."

And in ""The Patriot"", Gibson's character and up-and-coming star Jason Isaacs provide an unparalleled balance in which it seems one almost sees a flicker of his former self (not pleasingly, either) in the other.  We have almost a pair of Jungian 'shadow' figures, and the film would have listed very badly on its proverbial side had there not been some such measure of balance.  For Isaacs we're talking nothing less than an Oscar-calibre performance, while Gibson himself may finally see his name opposite an Oscar nomination in an acting category.  The number of fine 'character' actors in this film is also impressive, and new stand-outs Heath Ledger and Lisa Brenner certainly deserve honourable mentions -- indeed, the latter may even find herself with a nomination as well.  Certainly the best picture of the summer, if not for the year (it's already got my vote!), and other kudos would not be surprising at all in the directorial, screen-writing, cinematography, editing, and yes, ""Best Picture"" categories.

","Perhaps not. Of course there are shallow parallels in the plot between the two films: man refuses to fight against the British - British kills members of man familiy - man gets pissed and kill a ton of Brits. It's apparent that Gibson will probably not be knighted for his acting/directing prowess anytime soon.<br/><br/>But there are emotional and cinematic diffences that just makes Braveheart the better movie. The battle scenes in braveheart were much more grander and richer in scale. They seemed realer, perhaps due to the lack of score during the bulk of the scenes in order to give it a more documentarian feel to it.<br/><br/>
Then there is character the Gibson played in this film compared to William Wallis. The Wallis character seem larger than life, an epic hero in an epic movie. The Benjamin Martin character is a more mortal character that did not have the emotional impact on me than Wallis.<br/><br/>Of course, this is probably done on purpose. Willis is based on a real life folk hero, while Martin is a character created in a general historical drama.<br/><br/>But if you however, do not obsess like I have on how similar or different The Patriot is to Braveheart, you will find that Patriot is a very satisfying film (not as satisfying as braveheaNONONO!!! must...stop...comparing!!...)<br/><br/>It's filled with outstanding chacters. Heath Ledger was awesome, and the chemistry between him and Gibson was so good that it seemed like they really did share the same genetic material. This role definitely redeemed him from the post brat-pack teen date movies (10 things I hate about you). Jason Isaacs plays the bad guy so well that people may want to punch him in the nose if they ever saw him in public.<br/><br/>The plot was innovated. The way they filled Gibson's band of militia with half idealists and half ruffnecks posed a general question in the film, do you fight with honor and dignity, or do you fight to win?<br/><br/>They even deal with slavery very well, with accuracy and some sense of hope. Being black, I saw when I first saw slaves in this film, I was thinking to myself ""I hope they don't drop the ball on this one."" But they don't. They showed what happened to slaves during the war, what side they were on, and what was promised to them on from both sides (colonial, British) when the war was over.<br/><br/>Of course, there are some parts that are corny, like quicky quotes ""It's a free country, or at least it will be"", and just scenes of blatant patriotic symbolism. But hey, its that type of movie that is suppose to make you feel good about America, so watch it and try to take in the idealism of it all, without having the reality of the complex, modern version of the country they are fighting so hard for."

Gibson's portrayal of late 18th century warfare is excellent, even if Gibson himself indulges in some near-silly heroics (i.e. the bulletproof warrior sort of thing).  The performances are quite good on all fronts, and several casting decisions were adventurous gambles that paid off. Production values were superb, and computer-assisted recreations of Charlestown S.C. and several battles were terrific.

The first is that it's about 20 minutes too long, with rather too long, at times, between the action (and don't give any of your 'it's an intellectual film' arguments). Secondly, most of the characters are painfully underdeveloped. Thirdly, and most importantly for me as an Englishman, it is a risibly one-sided look at a war which, like any other, had its heroes and its villains on both sides. I counted two, just two vaguely sympathetic characters on the side of King George. One dies in the first skirmish of the film; the other seems to be going along fine until he decides to set fire a church, slaughtering tens of women and children.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson is, as ever, excellent, as are several of his co-stars.

There's no doubt that the producers were inspired by Gibson's own BRAVEHEART - especially by the battle scenes. But unlike in BRAVEHEART the battle scenes here were not well made. The surround sound was great though, and the distant shots were OK. But the close-ups almost gave a head-ache. THE PATRIOT has quite a bunch of clichés: the English are portrayed as ruthless terrorists (like in BRAVEHEART), Gibson's character has an enemy (little !!SPOILER!! , although predictable), who he `will kill', etc. The filmmakers (politically correct) also show that they care about racism: (another little SPOILER) there's a slave who joins the war so he can get his freedom back and finally becomes a hero (By the way: Why only ONE slave...?). I don't know why I'm complaining about these things. I knew this movie would be like that. I expected THE PATRIOT  to be a `brain candy' movie, like BRAVEHEART or INDEPENDENCE DAY, but it wasn't even entertaining. It was more `brain crap' than `brain candy'!"
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","0","1","8 August 2000"," The Patriot truly was an epic film, but the effects of Hollywood were much more heavily felt than in the movie's 1995 counterpart, Braveheart.
","The Patriot is a beautifully made film. It has a very engaging story and it is very well acted and directed, but it was also heavily influenced by Hollywood. Normally, the effects of Hollywood are not inherently damaging to movies in general (although they rarely add to a film's cinematic value), but in the case of a period film like The Patriot, it is best to avoid the influences of Hollywood. <br/><br/>The first problem that is presented is the fact that a ""Hollywood Movie"" is NEVER compatible with real life. The real world is just not the same as the world that is presented in the movies, and the Patriot attempted to tell a bit of real history, the same way that Braveheart did. Even though the film was historically accurate to a certain extent, many of the battles were either blended together or completely fabricated, and the events that took place in those battles are, in many cases, clearly manipulated. I believe one of the ending scenes, involving Benjamin Martin (Gibson) and Charles Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson), provides a good example. <br/><br/>And Mel Gibson played EXACTLY the same role that he played in Braveheart!! He was the average guy who suffered an unimaginable loss to the sheer brutality of the 'enemy,' and decides to take it upon himself to take the enemy out. He is such a spectacular warrior that he is able to kill dozens of men single-handedly, and the enemy is so shocked that they think he is a ""ghost."" Wasn't that exact line in Braveheart somewhere? I have to admit that it was a lot of fun to watch those battle scenes, but the lack of originality is something that I absolutely have to complain about.<br/><br/>
Besides that, the film also attempted to address certain issues in history, but these attempts were clearly very weak. They wanted to address the slavery issue, so they had a slave in the movie who is fighting in order to earn his freedom, but winds up fighting alongside the other white soldiers even though the necessary time to earn his freedom has passed. This is a very noble thing to do, and it was very inspiring to watch, but then you realize that this was the only black man in the entire film. That is a very small effort to put towards addressing such an enormous issue, especially in American history. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the very end of the film (possible spoilers ahead), while uplifting and much easier to watch than the ending to Braveheart, was obviously meant to manipulate the audience's emotions. I don't like to have my emotions manipulated like that, even if it IS nice to see a ""happily ever after"" ending. Everything was finally coming together for everyone in the movie, including the solitary slave, who apparently found the perfect white man to spend his freedom working for. <br/><br/>It's ironic that when everything works out perfectly in a movie, it ends up being more disappointing than a film that has a tragic ending, like Braveheart did. I think that this is a pattern that can be seen most in war films, because the target audience for war films likes to see what really happened. They don't want a nice flowery ending, they don't want anything sugar coated to make it easier to watch, they want the history books acted out on film. This led to the success of films like Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, All Quiet on the Western Front, Full Metal Jacket, etc. When the facts are altered in any way, it immediately lessens the impact of the film. <br/><br/>Despite all of my complaints, I do acknowledge that The Patriot was an amazing film, and it was extremely well made, with even a bit of good comic relief included (comic relief is almost required in war films, in my opinion). It is something that should be watched by anyone who even remotely enjoys war films or even just period films. All that I have pointed out in this review are some of the things to be advised about before watching it."

","While watching the trailer of this film, one actor caught my attention, and looks there was no other films worth seeing than ""The Patriot"". so decided to see it. as Neither an american nor an English, I didn't much care about the Historical accuracy which is a very controversial issue on this board.<br/><br/> I was just entertained , never felt bored during the film and glad to see that actor that I found for the first time.  there were Humor, death, Love(?), revenge, tears...those are just kept me sat through the movie.<br/><br/>but it wasn't great. it has much potential to be a great movie, but failed. a big hiss and boo and laughs burst out from the audience included myself throughout the film, especially when Gabriel's wife gaves speech in church about what the patriotism is. then one by one stands and agreed to fight against Redcoat. the director wanted to emphasize the patriotism through this scene? it wasn't patriotism to me at all. looks people reluctantly agrees to fight for the honor.<br/><br/>and why Benjamin's youngest daughter hasn't spoken anything until her father decides goes to battle? that ""l'll say anything you want"" was the most corny, cliche scene that I've ever seen these days. that scene forced me to cry, actually I didn't want to at all.<br/><br/>The actor who caught my attention in this movie was Jason Isaacs who's play sadistic, vicious Col. William Tavington. if  his Col. might looked as one-dimension character, it's Script's fault, not the actor's. actually He plays the role perfectly. and also loved Tom Willkinson as General Conwallis.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 7"
"Alcaminhante","Null","0","1","7 August 2000"," The best COMEDY since South Park !
","Hilarious !<br/><br/>This might sound like a strange beginning to comment on this movie, but i can´t help it. And this comments might include some *Spoilers* ,but i can´t help that either.<br/><br/>And i say this because you can´t imagine how weird and funny was to be inside an almost sold out  movie theater , listening to comments all around. Normally this is a very annoying thing, but this time i have to admit that it was almost impossible not to joke while watching this movie, such was the amount of BULL@#%& present in the screenplay.<br/><br/>Everybody was laughing through out the movie, and i just want to point out some of the great comedy moments in this film that caused that reaction, (not by a particular order)... The patriotic scenes were hilarious ! That scene in the church when Mel Gibson´s son comes to recruit people for the militia and he delivers that ridiculous speech about country and honor must be one of the most funny moments in the entire movie, only surpassed by those moments with the american flag right at the end. That one when Mel Gibson downbeated finds the flag on the saddle and then decides to go and kick the cr@p out of everybody created some of the most funny comments on the audience i ever heard ! And then when he grabs the flag at the end and by himself turns the outcome of the battle around must be one of the worst and most funny moments, since the speech of the american president in INDEPENDENCE DAY. Curiousily by the same director...<br/><br/>What´s  wrong with this guy ?! Isn´t he supposed to be German ?! He must be one of the most americanized foreigners in the states since Arnie Swarzenneger !! Never since the ROCKY and RAMBO series, america had released such amount of funny ultra nationalistic crap. With THE PATRIOT , it looks like we´re back at the Ronald Reagan days, the president who loved Rambo !<br/><br/>And now all this wave of ultra nationalistic stuff is coming out of the work of a German guy ? And worst of all, this time all this propaganda comes out disguised under a poltically correct cover of more human heroes. Hey, at least Rambo and Rocky claimed immediately that america was the best country in the world. Rolland Emerich movies don´t even have the guts to do that, which makes them even more funny.<br/><br/>Anyway, another great comedy moment was the one, when the racist gets saved by the black man. Wow, nobody expected that ! :-) After that some people next to me, comment that if the movie wasn´t such a comedy, they would have gone ! Ok, Roland Emerich is the most cliché guy ever to set foot on Hollywood, but, come on, there are limits !!  And i thought ID4 was bad ! At least ID4 didn´t tryied to be nothing more than just a great popcorn nationalistic movie. THE PATRIOT has such pretentions of being an Historical fresco that it gets exactly the opposite effect. THE PATRIOT has such an amount of clichés, that sometimes it get almost unbearable to keep following this movie. Such amount of clichés that we would need another text like this just to make fun of them.<br/><br/>And i´m not even complaining about the English depiction in this movie. It´s of course totally historically unfair, because there are bad and good people everywhere. Altough the english can´t complain much about the cruelty depicted on this movie, because it´s not that farfetched compared to what they did during their British Empire days. It´s not because of this THE PARIOT is a bad movie. It´s because the way the elements are balanced. We never know ,if this is an adventure movie, an Historical, an Epic drama, a propaganda film, or just an action movie. That and the amount of stupid clichés is what sinks it.<br/><br/>If it wasn´t for Mel Gibson and a few other secondary actors, this movie would be totaly unberable. They and the technical stuff  saves THE PATRIOT.  Great design, photography and cute special effects.<br/><br/>Once again Rolland Emerich delivers another great ""Turkey"". Fun, but totaly empty and ridiculous. Rolland Emerich, has confirmed himself, as some kind of king of ""B"" and ""Z"" movies, but within the ""A"" league. Pretty weird....<br/><br/>Anyway, go and see it, and have a few or a lot of laughs, which if you don´t live in America , i can guarantee that you will find this movie extremely funny. And there are still people who believe this is a very realistic historical movie...man... :-)"
"theirongiant","6","0","1","7 August 2000"," The Patriot - so close
","Going in, I didn't expect much of the Patriot.  This is usually how I approach films.  I think I was better off having done that in this particular instance.  Don't get me wrong.  The Patriot is really not bad at all.  But it lacks any real oomph.  There are a couple of cheap shots, IMHO, that just want to get an audience reaction.  On top of that, there are some characters who seem either too forced into the film or too cliched.  Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger are awfully good, as is Chris Cooper, but the above elements, combined with some odd plot elements and a weak score from John Williams make me hesitate to recommend the film to everyone.  If you are a war buff or this movie comes to your local second-run theater, check it out. Otherwise, don't be in a hurry, unless you want to see some great cinematography for about 3 hours."

I think the filmmakers covered all bases on this movie including every war cliche and one-liner possible.  Great movie, poor film."

He showed things that Nazis have done in 2nd World War. We all have to learn from history. I am sorry for England, which is a great country, I ve got a lot of respect to every country in world. And I think we should show the truth of the history. May be some things happened which were shown in the movie.

","The movie actually was very good. It had humor, action and outstanding acting. Mel Gibson plays his role with a lot of dedication and honesty. Jason Isaacs plays a great villain. The story was great and had everything a good War Movie needs. Saving Private Ryan  has a simple storyline but was compared to masterpieces like Apocalypse Now to name one. Now to the brits and their hurt feelings: It is a fact that the british were a sadistic and violent entity on this planet. Murdering thousands of people only to maintain their force. That's a fact. In Saving Private Ryan all germans were depicted as violent and gruesome.Don't get me wrong the Nazis were scum and belong to hell but when it comes to quantity the british killed more than the germans ever did. But this has been forgotten by historians. They look back in time for about 60 years(2nd World War) but when you look back in history of violence about 1500 years before our time you would see that the world biggest murderer were the british. The germans are not the only ones to be ashamed. Be honest to yourselves and be ashamed too, britains."

","The trouble with this movie is that it has been directed by a non-US director who exaggeratedly tries to chum up with Americans in order to make big money. Hopefully, he will not earn other credit than that. The movie lacks historical precision and puts the English in an almost Nazi-like role. Well, I know how it feels like to watch expensive movies which draw a black-and-white picture, where all your ancestors are on the black side. Still, the first one and a half hours are mostly entertaining and have some fairly enjoyable scenes, which even seem to stick to historical detail. But the end of the movie could have been placed at least half an hour earlier, for every bit of the story was very clear after the first hour of the film. I give some points for the juicy gore effects, but after all only 5/10 in total."

Even though one or two aspects of the movie were not exactly true (such as the exploding cannonballs), I believe it all had a purpose. Whether it was to bring more excitement during the great battle scenes or to show that these old wars that didn't involve guns  and artillery were still as deadly as our more modern wars. Humour accompanies you throughout the film that ranges from cracking jokes about the French, or how Benjamin Martin (Gibson) plays along the British. A twist near the end of the movie shows just how much thought Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan) put into his script.

Worst of all, once the movie reached a climax very early on, it couldn't get down anymore, it went on and on without giving you time to breathe.<br/><br/>At some point then, somebody seemed to have realized that the movie should have an end.

","THE PATRIOT is an excellent movie with attention to historical detail in terms of dress, interiors, and modes of speaking. In terms of actual history, however, Hollywood has revised history to suit their script. For instance, the great battle at the end of the movie was supposed to be based on the Battle of Cowpens, but General Cornwallis was not at Cowpens. Banastre Tarleton was in charge of the British troops at Cowpens. Secondly, there was no ruined plantation mansion at Cowpens because it was literally an open range ""cow pens,"" hence the name ""Cowpens."" Mel Gibson's character was supposed to be based on Francis Marion (the Swamp Fox), but again various liberties have been taken. The character of Tarington is based on Banastre Tarleton (a.k. The Butcher), but again another fictional character. Tarleton's Legion actually wore green uniforms with red trim. The King's Own Dragoons wore red uniforms with white trim. The attention to historical detail was great, but again various liberties were taken for the sake of Hollywood revisionism.

","Accuracy should not be an issue with a work of art.  Who talks of the ""accuracy"" of a poem, whether it's by Keats or Homer?  And The Patriot is a magnificent work of art.  And judging by the early reviews, like most art, it is both polarizing and misunderstood.  Of course the English hate it. But what of their great WW11 movies, of which there are many (e.g., the many starring Jack Hawkins) that capture the spirit of the war beautifully, and portray the Germans one-dimensionally, but ""accurately"" (understandably so) from the English perspective?  Movies aren't documentaries, they're tales. The best transcend facts, which are most dishonest, and get at the essence beneath.  The Patriot is from the heart and soul, not the head. And it is true.  Read Barzun regarding imperialism.  Many could reach for the crown of imperialist over the last 500 years, but the English would take it.  Hands down.  All over the globe.  Has anyone met a true aristocrat?  I have, and they deeply believe their bulls**t. It's about superiority in the blood, it's not about superiority through annoying things like achievement or elections. The English crown treated the colonies, once at war, as they would Indians (in India), the Chinese, the Irish, and so on.  Cornwallis was captured perfectly. Brilliant, ruthless...actually the portrait was too kind.  Gibson is unique. He doesn't care about the boxoffice in England. He picks material that goes against the Hollywood multicultural grain. Cruise, Cage, Carey, and every other major male and female star chooses the most cynical crap possible. They're putting TV shows on the screen (at best), Mel Gibson brings novels to life.  Novel meaning a story, with characters, with values, all in conflict, riveting our attention.  I give Gibson all of the credit because we all know the movie wouldn't/couldn't be made without him. And what a compliment to America, and what a debt of gratitude all Americans owe him!  For this citizen of Australia to put so much of his life, his passion into the most patriotic American movie ever made, is a remarkable act of generosity.  This is one American who says, ""Thank you""."

","This movie is so good.  I have rarely been as impacted by the SECOND viewing of a movie.  It is very encouraging to see liberal Hollywood come out with a big budget, major star picture that treats the American Revolutionary War as something that we should be proud of.  Not only that, but this movie also upholds family, praying, repenting of sins, saving sex for marriage, personal sacrifice, fighting for freedom and what is morally right, and actually gives a positive and admirable portrayal of a pastor/minister! Wow!<br/><br/>The one thing I would warn parents with young children of is that there are a number of very realistic battle scenes.  Even here, though, it is not gratuitous violence, but shows the horror of war.  The realism both detracts from war, and hilights even further the heroism, courage, and selflessness of the heroes (similar to Saving Private Ryan).<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunning in this movie, with spectacular scenes and settings.  Gibson gives probably his best acting performance yet.  Also, newcomer Heath Ledger may be the latest teen heart throb to come down the pike, but this one can actually act!<br/><br/>I hope this movie is nominated for oscars in cinematography, costume design, best actor (for Gibson), supporting acting (for any number of people), and of course, best picture.<br/><br/><ul><li>MINOR SPOILER COMING UP -</li></ul><br/><br/>My only complaint with The Patriot is a minor, but confusing, one.  There are two different British officers who look remarkably alike, and both I and the people I've seen this with did not realize that they were different characters until a scene near the end that they are both in.  Honestly, if someone involved in the making of the film were to reveal that it is the same actor, made to appear as two separate ones in this climactic scene, either as a practical joke or for some symbolic reason, I would not be surprised.

","Always ready to watch a war film on a Sunday morning, this film has some great, stirring battle scenes (especially those cannon balls!). While many have criticised the flag waving routine (It's a staple of US cinema) and the portrayal of the the English, I must say what really made this film work is the bad guys! Mel and Heath did admirable jobs as good men fighting for their principles but on the other hand, the swarthy behaviour of the English is particularly memorable (They even ham it up for good measure...but not too much) and as a result, their performances are a lot more enjoyable than the good guys (Just like the North Vietnamese colonel in Missing in Action 2). Remember...It's sometimes the 'bad' guys who make the film work! Also, its interesting to note how war tactics have changed since the 1700's - men standing in formation marching to get into range, men crouching down to MANUALLY LOAD their weapons, men getting shot in the nuts, fierce hand to hand combat, flags waving...ah, those were the days."

No ""pop culture"" jargon thrown in to appease the kids. And no gratuitous sex!!!!!!!!!  I loved it .

","I found the Patriot to be a very exciting and moving film...I'm sure it will be passed over at Oscar time because of its similarity to Braveheart, and because it celebrates America (how dare we feel proud of our heritage?) I've noticed that the real bitterness towards this film comes from people who feel that it is revisionist history. As an American, I realize that the winners of the wars almost always skew the facts and figures in their favor (this includes the English, the French, the Germans...it is not merely an American fault). I'm not going to say that if you hate this film you're in the wrong because you're not patriotic, or un-American, but please have some respect for both sides of this great conflict. The British were by no means villains (perhaps King George was a bit of a jerk) but soldiers are by and large innocents in any war, fighting for causes that sometimes they don't even understand. It's strange that some of the viewers (at least I think they actually saw the movie) say the British were depicted as villains. Wrong. The scriptwriter, if anything, went out of his way to show that nearly every English soldier in the film were honorable and unwilling to commit atrocities...there was ONE villain, and he was viewed by his own allies as unstable and cruel. One final thought...there can be no accurate telling of any war in the end, and least not one with emotion. Both sides will always feel they were in the right, both sides will always want to tell their tale and deny all others. If England (or Canada, for that matter) wants to take a shot at filming the Revolutionary War in a ""realistic"" fashion (bearing in mind that they could not simply turn the tables and depict English soldiers as heroes and the colonists as monsters), they're welcome to try. I think that the English are just extremely bitter souls right now...think of everything they lost over the last 400 years...I'd probably be bitter too."

","The Patriot has been described, rather prematurely, as an american Braveheart.  While The Patriot is nothing like Braveheart, it is still far from the greatness of that movie.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie, just flawed in two very annoying story elements.  The first is death. I won't say who dies, but there are a lot of key characters killed off.  So many, in fact, that I stopped caring after a while.  The other problem is the biggie.  The filmmakers, apparantly, couldn't figure out what type of movie they wanted to make.  There are revenge movies, like Gladiator.  There are movies about wars, like Saving Private Ryan.  The Patriot seems to want to be both of these movies at the same time.  The lead character vows revenge on a british soldier.  This is a movie on its own.  However, they try to place american history in very inconvenient places.  I couldn't figure out if the movie was made to show Mel Gibson's character, or to give an insight into the American Revolution.<br/><br/>The Patriot isn't that bad though, and it has its strong points.  Mel Gibson gives another stunning performance as our hero.  He seems to posses the same drive that allowed him to play William Wallace.  Heath Ledger shows that he is ready for the spotlight with his role as the rebellious son.  Jason Isaacs is one of the best villains in a year with all kinds of great villains, such as Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator, and the storm in The Perfect Storm.  The Patriot is a three star movie, which is too bad.  It had some great potential."

","This film was, as many have commented, beautifully executed in cinematography, score, lighting, and concept, and grandeur of scope.  The scope of the scenes was incredible - master filmmaking at its best.  I was never quite drawn in, though, by Mel Gibson's character.  I didn't quite see the depth of emotion one might expect from the terribly traumatic events that eventually lead him to join the battle, nor from the even more horrific events that follow.  I *almost* got there a couple of times, just as Gibson almost did, but never quite made it.<br/><br/>More importantly, though, I was distanced from being immersed in the film by the negative slant on even the most heroic of the characters.  Benjamin Martin (Gibson) seemed motivated not by patriotism but by revenge, and the glimpse of the depth of his violence in killing and then continuing to rage at and maim the victim left me feeling sick (as it did him and his boys). Others were motivated by financial gain, others by power; I was sort of hard-pressed to find the character mentioned in the title:  the Patriot. Maybe the title was meant to be ironic; maybe the director wanted to make the statement that our history is not as glorious as one has been led to believe (true, of course, but still...).  Or maybe the goal was simply to show war so close up (like Saving Private Ryan did) that it will finally sicken and offend enough people to say ""Never again"".  *That* part worked for me: I could barely watch many of the battle scenes, and was sort of offended after all that by the way the music swelled gloriously at the climactic final battle; I almost think that should have been done without any music...<br/><br/>So -- a grand film, but ultimately, for me, a film that left me a little sick."

","It's a fine line, in film, between a scene with emotional truth and a scene set up to manipulate your emotions.  Sometimes the camera holds a little too long on a crying man's expression of grief or the musical score is a bit heavy handed.<br/><br/>One wouldn't suppose that the director of Independence Day, Roland Emmerich, could handle the subtle balance between a serious drama and a story with graphic sweeping battle scenes.  He does.  The Patriot keeps you guessing. Often as not, the story will seem to lead in an obvious direction and then it veers off and does the unexpected.<br/><br/>This is grand Hollywood film making that doesn't shy away with showing the carnage of battle, in both large clashes in open fields and small skirmishes, but it also touches on men and their families and a central conflict between a good man and an evil man.  Much of the film's emotional weight is carried by Mel Gibson.  There are a couple of scenes that would make even a hard boiled cynic weep.<br/><br/>I must admit that I was concerned by the prerelease trailer showing Mel carrying a  flag into battle.  It seemed an easy way to manipulate the heartstrings of any good American.  His use of the flag, in the film, is actually far more personal and dynamic than one would expect.<br/><br/>This is an action movie that isn't predictable and a drama that will please the serious filmgoer."

","THE PATRIOT is set in Colonial South Carolina. My husband was born in Rock Hill, my grandparents lived in Chester and I have traveled extensively in the Pee Dee/Low Country of the state; therefore I recognized quite a bit of the scenery. The film messes with history (still, as co-author of a historic textbook, I knew more or less who the characters were supposed to be), but it is a compelling story. And Mel Gibson is outstanding in his portrayal of a tormented man driven to extreme means to defend his family.<br/><br/>
That said ... I knew ahead of time THE PATRIOT contained violent battle scenes and other rather unsavory (often sadistic) bits of business. I didn't realize, however, that I was going to spend half the movie with my hands over my eyes. Particularly disturbing to me was a suicide scene that lasted perhaps a second, but made me hyperventilate (I lost a friend to suicide a few years ago). One might say that since war is hell, the violence is not gratuitous. Maybe not, but gore is gore, and there's quite enough of it. THE PATRIOT is a good movie, but I would not recommend it for anyone who finds violence unnerving."

I may have gone into this film a little jaded because of my dislike of the director's (Roland Emmerich) previous works.  (Godzilla, Universal Soldier and Independence Day)  But there is no denying how bad this movie is.  The fight scenes are poorly shot.  Too busy, emphasis on the wrong elements of the screen, unbalanced.  It might have been better if Roland just let Mel direct those scenes for him.  The dialog is a drain mentally and physically.  The scene where Heath Ledger's character (Gabriel) goes to recruit militia and his girlfriend gives a speech on patriotism is a joke. It is laughable.  The dialog between Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) and his men is horrible, almost like it tries to make every sentence a catch phrase. There were tons of other things that aided in this movie being absolutely rotten.  First, the scene where he hacks the Brit for a good 2 minutes. Pointless.  Why was that necessary?  I think we got the point after he killed 15 other guys.  Second, the guys were able to hit soldiers from 50 yards away while riding horses with muskets.  Ridiculous.  Third, Mel is able to save his family from being killed by showing up at the right time with all his men, but nobody else can be saved.  Silly.  Fourth, his 6 year old daughter doesn't speak to anyone, she starts talking eventually and expresses a hate for her father that is unfounded and unexplained.  Dumb.

Mel Gibson presented us with the image of a war-hero who wished that he could undo the past. Unlike the other zealots at the town meeting, he alone saw the dangers of fighting a revolutionary war, and the high prices that the innocents would pay. Yet even his character could not foresee the terrors that his own family would face, and the dear consequenes of undertaking such an endeavor. This film is a testament to the human spirit, a force of reckoning for revolutionaries anywhere. It is such a contrast to learn about the American Revolution in a history class and then to see it reenacted onscreen, with bayonets slicing, tomahawks flying and cannonballs wreaking horrific havoc upon the enemy. Yet what is most moving is the devotion that these soldiers had to their families. Never mind the societal taboo that men cannot cry, for these men cared deeply for their families.

Maybe if they portrayed Benjamin Martin masturbating in the shower more viewers would consider this to be an excellent movie?  Nonetheless, it was an excellent movie in many ways and worthy of being seen by every US patriot out there. Some of the comments I've read would indicate the movie touched a nerve with the British. Well, hurray!!! The Imperialistic British empire of that era deserves every bit of it.   Some of the strong points of the movie were the excellent performances by some relatively unknown actors like Heath Ledger and Jason Isaacs. I didn't find the movie to be overly melodramatic. I wasn't moved to tears in any parts, mostly I felt anger and outrage. The portrayal of brutality and loss of life and property were very real. Some of the comments I've read would indicate that they think this movie was about a totally fictional period of world history.

","I'm genuinely surprised at the number of people who didn't like this film. I didn't find it too sappy (definitely not nearly as the better rated Frequency) and there were far less historical inaccuracies in this than in other recent films - notably Gladiator and U-571.<br/><br/>The story was well done and the cast was extremely strong - there were good performances all throughout this movie.  It was also an interesting tale set against the backdrop of the American Revolution.  The film had a lot to do with revenge but in the end if you pay attention ""the cause"" is what comes through.  <br/><br/>One of the many things I liked about the film was that the main character was definitely a flawed hero - he could be as cruel as his enemies and he was weak enough to exact his vengeance.  To me, that showed he was human. Mel Gibson portrays his hero with great depth and makes him real - this was definitely his film.<br/><br/>The film touches on a lot of real issues in the Revolutionary war.  One of which is that there were a number of ""Loyalists"" among the colonists and that there was a great deal of in-fighting amongst them and the patriots. There was cruelty - on both sides.  However, it is not inaccurate to show one mad British officer conducting acts of brutality. This did not reflect on the entire British army or the British people - it just reflected one sick individual. I don't blame the British for being genuinely annoyed at such inaccuracies in U-571 where their accomplishments were ignored and history was distorted.  But I don't think they should have as much issue with the Patriot if you look at the history of this war and yes, it is told from the American point of view.  <br/><br/>The issue of slavery was not touched upon much here but then again the revolutionary war was not primarily about this issue.  African Americans were never granted their freedom by Brits and in many cases inhumanely treated. The film does show some of this cruelty and prejudice on both sides.  An infamous example is that the British often infected them with small pox that would then spread among the colonists.  This is a real, historical fact - The Brits would be REALLY up in arms if that had been portrayed.<br/><br/>This film is worthwhile to see if you enjoy good epic stories with excellent acting."

","There is no doubting the impressive production values of this re-creation of the American War of Independence. Filmed on location in South Carolina, some 400 enthusiasts of the period helped to portray faithfully the clothing, the weaponry and the tactics of this epic conflict. There are some exciting fight sequences and some impressive battle scenes and the direction, photography and sound are all superlative, so some credit should go to German director Roland Emmerich who has previously given us `Independence Day' and `Godzilla'.<br/><br/>Yet, however entertaining the movie, it is irredeemably flawed by its appalling travesty of history and I simply cannot imagine how the Smithsonian Institution could allow itself to be credited as historical consultants. I saw the film with a good American friend and it is difficult to say which of us found the narrative more risible and offensive.  The British regulars are represented as proto-Nazis and there is simply no evidence to justify the infamous church-burning scene that seems to be a crude attempt to wipe out the memory of the American butchery at My Lai. Although Americans supported slavery for four decades after the British abolished it, here blacks are shown as free and happy.<br/><br/>
As the eponymous settler and family man Benjamin Martin, Mel Gibson once more plays a hero of mythic qualities  at times he is referred to as a ghost  most notably in a tomahawk-wheeling scene taken straight from `The Last Of The Mohicans'. As in `Braveheart', he turns the course of battle with a speech that few could have heard and still fewer would have heeded and this time his literal flag-waving apparently becomes a pivotal point in American history. The whole thing is laden with cliches from the traumatised girl who will not speak to the dogs who switch their affections to the good guy. At the end of the 2 hours 41 minutes, you will be none the wiser about why the Americans fought for  independence and how they won the war and this inability  or unwillingness  to come to terms with history has serious implications for the present. ."

The only thing that keeps it together is Mel Gibson.  The fight scenes either showed too little gore and looked fake, or showed too much and were disgustingly repulsive.

","Let's get something straight.  When someone makes a movie similar to another movie with the same type of plot and the same actor, there are bound to be comparisons between the films.<br/><br/>""The Patriot"" almost too well puts Mel back into ""Braveheart""'s freedom fighter, William Wallace -- except sending the hero forward into time to the American Revolution.  Yet, the film bares a similar theme:  normal, everyday man gets his life ripped apart by tyranny of war -- and has to fight.  No problem, though.  <br/><br/>What bothers me about ""The Patriot"" is that director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, Stargate) seems jarred by Robert Rodat's (Saving Private Ryan) script; or is it the other way around?  Many scenes either seem paced, or seem cut to raw bone plot.   Characterization is largely disregarded -- save for its heavy concentration on Mel's character, ""Benjamin Martin."" <br/><br/>
Furthermore, the English seem to be cast as ""the bad guys,"" which, to me, seems passe.   Enemies they are, but they aren't inhuman entities!   We are never given a clear reason why our infamous Bad Guy Brit, Col. Tavington is clearly psychotic, going beyond being a millitary opportunist, even endangering his own career infront of General Cornwallis for the thrill of being brutal.<br/><br/>Thrown into the script are random scenes of emotionally manipulative drivel, which are totally unnecessary, blurring the focus of the film.  <br/><br/>
I would like to say it would have been better if Mel had more to do with the technical side of the film, but I cannot even give the film that honor.

They are portrayed as evil sinister men who care more about killing innocents and committing massacres than actually fighting the war. One more than one occasion the director and writer seem to be trying to associate Nazi war crimes in France with the 18th century British Redcoats. One scene where hundreds of civilians are burned inside actually bears an eerie resemblance to an act carried out by the Waffen SS in the small French village of Oradour sur Glane where 600 civilians were locked up in a monastery which was then burned down. One must start to wonder if the director Roland Emmerich (who by the way is German) has some ulterior motive.

It's just another mediocre, dumb action movie posing as an important film showing what our forefathers supposedly went through for freedom. Why it's holding everyone's interest is beyond me. I was very bored watching it, because I'd seen it all before in BRAVEHEART and ROB ROY, except it was done better then. But what would you expect from the director of INDEPENDENCE DAY, another stupid film that made lots of money by using every cliche in the book to pander to the lowest common denominator of an audience!<br/><br/>(BEWARE: SPOILER) For instance, when the oldest son supposedly killed the sadistic British colonel. C'mon, you knew the colonel wasn't dead because the cliched script dictates that he has to have a final showdown with Mel Gibson's character. For some reason, the director thinks he can surprise us, so he shoots the part where the son goes to make sure the colonel's dead in slooooowwwwww motion (an unimaginative way to convey suspense). And right at the last second, the evil colonel quickly turns around and kills the son with his sword. What nonsense! This son has shown that he is a cunning fighter. Why does he turn stupid all of a sudden and take his time (using a mere dagger yet!) to finish off this skilled opponent? The answer is that the director treats his audience like morons, knowing that they don't want to have to think -- they just want to be entertained. (Today's audience thinks `entertainment' is synonymous with `turning your brains off for a couple hours.')<br/><br/>Then there's the cue card factor brilliantly contributed by `vdasher' in an earlier review. He is right on target and I urge you to read and reread his viewpoints from July 10, 2000. I can add nothing more to them.<br/><br/>I don't mind the fact that people enjoy vapid crap like THE PATRIOT. I mainly criticize the idea that it belongs in the top 250 films of all time. It's not. And anyone who says it does is obviously very young and has no sense of film history and what riches the truly great films can offer."

Although a glamorized version of a certain part of the revolutionary war(to much the same degree as the history in Braveheart), it still rings true with the most important elements, and creates an interesting look into how this nation was forged. You see the blood and mettle and metal in the battlefield.  It does contain some disturbingly violent scenes, but no more than expected for this film.<br/><br/>The one weakness is that too much rides on Mel Gibson's character, but the film makers also seem to have realized that and alter the movie enough to make it unique and enjoyable."

","I have heard much of how this movie was either hated or loved. Those who disliked it state their arguments firmly.<br/><br/>My turn.<br/><br/>This movie was not about the Revolutionary War-- it's about the strength of family amongst a background of war. Every human emotion is displayed. The human spirit soars in this picture. As for everyone complaining about historical inaccuracies, this picture is a piece of art, of entertainment, not an educational tool. (I did observe, however, that ""The Patriot"" contained the smallest detail in that the British never use the term ""aim"", as the Americans do, which is historically accurate. So I would not discredit this movie for being flawed. The movie-makers for this one knew what they were doing.)<br/><br/>But while everyone else is picking out imperfections, look for its strong points: direction-10, music-10, acting-10, special effects-10, and the story, most of all-11.<br/><br/>(!!!---Mild Spoiler---!!!) This is a story from the eyes of an American, a patriot named Benjamin Martin. In his eyes, blacks are treated fairly, as depicted in the film. War is brutal, as depicted. The British are character-less walking killing machines, as depicted. So don't look at the larger picture, see it through Mel's eyes! See the war as we would if we were living there in South Carolina at the time.<br/><br/>(!!!---If you haven't seen this movie, read no more, this is the SPOILER OF SPOILERS---!!!)Another uncomfortable grudge that we hold against the film is that Heath Ledger's character is killed.  But he had to die. He fought to keep a cause alive; he never once fought for himself. Benjamin Martin, as pacifist as he was, could very well have forgiven the British for killing Thomas, his second son. (Since he is not William Wallace this time, he wouldn't need to hack down 1000 Englishmen and invade a country to get revenge.) The writer killed Martin's first son (Ledger) to keep that burning hate for the British alive on the part of the audience and for Martin. Any exaggerated passions that the movie displays is because our very own patriot saw it that way.<br/><br/>All in all, I believe this is the best movie I've seen in a long while, much better than some think. This movie is as brutal as it is so that we as Americans, can stop taking what we have for granted and see what we had to do in order to earn our status as the best country in the world. Every American should see this picture.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich, Mel Gibson, and Heath Ledger--Oscar wishes to you all."

","May Contain a Spoiler<br/><br/>This movie was unbelievable. (While not necessarily a spoiler, this review reveals details of the movie.) How many more cliches could the director have used? The only way the movie could have been cheesier was if the black man had learned to read by the end of the movie. Even the dogs who somehow instantly bonded with Mel survived to the end of the war. And was hat a baby in Charlotte's arms at the end? Please!<br/><br/>There is no redeeming value in this movie. The director ripped off the best parts of ""Rob Roy"" and ""Last of the Mohicans"" (some scenes are exact copies) all for the glory of Mel. The movie doesn't tug at your heart strings; it holds up cue cards that say, ""OK, feel patriotism now. OK, now righteous anger.

","There are a few things that really dragged this movie down, and really kept it from being a very very good movie. First, there were too many melodramatic scenes. I know this was a movie about war, and of course there would be many emotionally gripping parts, but I think they were terribly overdone to the point of being silly.<br/><br/>But maybe the overly-dramatic scenes seemed that way because they have been done in other films (especially Mel Gibson movies) over and over again. The first thing that pops in my mind is the standard ""Nooooo!"" in slow-motion as someone is diving -too late- towards someone as they are being shot, stabbed, etc. Also the ""family man is reluctantly dragged into war, and, against all odds, winds up leading a rag-tag army to victory over the British"" is quite unoriginal now that ""Braveheart"" has been around for a while and also with the new arrival of ""Gladiator"", although there were no English 'bad guys' in that one.<br/><br/>Also, I think the love scene with the Aunt was superfluous to the plot and was quite frankly very boring.<br/><br/>But the rest of the film was good. I was impressed with the sense of realty in some of the war scenes. It was very gut-wrenching and believable.<br/><br/>In all, I believe it deserved a 6 out of 10 - above average, but only slightly so."

Mel Gibson is obviously trying hard to tell the masses, to wake up and pull your head out of the sand.  What Braveheart meant to the Scots, surely The Patriot will mean to Americans. We in this country should take time to realize the loss and sacrifice given by those who risked all they had, to create a freedom for those who follow.  This movie is overdue. Whether the oppressor is the king, the international bankers, or the thugs in the light blue beenies, there will always be a struggle against tyranny.

","The Patriot: What a bomb, waste, debacle whatever you want to call it. Of course all ""patriots"" were pacifist traumatized into becoming freedom fighters, lived in huge homes, with large farms, were heroes of major battles, had two sons brutally killed by British war mongering louts, had temporarily autistic daughters ultimately reconciled with him through the perils of of war, fell in love with their beautiful sister-in-law, and yes of course,met their arch enemy on the battlefield to extract the ultimate revenge. What a crock! After making a great movie about a Scottish Patriot, you think Mel could have had the foresight to perceive this for the bomb and distortion it is. What a waste of an opportunity to tell the story of the true ""Patriots"" of the War for Independence, the ordinary folk, the likes of whom we in passing saw in this movie, standing in the lines taking the musket balls, leaving their families behind to fend for themselves(and not in cozy southern mansions),struggling with starvation, weather, and their own doubts about their cause.     the ordinary folk who fought for the cause of liberty to protect an ideal, not the landed gentry portrayed by Mel who, while fighting for ""freedom"", also had their own self interest at heart; after all, you don't think Mel wanted to be taxed any more than he was already on all that wealth or, heaven forbide lose it to some Tory. A movie about the ordinary folk who gave their all for an ideal would have been so much better. As portrayed, this movie is an insult to our forefathers and to our intelligence.

I was actually pleased. Very pleased as a matter of fact. But there were some disappointments as I always do.

It was very good. But not brilliant. See, this is where I draw the line between brilliance and entertainment. Was this a film which brilliant idea was behind it? Such films as BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, THIN RED LINE, or ANY Stanley Kubrick films? NOPE. BUT was it one of the most entertaining movie I have seen in a long time? Yep.<br/><br/>The movie was engaging, packed with emotion, action, and nice acting. Also, very nice and interesting photography work where scenes where painted with RED, WHITE, and BLUE colors. And I got goosebumps when that American flag was being waved by the rebel soldiers fighting for their freedom. I almost cried too. But then again, it wasn't what I'd call a brilliant epic which deserves an oscar for best picture. It was a good movie, but nothing more. Kind of like TITANIC, which was a very good movie, but not a brilliant film.<br/><br/>So let me wrap up my point here. Was it Brilliant? NOPE. Was it entertaining? HELL YEH!

I understand and agree that to achieve great drama, films often need to portray history inaccurately but care must be taken. It seems to me that this film could not have been made if our education system was at all competent and confirms for me that our country is in dire need of major improvements. This movie is just another example giving evidence of how poorly most of us have been taught by our school systems. Isn't it interesting that Hollywood can not find a way to make a truly great film of this singularly most important part of our history. Calling Mr. Spielberg.<br/><br/>Just for the record. I happen to be a fan of Mel Gibson and have always enjoyed his performances and he does a fine job in this film. It is the script and its message that is troubling. For example, we not only confuse the meaning of the Holocaust when we displace it in time, peoples, and location but we falsely attribute this horrific event and that is just wrong."

"Brogan","Null","0","2","5 July 2000"," Finally a good Revolutionary War film!
","For the Fourth of July spirit, there is a film out that will show on what the rebels of the United States had to go through to gain their freedom, the film is called THE PATRIOT. When I first heard about this film, I was very skeptic. First, I heard that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin were working on this film, I said, ""oh boy, another dud.""  I thought STARGATE was so-so, INDEPENDENCE DAY was silly, and GODZILLA was awful, so what would they do with the American Revolution?  Then I saw that mel Gibson was involved, and not since FOREVER YOUNG, have I seen a bad Mel Gibson movie, then again, I forgot about LETHAL WEAPON 4. THE PATRIOT is set in the year 1776, in South Carolina.  Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) a former soldier during the French/Indian War who is now a plantation owner, and a father of seven.  He is a widower, his wife passed away a few years eariler, and he spends his time doing woodwork in his barn.  It isn't until a town meeting is called that the other Americans decide on should they go into war to fight the English for their freedom or not.  Martin, doesn't want to see anymore bloodshed, he would rather see more negotiations be made, until they come to an agreement. But Martin is outvoted, but what really upsets Martin is that his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) enlists in the military to fight the English soldiers.  Martin, being a good soul, decides to take care of all of the wounded soldiers, no matter who's side they are on.  Col. William Tavington (a very sadistic Jason Isaacs) arrives and orders the wounded redcoats to be taken to a English camp, kill the wounded rebels, arrest Gabriel and taken to camp to be hung, steal the black plantation workers who work for Martin to fight for the English, and burn down the Martin house.  Talk about villainy! Martin then decides that enough is enough, with Gabriel and a group of miliants that he leds, they set out to fight the English to gain their freedom.  But before you will yell, ""BRAVEHEART!"" there are some differences in this film. First, there is Gibson's character of Martin, who would rather see the differences come to a peaceful end without raising a rifle.  And Martin goes to fight, it's not only for freedom, but for revenge.  Second, unlike William Wallace, Martin is a father, and is caring more for his family, than for the country.  And the battle scenes are different.  They are not as bloody as BRAVEHEART, or as pumped up as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but they do stand on it's own.  What GLORY did for the Civil War, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did for World War II, and FULL METAL JACKET did for Vietnam, PATRIOT does for the Revolutionary War. The acting in this film is also very good.  I did enjoy Heath Ledger who plays the rebellious son who wants to fight for freedom.  And I also enjoyed Tcheky Karyo as the French officer and Tom Wilkinson as English General Cornwallis.  But the best acting credit goes to three actors. First there's Chris Cooper, a actor that I always enjoy watching.  Ever since LONE STAR, I've followed this actor's career.  From A TIME TO KILL to THE HORSE WHISPERER to OCTOBER SKY and AMERICAN BEAUTY to the recent ME, MYSELF, & IRENE, Cooper has always make a film worthwhile.  And in THE PATRIOT he gives a great performance as American Col. Harry Burwell, a fellow soldier who fought in the French/Indian War with Martin.  Then there's Jason Isaacs, the most coldest villian since Doug Hutchinson's role of ""Percy Wetmore"" in THE GREEN MILE.  You'll hate Isaacs character of Col. Tavington so much that you would like to kill him yourself. And for that, I applaud his performance, like Richard in RICHARD III, he is indeed cold-hearted and cruel.  And Mel Gibson also does a very good performance of the father who cares for his children and is emotional throughout the bloody war that takes a toll on his neighbors and family. It's too bad that THE PATRIOT is very bloody, otherwise it would have been a great film to show for schools.  I know it's not historical accurate, but with the environment, the setting, and the historical characters in the film, it does give a entertaining look at the war for America's independence.  But if I was a father, I would rather take my child to THE PATRIOT than to ME, MYSELF, & IRENE, SHAFT, or THE MATRIX.  PATRIOT is just as bloody or gross as those films, but it is historical and who said that war was pretty? But all and all, I recommend THE PATRIOT for a entertaining film. Yeah, it's not factual, but it does give a good idea on how the Revolutionary War was fought.  It's rather ironic that the first director to make a good film on the American Revolution is a German.  But as for Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, I consider this thier best work to date.  Keep up the good work guys, you're now on the right track!  ****1/2 (out of five)"

"littlesb","6","0","1","5 July 2000"," Wasted effort
","I was hoping that this movie would be an American Revolution ""Braveheart"", but no such luck.  This film was simply a load of boring schmaltz.  They needed more battle scenes and more excitement and less standing around. <br/><br/>
The most exciting scene was when Mel got all fired up, because one of his sons had just been killed.  What he did in immediate retribution is what I'm talking about as far as the type of exciting action that I think this movie merited.  <br/><br/>Also holding this film back was the score.  I was expecting them to break into ""I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandee"" any second.  It was all just too corny.<br/><br/>Mel Gibson did his usual good job of trying to hold it all together, literally, as the movie had nothing else to hold the viewer's interest EXCEPT him and figuratively, as he, of course, was the hero and was trying to lead his little band of followers to defeat the bad guys.  I, being female, personally missed getting to see Mel get sexy, as that is one of his main appeals and was not exploited in this movie at all.  How many times did his dead wife's sister have to give him longing glances until he got to do anything about it??!!!  Let's get it on, already!!<br/><br/>Basically, I feel this movie was barely a 6 and was a wasted effort that could have been a very spectacular film with more special effects and deeper human drama.  #1 film of the season still, in my opinion, is ""Gladiator"" by a long shot."
"bjones","10","0","4","5 July 2000"," With Great Expectations
","As an ardent film and history buff and a descendant of at least three Revolutionary War Soldiers, I was waiting for this film since I first saw the trailers. I had unreasonably high expectations and hoped for the kind of historical film that is capable of being made - some day. Still, I think this offering will become a classic. I think - for American citizens - this film will be very well received and enjoyed by many for years to come.<br/><br/>Though not a historical piece, this film could be very useful to generate interest in students not otherwise inclined to enjoy history. However, I expect a good number of British citizens may not care for it at all, as it's too close to truth. As much as they wish to predictably deny it, the British Army/Navy/Government has a long history of brutal treatment of fringe citizens in times past (India and Ireland, for example). Even the treatment we later regrettably subjected the Native Americans to was only a copy of the earlier British treatment of the Irish & Scots. Thus, I feel that from all the histories I have read, there is a common thread of truth concerning the ""old"" ""British Empire"" reflected in this film. Yes, the British did commit many objectionable acts (though not burning a church full of parishioners as far as I know - though the Scots did it at least once), but there were villains to be sure. Many of these kinds of things did happen to Revolutionary War figures: they fled persecution, had their homes and possessions seized, and they and their families were killed. There were also figures such as the Gibson character who used stealth and guerilla tactics, so one could say the film was created from a host of historical fact.<br/><br/>What I did appreciate in this offering is the way Cornwallis was portrayed as a bit more human, and complimented on his genuine skill. I also liked all of the references to the early ineptitude of American forces, which was true, though not much was given for how they improved and eventually triumphed.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the film was a work of visual joy. Rich scenery and special effects, though falling short - as usual - of the ""real"" reality of war. (I also wonder how they managed to elude capturing the awful humidity in South Carolina.) The acting was solid and enjoyable (given the shortcomings of the script), the score wonderful and the factually represented military equipment, sets and costumes are worth the admission alone. But I do wish Hollywood would learn to write a less predictable story; the overall plot was the most disappointing feature.<br/><br/>What I - and I think many others would enjoy more - is a factual story of real Revolutionary War figures done with this kind of production quality; something akin to ""Gettysburg"", which sang of realism throughout.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to all Americans, especially history deprived students who could use it as an excellent springboard for interest as many did with ""Braveheart"". I'm buying the DVD when it comes out. After all, it is a MOVIE, and this one is great entertainment. Bravo."
"Bob-45","6","0","2","5 July 2000"," Dime Store Patriotism. And Mel's Stuck in a Rut!
","WARNING:  SPOILERS AHEAD.<br/><br/>In THE PATRIOT, Mel Gibson portrays `Benjamin Martin,' a former `hero' of the French and Indian War, now wants nothing more than to raise his large family on his South Carolina farm, and wants no part of the `revolution' being waged around him.  However, Mel's oldest son, Gabriel (       ) is seduced by the siren song of  `adventure' and `patriotism.'  Soon, Gabriel discovers first hand the horrors of war; and, though the `romance' and `adventure' is lost to him forever, the germ of `patriotism' grows to full bloom, symbolized by his repairing of a tattered `Betsy Ross' flag.<br/><br/>While performing his duties as a dispatch rider, Gabriel is wounded and returns to his father's house for assistance.   Meanwhile, a major battle rages just beyond Martin's farm.  Gabriel awakes to find the battle over, won by the British, and his father lending medical assistance to BOTH British and American soldiers. Gabriel prepares to leave, when he discovers that his father has turned the dispatch papers over to the British.  Though the British Lieutenant is a decent man, the British Colonel is as cruel as he is stupid.  The writers of this film would have us believe, that this Colonel would drive off Martin's livestock and `field workers' (Mel is the `good guy;' perish the thought that he would have slaves!), burn his farm, shoot all the wounded American prisoners, except for Gabriel (whom he plans to hang) and kill Mel's fifteen year old son for resisting, but leave Mel unharmed, and not even search the house for weapons!  DUH!!!! For almost three sluggish hours, Gibson plays cat and mouse with this horrid Colonel.  The film is a revenge tale and little more.  Only in the last five minutes of  the film does Gibson display even a symbolic interest in the outcome of the war.  He passes up an opportunity to dispatch his enemy to carry the flag his son repaired and lead the American troops in a rout of the British.  Even then the movie cheats, the British Colonel comes after Gibson, setting himself up for Gibson's revenge (mighty nice of him).<br/><br/>During the course of the film, we discover Mel's `heroism' during the French and Indian War consisted of  torturing and dismembering French and Cherokee whom had massacred American men, women and children.  As they say, what goes around Â…<br/><br/>This is not to say THE PATRIOT is without its pleasures.  Mel is charming, as almost always, even if he IS playing pretty much the same character he usually plays.  The film abounds with some terrific performances, particularly among the subplot characters.  Special note must be given Heath Ledger (Gabriel) and Lisa Brenner (Anne Howard).  These two have tremendous careers ahead of them, hopefully in movies better than THE PATRIOT. Unfortunately, many of our favorite characters are dispatched in especially cruel ways (think Waco) during the course of the film.   The historical inaccuracies (as well as the brutality) prevent this film from inspiring what should have been its target audience (young people with little sense of America's history).  THE PATRIOT, alas, is revenge and brutality, served up as `dime store' patriotism.  If you really want to show your family inspiring movies about the revolution, try THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE or the director's cut of 1776.  Both are pretty bawdy, but both are historically accurate and have a genuine feel for what truly was at stake in the American Revolution."

","I went to see The Patriot this weekend with mixed emotions.  I am a fan of Mel Gibson and his work in the past and was intrigued by the previews but at the same time I was conflicted by some of the negative comments regarding this movie.  After seeing the movie I feel that I can address the comments as well as assure you that this is one of the top 50 movies of all time. The imagery was amazing, the acting was wonderful, and the story was moving. I fully enjoyed every minute of the movie and did not feel any effects of sitting down for such a long time.<br/><br/>I want to address some of the criticisms of this movie.  1. It is an inaccurate portrayal of history.  Answer:  This is a movie not a documentary, it is meant for entertainment purposes only and if you go to the movies to learn the facts about history then that is a whole different problem.  2.  It portrays a disgusting and violent man as a hero.  Answer: Benjamin Martin is based on several characters and despite being the hero of the movie they do make a point of showing that several of his deeds are very morbid and appalling, even to his own family.  3.  This movie is too similar to Braveheart.  Answer:  Yes, this movie is an amazing epic, Mel Gibson is the star, and there are some similar generic plot aspects (revolting against tyranny, revenge for loved ones) but I didn't see any one running around in kilts and I'm pretty sure it took place in a different time and place.<br/><br/>The bottom line here is that if you worry too much about the silly criticisms trying to make this movie into something more then you are going to miss out on one of the best movies of all time.  This is a must see and I for one will be seeing it again."

","Having read many of the comments before mine (face it...you either loved it or you hated it), and having seen ""The Patriot"" recently, I feel compelled to state that this is a movie.  Not a documentary.  Historical accuracy?  Save it for American History 101.  I personally went to this movie to be entertained, not to re-hash my American History class.<br/><br/>
Was it based on historical figures?  Of course.  Gibson's Benjamin Martin bears a striking resemblance to Francis Marion, the famed ""Swamp Fox"" of South Carolina, whose hit-and-run tactics confounded the British regulars.  Isaacs' Colonel Tavington is an obvious caricature (note the word ""caricature"") of Banastre Tarleton, commander of the Green Dragoons, who, contrary to previous comments, did order the massacre of Continental troops who had surrendered after a battle in South Carolina.  I don't remember a lot of my Revolutionary War history, but I do remember that part quite clearly.<br/><br/>Does this, then, mean that all British were Nazi-esque murderers?  Of course not.  Tarleton's behavior was considered to be quite aberrant, a fact the movie does attempt to convey in Cornwallis' distaste for Tavington's ungentlemanly brutality.  And I don't believe that the Americans were portrayed as ""straight-laced,"" as some have expressed.  In the movie, most of Martin's irregulars are mercenaries and thieves, and he has to wind up issuing a standing order not to kill wounded and prisoners. The slavery issue.  Some felt that (POSSIBLE SPOILER MATERIAL) the reconciliation between the bigot and the freed slave was too ""cheesy"" and ""clean-cut.""  Others took issue with the fact that Martin kept no slaves.  The sad fact of the matter is that believing that all Southern landowners (and, in fact, all Southerners) were howling racist bigots is a form of ignorance on the magnitude of howling racist bigotry.<br/><br/>Please, folks, go into this movie with an open mind and desire to be entertained.  In no way should this movie attempt to serve as a study guide for your American History final exam.  For a solid performance from Gibson and co., a good bit of work from the director and the writers, and an all-around entertaining glimpse at what life MIGHT HAVE BEEN like during the Revolutionary War, I give ""The Patriot"" 8 out of 10."

","I didn't expect this film to be a classic.  But... It's amazing how a good popcorn movie can suck you in.  It can make you think it's better than it really is; it can make you remember it as being better than it really was.<br/><br/>""The Patriot"" is a popcorn movie.  Despite the marketing for the film (epic, historical drama, emotional family tragedy, epic, swell that John Williams score, EPIC), the flick is your standard Mel Gibson actioner.  The moral of the story is ""Don't Mess With Mel or THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY!""  Despite the first thirty minutes of the film which show Mel living a bucolic family life and trying to live down ""the sins"" of his past warrior life, this film is really about what happens after Mel stops making rational, pacifist speeches and starts being p***ed on and getting p***ed off.<br/><br/>And there is wonderful power to his meltdown of Biblical proportions.  Mel loses his eldest son metaphorically when he enlists in the war.  Mel is upset.  That son is injured then captured.  Mel gets angry.  Mel loses his second eldest son when he is killed by the sadistic British officer (is there any other kind in these ""realistic"" ""historical"" ""epics""?).  And (to paraphrase Tom Laughlin in ""Billy Jack"" [another guy you just should NOT p**s off]), Mel just... goes... berserk!  The scene in which Mel uses his two younger sons to ambush the British team escorting his captured son to execution, where the sons (nine and eleven years of age) ""aim for the officers"" first, where Mel kills off the British team and hacks the final Brit to death with his Cherokee tomahawk, and continues to hack him after death to the horrified stares of his three sons, is a scene of uncommon brutality, of uncommon power.  It is a keeper.<br/><br/>And this power continues for most of the picture.  Sure, Hollywood creeps in at moments: ridiculous dialogue, anachronistic behavior (the open-mouthed kiss between the son Gabriel and his soon-to-be-betrothed surely would never have happened), the seemingly obligatory ""good"" slave fighting for REAL freedom plot-line, and that swelling Williams score.  But the power of Gibson's performance, the strength and emotional tug of the plot line (especially for this father, the son of a warrior, sitting in a theater on Fourth of July weekend) had me going.  It had me thinking the film was better than it was.<br/><br/>** SPOILER ALERT ** And then IT happened.  And I'm going to state was IT is (so if you don't want to know what happens in the flick, skip to the end of the review)...<br/><br/>Mel's son Gabriel kills the sadistic brutal British bad guy (and for a moment, as Hollywood convention is broken, the film's greatness was solidified), but he didn't really... just as he was about to hack the body of his newlywed bride's killer (like father, like son), the baddie turns around and skewers the kid, and runs off to FIGHT ANOTHER DAY, setting up the Hollywood climactic fight with Mad Mel.  And the film began to lose me. Then the final battle is not set up at all.  We know that a battle is about to happen, and we're told that the strategy the revolutionaries are going to employ will be not what Cornwallis expects, but that's it.  We're not told how it will break contemporary battlefield convention.  Without this knowledge, the battle sequence is unwatchable, completely without intellectual OR emotional impact (This is where the otherwise Hollywood-soppy ""Titanic"" was masterful: we know exactly what is going to happen to the ship before it happens... so when it does happen, there is a heightened sense of tragedy and inevitability).  This final battle scene is so ineptly shot and cut that the film loses intellectual direction and emotional suspense.<br/><br/>And then, THEN to Williams' self-cannibalized strains of pseudo-Indy-esque adventure music, Mel must take on the bad guy in HAND to HAND combat.  And here Mel should die, decapitated by the sadistic brutal British bad guy, with visions of sunlight streaming around and through the fluttering colonial flag, knowing that his strategy has won the day for the Americans, for the cause of his son.  The sword comes around, and Hollywood, er, Mel ducks down and skewers the sadistic brutal British bad guy, commenting to him that his own sons (yep, the two that the sadistic brutal British bad guy killed) were better men.  Swell music.<br/><br/>Then we get an COMPLETELY inept wrap-up of the war.  A character whose wife is expecting a child before the climactic battle, finally gives birth to the child THREE YEARS LATER.  Mel marries (I think) his wife's sister, and she carries his baby in her arm (or does she?).  And Mel's Men (including the now free former-slave) build him a home.  Sell music.<br/><br/>Suddenly, twenty minutes after thinking this was a great movie, I wasn't so sure it was even a good movie.<br/><br/>It makes one think.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the R-rated violence in the film.  And I think it is indicative of the Hollywood Problem and a pretty good discussion point in a comparison to a better (if not truly great) film like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (written by the same writer, Robert Rodat, and sharing some of that film's emotionally manipulative shortcomings).  Whereas in ""Ryan"" the truly gruesome visions (entrails outside the body, limbs missing) were seen in a scene's periphery and the shot's focus was on a character about whom we cared, the grotesquerie in ""The Patriot"" ARE the focus of the scene. Hollywood's hand can be seen in this sideshow-like fascination and dumbing-down to the lowest common audience; an audience member in the row behind me actually laughed at the cannonball decapitation.<br/><br/>We get the movies we deserve (or at least the ones we'll go and see). They may not be great ones or even good ones, but they will be ones that live down to our expectations."
"JakeSpy","9","0","2","28 June 2000"," Films are not history . . .
","I have grown weary of people who bash films for historical inaccuracies, as if to suggest all films are meant to serve the same purpose as history books.  I am even more amazed at how when someone likes a movie they conveniently forgive historical revisionism (Titanic or Saving Private Ryan anyone?).  Much of the criticism against The Patriot is leveled not at the film, but at the history the film supposedly presents.  The filmmakers made it very clear to reasonable people that they had no intention of making a historical film.  They changed the main character's name to avoid confusion, they intentionally kept most real historical figures of the American Revolution at a distance.  History is not always good storytelling, but good films always are about good storytelling.  Basically, nowhere in the film itself is there any suggestion that it should be viewed as or aspires to be a history lesson of any kind.  <br/><br/>That being said, people can debate the merits of the real actions of the real Francis Marion and the cause of the real American Revolution until they are blue in the face, but it has nothing to do with this film.  Suspension of disbelief is a big part of any filmmaking endeavor, and when a filmmaker wishes to bypass that mechanism it is pointed out to the audience (Schindler's List for example).  Yet storytelling still prevails even in the most historically accurate films as most filmmakers will attest.  The Patriot is not such a film, it is intended to entertain, not educate, and that is just fine--we need both types of films, just as much as we need people who can tell the difference.<br/><br/>The Patriot is a truly remarkable achievement considering the last film from this producing/directing team was Godzilla.  The film is centered and held together by Mel Gibson's performance which is certainly his best to date. Still, much credit is due the cinematographer, director, screenwriter, and editor for being able to take melodrama to such high levels.  There are many characters here and their inner-struggles are brought out. Benjamin Marten's character is most compelling in that he is not so perfect--he makes mistakes, has regrets, and is still dealing with his temper.<br/><br/>There is no pretense in this film--it does not ""reinvent the wheel,"" but never claims to either.  It is just a film that gives us some great characters, a compelling story, and solid delivery.  <br/><br/>In the end (at least for those of us who leave our baggage about PC historical accuracy at the door) we are well-rewarded with a solid film that pays off more than most."
"Chewie-35","10","0","3","3 July 2000"," Not a history lesson but perhaps the best movie of the year.
","A work of shear genius. The second of only two movies this year that truly hold the audience captive. This, and Gladiator are the only films of the 2000 season that fit this category.<br/><br/>The Patriot at its base is a human story of a man trying to hold onto the remnants of his family at all cost. The backdrop being the Revolutionary War.  It is impossible to create an exactly historical film and still draw an audience.  It is after all a form of entertainment and certain things must be changed in order to provide entertainment. If I wanted a complete history I would have opened a book or watched the history channel. History is written by the victor and British history is perhaps the greatest example of this idea. This film draws from its base historical fact, showing the atrocities  of war, and the will of man.  Col. Tarlington, who is based upon a real British officer Tartlton, often called ""The Butcher"" lead his group of Green Dragoons into some of the bloodiest acts of the war. One including the slaughter of a troop of Continental army that were hacked upon by the Green Dragoons after they surrendered with sword and bayonet until not one of them was left alive.  The depiction of this character I believe to be one of the strongest points of the film. Jason Isaacs gets deep into the mind of evil. You can see it in his eyes and with every clinch of his jaw.<br/><br/>I loved every aspect of The Patriot. The acting was superb, Gibson once again showing brilliance and Leger giving a glimpse of greatness to come.<br/><br/>John Williams does it again, providing a score that pulls at every emotion. You will laugh, come to near tears and feel pure hatred as the movie progresses. It is the perfect Fourth of July event, for if this film doesn't tug at your heart as an American you may need to rethink where you live.<br/><br/>This is a must see at any cost, but do not be bogged down by the criticism of the historical accuracy of the film. Enjoy it for the great form of entertainment that it is."
"bagnon","5","0","1","2 July 2000"," This is what I thought
","I saw the Patriot upon the recommendation of my dad who told me about it with great enthusiasm. It started out really well as the scenes instilled within me a great sense of patriotism and gratitude for the brave men who fought for our freedom. The first fight scene with Mel Gibson's character and his three sons was excellent and I really got into it. However, as soon as the 18-year-old son goes to the church to find militiamen and they are inspired only by a girl (not patriotism or love of freedom), the film got very poor and pleased only the simple minded. The feelings of patriotism never returned and I felt let down by the lack of historical accuracy as the scenes were watered down by political correctness and as the soldiers quoted lines from the constitution and Gettysburg address, documents they had never read. This film will only please simpleminded Americans, not by the true red-blooded American heroes that fought to make our country the best in the world."
"killgore-6","10","0","3","3 July 2000"," Excellent film, one of the best!
","This was an amazing experience. Mel Gibson has a way of sucking you into his roles. He is very good at portraying grief. This is a film that holds nothing back. As soon as you start to like the characters they get killed. It shows the harsh reality of the Revolutionary war. The goodguys don't always win. If you don't like this one you must be as cold as the colonial in this film. I am not sure as to how accurate it is but it definitely captures the American spirit."
"sunface","Null","0","1","3 July 2000"," Good dramatization... bad message...
","Similar to Titanic, as a historical dramatization, The Patriot was good (although, I've heard, not necessarily accurate).  I've always said Titanic would be a GREAT movie if all the scenes involving Jack and Rose were removed and they just told the story of the ship and its passengers and crew.  I feel the same way about The Patriot.  I loved the scenes that told the story of the war.  The battle scenes with the long rows of troops facing each other and the ambush scenes in cotton fields were great.  However, I found the personal life of Ben Martin only marginally interesting and I thought that the film's revenge theme was quite a turn-off.<br/><br/>The Patriot also had something deeper that I didn't like.  Although Ben Martin's nemesis, Tavington, was a very strong screen presence, he was the epitome of the movie-bad-guy stereotype and a perfect example of this movie's attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  The average American's patriotism is unfortunately filled with ethnocentric arrogance rather than respectful pride and I'm afraid that this movie was aimed to appeal to that arrogance.  It's uncomfortable for me to think that many people may have left the movie theater feeling like, ""America rocks!  The American way is, not only the best way, but also the only way!""<br/><br/>The film did try to subtly leave some signs that maybe America doesn't learn from its mistakes very well, but I think that they were too subtle for some people.  Overall, I felt that there were too many honorable Americans, too many dastardly Brits, and too much Stars'n'Stripes waiving for this movie to be taken seriously."

","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but was a bit disappointed.  It wasn't a bad movie, but it just wasn't the great movie I expected it to be.  There was something missing that I can't quite put my finger on that kept this from being a great movie.  The story was a familiar one (ahem...Braveheart anyone?)  which was not helped by the fact that Mel Gibson portrayed the hero in both movies, further drawing comparisons between the two.  Braveheart and Gladiator were both much better movies. But at least there is finally a Revolutionary War movie for people to watch. Worth a look, but not worthy of the praise it has gotten."
"Cheyenne-3","6","0","1","1 July 2000"," Disappointed!
","I have to say that this movie wasn't up to my expectations. If your not going to make a historical movie historically accurate, than what is the point? I'm a history buff, which may explain the reason for my resentment, but still there were an awful lot of scenarios that were falsely portrayed ( not giving anything away here.) One scene when Lisa Brenner stood up and gave her patriot speech just made me cringe. That scene should have been cut out altogether! The only thing that made this film good was good 'ol Mel.<br/><br/>Most people would have compared this film to Gibson's Braveheart, but I am more likely to compare this film to The Gladiator. Both films deal with a man who face similar situations. I have to say that I enjoyed Gladiator much more than The Patriot.<br/><br/>The Patriot was predictable and too melodramatic. I think I got sucked in by watching the trailer. I mean I was so thrilled when I first saw the trailer for this movie, but that excitement died when I saw this film."
"razorbak1","Null","0","1","1 July 2000"," Patriot is Excellent
","I read many favorable reviews of the film The Patriot, but also a number of unfavorable ones. Most of the unfavorable reviews were from [1] left wing diehards with an ideological axe to grind, [2] the British, [3] pseudo-sophisticated movie critic wanna-bes who hate the movies most Americans love, and vice versa. It is understandable that many non-Americans might be more enthralled with Gladiator. But even they will enjoy the excellent acting, cinematography, score, realistic effects, etc. And most Americans film goers will love Mel Gibson and The Patriot as much or more than Russell Crowe's captivating performance in Gladiator. Historically speaking, virtually all of the characters and events seen in The Patriot can be found somewhere in the details of the documented history of our Revolutionary War. The film wanted to highlight as many of these experiences as possible by compressing them into the life of one man, Benjamin Martin, whose character was loosely based on the actual patriot and revolutionary war hero, Francis Marion. Don't let the negative critics scare you away from this film. I wondered as I watched The Patriot if they had even seen the same movie that I had. It is gratifying as we enter our July the Fourth festivities to be reminded so powerfully of the sacrifices our forefathers made as they fought for their families and their freedom. My wife actually described seeing this film as ""a life changing experience."" Some complain that the theme of The Patriot is too similar to Braveheart. They seem to overlook that it was not just the screenplay, but actual history that inspired Braveheart, The Patriot, Spartacus, Gladiator, and many other films of this genre. I think I may go see it again, and, even though I rarely purchase a movie on videotape, I definitely will be buying the Patriot for my small home film library."
"latlk","10","0","3","2 July 2000"," The Patriot is the wonderful and moving story of a man trying to protect his family and still be true to himself in the face of the American Revolution.
","The Patriot is the kind of movie that sticks with you long after you leave the theater.  Epic and emotional, the story details the struggles of one man to protect his family and atone for past sins against the backdrop of our fight for independence.  I was especially moved by the personal moments between Benjamin Martin and his seven children.  Those intimate scenes really showcased the family chemistry at the center of the film.  Mel Gibson is always wonderful, but this could be his best performance yet.  He brought such depth to Benjamin's conflicting emotions that it was easy to understand and sympathize with his character's pain.  Heath Ledger was perfectly cast as Mel's son, and his conscience.  And Jason Isaacs gave new meaning to the word evil as the growling Tavington.  It was my pleasure to watch them all.<br/><br/>One aspect of the movie that has been overlooked is its humor.  Amid unbelievable suffering it was comforting to break up the tension with a light hearted moment here and there.  Nothing too wacky, just enough to make it July 4th friendly.<br/><br/>The battle sequences were stunning.  They certainly bring to mind both Braveheart and the Last of the Mohicans in their style and scope.  The movie takes you right into the middle of the fighting, amid all the blood and gore and suffering.  Of course the film has a lot of bloody moments, but they are not gratuitous.  Quick and tasteful cuts make the violence tolerable and the sacrifices moving rather than depressing.  What a horrible time it must have been to be a soldier!  It certainly took a special kind of man to fight so hard for independence in the face of such overwhelming odds.  The Patriot makes you appreciate those men just in time for Independence Day.<br/><br/>
I intend to recommend the movie to anyone who will listen!"
"sublimeaj","Null","0","1","1 July 2000"," This is a movie, not a book...
","I just saw The Patriot last night, and I thought it was a great movie. I went online when I got home from the theater, and logged onto IMDB.com, to see what other people's reactions were to the movie, and saw many people lamenting about how the movie wasn't historically accurate. This wasn't a surprise to me, as I have seen this happen to other good movies, and frankly, it is getting annoying. The people who complain about The Patriot being historically inaccurate are the same ones who feel that Saving Private Ryan was also inaccurate. They feel that Schindler's List only showed one side of World War Two, that The Usual Suspects was predictable, and that The Godfather was, well, disappointing. To all you people who are foaming at the mouth over what I have just said, I only have one thing to tell you. GET A LIFE! These are movies, people! They are not made to give you a history lesson, they are made to entertain and make money. If you really want to know what happened in the Revolutionary War, then read a book! If your life is really so sad that you must nitpick with great movies over historical inaccuracies, then I am sorry for you. Blockbuster should revoke your card and movie theaters should have Wanted posters with your pictures on them. Since you obviously know how to make movies brilliant, I suggest that you make a movie of your very own, that can be as historically accurate and perfect as you want. Otherwise, leave perfectly good movies alone."
"dakokes","Null","0","1","1 July 2000"," pretty good action, terrible plot
","This movie is like many other American movies: terrible plot and dialog, saved by pretty good acting. Yes, the movie presents one-dimensional characters in the heroic Americans and the dastardly British. And yes the plot is utterly predictable and over-the-top melodramatic. And yes it is not very historically accurate. But as several people before have said, the movie is not meant to be a serious look at the revolutionary war; it is supposed to be a summer blockbuster geared towards the 4th july upsurge of patriotism. On that count it succeeds; the action scenes are pretty good, though not quite the quality of braveheart. The acting is quite good, particularly on the part of mel gibson. And some characters are actually well done, for example that of General Cornwallis as the true British aristocrat.<br/><br/>Hence I would almost be willing to overlook the movie's many faults and enjoy it for the mindless action movie it is. However, one thing I found completely disgusting is the total revisionism with respect to the treatment of black people in the movie. It's as if because the movie has portrayed Mel and his militia men as such good hearted honorable men, it couldn't destroy that image by acknowledging their racism. It's so blatant and so obviously untrue to life one cannot help but cringe.<br/><br/>To summarize, this is nowhere near as good as Braveheart, which actually had interesting subplots and _good_ monologues, but if you're willing to take it for what it is, and can get past the corny lines, blatant emotional manipulation, and revisionist interpretation of history and culture, it's not bad."

","Seriously folks...  This movie tried so hard to be Braveheart, which by the way is one of my top 50 favorite movies, but fell so short.  It is 2 hours and 40 minutes of sappy, lame drama broken up (not nearly enough) by decent action sequences.  Don't get me wrong, I love drama, but not this kinda drama...  This movie definitely had the worst of both worlds.  The first twenty minutes felt like an hour as we all waited for the first action scene.  This scene is by far the coolest of the picture, and makes the rest of the action pale by comparison.  There were too many lame parts to mention, but I will tell you my friend rolled his eyes about 25 times and all we did was make comments all the way through.  I am a big movie fan and almost never talk during a film, but this one was just SO boring.   At one point the movie completely stops.  Just stops.  I was glad it was over, but then realized that they never resolved the issue with the anagonist.  Then I realized there was more to the film...  About 45 minutes more.  I almost cried.  See this if you wish, but I'm telling you... This movie was so bad it made me wish for Gladiator, which is a huge accomplishment because I'm not to keen on that one either. Hollywood, stop trying to make Bravehearts.  It's been done, and you can't do any better.  Have some originality."
"mugzybrown","3","0","1","1 July 2000"," Disappointing
","The movie to me was promoted as a war film in the same light as ""Glory"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"", but was more a story of a man and his family with the background of the Revolutionary War.  I felt it very very Cheesey and formulated and not all that entertaining"
"CanadianTory","Null","0","1","30 June 2000"," Can we please be objective?
","Someone was saying how offended he was about the allusions made to Braveheart. Had the screenwriters re-written the scene where Mel rides up and down the Rebel lines waving the flag to rally the troops like he did in Braveheart, maybe so many people wouldn't have branded it Braveheart so quickly.<br/><br/>Anyhow, my gripe is with another matter entirely. This film covers a conflict I find the most interesting of all wars. I was really looking forward to a great war film, but it seems a large amount of historical truth was wantonly sacrificed to satisfy the demands of a gripping family drama. This could have been achieved without bastardising the facts of history.<br/><br/>The ""hatchet job"" someone else mentioned was really done on Banastre Tarleton's reputation (on whom Tavington, the vilifed British cavalry colonel is based), blowing facts completely out of proportion in order to create a genocidal, baby-killer the viewer could hate, to contrast with the straight-laced Patriots.<br/><br/>This happens all too frequently in motion pictures, particularly American ones, but could the same emotional result have been achieved without unfairly vilifying the British. Sure there was a substantial amount of pillaging and massacres of civilians and war prisoners in the war, as there have been in all wars since, but it was done by both sides. Loyalists residing in areas supporting the Rebel or Patriot cause had their houses torched or confiscated and their persons attacked -- that fact of history provided Canada with its first major English-speaking settlers.<br/><br/>I loved the combat scenes in the film, but I can see why a large number of British people, and generally most historical purists have been offended, and why many journalists have given the film less than glowing reviews. As a movie-goer, I've become accustomed to the cliche scenes of Old Glory waving proudly in Hollywood films...It's just a shame the Patriot would have to greatly distort history to achieve such a result, in what would otherwise have been a masterful film."
