","I have seen ""Bloody Sunday"" twice now - once on the big screen and once on DVD - and read Don Mullen's book, ""Eyewitness Bloody Sunday.""  This movie is a very realistic depiction of the defining moment of the ""troubles"" in Northern Ireland.  The hand-held cameras and grainy film style make it feel more like a documentary than a movie, which of course is the intent.  As another reviewer has mentioned, the acting is very natural throughout.  It does take some time to get started, but once the the shooting starts it hits the viewer like a sledgehammer.  Very powerful.<br/><br/>     The film jumps so frequently from scene to scene that at times it is distracting, though I was much less annoyed by this the second time around. And, having seen it once with and once without subtitles, I must say that although the subtitles (optional on the DVD) are intrusive they are quite welcome.  I love the Irish accent but at times it can be difficult for me to decipher,and much of the dialogue in the movie is muted.  It was good to know what was being said.  <br/><br/>    As for the objectivity, of course the movie is slanted - so was the situation.  But it is not unreasonably slanted.  The British are not shown as one-dimensional demons - in particular, Nicholas Farrell does a great job of conveying Brigadier Mclellan's ambiguity and even disapproval of the course taken against his wishes by the supposed ""Observer,"" Maj. Gen. Ford (who, if the movie has a villain, is the prime candidate.)  At one point early on several Paras are discussing the day's prospects, and reveal how tired they are of being harassed, shot at and otherwise abused by the native population.  This makes the day's events more understandable.  This does not EXCUSE the cold-blooded gunning down of 27 people - there is no excuse for that - but at least one can see a contributing factor.  And protesters are shown, once or twice, firing back.  (The key here is firing BACK - evidence indicates that no marchers fired until the first two protesters were wounded.  And those scattered few that attempted return fire were quickly dissuaded by their countrymen.  Later in the day the IRA did go into action, but not until after the bloodletting in Bogside was over with.)  Ivan Cooper's (James Nesbitt) words at the close of the film were shown to be all too true in the years since the actual incident.  The IRA was on unsteady legs at the time, but has never lacked support since January 30, 1972.<br/><br/>     The film is a powerful object lesson concerning the misuse of force, and one that governments everywhere - including my own country, the United States - should take to heart.  It has a few flaws, but I think deserves the awards it has received.  8/10 points."

","I saw this film about 2 years ago, and was extremely impressed with the realism of the film.Having served with the British Army in Northern Ireland many years later I found the atmosphere and the general appearance and manner of the Paras extremely accurate, as I have seen many films about Ireland when trying to portray British soldiers they unfortunately could of done a little better. I consider myself to be open minded and understood and sympathized with the local catholic population during these events as this is or was pretty much how things are with regards to the catholic population in Northern Ireland.For me, the main good points were that the film was made in a documentary style in which the facts were shown in a straight to the point manner without any fancy computer effects or handsome faces portraying the main players. well done to the production team !!!!"
"noralee","Null","55","72","30 November 2002"," One day of ""the troubles"" packs a universal wallop.
","""Bloody Sunday"" is a very startling, cinema-verite recreation of a very specific date (January 30, 1972), in a very specific place (Derry, Northern Ireland) of an event that for the Irish became ""our Sharpeville.""<br/><br/>
But for an American audience with no benefit of subtitles for the brogues and working class Brit accents, no explanations outside of eventual context for lingo and slang (it took me awhile to keep track of ""provos"" vs ""paras""), the quasi-documentary, in-your-face approach takes on a tragic universality.<br/><br/>It could be part of a Cassandra trilogy with `Black Hawk Down' and `No Man's Land' about why military should not be in charge in urban strife, whether as ""peacekeepers"" or in civil wars or regime changes, no matter how heinous the regime to be changed.  A lesson for the Baghdad invasion planners?<br/><br/>
Cities are complicated social ecologies, and the film shows a great diversity of attitudes and pressures on all sides, managing to be both clinical in meticulous detail and visceral in shocking impact.  The film is probably not objective about the British (I don't think it's a coincidence that the imperious Brit ""observer"" who takes repugnant charge is played by Tim Pigott-Smith who was a similar colonialist in `The Jewel in the Crown."") A central universal image becomes the awesome power of rock-throwing, unemployed teen-age boys to spark war.<br/><br/>The liberals in the middle, clinging to dreams of Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and fair community relations, are morally destroyed over the course of a few hours and the extremists with guns on both sides feed on each other in perpetual destruction like the ouroboros image of the snake eating itself. I kept feeling I missed the exact flash point in a wandering attention moment and wanted to immediately re-watch it to see if I could track the gotcha! moment when escalation could have been prevented, so I look forward to this being available on video tape.<br/><br/>But the film does clearly show that it was attitudes that created the violent outcome and consequent government non-investigation, as we see in so many police situations.  Once soldiers enter a city it is a police situation with all those complexities.<br/><br/>I know James Nesbitt primarily from frothy Irish comedies, like `BallykissAngel,' so his staggering portrayal of the M.P. in the middle is a revelation, as he goes from planning a civil rights march to pleading with his girlfriend to physical heroism to a break-down in shock.<br/><br/>
The version of the titular U2 song played out at the end, running well past the credits finish, is a moving, live, passionate audience sing-along where Bono shouts out other locales that have experienced similar situations to emphasize the universality."
"ainge_devyr","10","31","40","12 June 2006"," for anyone even peripherally familiar with the northern conflict, this is an important film.

"comprachio","10","28","36","22 January 2002"," Not a farse
","Naive or not, the film version of Bloody Sunday couldn't do anything else but show the pandemoneum and confusion of a massacre of many innocent people.  This confusion was shown on both sides.  An army of young men being thrown into a situation which they didn't understand.  A people of a City riddled with gerrymandering and oppression.<br/><br/>The film showed stones being answered by guns and gas. As a British citizen I was moved and shocked.  The film brought to life the many books i've read on the subject.  It didn't point blame.  It was never shown in the film who fired first but it showed that both sides fired.  It documented how 13 people protesting for civil rights (majority of them children) were gunned down in cold blood by a 'peace keeping' security force.  The bodies are the evidence, their memory is the legacy.<br/><br/>This film highlights the importance of sensitivity when approaching the dark days of our history.  It succeeds where so many films fail by showing that no good can come from such events.  A sterling performance from James Nesbitt shows that he is a versatile actor not afraid of approaching difficult and controversial roles.  Perhaps we should forget the bickering and respect this for what it is; a stylistically impressive and well acted movie."

"ickabod147","9","49","75","25 November 2002"," Fact or Fiction? Who can tell...
","'Bloody Sunday' is, if nothing else, a very powerful film and,<br/><br/>depending on which side you're on ideologically, can move you to<br/><br/>tears or incite you with rage.  Is this film an accurate depiction of<br/><br/>the days events?  I personally can't say for certain.  Having read<br/><br/>enough contemporary Irish history, including Don Mullan's<br/><br/>""Eyewitness Bloody Sunday"", I can say that both sides of the<br/><br/>conflict in Northern Ireland can conduct some very shady<br/><br/>operations and dealings when the moment suits them.  A lot of<br/><br/>people have asked ""Where was the IRA in this ""no-go zone"" that<br/><br/>they controlled?"" Well according to the book they had been asked<br/><br/>by NICRA (Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association) to remain at<br/><br/>the Creggan Estate.  Cooper and the rest of NICRA knew that the<br/><br/>march was banned and they didn't need the Provos to cause<br/><br/>anymore trouble.  Also, at that point the Provos were at a nadir of<br/><br/>sorts in terms of numbers and support.  There was a lot of hope<br/><br/>placed in the Civil Rights movement, and Bloody Sunday crushed<br/><br/>all chances of it really succeeding. The operation conducted by 1<br/><br/>Para was, I can only hope, a ""grab & snatch"" operation gone<br/><br/>terribly, terribly wrong.  <br/><br/>I can only surmise that out of the some 10,000 people in the<br/><br/>march (not a few hundred as listed in other reviews) some were<br/><br/>either in the IRA if not most definitely IRA sympathisers.  Do I<br/><br/>believe most of the marchers that were killed to be innocent<br/><br/>civilians? Yes.  Should the ""young hooligans"" have thrown stones<br/><br/>at the RUC & British Armed Forces? Probably not.  Did the IRA<br/><br/>shoot first or did 1 Para? I doubt that with all the confusion going<br/><br/>on, between CS gas & rubber bullets being fired anyone can tell<br/><br/>for certain.  I don't think that the Widgery Report was anywhere<br/><br/>near right, or the current Saville Inquiry will get it 100% right either.<br/><br/>But these opinions are coming from a remove of 30 years and a<br/><br/>pretty large ocean.<br/><br/>As for the film itself.  i liked it.  James Nesbit gave a career defining<br/><br/>performance as far as I'm concerned, going from the height of one<br/><br/>emotion to the absolute depths of another.  The Gerry Donaghy<br/><br/>character's accent was a little thick, to say the least.  However he<br/><br/>played a good victim with Republican feelings.  The jerky handheld<br/><br/>camera, which people either love or hate, worked well in this<br/><br/>movie.  It gave a real sense of being ""in the moment.""  Long story<br/><br/>short I'd give this film 3 1/2 stars out of 4."
"cottrellpj","9","22","31","27 October 2002"," Draining, But Worthwhile
","Normally I don't enjoy the handheld documentary style films, as they tend to induce waves of nausea, but Bloody Sunday had me riveted from the word go. That we already know how it's going to end is irrelevant, the pressure building on the day of the march is almost unbearable. Though there's been criticism that the film is slanted towards the republican point of view, I found it balanced, even in the depiction of the soldiers and officers. Everybody certainly looked the part and I went away feeling some sympathy for both sides. Given the close quarters and inflammatory nature of the conflict, it's amazing that bloodbaths like this (soldiers blasting civilians) haven't happened more often in Northern Ireland. It's only now, that retired soldiers have broken ranks and talked about what actually happened, that a film like this can see the light of day."
"Lomandal","10","4","4","12 January 2016"," A masterpiece not only to remember, but also to respect
","I've been getting overall information from IMDb for quite a while. Couple of days ago, I accidentally read a list called 'Best Irish movies'. By double checking, or triple checking or even more maybe, because I was too upset to count and I couldn't find this film, which made me terribly upset about till now. For those who haven't see this film, you need to see this film before you want to make any comment on Irish films. <br/><br/>Secondly, Paul Greengrass has set up a new standard of handy cam producing. I believe many late comers learned a lot from him. It's such a brilliant work. All these intense scenarios, conflicts and faces built in this film are not just impressive, I would say it's unforgettable. <br/><br/>Sometimes, people move on because life told them to. But sometimes, people cried and fought because no more they can hold on to. <br/><br/>This film, is definitely & absolutely the BEST Irish film, EVER."
"dawnofasgard","10","22","33","9 October 2005"," Great Movie
","A very well done movie. I found it to be a very factual and a very frank account of a terrible time in Irish/British history.<br/><br/>When compared to other books and materials I have read about the account in the past few years, I would have to say it was probably about as accurate as it could be. Of course we don't hear the exact language that was used, especially by British commanders during that time, but I think the movie gives a very likely occurrence of what happened behind closed doors. <br/><br/>Soldiers that were allowed to speak up, many years after the fact, have themselves, shed light onto what happened during that time."
"TedCrilley","Null","23","37","22 January 2002"," Documentary style drama recreating the events of 30th January1972 in Derry
","Although initially difficult to get into, Bloody Sunday proved worthwhile persevering, as the latter half puts the viewer in the carnage.<br/><br/> The acting, especially James Nesbit is excellent, the recreation of the mood is superb although it was obvious with the constant close ups that there was very little budget to recreate the scenery.  The geography was never explained and therefore would leave a viewer without prior knowledge of the area disorientated.<br/><br/> The documentary suffered from not being able to set the scene, a lot had happened in the week prior to the Civil Rights march that put both the participants and the security forces on edge and made the advance more significant.  The question of why the Paras were sent to Derry were never fully explored.<br/><br/> Overall it was flawless recreation of events from the point of view taken by the film makers on this particular incident.  It is worth noting that this is based on the Irish Governments review of the Widgery report into Bloody Sunday.  (NB the Widgery report is mostly considered by nationalists to be a white wash)"
"felixcat67","9","11","16","29 January 2008"," Phenomenal attention to detail is a big plus
","Certainly, anything dealing with ""The Troubles"" of Northern Ireland will quickly create a great divide between opposing viewpoints, and obviously 'Bloody Sunday' is no exception. For the record, I am no fan of the IRA. On the other hand I am no fan of sending an attacking force into a civil disturbance as police support. History is replete with evidence that this is simply a bad idea and will likely lead to an atrocity. For this I heap far more blame at the feet of British politicians who move their army around like chess pieces rather than at the feet of the army itself. And I believe Paul Greengrass handles this as such. Brigadier Maclellan is portrayed as a thoroughly professional soldier who is very conscientious about handling the march with minimal force yet finds this insurmountable upon the arrival of Major General Ford, who seems determined to have his Paras show those pesky Republicans who's boss. The Paras themselves are an elite attacking unit. They are trained to jump from planes and kill with maximum effect, not to make sure peace marchers remain peaceful. They don't want to be there any more than the Irish Catholics want them to be there. They're not policemen. They are frustrated and angry, but they are the ones with guns, Queen and country behind them. And when told to move in, they move in with a vengeance. Again, sending an assault force into a civil insurrection is just a bad idea. The inquest that followed may have been incomplete, but with all due respect to the Parachute Regiment in an unenviable situation, it was a massacre regardless of who fired first (and again Paul Greengrass does not take sides here and make it obvious where the first shot came from). There is a huge difference between understanding why something happened and attempting to justify it.<br/><br/>That said, Paul Greengrass's near pathological attention to detail ceases to amaze me after multiple viewings. Having long been a student of the army in Northern Ireland, there is no fault to be found in reference to the soldiers. The flak jackets worn beneath old pattern Para smocks, the mix of maroon berets and para helmets, the wood stocks of the rifles rather than the later plastic. Paul Greengrass apparently hired ex-servicemen who had done tours in Northern Ireland, thus eliminating the need to train the cinematic soldiers to look like real soldiers. They knew the lingo, they knew how to hold their weapons, they knew how to assault. In fact, Simon Mann, the actor who plays the Para commanding officer, was once in the British Special Air Service (SAS) until 1985, and in 2004 was arrested in Zimbabwe on charges of planning a coup in Equatorial Guinea. Many of the scenes are carbon copies of actual incidents seen in archival footage of the actual march. If you are familiar with such footage, you begin to forget you're watching a recreation. <br/><br/>It is a dark and cold film. It is gray and gritty. There is no dramatic score. The camera-work is often shaky. Dialogue is sometimes hard to understand. What is going on is sometimes confusing. And you know what? Life is like that sometimes, and that's what makes this film so powerful and brutally realistic."
"stensson","8","18","29","11 May 2003"," Like you were there
","This is a film with a terrible nerve, from the press conferences in the Sunday morning, through the preparations for the march and the preparations of the military, and forward to the scenes in the hospital afterwards. The camera is working in a way, there you definitely can feel the gloomy weather and the excitement.<br/><br/>It's also a 1972 feeling about it, which doesn't feel acted, but like  a documentary. James Nesbitt is making a tremendous job as the MP and when you notice that this man hasn't got an Oscar, the Oscar institution definitely seems like the stupid joke it is.<br/><br/>The only thing you can have against this Paul Greengrass' movie is the tendency in the end, where the relative documentary objectivity in the beginning, moves over to tendency. The unionists and the British government remain the totally bad guys and the catholics are the eternal martyrs. They might have been that this Sunday, but the conflict of Northern Ireland is a little more complicated.<br/><br/>However, this is definitely more exciting than most of what you see in the action genre."

"rdoyle29","7","4","5","12 August 2017"," A good film almost done in by it's idiotic stylistic quirks
","Paul Greengrass directs this dramatization of the civil rights march that ended with British paratroopers killing 13 civilians, kicking off the long and bloody civil war that engulfed Northern Ireland for the next 30 years. Greengrass manages to do justice to the events despite his terrible visual style that involves an insanely shaky camera and hundreds of pointless jagged edits. This is largely chalked up to ""documentary realism"", but no documentarian would be happy with a film that consciously draws attention to it's own stylistic quirks and away from the events depicted in the film. James Nesbitt stars as Ivan Cooper, a politician who organized the march and bore witness to much of the slaughter. He does a magnificent job of depicting hope and optimism dying."
"DanH_99","5","27","54","24 October 2002"," Good movie. Bad documentary
","As many of the previous commenters have pointed out, this is a very exciting and well acted film about a shameful day in British history.  However, the documentary style film-making style means that factual omissions and implications have greater impact than in a film that doesnt purport to be 'historical fact'.<br/><br/>A couple of the previous comments have stated that Bloody Sunday was the start of the 'Armed Struggle'.  In fact, the hardline Provisional IRA split from the Official IRA in 1970, 2 years before Bloody Sunday - this was the start of the resumption of IRA military operations. 200 soldiers, policemen and civilians were murdered in 1970-1, so the soldiers would indeed have been scared about being shot, and would also have wanted to 'strike back'.  I didn't think that these motivations were portrayed in the film, and other than the historical omissions this is the only real weakness of the film which i would recommend to anyone irrespective of their own opinions on Northern Ireland."
"bob the moo","Null","21","42","22 February 2002"," The majority is good - conveying the chaos and confusion of the day, but the conclusion is pure fiction that degrades the film to a clumsy exercise in finger pointing.
","On 30th January 1972 Londonderry Ivan Cooper is one of the group of volunteers that put together a march against internment and campaigning for civil rights.  The march starts peacefully but breakaway youths start rioting against the military presence, throwing abuse and stones.  The march continues but, under the impression that the army have been fired on, the army open fire on the marchers.  At first they fire over the marchers heads, however the confusion and chaos builds and innocent civilians begin to fall. At the end of the day, 27 civilians are shot, 13 of them are killed, of all ages.  This is a dramatisation of the events that contains scenes and dialogue that are fictional.  The film is however based on documented evidence.<br/><br/>Films about Northern Ireland tend to reveal what side of the fence people are on.  I'm from Northern Ireland (until a few years ago) and am a Protestant.  However I'm in two minds about this film.  The first hour or so is really good, the story unfolds in a series of scenes that fade in and out - this technique makes it feel a little episodic but happily doesn't go on for the whole film.  The main strength of the film is that it uses handheld cameras to create a great sense of chaos, confusion and disorientation. This helps show the events in a relatively balanced light.  It's not clear if shots are fired at the army or not - it's so noisy that some of the bangs could have been shot.  What is clear that the military were as confused as the marchers - however the film does allow the fact that many police and soldiers had been murdered in the run up to the march and at least it shows the IRA having an armed presence and returning fire.<br/><br/>It also bravely shows civilians being shot - this is hard to accept but lets be honest (13 dead) this happened.  It starts to show it's bias towards the end of the march when soldiers are shown shooting marchers who are wounded on the ground etc, however for the most the chaos is palatable and the soldiers are shown as on-edge and a little too ready to react (however they were in a war zone - Free Derry was not the best place for anyone not supporting the IRA to be).<br/><br/>The final 30 minutes of the film deals with the aftermath of the events. This is where it nails it's colours to the wall.  It shows the soldiers lying to the investigating bodies and making up things that didn't happen - these scenes are clearly the dramatised ones.  However if the film claims to be based on evidence then why does it totally ignore the testimony of the soldiers who claimed they opened fire on armed men?  Yes they hit civilians but the starting point may have been the IRA opening fire.  The way the film shows that the army are lying goes against the claim that it is based on documented evidence - if it were truly based on evidence then it would mix the testimony of marchers and soldiers.  I'm sure that the soldiers are not blame free but this is a clumsy finger pointing exercise.<br/><br/>The problem is this - it wants to have it's cake and eat it.  It wants to be taken as a documentary style film (the director is a former World in Action producer) but it also wants to include fictional scenes.  It can't have it both ways - this allows the film maker to do anything he wants in the fictional scenes and back it up with the claim of documented evidence.  It's a shame because the chaos and confusion of the march is so well handled and manages to spread blame evenly without finger pointing.  However it blows it's credibility at the end by revealing a horrible bias.<br/><br/>The cast are all quite good but the standout is James Nesbit in one of the best roles I've seen him in (I'm not just saying that because he's a fellow Coleraine lad!).  He starts out as a happy go lucky politician type but slows becomes a white-faced witness to the deaths on the day.  His horror looks so real and echoes the viewers emotions.  He helps us see that what happened was terrible, regardless of the circumstances (even if the civilians were caught in cross fire, it's still terrible) and that the horror on the day extends beyond religious boundaries.<br/><br/>If you compare this with Sunday that deals with the same subject, this comes across much better and with much less finger pointing, but it's still as guilty of using fictional scenes to incriminate one side.  It's a shame that the film takes the evidence of marchers as gospel but ignores the claims of soldiers that they were under fire themselves.  Where did the IRA go on that day?  Free Derry was an IRA stronghold that was guarded by patrolled by armed men - it was a RUC and army no-go area.  The claim that they had an armed presence there on the day seems perfectly reasonable to me.  In fact the idea that they had no part in the day at all (apart from a few men chased off by civilians) seems ludicrous.<br/><br/>Overall this is quite good - the march is well handled and feels chaotic and confused, leading to the deaths.  However the final half hour  is pure fiction and is an exercise is clumsy finger pointing.  With the enquiry still going on, why don't we wait just wait to see what the outcome of that is?  Why do filmmakers feel they have carte-blanche to rewrite history, using or discarding evidence as they see fit.  Worth watching for the harrowing depiction of events spinning out of control but please look into the evidence yourself - don't just assume that you can tell what is made up and which bits aren't.  6 out of 10 (but only for the excellent hand-held camera coverage of the march)."

","As I really don't know anything about the events depicted in this film, I can't say whether it's a realistic or biased account of what happened. As ""just"" a film, I found it to be very good.<br/><br/>The documentary style of shooting it works most of the time (the constant fade ins/outs really bothered me though), and the film builds up tension and keeps you watching. The acting is also good. Nesbitt skillfully manages to switch moods depending on who he is talking to, all with remarkable ease. Also, kudos to the actor portraying the commander (or whatever you call it) of the British paras. He doesn't seem to be acting at all, it's like you're really watching a documentary when he is on screen.<br/><br/>Towards the end, the film does tend to skip realism a bit, as it seems to side with the demonstrators a tad too much, while showing off all English soldiers as cold blooded killers. On the whole though, a very watchable film. [8/10]"

It was a real consciousness raiser for me.<br/><br/>My biases notwithstanding, this movie is as a hypnotic account of a confusing episode of an even more confusing time. It has the task of representing the mindset of the times, the mindsets, I should say, while still making it into a spontaneous narrative.<br/><br/>I'm not an expert so I cannot vouch for the authenticity of any of this, but I feel I can believe all of it. There is a tendency for us to demarcate history from real life. A million deaths is a statistic as Stalin said. But here I really feel history and the lives of regular people converge in a devastating way.<br/><br/>At its heart I suppose the movie is a mystery. Not so much who-done-it but a why-did-it. I really felt while I was watching, all the chaos and threat that leads to tragedy while still feeling baffled and disorientated throughout. It feels like a documentary. The dialogue is spontaneous but still rich with nuance. The cinematography is candid and even shaky, giving it an often hypnotic, Blair Witch quality.<br/><br/>A movie to never forget."

Cooper wanted to develop a pan religion civil rights movement to counteract the violent nationalist and loyalist groups.<br/><br/>Intercut with Cooper organising the march are the British troops setting up roadblocks and barricades to prevent the march going much further due to newly introduced restrictions on marches.<br/><br/>When some rebellious youth start to to throw bricks at the troops they are met with a disproportionate response as the army shoot at some of the protesters which lead to thirteen people being left for dead.<br/><br/>The events ended up being a prime propaganda tool for the IRA. It turned many of the Irish against the presence of the mainland troops and set back the civil rights movement and any hope of a peaceful resolution to the Troubles.<br/><br/>Greengrass's documentary approach does not leave much for characterisation. Apart from Cooper, many of the people are painted in broad strokes with Tim Piggott-Smith's Major Ford being the main hissable villain.<br/><br/>Greengrass also does well to recreate the early 1970s setting and look. The editing might be jarring but the art direction, costumes and make up are well realised."
"Leofwine_draca","6","2","2","27 January 2017"," Greengrass's powerful style was present from the start
","I wanted to see Bloody Sunday because it was the first film directed by Paul Greengrass, one of my favourite directors working today thanks to his efforts in the likes of his three BOURNE films and UNITED 93. I'm pleased to report that Greengrass's trademark stylistic touches - shaky, hand-held camera-work, sudden zooms, a documentary-like feel - are all present even at this stage, making for a film that looks very good.<br/><br/>The story itself is the true-life tale about a notorious massacre perpetuated by British soldiers in Northern Ireland in 1972. Everybody knows what happened - much as in UNITED 93 - but Greengrass's gritty realism makes this a hugely suspenseful tale without having to rely on the usual suspense-building tactics like ominous music and the like. Greengrass is content to let the tale tell itself, and the film works well as a result. He's also careful not to take sides, showing the reality from both the British and the Irish. Some fine performances, including a career-best James Nesbit in the closing scenes, round out a solid effort."
"CinemaClown","Null","2","2","27 April 2016"," Powerful, Provocative & Prompting, Bloody Sunday Is Essential Viewing.
","Powerful, provocative & prompting, Bloody Sunday is a meticulously researched, expertly crafted & thoroughly gripping recreation of the Bogside massacre that occurred in the Northern Ireland town of Derry when British troops opened fire on civilians during a protest march, killing 14 & wounding just as many in the process.<br/><br/>Dramatising the events that led to the tragic incident on January 30, 1972, Bloody Sunday follows a civil right activist named Ivan Cooper who was the central organiser of the peaceful rally against internment that ended when British army paratroopers began firing on the unarmed demonstrators in full view of the public & the press.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Paul Greengrass, the movie sets its foreboding tone right within the opening segment after which it takes a step back to put its pieces on the board but once the stage is set, it explodes & moves forward with stunning immediacy. Greengrass' direction is at its very best when things go south & the whole episode is extensively detailed in the script.<br/><br/>Cinematography employs the quasi-documentary-style to film the entire event as it unfolds, thus bringing the viewers right into the conflict, while the frenetic hand-held camera-work further reflects the chaotic nature of such circumstances. Editing is slick for the most part, music is nearly absent and its cast contributes with convincing performances, playing their given roles with utmost sincerity.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Bloody Sunday is a fiercely directed, deftly scripted, viciously photographed, skilfully edited & brilliantly performed movie that brings the dreadful event to life with remarkable precision, brims with intense emotions from start to finish, and not only works as a riveting thriller but also as an unsettling documentary. Disturbing & disquieting but essential viewing nonetheless, Bloody Sunday is strongly recommended."

","I only first learned of Bloody Sunday on its thirtieth anniversary, less than a year before this movie came out. But even if you know absolutely nothing about the event, the movie will probably blow you away. We first see how, as Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt) announces the march, the British army basically says that if the marchers get shot, it's their own fault. Later, a British general explains that there will be violence (meaning that the British army will perpetrate it).<br/><br/>And then, there's the massacre. It may have been the most evil, vicious thing that the British government ever did in Northern Ireland, analogous to what they did in Amritsar, what the Japanese did in Nanking, and what the US did in My Lai. Following the massacre, the army proceeds to plant weapons on people, so as to make them look like terrorists. As Cooper explains: ""You have given the IRA its greatest victory."" Anyway, ""Bloody Sunday"" is definitely a movie that I recommend, especially when we claim to be fighting terrorism. The situation in Northern Ireland may be a controversial one, but this movie shows just what it is like to live there and have experienced this event. A very good debut for director Paul Greengrass (currently nominated for Best Director for ""United 93"")."

","I've just seen this film, and give it a 8/10 rating, it is for me, an Irishman living in the South, a terrifying account of a day which will always be indelibly stamped on my memory. The national newspapers carried the images of the slain in graphic detail, which to a child (as I was then), became the dawning of the realisation of the turmoil which was Northern Ireland of the early 70's. I did not understand then, why they were shot, and sadly after 30+ years we still do not know the reason why the Paras opened fire. This movie does give an accurate dipiction and the acting is brilliant, especially the Para officers who are incredibly believable. I can see where film goers on the other side of the Atlantic Pond, got impatient with the dialog and shaky camera work, this is not easy viewing.However for me it was as if those terrible black and white images carried on the national press the following day, suddenly came to life in raw power, well done to the makers, powerful stuff. I also wish that commentators to this great website, would refrain from their political bias and comment on the film. Who cares what side you are from ? it's got nothing to do with this film."

","Shot in a hand-held documentary style, this conveyed the feelings of anger on the one hand and indifference on the other that lead to the killing of 13 people.<br/><br/>It is clear why so many turned to the IRA after the tragedy of this event and perhaps puts some of the terrorism of the ensuing years into context. That is not to say that perhaps there were some omissions. I thought it didn't quite convey the fear the soldiers felt that might have caused them to fire, it is assumed that they did so with little provocation. Maybe this was true. On the whole it does tend to cast them as heartless b***ards intent on zero tolerance and they were one dimensional compared to the Irish characters. It is never really clear why they pulled the triggers.<br/><br/>However, it is plain to see that this event set the tone for the remainder of the decade and hopefully a similar massacre will never be purpotrated by the British army, especially on people with whom we share this group of islands.<br/><br/>On whether another film made to redress the balance on events in places such as Enniskillen, Omagh and Brighton should be produced, I'm not sure. It probably wouldn't achieve anything.<br/><br/>Hopefully, we've moved on from all this and the peace process is irreversible. It was interesting to see Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness walking into Westminster today.

"butterfinger","Null","6","11","24 October 2004"," Gripping
","Paul Greengrass's Bloody Sunday is an exiting new film that deserves much attention for its full-throttle evocation of the milieu of 'Bloody Sunday', in which Irish citizens in a peaceful protest for independence from Britain were killed by British troops. The film doesn't raise any controversial questions-it is a simple criticism of the way the troops acted-but I was fully immersed by Greengrass's stunning, semi-documentary style and James Nesbitt's passionate and nuanced performance as the leader of the protest. Any director who works with Nesbitt in the future is striking gold; few actors can have subtlety as well as power-that is something only the greats are blessed with. Editor Clare Douglas makes a major mistake: the constant scenes in the British troops headquarters are unnecessary and interfere with the films gripping pace. But the jump cuts are done well and the no-nonsense fade-out/fade-in style gets us right to the meat of the picture.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass is a muscular filmmaker with a highly personal style but I am worried that he may be on the verge of becoming a hype artist. The next film he got under his belt after this one was the awfully indulgent The Bourne Supremacy. The fact that he has made several films (some for TV) that criticize the British government makes me think he has convictions as a filmmaker; he isn't a style-crazy fool. I just hope that he makes the right choicesÂ… Footnote: Bloody Sunday has been criticized as being an anti-British film; this is almost as absurd as saying that The Murder of Emmett Till is an anti-white film or that Schindler's List is an anti-German film. I just hope that the anti-British fools who keep running their mouths off don't continue to be thought as being in cahoots with Paul Greengrass."

Everything from the visual style to the sound comes across as if there was really a documentary crew following the events of that day. The actor's performance are so fluid and reactive of the films atmosphere that you completely forget all together that you are watching a narrative film. Understand that this means that this is truly unlike your normal movie, even a historically based one at that. People have complained of the camera shakiness and even the unability to understand everything that is being said. But when watching this you have to understand that in order to make a documentary style film, you have to shoot...well.... documentary style. Which means no lighting set ups... which they didn't have... or even having everyone and everything being said perfectly recorded. However.. certain dialogue from different main characters... even that which was off in the distance could be heard clearly for the sake of communicating what was going on with the characters.. but apart from that... it is pretty raw.

"shengyang","2","16","39","25 April 2003"," Blatant propaganda film: British = Bad! Irish Catholic = Good!
","There is enough audience manipulation and fudging of the facts here to make Oliver Stone proud. Didactic movies such as this are annoying, no matter how good the director's technical skill, because they talk down to you and tell you what you ought to believe, based on a conveniently selected subset of the facts. For instance, what were the IRA doing that day in this supposed IRA stronghold? We are not told. It is certainly legitimate for the director to question the official British version of events, but he fails to apply the same skeptical standards to the other side. <br/><br/>While this docu-drama fails as a documentary, does it at least work as a drama? Yes and no. One the one hand, I found the hand-held ""war correspondent"" camerawork to be very effective. In addition, the director was able to elicit wonderfully naturalistic performances from his actors. But there are narrative failures. Strangely, the motivations of the British paratroopers to kill are not explored at all. One minute they are there with a disciplined plan to break up the march and arrest activists, and the next they are shown running amuck like crazed psychopaths shooting people execution-style. The film initially takes great pains to show the professionalism of the British troops as they organize, and then portrays them as behaving completely unprofessionally in the field. My guess is that this incongruity is a result of the director having left out some inconvenient facts that would weaken the anti-British moral judgement he is pushing. It's tough to maintain a consistent story line when you are so busy coming up with speculative embellishments and stripping out what you don't want the audience to know."

","Unlike most who comment on this film I've been in Northern Ireland & seen the petty, small minded, nastyness that really lies behind the so called ""noble cause"", a truth that lies in drug dealing, racketering, international terrorism & sheer thuggery. I find it ironic that there is also a complete lack of any sort of reference in this film to the Marxist roots of Irish terrorism & the support these people got from the US. This must be the only time that the people & government of the United States have given so much money, help & support to a band of Communists since the end of World War 2! What was Korea, Vietnam & the Cold War all supposed to be about then?<br/><br/>The production values of the film also lend nothing to the experience, it's cheap & awful, with a wiggling camera that looks as if it's been suspended from a yo-yo. As an experiment to try to convey the immediacey of the times it's a worthy experiment, but it just doesn't work. What I can't figure out is why the producers didn't register the similar criticism of the TV show ""This Life"" which used the same technique & attracted the same complaints. The accents I didn't have any trouble with, although I can understand why international audiences might.<br/><br/>The story itself is pure B-S, slanted to the Republican side it loses all credibility by the end. Did members of the IRA open fire? Do you think those involved will ever come forward & admit to it? Are they even still alive? Certain political leaders try to convey that the army had never been shot at before Bloody Sunday, but anyone can read the coroners reports & see for themselves that the army had genuine concerns of ambush & sniper attacks. One major step forward though, for years the likes of Jerry ""I've Never Killed Anyone"" Adams referred to the protestors as ""peaceful marchers"", so at least this film has the guts to show that they were anything but peaceful. Such is the world of Northern Ireland, where the truth counts for nothing & if it rains on your day off ""It's the fault of the British Government"".<br/><br/>In conclusion then ""nothing"" is the word I would use for this film. It does little to shed new light, nothing to heal wounds, nothing to unveil the truth, nothing except to entrench existing views. It doesn't go into the Irish mentality that you can only solve problems with mindless violence, doesn't deal with the lack of sane community leadership, doesn't mention that the troops were there to initially protect the Catholics (which the Catholics welcomed) & that the progress that was being made regarding their problems was blown away by the mobs who rioted & expected to be rewarded for it afterwards.<br/><br/>The history of Northern Ireland in the last 40 years is undoubtedly a tragedy for all concerned & a litany of opportunities thrown away time & time again, but this film just deals with one fragment which is easily cast in a highly partisan light. Of course it could have dealt with the wider issues, but that would be to undermine the message it tries to peddle & would put the Irish republicans & their cronies in a bad light. The film could have dealt with the inability of the people to accept the responsibility for the increasing mess they were getting themselves into, but it doesn't.<br/><br/>0/10, a pile of rubbish, AVOID AVOID!"

","Great style to this film, makes you feel like you're one of the marchers or someone in the British hierarchy who made the decisions. I'm sure that's what the director intended. I was hit very hard emotionally from this film. I knew general information about Bloody Sunday, I'm of Irish heritage and still have quite a few relatives living in Ireland, mostly Donegal. From hearing their first-hand accounts of the happenings during the early 70's, I gathered a little more of a story-telling perspective of the Troubles, not one which was politically motivated as my relatives, and from what I've heard most Irish, don't condone ANY type of violence, whether it be anti-British or anti-IRA. I think this film carried off the events brilliantly, as gritty a look that I can remember. It's still shocking what occurred, but I, for one, can only look to the recent past and hope that all violence will end forever."

Can't say I blame the cinema operators. It's one thing to watch a sappy movie and cry coz you know it never happened but it's another thing to watch a movie that is based on actual events with characters that were real people. It was enough to make me cry just watching how the soldiers gun down the civilians, who, on the most part, just wanted the opportunity to express themselves, even if they knew it was a losing battle. Paul Greengrass did a marvellous job with his style of direction and camera work, focusing on the short sharp conversations they marchers had with each other. He focused his efforts on the character developments whilst concentrating on their efforts to carry on with the march irregardless. It is a great piece of work and equally great story telling."

","This docudrama recreates the filmmakers' view of the events in the Northern Ireland city of Derry on January 30, 1972. It starts by showing an announcement by the British outlining the restrictions against public assembly in Northern Ireland. A protest march is clearly not approved.<br/><br/>The night before a planned civil rights march, Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt from ""Waking Ned Devine""), a Protestant member of Parliament representing the Irish Catholic district where the illegal march will take place, is making preparations. We see him moving through the streets, greeting people and trying to reinforce peaceful, non-confrontational interactions with the ""occupying"" British military force. We see that there are doubts about whether the march should go on and whether or not the more radical marchers will remain peaceful, but Cooper is resolute: ""If we don't march, civil rights is dead in this city.""<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the leaders of the British military know that a march is planned the next day. The upper-level officers give the directive that success will be defined by the number of so-called ""hooligans"" who are arrested. They make detailed plans for exactly where the march will go and where they will attempt to make the arrests. They spend little time planning what forms of force are appropriate.<br/><br/>And so the stage is set. With thousands of marchers, most will be peaceful while a few will inevitably push the boundaries. And on the military side, some will have measured responses while others will overreact.<br/><br/>The film style is intense. One is reminded of Black Hawk Down, with the washed out, almost monochromatic, color palette. Another similarity is the shaky handheld camera work, although I believe this film goes too far (TurboSpastiCam(tm)). But a contrasting aspect of the style here is to cut to black and then pause briefly between scenes, which gives you a moment to think and catch your breath. The accents are difficult to follow, not just at the beginning of the film but throughout, and subtitles would probably help.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly good, making you feel as if you are watching a true documentary, with James Nesbitt clearly standing out. He has the most interesting part, and he lets you inside to feel what he is feeling. The film has won many awards, including the top prize at the Berlin International Film Festival and an audience award at Sundance.<br/><br/>After the film is over, one is left to wonder just how accurately it portrays the events. Not having studied the history, I can't say for sure, although I suspect the film is somewhat biased, but is probably not blatantly so.<br/><br/>If you have trouble with shaking cameras, you should stay very far away from this film. For everyone else, this film is worth watching. And if you wait for the DVD, you can decide if subtitles help.<br/><br/>Seen on 10/13/2002."

"lilitou","10","6","13","12 September 2003"," Wrenching drama, not as biased as expected
","I could not possibly offer an opinion on this film's accuracy in its depiction of Bloody Sunday.  As I'm separated from the events by nationality and age--30th January, 1972 being nearly 11 years before my birth--I have no better idea than anyone else as to what actually happened.  I know the death toll, I've read eyewitness accounts, I've studied the history, but that does not necessarily bring me any closer to the truth.<br/><br/>Having gotten the disclaimer out of the way, I thought this movie was brilliant. Paul Greengrass and his remarkable cast pulled together what could have been a disaster in the hands of a lesser moviemaker and turned it into a heart-wrenching, brutal docu-drama.  James Nesbitt turned in a fantastic performance as Ivan Cooper.  Even if the violence weren't so painful to watch, the film could still deeply affect the viewer simply because Nesbitt is so convincing as he moves from determination (and more than a bit of frustration) to shell-shocked despair.<br/><br/>I disagree with those who say that this film is heavily biased, or--even worse!--IRA propaganda.  If there is a bias, it is a slight one.  The IRA does not get a positive portrayal. Its sympathizers do, but not the IRA members shown seem just as unbending and unforgiving as some of the British soldiers.  For that matter, the stress and confusion the soliders must have been feeling at the time is displayed rather well.  Confusing messages and conflicting orders only increase the chaos until bullets are flying everywhere.<br/><br/>The accents were difficult to understand at first, but I got used to them as the movie progressed.  (Americans don't get much exposure to British and Irish accents that thick, as the movies that tend to make it over here have either been redubbed for clarity or were shot with American audiences in mind. We're spoiled.)  The jerky, handheld camera work increased the confusion of the rioting and atmosphere of 'gritty realism' that Greengrass seemed to want.  Stylistically, my only objection is all of the fading to black between scenes. There are places where that tactic works, but it gets tiresome after the first few times. The film was originally shot for television, however, so the fadeouts could be a result of the difficulty in transferring from tv-movie to the big screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this film a heartbreaking vision of actual hellish events, truly depicted as one man saw them.

The film marks the 30th anniversary.<br/><br/>The screenplay does not, as some have inevitably claimed, act as a propaganda feature for Irish nationalism. It goes some way to showing how the Parachute Regiment were given orders on the ground which went beyond their orders from a confused base, though demonstrating how individual soldiers were responsible for their actions.<br/><br/>The overall atmosphere of confusion on all sides is added to by the cinematography, with handheld cameras used in crowd scenes. The gloomy lighting and drab colours, in a battle-scarred part of Derry, bring the period back to life, as do the mechanical telephones which ring constantly.<br/><br/>At the centre of the film James Nesbitt gives a superb and striking performance as Ivan Cooper, who at all times is trying to avoid the outbreak of violence as the situation slides away from him. Tim Pigott-Smith, as the Parachute Regiment commander, is believably aggressive and ignorant.<br/><br/>It is a slight pity that Ivan Cooper is misrepresented as a Westminster MP (he was actually an MP at Stormont) and as ""the MP for this area"" (he actually represented the Mid Derry division, while the march took place through the Foyle division which was represented by John Hume)."

I found it totally engrossing from beginning to end and had more of an understanding of what happened on that awful Sunday 30 years ago the after effects of which are still being felt in the North of Ireland.  What starts out as a peaceful march under the leadership of the Protestant MP of the area quickly turns into a scene of carnage as the paramilitaries fire on the unarmed marchers who are defenceless against the fusilade of bullets. It is sickening what results from this and the inquiry, which was originally blanketed in lies and conspiracy and whitewashed to protect the guilty has now being reinstigated and hopefully the truth of that dreadful day will emerge. At times I had to remind myself that is was actors on screen, it is powerful acting. Kudos to all on the excellence.  8 out of 10."

","Terrific movie. It not only depicts the horrific events of 1/30/1972 in Derry, but also gives a glimpse (and only that) of the lives of people in that time and place. <br/><br/>Knowing what happened on Bloody Sunday does not keep one from being pulled into the world of ""Bloody Sunday"". <br/><br/>Much of the dialogue, at least to this listener, could not be understood. Which, in this case, posed no problems at all--the impact of the movie was not deflected at all by not understanding the specific, commonplace words of the working class characters. <br/><br/>For those interested the inflections and cadences of urban Northern Ireland are difficult for Americans to understand. Added to this is the very rapid and sometimes mumbling delivery of the actors. But anyone who thinks they need to know EXACTLY what lines a certain actor is delivering to understand the story is wrong.<br/><br/>The scenes of combat (or slaughter, if you will) are almost too powerful. The confusion that reigns among the three main groups--the British Army, the Civil Rights marchers and the disaffected, lumpenized youth is very well depicted."

","Here we go again...another piece of one sided political propaganda which fails to give a realistic rounded view of this incident when IRA terrorists shot at British troops under cover of a local riot.<br/><br/>There is little mention of this perspective, this would hardly suit the political agenda which this film waves loudly. There is no discussion of the events leading up to this incident ie that large numbers of police and innocent civilians had been bombed and killed by terrorists under similar circumstances.<br/><br/>The so called civil rights march also included people calling these terrorists, political prisoners, presumably they would believe that those Al Queda prisoners in Cuba are political prisoners also.<br/><br/>The film ignores the facts in the search for emotional fairytale land.

"phranger","2","8","21","30 November 2002"," Limited contents urgently conveyed.
","I agree with most of the points made here about Bloody Sunday by people who liked it, but these points are my main reason for not liking it. The film is made for TV and adopts what Janyeap quite rightly a ""faux documentary"" format. That is, the color is dull and cold, and the contrast high. Cuts are frequent, and so are camera movements. Everything is framed close. You need an Irish ear to get all the dialogue. (No, the shots aren't jerky, except on purpose to underline ""high"" moments.) All that could be accepted, if it did not also impose the point of view of on-the-spot news shooting. There is no background at all, only the simplest dynamics, linear development and no real center, just disorder, urgency, emotion.<br/><br/>If you come into the film with the belief that one unit of the Royal British Army went on a nice Sunday duck shoot at a peaceful march, and got thirteen Catholics dead, and good reports all around due to the efficient propaganda system in place (and now a fine life in retirement), well, you will learn practically nothing from the film - only perhaps the point, made near the end, that this was the IRA's greatest battle, killing the civil rights movement and bringing hundreds of recruits. Perhaps it was, if you take ""battle"" to indicate a rate of death per hour.<br/><br/>If you don't agree with the preamble in the last paragraph, then, as several postings here show, the film will not convince you one wit. The best that can be said about it is that it's a nice memorial intended for those who agree with the preamble, quite well made in its way. Still, whether you want to sit through a 107-minute memorial depends on your feelings for TV news shoots."

","Now I have to admit while watching the movie, I hated the unsteadiness of the camera and the fact the whole film was skipping scenes abruptly. It made me feel uneasy seriously. It was interesting that the British army just lied about the protesters that some of them had firearms. I bet when they told the police about what happened, I say inside, they were peeing their pants. The ones who killed those unarmed citizens should be in jail for live. <br/><br/>It was such a cowardly action to just kill whoever was on their path, the 14 people who died that faithful day, didn't deserve this. The families should've been given a apology like a year after it happened. David Cameron (Brexit Escapee) shouldn't be the one giving it 38 years later, it should've been the army. To be honest, that was wayyyy too late, it won't bring back the victims. I honestly can't imagine how stressful and upsetting it is for the families to have their loved ones being killed in a pointless act. Also the ones who miraculously survived and will remember this tragedy for the rest of their lives. <br/><br/>May the 14 men rest in peace<3"
"eshwarmail","8","1","1","8 January 2017"," A powerful gritty drama with excellent acting and cinematography
","Reviewed December 2011<br/><br/>I am an admirer of Paul Greengrass movies mainly for the editing and camera work which led me to watch this. An up close account of the tragic events that turned a peaceful Irish 1972 Civil rights march to a deadly massacre which ended with 13 civilians killed and twice injured kick-starting a political blame game. <br/><br/>Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt), the Member of Parliament for the Irish town of Derry leads the charge of a Civil rights march. The British government bans the protest making the march illegal and also involves the military to crush the situation. Like any other riot anywhere else in the world, one thing leads to another involving rowdy hooligans, trigger happy policing and groups with vested interests. The movie divides its focus on a close look from Ivan Cooper's stand point, the British Military view and a couple of families that were affected by this day. <br/><br/>Keeping in mind that it would get offensive for the real victims if there is even a single point in the script that justifies the military action, the writers and the directer tread carefully and mostly plays safe. Paul Greengrass shows his early taste for editing and camera work, but his talent is not on best display here. James Nesbitt does a terrific job as the man edging on emotional crisis with the way the day has turned out, but has to maintain his saneness and composure to concentrate on the operational details. Sometimes gets a bit melodramatic and too emotional, but they must have been apt for the circumstance. Doesn't push it as hard as it could have and gets a little biased on the victims side. It has great moments placed in between mediocre ones. <br/><br/>I wouldn't say it is a great movie, but does enough to use the emotional depth of this true story."
"ianlouisiana","8","1","1","29 June 2015"," Two Tribes
","In 1972 the British Army was still bemused as to how it had become to be regarded as an invading force when only 3 years earlier it had been welcomed by the Catholic community as a means of protecting them against Protestant aggression. The Marxist IRA had done its work well and the Brits were hated,despised and murdered if it could be done with no risk to the killers. The Army was embittered and resentful,confused as to its role . Bloody Sunday was a disaster waiting to happen in a testosterone - fuelled cauldron of mutual distrust and hatred. In Mr Greengrass's film the blame for this tragedy is laid firmly at the door of the British Government. The only innocents are those that died. Mr J.Nesbitt is superb as the Stormont MP leading the march to protest against Internment. As in real life,the moment the first stone is thrown all bets are off. The two sides confront one another,and not surprisingly,the one with the biggest guns wins. Over 40 years have passed and vested interests amongst Republicans and senior British officials have ensured that the truth will never be known. The film is chaotic,jagged,noisy and bloody.There is no time for reflection,again as in real life. As details of the casualties filter through,the senior RUC man - hardly a provo sympathiser - says to a clearly shocked army officer,""Is this what you call a measured response?"". The truest and most significant line in the whole film."

","On 30th January 1972, British parachute troops shoot against a peaceful march of disarmed Irish civilian claiming for civil rights. After the massacre, twenty-seven civilian are shot, being thirteen dead and fourteen wounded. This movie is one of the best of the year. The dramatization is so perfect that gives the sensation to the viewer of a documentary. The use of hand-held cameras provides the feeling of confusion, like the images of correspondents in the war. The fact is true, really happened, but the fictional dialogs certainly are part of a dramatization. This event is a wound in the flesh of the Northern Irish and it is the theme of maybe the most beautiful song of the U2. This UK/Ireland production is a wonderful movie, which certainly deserves an Oscar. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Domingo Sangrento"" (""Bloody Sunday"")"
"Lupercali","5","6","15","12 September 2003"," How NOT to make a pseudo-documentary
","I've read review after review stating that this movie is made in a documentary style. I don't agree. The purpose of a documentary is to convey information. Generally there will be a narrator. If there isn't, then there will at least be an introduction; a background of some sort.<br/><br/>
There is none of this. To many who weren't already familiar with the events and background to the massacre, this movie must have been a frustrating and confusing affair. Scenes shift leaving you with no firm sense of the geography of the action, which is really crucial to understanding events on a purely physical level.<br/><br/>Worse, the film tries to have it both ways by having 'characters', except these characters are so poorly realised that even the major ones are sketchy in the extreme, and the incidental ones are sometimes plain bewildering. I felt little compassion for most characters in the movie, because: the producers evidently didn't feel it was important enough to give the slightest background or character development. Even if this HAD been a real documentary, the narrator would have at least told us SOMETHING about the subjects being filmed.<br/><br/>Oh, I don't know. Really - I don't know how anyone could make a movie about such an emotionally charged and compelling subject, and end up making it dull, but I found myself alternating between boredom and annoyance for at least the first half of the movie. Admittedly it did pick up somewhat towards the end, but even then the emotional impact was blunted by a total lack of identification with any of the characters.<br/><br/>There were a few exceptions: the British army officer who asked ""why not just let them march"", and then sat impotently and listened to the thing unfold. But again I find myself thinking, this could have been done so much more effectively in a conventional dramatic narrative.<br/><br/>It wasn't a bad film: the acting was excellant, from the POV of it appearing genuinely spontaneous (in fact I suspect much of it was improvised) but my main impression was of a well intentioned film with a talented crew and cast simply going wrong because they tackled it the wrong way."
"cls_y2k","10","6","15","28 January 2002"," A Credit to the victims of Bloody Sunday!
","This film was a real credit to Paul Greengrass and the Bloody Sunday Victims a film that documents the evidence given to Lord Saville's enquiry on that fateful day.<br/><br/>A film that seems biased but sadly is quite true and shows the embarrassment of British forces on that day.<br/><br/>It's a film about a Protestant SDLP MP called Ivan Cooper, who fought for Catholic civil rights and led a march to end internment in which Catholics were arrested and imprisoned without trial.<br/><br/>The civil rights march took place on January 30th 1972.  It ended with 13 unarmed civilians killed in cold blood by the British Army's 1st Parachute Regiment.<br/><br/>The film is a gritty insight into the actions with different scenes representing different parts of evidence, which was, given to the enquiry. It was filmed in Derry and is quite realistic to the march on that day. People that were in attendance on that day were also used in the film. Actor James Nesbit also a Protestant Played the role of Ivan Cooper quite well and Gerard McSorley also commanded his role greatly of RUC Chief Inspector Frank Lagan a man who showed deep emotion in realising a British Army disaster.  Tim Piggot Smith can also be commended for his role of Major General Ford who took command of the mission that day.<br/><br/>The film is quite unbiased as it shows the disaster causing actions of both sides showing British Soldiers shooting on a crowd of running unarmed civilians and supposed IRA involvement so not many people could argue that this film was propaganda of sorts but a quite well directed insight and a credit to international Human rights."
"jaredmobarak","10","5","12","21 August 2007"," It's just a nice Sunday strollBloody Sunday
","When Paul Greengrass was named as the new director in the Bourne series, people had no idea who he was. When he began filming United 93, people wondered what a Brit was doing telling the story of a plane full of American heroes. The answers to these questions always seemed to make mention of the film Bloody Sunday. That reasoning, upon seeing Greengrass's first major film, holds up strongly. What is now my favorite film of his, the story of that fateful day where a peaceful civil rights march ended in bloodshed and murder by the government, is portrayed as realistically and heart-wrenchingly as possible without it being actual documentary footage. It takes guts being English and deciding to take on a tale of injustice by his people over the Irish. When I saw United 93, I left the theatre thinking that no one could have done it any better; this film paved the way, ushering in a new artist able to put emotion and tragedy on screen without ever letting even one moment seem false.<br/><br/>The hand-held filming technique that he has utilized so well in his subsequent films is on display throughout. Always inside the action, the camera follows Parliament member Ivan Cooper while he goes around Derry readying his constituents for their peace march to the civil rights rally. He is a man that is loved by all for both his charisma and his willingness to be among the people during their fight for the rights they deserve. The younger generation and high ranking members of the IRA know him and respect what he is doing, but they feel peace won't cause change, that they must fight fire with fire. Because of this, and some previous altercations that left British troops injured or killed, the English government has decided to go in and make an example of their power. What begins as a covert operation, to accompany their roadblocks and strong numbers around the town, with a mission to grab IRA members on their wanted list, soon escalates to a massacre of civilians at the hands of adrenaline pumping soldiers who had to wait too long to get out into the action.<br/><br/>All the acting is phenomenal across the board. Young Gerry, played by Declan Duddy, has just gotten out of jail and decides to go with friends to the march, knowing he is risking getting caught again. Duddy does well portraying the love for his girlfriend and his desire to stay outside for her; he knows when he has gotten too close to the troops and tries to go with Cooper's group to the rally, but his mates won't let him. When his cousin is killed with a bullet from the troops, troops whom were supposed to be equipped only with rubber, all that goes away. The horror and shock of what has begun to transpire never leaves his face or actions and what eventually happens to his character is truly tragic and disgusting on the part of the British. On their side, both Nicholas Farrell and Gerard McSorley are great as the men behind the scenes, listening to what is happening on the streets. McSorley's police chief tries to tell Farrell that they should just let the march happen because the kids out there could be too dangerous otherwise. Farrell speaks of how they will use minimum force and throughout the course of events, he constantly tells his men to stand down while they take it upon themselves to move when they have the chance. He is powerless from his position and he knows what kind of tragedy has occurred and that it will end up being on his watch. Standing idle for too long made the soldiers antsy and when they had the opportunity they took it. After the incident, the conversations among the men are atrocious. Bragging about how many they got and the invigorating feeling of it all is appalling, however, not as bad as the one soldier among them who felt remorse at all points, even screaming about the ceasefire while his compatriots continued mowing down innocents. What he ends up doing could possibly be looked upon as worse than the men who actually killed people; his soldier that could have been a voice of truth ends up being a disgusting display of hiding ones' guilt.<br/><br/>Shining above all, though, is James Nesbitt as Cooper. An actor that doesn't get enough recognition or work this side of the Atlantic, despite nice turns in Waking Ned Devine and Millions, he is fantastic. His modesty and compassion with the people is contagious at the beginning. He goes through the streets telling the troops that the march will be going, but it will be peaceful, and with every young hooligan he passes he goes to them and says to calm down and join their non-violent demonstration. He tries his hardest to use his political position to stop the riot that begins, but his idealism never prepares him for what happens. What began as Irishmen throwing rocks became two innocents shot down in cold blood. When the hooligans run away to the rally, all hell breaks loose with women and children needing to take cover from the gunfire. Nesbitt's reaction when his friend Barney tries to surrender is heart-breaking and when he goes to the hospital after it all, he is absolutely genuine in his grief. The glue that holds everything in the movie together, Nesbitt's concluding speech to the media is hard to watch. A man full of hope for freedom has finally had his eyes opened to the violence and physical tyranny at hand. He is correct when he says that the incident ended the civil rights movement, from that point on there could be no more peaceful marches. Bullets needed to be matched with bullets and young men on the fence of battle were finally swayed to join the war full steam ahead."

","I, as many others, grew up with the U2 song ""Bloody Sunday"" and knew vaguely it referred to some tragedy but never had a clear picture of what ""Bloody Sunday"" actually was.  When I saw this film playing at a nearby theater, it grabbed my attention since I wanted to know more.  I skimmed some reviews and it seemed pretty good.  Now that I've seen it, all I can say is that this is an amazing and powerful snapshot of what happened on that day.  It was quite a roller-coaster ride, tense the whole time as you know a horrific tragedy is about to unfold.  The filmmaker shows us the characters up close and personal, from the Irish politicians trying to peacefully organize and resist the British, to the British soldiers who are sick of being shot at and dying here and there over time, without any chance at revenge.  They are angry and hungry for blood.  Most of the Irish people and their politicians try to embrace the ideals of MLK and Ghandi, but ultimately the few violent radicals amongst them bring an enormous, tragic and gut-wrenching response of force from the British.  The faux-documentary style can at times be dizzying and disorienting, but this film looks and feels like it's made from 16mm shot in 1972.  It really brings you there and gives a sharp edge of reality.  The haunting image of a horribly shaken Irish leader, Ivan Cooper (played by James Nesbitt) as he staggers out while reading the names of the dead is one that won't leave you anytime soon.  This film will also give you some understanding as to the anger of the IRA.  Highly recommended to all, although it may be upsetting and confusing for young children.  But everyone should know this history."

","As an American dissident and Mayflower descendant, I am both English and Irish, having both bully and rebel in my blood. It was therefore with complete empathy and fear that I watched this movie. Have you ever been harassed by the police for exercising your 1st Amendment rights, threatened with arrest for carrying a sign and drinking coffee at a restaurant? If so, and it's been done repeatedly, you'll know what a fine feeling it is, as it was for those marchers, to finally say, ""Enough. I'm not going to take it anymore."" <br/><br/>Watching the lying by the British brass, done much more skillfully by the top dog than the cowed troop, I am reminded of Ashcroft, Rumsfeld and the entire Bush administration. They pretend to be patriotic, getting rid of the terrorists, but wind up planting nail bombs on the dead innocent. This is what we're looking at in the U.S. with a Red Sox fan killed by the 'pepper gun', a non-lethal weapon, in Boston with a gun meant for the 'dissidents at the DEmocratic National Convention' (i.e., people like me). When people have the weapons and go out to meet the protesters as these soldiers did, they are ready and armed to kill. Troops /police in the confusion of a protest will use whatever weapons they have with them: so Kent State, so the Red Sox celebration and a dead fan, so the Inauguration will be with troops and police brought in from all over to quell the furious masses (such as moi). When a government is not OF the people, as the Derry government definitely wasn't, the resentment is real, true and deserved. So also is our federal government, one by the corporate 1% who rule us, who manipulate their lackeys (i.e., the Bush mafiosi). Look for more violence in our future: we got rid of one king George. As the Irish did, we'll get rid of another set of bullies.<br/><br/>Great movie, because it shows so well the confusion, the horror, the lying and the deliberate planning to kill that was done by the Brits.

","Both sides concur that the eponymous civil rights demonstration in Derry, Northern Ireland, ended with a skirmish between some of the demonstrators and British army paratroopers. Ultimately, 13 demonstrators were dead and 14 in the hospital, one of whom later died. None of the casualties were British troops. A formal inquest proclaimed that the soldiers had defended its position against armed demonstrators. Some of the soldiers involved were later honored by the crown.<br/><br/>Outside this understanding, there's a dispute so profound and indignant that three decades later Bloody Sunday is still an open gash in the lingering, disputed account of the British in Northern Ireland. Paul Greengrass' Golden Bear-winning film is shot on 16mm, made in the manner of a documentary. It encompasses roughly 24 hours, beginning on Saturday evening, and its central character is Ivan Cooper, a civil rights organizer in Derry. He was a Protestant MP from the nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party. Most of the 10,000 demonstrators on that Sunday would be Catholic. That a Protestant led them reveals the separation in the north between those who stood in unity with their co-religionists, and those of all beliefs who just wanted the British out.<br/><br/>Cooper is played by James Nesbitt as a completely excellent guy, hopeful, diligent, who walks boldly through hazardous streets and has a good remark for everyone. He knows the day's demonstration has been prohibited by the British government but anticipates no conflict, as it will be diplomatic and peaceful. As Cooper distributes flyers in the streets, Greengrass intercuts measures by the British army, which is fully resolute to take a muscular position against ""hooliganism."" Several British soldiers have been killed by the IRA, and this is an opportunity to settle scores. The British continue giving themselves tell-tale indications of how to prevent violence when they say things like, ""If they see the Paras, that'll inflame the situation."" So basically, the people demonstrating for their rights will only become violent if the troops try to stop them from demonstrating for their rights. Which they do. So the British knew the truth before the atrocity even occurred.<br/><br/>Greengrass also establishes some other characters, including a young man who kisses his girlfriend goodbye and assures his mother no hurt will come to him, classic threatening omens in a movie. And we meet the Derry police chief, troubled by the ferocious doggedness of the soldiers and asks, not irrationally, if it wouldn't be more prudent to just allow the march because it's clearly going to carry on anyhow. Greengrass reconstructs proceedings with striking realism. When he shows a movie marquee promoting the Schlesinger film Sunday Bloody Sunday, it's a tiny anomaly, a deliberate shot in a movie that aims for cinema verite. He's served by the incidence of thousands of volunteer extras, some having demonstrated on Bloody Sunday and are relatively playing themselves.<br/><br/>Cooper and the other influentials are on a truck which pilots the procession, and from their POV we can see that when the march avoids the army's spot, some hotheads instead start to throw rocks at them. At Major General's headquarters, commands are given to counter decisively. Data lines are obscured, orders are hazy as they dispatch down the pecking order, and soon rubber bullets and gas grenades are substituted by the shatter of actual bullets. Once this begins, we get the truest visceral sense of how difficult it must be to resist physical retaliation, and thus the true profundity of pacifism.<br/><br/>Greengrass sees marchers struggling to control some of their comrades who are armed, but his film is unmistakable in its conviction that the British fired first and without mercy, and he shows one injured demonstrator being eliminated execution-style. One of the marchers is based on Gerald Donaghey, who, after being wounded, was searched twice, first by doctors, then taken to an army section where he died. Soldiers then ""discovered"" nail bombs on his person that had been ""overlooked"" in the earlier searches. This is part of a frantic effort by the army to plant evidence and validate a slaughter. OK, there are two sides to the story, but 14 dead marchers alongside a complete lack of dead or wounded soldiers seems telling. The Greengrass standpoint reproduces the rage of the anti-British groups, and the army's self-satisfaction after being acquitted in the initial investigation was simply infuriating. This raw, ultimately brutalizing tragedy is an extremely valuable vision of what occurred that day. And as an act of filmmaking, it's stunning: A sense of urgent and present-tense reality pervades every powerhouse moment."

I don't think I'd understand the words even if they were spoken by Americans.<br/><br/>I don't doubt other peoples' comments that it's a very moving film, but it seems like a wasted effort if it's difficult to impossible to watch. Sort of like the Dogma films, which were similarly often good stories ruined by (intentionally) bad cinematography and sound (though at least when shown here they have subtitles)."

","Bloody Sunday is about the shootings dead of 14 civil rights marchers by the British army in derry during the conflict in NI. 90% of those killed in the conflict were killed by paramilitaries. However film-makers have decided to make a film about one of the few atrocities committed by the security forces.<br/><br/>The film is co-produced by an IRA sympathiser called Don Mullan. He has described the IRA campaign as a reaction to the violence of the state.<br/><br/>The propaganda line put forward by this film is that the nationalist community tried peaceful means for achieving civil rights but were just met by state violence and that the British crushed NICRA (as the CRM was called).<br/><br/>This contradicts with the facts. In order to get the viewer to believe this the film tells a number of lies 1. Ivan cooper says at the beginning of the film that there were no reforms introduced prior to 1972. This is a flat out lie. Loads of reforms had been introduced beginning in 1968. One man, one vote had been introduced, the B specials had been abolished for example.<br/><br/>2. Ivan cooper says at the end of the film that the civil rights movement had been destroyed. This is a flat out lie also. NICRA disbanded voluntarily in the early 1980's. The viewer is therefore misled into believing that there were no longer any peaceful alternatives to violence.<br/><br/>The film is extremely anti-British. One piece of anti-British hate-mongering is the message at the end that those who planned the operation were honoured by the queen. It is true that two of the senior officers in charge of the operation were later honoured by the queen. However no one who carried out any of the shootings or ordered any killings were honoured by the queen.<br/><br/>Do not believe the lies in this film. The brits were working on setting up a power-sharing arrangement at the time. What was planned was an arrest operation not a massacre as is implied by this film. Everyone of NICRA's demands were introduced by 1975. There were other options available to nationalists other than violence, contrary to the lies in this film!"

"sddavis63","3","4","10","23 December 2010"," A Chaotic Movie About A Chaotic Event
","""Bloody Sunday"" is a movie that might be best described as chaotic - which is surely not inappropriate for any movie dealing with the tragedies of Northern Ireland and in particular with the events of January 30, 1972 in Derry. This TV production was filmed in a quasi- documentary style, which perhaps added a touch of reality to what was happening but which, to me, also failed to engage. It largely follows the efforts of the Irish Catholic Member of Parliament Ivan Cooper to organize a peaceful protest march through the streets of Derry, only to be forcibly confronted by the British military. Cooper seems to have modelled his ""Civil Rights Association"" after figures who were noted for non-violence - particularly Ghandi and Martin Luther King, Jr. There's absolutely no doubt here that the movie takes sides - it's pro-Irish Catholic and anti-British Army. I don't know that I'd go so far as to declare it pro-IRA, though. The IRA doesn't actually get mentioned very often, the emphasis being on the contrast between the desire of the protesters for a peaceful march and the apparent over-reaction of British troops. The movie is far more interesting in its second half, once the confrontation begins. The lead up to the confrontation really didn't capture me all that much, but the events of the actual confrontation were realistically and graphically recreated.<br/><br/>I suppose that now (in 2010) before one falls into the trap of declaring this pro-IRA (or at least anti-British) propaganda, one has to take into account the results of the Saville Inquiry, which were made public in June 2010 and led to an apology from David Cameron - the British Prime Minister - in response. The closing captions of the movie certainly make clear that the sympathies of the producers were with the protesters.<br/><br/>I didn't consider this to be a great production, but it certainly gives a hint of what feelings were like in Northern Ireland in those troubled times, and it raises a lot of unsettling questions about the use of violence and what it accomplishes."
"Chris-195","6","4","10","1 September 2003"," Effective use of documentary style (spoilers0
","One of the few films I've seen where the documentary format seems, for the most part, to convince you that you are watching a documentary, and not a film. This may be more effective for US audiences, as I recognized none of the actors, but nonetheless the acting, sets, etc are so naturalistic that you soon find yourself sucked into this world. I'm sure a low budget necessitated some of this -- some shots are so dominated by close-ups you get the feeling that if the camera pulled back just a little more you'd see modern day Ireland in the background. The filmmakers turn this to their advantage, and I think this film probably looks much better than its budget would have led someone to believe it could have.<br/><br/>My only problem is a lack of details in some areas that would leave people unfamiliar with the events of Bloody Sunday confused. I admit, I knew very little about what happened beyond the fact that deaths occured and it set off much of the IRA activity of the 70s and beyond. I can't understand why a government would be so adamant about not allowing a parade to occur, even to the extent they'd send in military troops. What policies led to this kind of outrageous behavior? And on the other side of the coin, many accusations are thrown against the British troops by the end. While I'm inclined to believe these facts are true, I'm still curious as to how the conclusions were reached. Soldiers are shown planting evidence, murdering civilians. I'd like to know when these facts came to light. At the end, we learn that the official inquiry found the military was in the right, but we don't learn how the opposing view spread."

","Before The Bourne Supremacy, director Paul Greengrass made this historical drama based on a non-fiction book. Basically this is a documentary style film showing the events on January 30th, 1972, where a protest march through Londonderry for civil rights led by activist MP Ivan Cooper (BAFTA TV Award nominated James Nesbitt) turns into a disaster. I think it is when marchers start pelting the Parachute Regiment that they begin shooting at them, and they killed thirteen people, and wounded fourteen more. You see the action from both sides of the drama, from the protesters' point of view, and the members of the Regiment, including Major General Ford (Tim Pigott-Smith) and Brigadier MacLellan (Nicholas Farrell). Also starring Gerard McSorley as Chief Supt. Lagan, Kathy Kiera Clarke as Frances, Allan Gildea as Kevin McCorry, Gerard Crossan as Eamonn McCann and Mary Moulds as Bernadette Devlin. The only off-putting thing about this film is the frequent fades to black and no sound pauses going through the action, but besides this, a pretty powerful and provocative film. It won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Photography and Lighting, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Single Drama and Best Sound. Very good!"

","A true work of cinema verite.  The movie draws you into it.  There came a point, near the end, when the Ivan Cooper character is walking around the makeshift morgue, and he's seeing the family members of the dead wailing and crying, that it actually seems like you are a part of the film.  It's amazing. You become, not just an observer, but almost an emotional participant. The only other sensation, in a movie,  that I've had like that is in ""Private Ryan"" when Tom Cruise is dying near the ""alamo"", and he looks over and sees that the Tom Sizemore character is dead.<br/><br/>The only disappointing thing about the film was, not knowing a whole lot of the chronolgy of the period, that I thought the Gerry character was going to be developed as Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, who was just out of prison at that time this took place, just like the character in the film. He would have also been about the same age as the character.  It turns out that he dies in the movie so that can't be true, but it was probably a thought that the writer had in developing the part.

This WASN'T a documentary?  I'll be perfectly honest, and this is how powerfully dynamic every performance was, if there were no opening credits, listing actors and writers, I would have believed I was watching a documentary.  That's what I'm talking about when I say this entire ensemble deserves special recognition.  If even one person looked out of place or out of character, the piece would have fallen.  But this...the settings, the costumes, the hair, the grainy element of the picture itself...this is absolutely, magnificently brilliant. Paul Greengrass - how did you DO this?  How could you organize the chaos, synchronize the sounds, phones ringing, crowds swirling, eight conversations going on at once, bullets flying, this is absolute genius.<br/><br/>     In the hands of Hollywood, this would have been an absolute farce. Jennifer Lopez and her embarrassing Irish accent would have fallen in love with Dermot Mulrooney and his embarrassing Irish accent, they would have realized that love was more important than any old conflict between Catholics and Protestants, and they would have daringly slipped through the barbed wire and lived happily ever after in Galway.<br/><br/>     This film presents real life.  Well, I mean, it really happened.  But so did ""Enemy at the Gates"", and look what Hollywood did to that. See this film.  It's amazing.  It's brilliant.  It's genius.

"Ronin47","Null","4","11","25 November 2002"," Somewhat slow but gut-wrenching (***)
","The events in Derry, Northern Ireland on January 30th, 1972 are gut-wrenchingly re-created in Paul Greengrass' ""Bloody Sunday"".<br/><br/>On that day, several hundred Irish people led a civil rights march that, somewhere along the way, became violent, and 13 Irish citizens lay dead by the guns of British soldiers (14 more were wounded, one of whom died later). To this day, what exactly happened remains cloudy. The British soldiers maintained that they were only returning fire initiated by armed marchers, but many facts seem to contradict this. ""Bloody Sunday"" takes the Irish point of view, in which the British had no reason to fire upon the marchers, but did so anyway.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is its style, which is that of a documentary. There are abrupt fade-outs at the end of every scene, there is no music, and the jerky, hand-held camera seems to be held by someone who is actually there witnessing these events. Many times, the camera follows behind characters as they walk, panning up and down, back and forth, as a person might actually glance around. This creates one of the most convincing ""you-are-there"" feelings I've ever had while watching a movie. It's effective the whole time, but especially during the 20 or so minutes when the massacre is happening. These scenes are depicted with a rawness and realism that is absolutely horrifying, like being trapped in a nightmare you can't wake up from.<br/><br/>The downside is that, even as intense and immediate as the film is, the first half (leading up to the massacre) drags in places. Also, the abstract ""documentary"" form makes it near impossible to include character development, and as a result most of the characters never really grab us emotionally, except on a life-or-death gut level. The only character who truly emerges from the crowd is Ivan Cooper, a real-life Irish civil rights leader who is trying to lead the march in the non-violent style of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but becomes aware early-on that things might get out of hand, and they do, with tragic results. He is played by James Nesbitt in a performance filled with many intriguing layers, which is hard to do, considering the cold, observational style of the filming.<br/><br/>One other thing, and of course it's not the filmmakers' fault, but the thick Irish and British accents made it hard for me to understand what the characters were saying much of the time. That said, though, it's never hard to understand what's happening."

","Truly a powerfully and vividly profound and horrendous take on that fatal Derry day of massacre and debacle of 1972 that fortified the IRA's stronghold! And it's not unlike a dramatic repertoire of the ancient Greek tragedies that we are so familiar.  27 peaceful Irish demonstrators fatally shot and 13 dead - all because of their willingness to participate in a peace march against Britain's policy of 'internment without trial' and its policy of political favoritism! Random arrests turning into random killing! Everything exposed on screen!  Are the Brits mostly at fault?  Tim Pigott-Smith's obnoxiously condescending Major General Ford's command tactics will certainly bring discussions to our dinner table.<br/><br/>Director/Writer Paul Greengrass gives a heinous account of the tragedies from both sides of the aisle. Events flip from the Irish side to the British, and vice versa, offering significant events to prompt the viewers' judgment. His jerky and amazing verite-cinema shots, and his faux-documentary filmmaking style give me the illusion of being an eye-witness to the events, feeling the tensions of both sides; causing me to build up that sense of urgency to stay involved - right on the scenes with the cameraman. The bleached and stark images also provide an effective stir to the moods and despair. Absolutely unpretentious, so intensely real!<br/><br/>No fancy character development, only glimpses of some of the characters' backgrounds - yep, ordinary people, in the City of Derry, going about their daily lives before the eventful day. And British soldiers tracking their moves.  The actors, playing their roles, are awesomely fabulous. They are truly convincing.  Just watch the progress of their moods. I was gripped by their personal stories. And I was frankly and totally absorbed by James Nesbitt's Ivan Cooper (the leader of the Irish civil-rights coalition,), watching this factory manager character stroll from his home through streets, and passing the theater where the `Sunday Bloody Sunday' and `Magnificent 7' movies are being shown at their local theater. Observing these characters, watching their plight, their baffling behaviors, and their decisively aggressive acts, and being thrown into the scenes of chaotic hostilities and confusion are like suffering the panic and excruciating pain from a bullet ricocheting through my spine. Yep, an absolutely dramatic and emotionally and chillingly disturbing attempt at revealing a historical episode! Just listen to the names of the dead being read out, between scenes of presenting the British soldiers' blotched defenses and fallacies.<br/><br/>The lack of dialogue is also ingeniously done to create a real-life approach to commotion and sense of tension.  Hardly any music accompanies the scenes. Just phones ringing off the hook and baby cries.  Absolutely a praiseworthy development to add realism to events!  Only the U2's `Sunday, Bloody Sunday' song score grates loudly through the closing credits... continuing way past their finale. Very effective!<br/><br/>It's the film to watch for those interested to see how well filmmaking can capture an effective point of view. It's a film that astonishingly  takes one right to that fatal Sunday of January 30 that has since led to the continuing estranged relationship between Northern Ireland and Britain. I am frankly still shaken and numb - even at this point of posting.<br/><br/>

"nived84","10","3","8","29 April 2006"," Sunday, Bloody Sunday
","Bloody Sunday is a gritty and emotionally intense documentary style drama about an Irish civil rights protest march in that ended in a violent massacre when British troops opened fire on the crowd of protesters on January 30, 1972 in Darry, Northern Ireland. The film was written and directed by British filmmaker Paul Greengrass with a steady hand and an unflinching eye for human emotion much like this year's United 93. Greengrass is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers with his passionate and intimate look at dramatic history.<br/><br/>The film starts off the night before the protest with Civil Rights leader Ivan Cooper (played well by James Nesbitt) announcing to the press that they will march peacefully the next day and that they will continue to march for Civil Rights until they get what they want. From then on the film shows Cooper rallying the town's people together, passing out pamphlets for their peaceful march, and we see British troops setting up roadblocks and barricades. The march gets going and as it makes it way through the town all seems to be going according to plan, but things start to unravel when some of the town's more rebellious youth start to fear the troop's presence and start to throw bricks. The British try hitting them with a water cannon, but the situation escalates into a shooting frenzy as the troops think someone in the crowd starts to fire at them. The troops move in quickly and suddenly laying down fire shooting retreating protesters left and right without pause or mercy. These scenes of mass hysteria and panic are both saddening and tragic.<br/><br/>At the end of Bloody Sunday thirteen protesters are dead and many of the young male surviving protesters joined the IRA in retaliation of the British government's actions, only causing the effectiveness of the Civil Rights movement's cause to become tragically lost. The film does a very effective job of recreating history in a convincing and gripping way. You don't have to really know anything about the Historical aspect of the film to really understand the film, but it certainly doesn't hurt. This is a powerfully effective film with a fiery tension and sad conclusion. If you liked United 93, Munich or Black Hawk Down I think you might enjoy Bloody Sunday. And as it should, the film ends with a live performance of U2's ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday""."

","just finished seeing the film this evening , shown on the national TV channel.<br/><br/>just sifting through the commentary to this film, it is only fair to say that no matter where your sympathies lie, historically this was a crucial time in Europe's back yard, where political matters were dealt with so hard handedly with such catastrophic results. Comparing this episode to the massacres like Sharpeville would seem apt indeed. Not only was heavy practices with soldiers scared out their own control being put into use, but also with the jingoism about it as was this the remnants of the Raj in India. News of the Troubles sent shock waves of disbelief through the press in Europe, and as a secondary school pupil intimidated me enormously. The b/w photos of the battlegrounds not very far from me, frightened everybody who had aspirations of a more peaceful world. On this background this film should be viewed, and not be criticized for its lack of proper commentary for the newcomer on the scene, not for its lack of dubbing to a more understandable English. Get on the internet , folks, check out what went on.. The film has has the smell of fear and confusion and the sheer frenzy on the part of the soldiers is being forcefully onto the screen.. - and and should rightly be recognized for this very quality of portrayal. Save the smell of cordite, I got this smell of fear and utter despair into my living room. Maybe I am prejudiced, I passed through Derry back packing in '79 when the county was in a stable,but unruly state, and was impatiently told by my ride to ""get the fokin' cam'ra out of the way, if yer don't want a shot in yer ahrse!"" The sight of the armored cars patrolling through the streets in their intimidating everyday business, stuck in my mind, as well as a visit in mid 'nineteens where optimism had worked its way into society in especially Derry. Still the normal , everyday practice of being stopped by random patrols. So ask yourself, on the basis of your own sensations from watching the movie, how would you have reacted in a situation like this. <br/><br/>Consider that one of the origins of this civil unrest was the result of popular demand for proper voting for the Catholics, namely one man, one vote.<br/><br/>and lastly consider how in the name of God, 30 years after these ghastly incidents, no clear and final official and satisfactory conclusion has yet surfaced as to how 14 people were killed and 13 wounded.... <br/><br/>and precious few, if any have been coming forward to offer explanations or apologies...."

I found the constant fades to be distracting at first, but as I continued to be drawn into the movie it stopped being a problem. I thought the movie was even handed in it's portrayal of the events. IRA members are not shown in a very favorable light. If there's a villain, its the general who shows up and tells the paras they need to kick some *ss. Then, after the events unfold, he washes his hands of the whole affair. There is no sense of rage in the film, more shock and sadness over the deaths. If there's an agenda here, it is to show what happened and to reopen an examination of the events on that terrible day. James Nesbitt turns in a powerhouse performance. In this I think the film has succeeded admirably. Probably the best film of 2002 and well deserving of 10 stars."

This is one I'll be thinking about for a long time to come.<br/><br/>James Nesbitt as Ivan Cooper was brilliant.  This was truly an Oscar-worthy performance.  The look of horrified bewilderment on his face as he looked around at all those grieving in the hospital scene, when he finds out the number of those killed, is something I don't think I'll ever forget.<br/><br/>Addressing language concerns, some of the accents were a little thick, but after settling in and watching the movie, within half an hour, I'd become totally accustomed to the accents, and it was no problem understanding what was being said.  Don't let that stand in the way of watching this amazing movie.<br/><br/>During the credits, there's a live acoustic version of U2's ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" that is absolutely haunting.  It's quiet and somber and completely riveting.  It continues after the end of the credits, but you won't want to turn it off until the song is finished.  It's the perfect choice to accompany the movie, and by far the best version of the song I've ever heard, which is saying something, as the original studio version is one of my favorite songs.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anybody, whether you have an interest in history, Northern Ireland, the Troubles, or you just want to watch a really excellent movie."

"Boba_Fett1138","8","3","9","13 January 2007"," One of the most powerful movies in recent years.
","In these times of big action movies and special effects laden movies, it's always good and refreshing to see that also still realistic and important movies, such as this one, are being made.<br/><br/>""Bloody Sunday"" gives us a good and fairly detailed view on the event that happened January 30, 1972 in Derry. The events that in history are now better known as 'bloody Sunday'. The day that 13 protesters were killed and 14 more were wounded by Britsh troops, during a civil right protest march. The movie is filmed in almost a documentary kind of style and shows both sides of the stories, leading up to the bloody and shocking event.<br/><br/>The power of the movie is most definitely in its realism and authenticity. The entire movie is shot without the use of artificial light and all the camera-work is hand-held. It gives the movie a documentary like feel and puts us right into the middle of the events. It makes everything in the movie work out more powerful. The anger, the desperation, the disbelief. The emotions all become extremely sensible, the moment fire gets randomly opened upon the civilians, men, women and children, young and old, which eventually meant the death of 13 unarmed men and boys.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't pick sides, since it tells the story from both sides, the protesters and the British troops. However the events as presented in the movie can't help but to make you feel sympathy for the protesters. I mean, if I were British I wouldn't feel proud while watching this movie. I however don't think it would had been possible to make the movie more neutral, without losing its power and all of its emotions. The movie also does a very well job to get us inside the heads of the British paratroopers. They hype each other up and get provoked by the protesters and when they're finally getting released upon the massive crowed, there is no holding them back. It's of course not an excuse for what they did (though none of them have been ever found guilty of anything) but it does give us a look at the factors that contributed to the reasons for what they did. So all in all, I really think that the movie is about as neutral as it could had been. It doesn't pick sides, it just tells the story like it happened, though 'officialy' still a lot of things remain unclear on what 'truly' happened on the day of January 30. Official inquiries results differ from eyewitness reports for instance.<br/><br/>Due to its realism and authenticity, the movie has an overall very gritty feel. It also makes the performances work out very realistic, almost if all of the characters are being played by non-actors, which for some part also is true. Still the movie also features some good well known actors such as James Nesbitt and the underrated Tim Pigott-Smith, who can play an hate-able character like no other. Some of the actions and responses from the non-actors in this movie are at times a bit distracting but obviously not distracting enough to ruin the movie in any way.<br/><br/>The movie focuses purely on the events of January 30, 1972. The movie doesn't ever get political and it doesn't say much about what happened before and after the events as presented in this movie, though Ivan Cooper's words at the end of the movie pretty much sum it all up.<br/><br/>Yes, at times the movie does tend to dramatize a bit too much but overall the movie does a very good job at keeping the atmosphere and emotions as authentic and sensible- and therefor also powerful, as possible.<br/><br/>The movie does use a constant fade to black editing technique which does work distracting at times. It's a technique normally shamelessly often used by mostly amateur filmmakers. It's perhaps the only flaw in the film-making, of this further more perfectly made production. Paul Greengrass' directing and approach of the events is very direct and works realistic. It makes the emotions really hit you, making this one of the most powerful movies in recent years.<br/><br/>An important- and powerful historical movie to watch.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","This movie tells the true story of ""Bloody Sunday"". On January 30, 1972, there was a civil rights March that took place in the Northern Ireland town of Derry. The protestors who were marching against internment were fired upon by English troops...27 were shot, killing 13 protestors. The protestors, led by Ivan Cooper, took great care to insure that it was a peaceful march. Yet, reminiscent of Kent State, the military was over zealous and fired on unarmed protestors. This film was shot with hand held cameras and had long takes, giving much the feel of a documentary...putting you right in the middle of the action. The majority of the film focused on the preparation of the March both by the protestors and the military, leading up to the big conflict at the end. Though I wouldn't call this a great film, I am really glad to have seen it since it is a piece of history I wasn't previously aware of. Although being very familiar with the civil rights movement in the United States, the story seemed very familiar to me."

","The partition of Ireland, though contested, is defensible; the subsequent neglect by the British government of the rights of northern Catholics is not. Nor is the shooting, on what has been termed ""Bloody Sunday"", of unarmed protesters objecting to the absence of these rights. Moreover, these events disastrously but understandably strengthened the roots that the I.R.A. was able to put down in the Catholic community. An initial enquiry vindicated the soldiers; but many felt this a whitewash, and Paul Greengrass's film shows an alternative version of events, based on extensive research. What we see, messily and unmelodramatically, is not a clean fight between good and evil - the demonstration was certainly hostile and not entirely peaceable - but a grotesque tragedy resulting from a self-fulfilling belief on the part of the army that they were already at war. The verdict might be incompetence rather than murder; but when the incompetence is itself premeditated, the difference is a fine one. To make a film effectively endorsing one of Irisah Republicanism's more potent claims was a brave move by I.T.V.; but a more recent enquiry has largely confirmed its accuracy."

That film famously cast unknowns so as not to detract from the power of events. Here, Nesbitt's presence does at times seem jarring, but only in the early moments as he goes on to give an outstanding performance as the convivial Ivan, overwhelmed by a massacre no one could have predicted. The panic of the crowd, the echo of the shots being fired, the incredulity of the reactions - all are believable, and powerfully so. Were the Paras as deliberate and calculating as the film makes out? Isn't there a chance this was a few low IQ numbskulls whose ill-discipline got out of hand? The portrayal of the UK military in particular marks this film out as polemical in its handling of the material. However, given the obfuscation and emotion swirling around Bloody Sunday, how could it be otherwise? Anyone interested in history who thinks they can get it from a film should not be allowed to handle sharp cutlery. However, as a start point to generating curiosity about this event, the film is well-executed. Hopefully, it can be used to begin the social education of future generations as The Troubles start to slip from living memory.

In the immediate aftermath the Army claimed they were fired upon and simply responded with appropriate force. The eyewitnesses including some members of the media tell a different story now corroborated by at least one of the soldiers indicating that there was little if any provocation. This is the perspective from which the story is told.

We also focus on one of the young protesters and several member of the British Army some of whom are more sympathetic than others.<br/><br/>The film employs a simple looking documentary style, with hand held cameras and no additional lighting.

","You apprehend an armed man, who admits to being a professional bank robber, outside a bank. Inside the bank three people lie badly wounded on the floor. The bank robber blames the victims for their injuries, and (perhaps as an afterthought) also blames others standing in the queue; he says they started the violence. The victims blame the bank robber. Only if you were so feeble-minded as to have no ability to process evidence at all would you subject the two claims to an equal amount of scepticism. Anyone interested in arriving at the truth would be biased against the bank robber. Yes, it's not impossible that he's telling the truth; it's possible that the victims ARE to blame for their own injuries. But the burden of proof rests with him, with the man who walked into the bank carrying a rifle.<br/><br/>The following is public knowledge, known to people who weren't there and not denied even by the British army: The organisers of the march urged the people taking part not to resort to violence, however much provoked. They certainly didn't arm the marchers themselves. The officers of the army DID arm its soldiers, with powerful rifles, tear gas cannisters, heavy artillery and tanks. Moreover they did NOT forswear violence, even in the statements they made for the benefit of the press: on the contrary, they announced their willingness to use their weapons in retaliation; not just in self-defence, mind you, but in retaliation. That journalists could sit through a press conference in which Major-General Ford says, as a message to the organisers of the march: ""Any violence that may result rests squarely on your shoulders,"" without snorting derisively, is surprising however much mainstream coverage you've seen of the recent attack on Iraq.<br/><br/>Greengrass has made a fictional recreation of an actual event and obviously he's had to fill in details. (Obviously, no outsider could possibly know for sure what Cooper said to his girlfriend in the privacy of his own home the morning before the march, etc.) But he's been exraordinarily careful, so far as I can tell, to fill in details in the most plausible way he can; only two or three times does anyone so much as utter a single line of dialogue that strikes me as unlikely (a line that sounds as though it may have been inserted for the purpose of exposition), and even then, not much. Not often, but sometimes, Greengrass has to choose between two conflictng accounts of what happened. If he doesn't do so he doesn't have a film. So he chooses whichever is most likely, which of course makes him biased; that is to say, a rational creature, and not a kind of walking dictaphone incapable of distinguishing between truth and falsehood.<br/><br/>Obviously I wouldn't be going to so much trouble to defend the film on this one point if I didn't also think it was good. It's a powerful and convincing account of a day gone wrong... a single day, with a couple of days' background, which is why people who accuse it of being a one-sided account of the conflict in Northern Ireland are also wrong: you either know or you don't why the protestors are marching, and the film doesn't include any forced exposition to try to cue in people who don't know. And while the film hints at what's likely to happen next, as a result of the violence, it doesn't include or pretend to include that story, either. I like a film that knows what it's about and what it's not about.<br/><br/>The cinematography is, alas, awful. What is Greengrass trying to do with all this needless, eye-watering camera-shaking - forge documentary footage? Only if he's a bigger fool than he could possibly be given the script he's written. He shows private domestic scenes no cameraman would be allowed to film, then wobbles the camera as though to remind us that there is a cameraman present, and an inept one, too, when in the world of the fiction, there isn't; and even outside the world of the fiction, one hopes that the cameraman isn't really as inept as he's pretending to be, although there's no direct visual evidence to the contrary. There's no excuse for such riding-over-a-cattle-grid photography. Nor is there an excuse for such horrible, dour, bluish-grey colour processing, the kind that announces to the audience, ""I wanted to shoot in black and white, but they wouldn't let me.""<br/><br/>Don't suppose for a minute that any of this HELPS the film. But the script, and Greengrasss sureity of purpose, are enough to ensure that it does little or no harm. We're taken completely inside the story despite (certainly not because of) the photography, and given the nature of what we watch... well, anger directed at the guy behind the camera seems misplaced."

","One more film on this Bloody Sunday, will you say. Shot for television in 2001. What can we add to the plain fact of 13 people killed in cold blood by the paratroopers of Her Majesty the Queen of England without any clear order to do so ? There is no excuse for this event, absolutely no excuse. The march should not have been banned and blocked in the first place. That was a total misunderstanding of the situation. And the English had never had anything to do in Ireland in the first place. The film though is not as effective as it could have been because the editing choice is pretty simple, not to say bizarre. Why try to produce a sloppy, amateurish and old TV documentary when everyone knows it is done on purpose by professionals in 2001 and with only filmed professional actors. It makes the film very chaotic and bumpy. The only thing that is clear is that the demonstrators were pretty amateurish in their non-violent disorganized organization whereas the paratroopers were pretty good professionals at obeying an order that never existed and the army was very good at covering up the event. And we have to keep in mind it will take more than 25 years to finally start moving towards a political settlement. And it is still fragile and could erupt again any time even if the situation is improving steadily day after day. We are still far from the end. Keep in mind that 13 dead people in Londonderry is probably more than in Tien An Men if we take into account the respective populations of Northern Ireland and China, and even one casualty would have been too many. As far as I know there was no casualty when Martin Luther King marched in Washington DC, and we can be absolutely sure that Martin Luther King's Baptist dream was just as valuable as that of these Northern Irish Catholic citizens, and vice versa of course.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

","Although I enjoyed the story, acting, tension and message of this film, I cannot help but give it a low rating.  The camera is almost never stationary long enough for viewers to recover from the constant sea-sickness inducing jiggle.  I found myself so nauseated during parts, I had to close my eyes and just listen.  A certain amount of this stylistic camera work could be considered acceptable, but here it permeates the film so completely as to not just distract, but to ruin what I would otherwise consider to be a good movie. ** (out of 5)"

However, it offers little story arc, character development, side plots, conventional entertainment value, etc.  In the grand scheme of docudramas, ""Bloody Sunday"" pales before a panoply of historical accounts of military/civillian conflicts.

","Good film, excellent documentary feel and given the subject not as one sided as it could have been - riots etc are chaotic for all concerned - as to those transatlantic posters with comments like ""When a government is not OF the people, as the Derry government definitely wasn't, the resentment is real, true and deserved"", they only show how little they understand - the type of person who probably donated to NORAID and sings rebel songs at a bar! Not a good day for anyone including the British Army and understandably an event that stoked up support for PIRA. Its interesting to note comments by people who served over there who also consider it has the right feel - though when did the Paras refer to subunits as squadrons as happens at one point? Btw one reviewer (from Australia)wrote ""The officers of the army DID arm its soldiers, with powerful rifles, tear gas cannisters, heavy artillery and tanks"" - heavy artillery and tanks"" - I'd LOL if this wasn't a serious subject - tanks and artillery - where were they - exagerrating matters doesn't really help anyone - and to be honest being as they were soldiers they would be armed with rifles wouldn't they?"
"Au-Cinema","8","2","10","16 September 2002"," A great document.
","""Bloody Sunday"" is the now famous story of one of the most violent<br/><br/>episodes in the Northern Ireland conflict. Moreover, it is that which<br/><br/>began the armed struggle. Now that the peace process is engaged, and an<br/><br/>""autonomous"" government runs Northern Ireland, including members of all<br/><br/>factions, Paul Greengrass and his producers decided that it was time to<br/><br/>make a film which would once and for all confront the event from both<br/><br/>sides and try to make some sense out of this painful piece of history.<br/><br/>The film does exactly that, and quite well, in a cinéma vérité or<br/><br/>documentary style, a great idea from the filmmaker. He shot the film in<br/><br/>16mm, with no additional lighting, in order to be close to the action,<br/><br/>the people mainly. The filmmaking itself is the best thing about the<br/><br/>film. The style is perfect and works perfectly. We only regret that<br/><br/>being up close to the characters doesn't compensate for us actually<br/><br/>feeling ""close to the characters;"" to their emotions, their lives,<br/><br/>neither their pains nor sufferings. The filmmaker deliberately chose to<br/><br/>concentrate on the action rather than on the characters. Even the<br/><br/>leading character, Ivan Cooper, the famous civil rights activist for a<br/><br/>non-violent solution, is left for us to decipher. In our absorbing of<br/><br/>these events, we never really know or understand who he is as a human<br/><br/>being. Also, we should always remember that strong leading characters<br/><br/>would help an audience understand the story better than any factual,<br/><br/>political, or historical explanation of any given situation. Take ""The<br/><br/>Boxer"" for example, by Jim Sheridan, one of the producers of this film.<br/><br/>Therefore, in this sense the only criticism we have in terms of<br/><br/>political is that the British are shown a bit complaisant-like, as if<br/><br/>they had fired upon the crowd by lack of organization. Things were much<br/><br/>more radical than that, but Paul Greengrass is British, and trying very<br/><br/>intelligently to put the matter to rest, rather than open up a new<br/><br/>debate. In any case it's a great tool in helping people understand how<br/><br/>from a peaceful rational conflict, we very often arrive at a conflict<br/><br/>ruled by extreme violence as the only way to instill change. In the end,<br/><br/>when the peaceful solution is defeated, we see young men taking up<br/><br/>weapons and getting ready to fight by other means than marching. It is<br/><br/>now clear that without the violent ""civil war"" generated by the IRA, the<br/><br/>British government would never have ""let go"" of Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, even if we think that's the message, Paul Greengrass<br/><br/>(during a Q and A with the press) doesn't, and considers and consider<br/><br/>that terror is always the same, mixing together the IRA, the ETA in<br/><br/>Spain, the Palestinians in Israel, etc., going further, thus condemning<br/><br/>the IRA for its violence, and affirming that a peaceful solution was<br/><br/>possible. This is a quite naive and simplistic point of view from a<br/><br/>director who made a film which shows something entirely different. In<br/><br/>any event, we are still grateful to Paul for giving us this great matter<br/><br/>to debate"

"s13ky","6","0","2","9 July 2013"," A semi-documentary film that follows the oppression between British soldiers and unarmed civilians taking part in a supposedly-peaceful march in the Bogside area of Derry.
","This film highlights the dark cloud over Northern Ireland following the incident occurring on 30 January 1972 in which British soldiers fired on unarmed civilians taking part in a supposedly-peaceful march in the Bogside area of Derry. What happened? Why are they throwing stones?, What triggers the bloody event? Those questions really should have been thought of when producing this film. First of all, as a part of crucial historical event, I feel that this film doesn't give proper introduction to the situation described even though some people can easily relate the title with the incident. Let us be logical, this wasn't the first massacre happened, events like this(whether more or less violent) may occur every day all over the globe to any unfortunate human race, just like the one occurred in Carandiru, Brazil. Despite the improper introduction, Paul Greengrass in a daring way portrayed this turmoil in such an honest, shocking, scary, daunting, disturbing and creepy way. I also admire the way he merged some original footages to the shoot, making it look even more real. The authentic feel of a documentary film obtained through the use of hand-held camera work is superb. This results in stunning realism, one feels part of that fateful day when dialog fails, when a supposedly peaceful demonstration ends with suppressed side stones with water, rubber bullets, tear gas, to lead to the negative lead bullets which crippled the lives of 13 people transforming into a killing with impunity which had no punishment to those responsible. The soundtrack, including U2's ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"", is also exquisitely composed and inserted here and there at the right moment. In short, the visual really helps the public understand various factors that lead to the events that occur in this film."
