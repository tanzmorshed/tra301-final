"imddaveh","Null","102","143","23 April 2001"," This film was made for 1% of the population. Happily, I'm in that 1%.
","Steven Speilberg once asked a friend of mine, ""Why didn't anyone like this movie?"" Well, I think that I can answer that - ""1941"" is a gigantic in-joke. The people who are in on the joke are people who, like myself, have an oversized love and knowledge of the city of Los Angeles and it's history. I think that in the vast, world-wide movie-going public, this group probably comprises 1%. For that group, ""1941"" has a wonderful nostalgia value. And for the people in that 1% that have a twisted sense of humor and enjoy seeing nostalgic L.A. blown to bits, this movie really delivers. By the way, the folks with that twisted sense of humor probably account for about 1% of the original 1%.<br/><br/>I don't know why, but having grown up in L.A. and being an aficionado of it's history, I find it funny to see planes in a dogfight over Hollywood Blvd, the ferris wheel rolling off the end of Santa Monica Pier, and aircraft crashing into the La Brea Tarpits. But for non-locals and people unfamiliar with the paranoia that gripped Southern California in the wake of Pearl Harbor, this movie will likely seem confusing and silly. To the history buff with a twisted sense of humor (like me, proud member of the 1% of the 1%), the movie is not only amusing, but sometimes surprisingly accurate, historically. Robert Stack plays General Joseph Stillwell - a very real historical figure in L.A. history. Stack even bears a striking resemblance to the real General Stillwell. The whole movie is based upon a few real-life incidents of panicky anti-aircraft fire that occurred over L.A. in 1941/1942, as well as a Japanese sub that actually shelled an oil refinery near Santa Barbara. Like ""Chinatown"" (a film mistakenly thought to be an accurate account of L.A. water politics in the 1930s), ""1941"" borrows from real-life history and distorts it into pure fabrication. The difference is that while ""Chinatown"" is a noir drama,  ""1941"" is an over-the-top comedy. Both films appeal to the historian, but as it is often said, comedy is much harder to pull off than drama. You either love ""1941"", or sit though it, saying, ""huh?""."
"goatboy500","Null","80","111","29 June 2005"," I cant understand why this movie is so reviled...
","1941 is considered to be Steven Spileberg's folly, a screwball farce about the Japanese invading America after pearl harbour, starring some of the greatest actors and comedians that ever lived. Some people hate it, I love it. Sorry for all you haters, but I guess the things I like are the things you dislike, but for the life of me, I can't understand why this movie is considered Spielberg's worst movie. For one, it's watchable, and for another, it's not full of Spielberg Schmaltz, (the thing i hate most about Senior Speilbergo's later movies, i.e Hook, Always, AI).<br/><br/>Treat Williams is an a$$hole but no-one plays a$$holes better (see; things to do in Denver when your dead), Robert Stack crying while watching Dumbo when a full scale dogfight rages outside the theatre, Ned Beatty destroying his house in an attempt to fight the Japanese, Slim Pickens faking doing a sh!t while Toshiro Mifune and Christopher Lee wait to find out if he's passed a compass. I'm sorry but but those are all comedic gems. Okay, so Belushi is wasted and is seemingly in this move for no reason, but Belushi in a cockpit without a bottle opener is funnier than anything with Sean William Scott in it. For me this movie hits all the right notes, and on reflection makes some very good points (the two numbskull's who mistakenly think Belushi's plane is a German fighter...the paranoia of anyone living in a coastal town after pearl harbour).<br/><br/>Give it another chance, then watch Jaws if you still don't like it."

","You can't have lofty aspirations all the time.<br/><br/>Even the director of such powerful films as ""Jaws"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""ET"" and ""Schindler's List"" has to take a break from all the serious issues in his films and play dumb at least once. <br/><br/>
Just look at ""1941"".<br/><br/>With a plotline straight out of The Three Stooges and special effects befitting a WWII epic, ""1941"" abandons all pretense by parodying the opening of ""Jaws"" right off the bat and hitting every slapstick point from there on in.  Spielberg knew that even if this turned out be a flop, it would be a good-natured one.<br/><br/>Just look at this cast!  Not only are Aykroyd and Belushi at the helm, but there's talent like Matheson, Allen, Oates, Williams, Beatty, Gary (Roy Scheider's wife from the ""Jaws"" films), Candy, Flaherty, Stack (in his first comedic turn before ""Airplane!""), Lee, Pickens, Deezen (a comic genius if ever there was one), Sperber and a whole herd of other I probably missed. All of them in the midst of the hugest battlefield of comic carnage ever seen.<br/><br/>And no wonder.  ""1941"" was co-written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, Spielberg protogees who went on to further success with the ""Back to the Future"" films, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Used Cars"", (all with climaxes as wild as the entire running time of ""1941"") and the vastly under-appreciated ""Death Becomes Her"".  Even John Milius (director/co-writer of ""Conan the Barbarian"") lends his pen hand.  <br/><br/>In the end, you'll be dazzled, breathless, stunned and amazed, but by no means bored.  And, with any luck, amused.<br/><br/>""1941"" - it was a very good year.<br/><br/>Nine stars.  And don't worry: it's all for the good of the war effort."
"zmanjz","7","67","97","19 March 2005"," Worth watching at least once.
","1941 is a unique movie. 1 part of it is animal house-esque lowbrow humor, 1 part is B-movie love story, and 1 part stoic war movie, and 2 parts insane hilarity.<br/><br/>It is a weird mix to say the least.<br/><br/>First, the problems: 1. The first half of the movie is slow. It grinds on making you wonder why you're watching this movie.<br/><br/>2. The ""Love story"" subplot is poorly executed for what this movie is trying to do.<br/><br/>3. many of the actors are not used to their fullest potential (especially Dan Akroyd and John Candy) while others receive excessive screen time. (see: The slow moving love story sub-plot) But then there are the good aspects: 1. John Belushi is hilarious. He would have been funnier had he interacted with more characters rather than appearing in many solo shots, but he was funny.<br/><br/>2. The ""Epic Battle"" was great. It had me laughing as my sides hurt.<br/><br/>3. Slim Pickens: His appearance in the movie was truly where the movie stopped being slow, and the fun really started. He was great in his scenes and between the dialogue and his visual scenes, you can't help but laugh.<br/><br/>There's more, but in short, if you don't mind sitting through a slow build up, the payoff is worth the wait.<br/><br/>It's not the best movie ever, but in the barren entertainment landscape that is Weekend Television: Finding this movie can be like an oasis in the desert. It's solid Saturday afternoon fun."

","I'll keep this short; read msa0510's review for a more in-depth review.  The best part in this movie is Slim Pickens.  Just thinking about his scenes makes me start laughing again.<br/><br/>It was nice having the ""Making of 1941"" on the dvd and seeing the remarks by Spielberg; I knew this movie had been panned by the critics but I hadn't known that it was popular in Europe.  I can't understand why we Americans don't find it funny; it's hysterically funny to me.<br/><br/>It's a perfect 10 in my book; so few comedies these days are so over-the-top funny as this movie is."

","Those who can't find humor in ""1941"" need to loosen up. This is one of the few movies I have ever purchased for my own personal collection. The Ferris wheel scene alone is an all-time classic.

I'm a huge Spielberg fan, but 1941 is just wretched excess. It's loud, destructive, unfunny and plot less (it's strictly situational). It's also a bit painful to watch all the now deceased wasted talent (Murray Hamilton, Lionel Stander, Wendy Jo Sperber, Belushi, The great Slim Pickens, Toshiro Mifune, Samuel Fuller, Bob Stack & others...). The film's uncredited cameos are strange (Penny Marshall? James Caan? Lenny & Squiggy from Penny's series??? C'mon...) This was a monumental waste of time, talent & piles of money. (1) unfunny star/10."
"TheLittleSongbird","3","10","13","16 January 2017"," Tries far too hard and fails more than it succeeds
","Steven Spielberg was, like many people, part of my childhood, and to this day 'Jaws', 'ET', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' are still favourites. 'Schindler's List' is also a masterpiece, and 'Jurassic Park' still leaves me awestruck with the revolutionary dinosaur effects.<br/><br/>Despite being widely regarded as Spielberg's biggest disaster, am personally not of the opinion that '1941' is quite his worst film. It's one of his worst, and on reflection his most disappointing considering the ideas and the talent, but to me 'The Lost World' (both that and the third were a disgrace to the original 'Jurassic Park') gets that dishonourable title.<br/><br/>'1941' has its moments where it succeeds. Technically, it looks fabulous, being beautifully shot (wasn't crazy about the dance scene in general but the cinematography in the scene was impossible to find fault with) and audaciously designed. John Williams delivers yet another rousing music score, not one of his better efforts but a very good and perfectly fitting within the film one all the same.<br/><br/>A few good scenes and standout performances. The ferris wheel and house destruction scenes are technical marvels, are wonderfully anarchic and extremely funny, and even more so the opening of the Coke and Slim Pickens scenes. Mustn't forget the 'Jaws' parody either. Of the cast, faring best are a wonderfully crazed John Belushi (a nothing part but Belushi makes the most of it), a hilarious Slim Pickens, Robert Stack as an army general who loves Dumbo, a nerdy and madcap Eddie Deezen and a wonderfully stoic Christopher Lee.<br/><br/>Others don't fare so well though. John Candy has nothing to do and looks bored, Dan Aykroyd is similarly wasted in a slapstick that is far too over-the-top and busy to find much entertainment value in, Treat Williams overdoes the aggressive condescension of his character and comes over as an irritating bully, Tim Mattheson and Nancy Allen are pretty bland and while good Lorraine Gray and Ned Beatty are underused.<br/><br/>Furthermore, '1941' suffers from being bloated and trying far too hard. It has too many characters, most of which either have very little to do or are sketchy at best or feature too much with not much interesting at all. Likewise there are also too many plot-lines, which gives the film a too busy and sprawling structure at times, the worst faring one being the love story subplot that just grinds the film to a halt and is truly dull.<br/><br/>Humour wise, '1941' has moments where it's funny, but too much of it is too loud, too over-egged, sloppily timed and gratuitously vulgar (this kind of humour has worked very well in other films like 'Animal House' but in those instances the timing was much sharper and less manic). The film takes far too long to properly get going, with the appearance of Slim Pickens being where it properly shows signs of coming to life. Despite the dazzling cinematography and a suitably intense brawl, the dance scene is not that interesting and goes on forever. The dialogue is crass and left me stone-faced rather than crying my eyes out laughing.<br/><br/>Spielberg shows expertise on the technical and visual front, but when it comes to momentum and keeping control of the too many plot strands and characters he fails and shows himself less than natural with comedy.<br/><br/>Overall, not a complete disaster but a lesser Spielberg effort that tries far too hard. While it succeeds in a few areas it fails badly in many others. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

","A Japanese sub off the coast of California looking for Hollywood so they can ""blow the s**t out of something big"".  There's your plot.<br/><br/>Yeah, It's got some slapstick but this film cooks. It's sorta like a Murphy's Law about hysteria.  What if everything went wrong?  Could that happen?  Yes!  There's solid performances from everybody from the kid in the ferris wheel to Robert Stack (actually crying in a theatre while watching DUMBO). An intelligent piece of film work?

"pkzeewiz","1","36","60","16 April 2010"," a lot of great actors, but the movie was horrible
","First off I have to mention all of the wonderful actors that did such a great job; Lucille Benson (reprising a role from DUEL), Slim Pickens, Susan Backlinie (reprising her role from JAWS), Ned Beatty, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Murray Hamilton, Robert Stack, Christopher Lee, John Candy, Toshiro Mifone, Warren Oates, Elisha Cook, Jr, Eddie Deezen, Dub Taylor, Joe Flaherty, Don Calfa, Dick Miller and small roles and cameos for people like James Caan, Samuel Fuller, John Landis, Mickey Rourke (in his film debut), Michael McKean and David Lander together but not as Lenny and Squiggy, also from Laverne & Shirley we have Penny Marshall, and of course in my opinion the movies true star was Bobby Dicicco.<br/><br/>Actors I didn't like but I will include are Tim Matheson and Nancy Allen as well as Treat Williams. I normally like Treat but he was awful in this film.<br/><br/>This movie is basically a lighthearted spoof of events that actually did happen at various times during the early 40's. The Japanese did try to invade LA, and airplanes were shot at thinking it was a Japanese raid. Zoot suiters did battle it out with USO boys and many events here are all true just put together for this movie.<br/><br/>As far as the plot to the movie, its basically about the Japanese along with a Nazi comrade trying to invade Los Angelas. The great General Stillwell is in town and trying to watch a movie, his soldiers are at a USO party. One soldier is trying to get a girl, but another kid named Wally wants her more. Another soldier is flying a plane trying to get a woman to sleep with him because she loves planes. There is a lot of weird things going on in here that should make it interesting, but it doesn't. Just random events that all connect to the threat of an invasion.<br/><br/>Spielberg directed this movie and its considered his biggest flop, with good reasoning. It offers nothing, its a mess, its very sloppy. I only laughed once and that was at the Slim Pickens part and director Brian DePalma actually contributed that section. Pickens also spoofs his own self from DR. STRANGELOVE. The movie opens with a spoof of JAWS with the original woman playing her part.<br/><br/>awe what to say...the movie was a mess, I hated the score by John Williams, the direction offered nothing, actors were many, but characters were few, the screenplay was silly and the scenes were flawed...<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend it to a single person...it was really bad 1/10 stars"

"benoit-3","1","30","55","30 July 2003"," The exact moment when the doodoo hit the fan.
","There is a scene in `1941' where a German general and a Japanese submarine commander (all over-simplified and therefore hateful racial stereotypes) have kidnapped a hapless country hick (Slim Pickens) and are coaxing him to defecate because he has swallowed a toy compass from a box of Cracker Jacks, that is apparently the only way for their stranded submarine to find its way out of Los Angeles harbour.<br/><br/>This scene is not only important because of the way it heralds countless instances of toilet and body fluid humour in Hollywood movies for decades to come. It also acts as a metaphor for the film itself: a bunch of grown men who should know better, hopelessly looking for a sense of direction amid what is basically human excrement.<br/><br/>`1941' is one major stinker. What can you say about the intelligence of a script based on events that happened in 1942, that calls itself `1941'? About scriptwriters who apparently hadn't even graduated to potty-training when they wrote this piece of drivel, are responsible in a large degree for the general dumbing-down of America and who went on to write even more infantile opuses like `Forrest Gump'? About a storyline that depends on the public's acceptance of attempted date rape as an amusing premise? About cameos by self-destructive over-the-top substance-abusing actors just this close to an overdose as a medium of entertainment?<br/><br/>In my book, `1941' is an important historical milestone in American consciousness. Shot in 1979, it marks the exact moment in time where American movies graduated from simple self-indulgence (i.e. `The Godfather' and countless other films in its wake, glorifying guns, cars, gore, sadistic violence, dismemberment, disloyalty and organized crime as a favourite form of family entertainment) to grossly excessive special-effects-driven children's fare (`Star Wars' and its ilk).<br/><br/>It is probably besides the point to add that this film is extremely strained and unfunny and that even its musical score (by John Williams) sounds like Sir Edward Elgar conducting a symphony orchestra during a controlled flatulence contest.<br/><br/>I truly resent one commentator's comparison of this film to `It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' which had a sharp, clear morality, which is that greed is not only bad, it is ridiculous. What is the moral of `1941'? Anyone? War is funny? Thank you. I rest my case!<br/><br/>To be perfectly fair, writer Zemeckis did eventually obtain redemption for his youthful indiscretions by directing such fine films as `Contact' (an ode to human reason, dedicated to the memory of Carl Sagan) and `What Lies Beneath', which is just plain good."
"kols","1","19","33","25 August 2013"," Obscene
","Thank God Mel Brooks never tried to play the Holocaust for laughs - unfortunately the producers of 1941 didn't know any better, mocking the initial and short-lived fear of a Japanese invasion following Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>This movie was obviously made for the Animal House generation and their strange, slightly warped, sensibility; something like a child's fascination with gross body functions and preference for using feces over oil or watercolor as media.<br/><br/>For that generation, the aftermath of Pearl Harbor may well have seemed fair game for their version of what they considered irrelevant humor; after all it'd been 35 years since the real thing and who really remembered the shock and horror of the real 1941? That may have changed in 2001 with the shock and horror of 9-11 and I doubt that those same producers would dare do 9-11 The Movie; hopefully, no set of producers in 2036 will try either.<br/><br/>Just as such a movie would be obscene in 2036, 1941 was obscene in 1979 and still is.<br/><br/>Apart from the poor choice of subject matter and on its merits as a comedy, there aren't any. By most generations definition of schtick, 1941 was a bomb - as many reviewers pointed out, Three Stooges, not the Marx Brothers and, apart from the Animal House generation, The Stooges get really old around age 6.<br/><br/>Bottom line - it just ain't funny.<br/><br/>Humor is a very individual characteristic so, if you're an adult and you do still find the Stooges funny, that's your right and I'll defer to your sensibility on the point.<br/><br/>But I will not defer to the obscenity of trying to exploit one of the most traumatic events in the history of America for laughs.<br/><br/>The wars that followed are fair game - from Catch-22 to Kelly's Heroes or Mr Roberts to the Caine Mutiny but 12-7-1941 and its immediate aftermath isn't, any more than 9-11.<br/><br/>Update 9-11-13.<br/><br/>""The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming"" is a movie I kept trying to remember while writing this review. You may or may not have heard of it but it deals with War Hysteria with intelligence and wit, unlike 1941. Haven't seen it since it's first run but remember it as being gentle and humane, making the point, ""Hey, we're all just people""."

You probably thought that the stooges used real hammers to whack themselves over the head and wondered why the ambulances didn't show up. Get over yourself. Man, there are some stupid people out there.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* Yeah...the house looked a little fakey as it ""blew up"" falling off the cliff (you can see the charges going off) but it capped off the hysteria pretty well and shows how a little rumor of something can set off a chain reaction of craziness to follow. Belushi had a minor role and carried his part off well enough, Robert Stack was genius...especially in the Dumbo scene. Even Lenny & Squiggy's cameo were done well. The extended version gives some added hilarity....though some of it was more fluff and you can see why it ended up on the cutting room floor. Still good to watch those extras.<br/><br/>As for all you Scrooges who think this is a turkey...well go rent Ishtar or Pee Wee's Big Adventure. Like another said...grab a beer, sit back and watch this film! It's great fun unless you are a complete prude or don't like American's laughing at Americans! This film will surely take any depressed old soddy mood and turn it around."

","As outlandish and hysterical as the war insanity of 1941 may seem, the plot tracks almost exactly a real incident reported the night of Feb. 24, 1942, in Los Angeles that began when Navy intelligence reported an attack by unidentified objects on their radar could be expected within the next 10 hours. Early the morning of the 25, radar tracked objects 120 miles west of Los Angeles and a blackout was ordered, triggering a flood of reports about enemy planes.  Planes wre reported by the coast artillery near Long Beach (25 of them at 12,000 feet). Four batteries of anti aircraft guns at Santa Monica opened fire on a balloon with a flare and all hell broke loose, with so much ack-ack and searchlights scanning the sky that utter confusion reigned for at least three hours with reports of swarms of planes (hundreds in some cases) flying in at every altitude imaginable.  Some 1,440 rounds of ammunition were fired at airplanes that never dropped a single bomb. There were reports four enemy planes had been shot down, including one that supposedly landed in flames at a Hollywood intersection. If this all sounds familiar, read on. At dawn, the only damage found was caused by stray ack-ack fire and traffic wrecks during the blackout.  The Navy said the next day there were no enemy planes.  The Army interviewed people and decided there were at least one to five planes over LA.  The War Department then announced the planes must have come from secret air fields in California or Mexico or from Japanese submarines. The next day the Los Angeles Times criticized the ""considerable public excitement and confusion"" caused by the alert that scared 2 million people. One California politician wanted to know if it was a calculated prank to move California's defense industries inland to other states.  The Washington Post followed on Feb. 27 with condemnation of the military's stubborn silence on the issue and the New York Times jumped in on Feb. 28 by calling the entire episode ""incredible"" and a display of ""expensive incompetence."" The movie is a wonderful glimpse of this real hysteria, a real incident and with quotes pulled right out of newspaper articles.  When Robert Stack wants to know ""where are the bombs?"" that is the same question the Air Force and Navy asked when reports came in about the thousands of planes attacking LA. All this information is available from government files on Air Force history from the Government Printing Office in Washington, D.C.  The Japanese, by the way never flew planes over LA, but did fly over Seattle, they said after the war. I LOVE 1941.  It got everything absolutely right. Right down to Belushi's plane crashing into the street and crazies going off searching for hidden airfields near Bakersfield or Barstow or where ever. This was NOT a comedy. It was just about comical people. It should have won an Oscar for BEST DOCUMENTARY."
"CinemaClown","Null","4","5","15 January 2018"," An End Product Of Steven Spielberg's Hubris
","There comes a time in every new filmmaker's career when a few initial successes makes them feel invulnerable and leads them to believe that they can do anything and get away with it, only for their hubris to be mercilessly destroyed when their next project turns out to be an absolute disaster.<br/><br/>1941 is an end product of Steven Spielberg's hubris that presents the now revered filmmaker tackling the genre of comedy after finding astonishing success with Jaws & Close Encounters, but this time he spectacularly fails at it. Arguably the worst film of his career, 1941 is nothing less than an eyesore.<br/><br/>Set during the Second World War, the story of 1941 follows the hysteria that grips the Californians in the wake of the bombing of Pearl Harbour. As paranoia sets in & chaos erupts all over the state, civilians & soldiers prepare for the Japanese invasion, while a lost Japanese submarine sends its crew to scout out the madness.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, 1941 finds the director trying way too hard in an effort to make the audience laugh but he only ends up making a mess of everything in the process. It appears as if Spielberg simply wanted to blow everything up and had his wish fulfilled with this big budget, big cast comedy that isn't even remotely funny.<br/><br/>The film is an exaggeration of everything. All the set pieces are either destroyed or blown up by the end. People keep falling here n there throughout the movie. All the characters are hyperactive. Performances are equally crazy, and not in a good way. Still, its energetic camerawork, extravagant special effects & John Williams' score is a plus.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, 1941 is a poorly conceived, awfully written & terribly executed example of blockbuster filmmaking and is a rare failure from a filmmaker who would later go on to become one of the greatest storytellers of all time. In retrospect, it's a bitter medicine that Spielberg needed, for 1941 didn't just knock some sense back into him and sober him up but also made him savour his future successes and not take his reputation for granted. A necessary dud."
"groatski","9","4","5","22 January 2004"," Why on earth did this movie bomb?
","My only guess for the dismal box office performance is that it was just too far ahead of its time. The superb movie-making abilities of Spielberg combined with an elaborate, star-studded comedy probably proved more than your typical moviegoer could digest back in 1979. '1941' is the only movie I can remember seeing that I thought was funny as hell when I watched it as a kid, and still thought it was funny 20 years later. The gags, characters, and elaborate sets lost none of their charm in the transition between preadolescence and adulthood (which is not usually the case).<br/><br/>The story takes place on the California coast less than a week after the Pearl Harbor attacks. Both civilians and soldiers are skittish, paranoid, and seeing Japanese soldiers everywhere they look. In no time they lose all self control in a desperate effort to fight off a (mostly) imaginary enemy. I think with the sole exception of General Joe Stilwell (Robert Stack) there is not one person in the cast who stays sane or levelheaded throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I am, of course, greatly oversimplifying the plot. The movie actually follows about eight or nine different story lines that eventually converge and feed off each other in a way seldom seen in cinema. The first 30 minutes are a bit slow as the movie sets itself up, but once it gets rolling you'll laugh till it hurts."

Finally in 1982 he put together one of his greatest and most profitable films to date ""E.T. the Extra Terrestrial."" So with these credentials what happened right smack dab in the middle in 1979 when he tried to pull together ""1941."" With this odd ball comedy you either like it or you don't. It's either funny or it's not. Sometimes when there are a number of huge stars you expect too much and then become disappointed when your anticipation is not met.<br/><br/>Another example of this is ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" you may feel the story lacks but still appreciate it for the big stars whether they meet your expectations or not. Myself I didn't care for ""1941"" on the other hand I liked ""The Bonfire of the Vanities."" The point is for every good review you read about ""1941"" your bound to find a bad one and the only way you will truly know is to see the film yourself. If you like that ""Three Stooges"" type comedy then you may appreciate ""1941."" There is no doubt that this is not Speilberg's finest work, but it does offer some laughs. Now if you are one of those types that must see everything Speilberg has his hands in then you need to add this to your rental list.<br/><br/>The film is a comedy centered around California preparing to defend itself from a possible Japanese attack. In it's wake a silly Japanese submarine crew delivers many of the laughs."

","Inexplicably, Steven Spielberg chose the unlikely topic of America's paranoia around a possible Japanese invasion in 1941 for his first comedy and it's woefully unfunny. Presumably going for a IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD feel, Spielberg fails miserably. While that film had Milton Berle, Jonathan Winters and Dick Shawn, 1941 has Treat Williams, Robert Stack and Ned Beatty. Fine actors all, but hardly at home with broad comedy. Even clowns like Eddie Deezen, Dan Aykroyd and Slim Pickens barely register among the humongous cast...this is a very overpopulated movie! John Belushi, essentially reprising his Bluto role from ANIMAL HOUSE, gets a few points as a literally out-of-control fighter pilot and the opening scene, a goof on Spielberg's own JAWS, is pretty clever. Unfortunately for the remainder of the movie, Spielberg and the writers, Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale, mistake chaos and clutter for slapstick farce. Clearly a lot of money was spent on destroying things like a ferris wheel, various houses, and so on. And WHAT are Christopher Lee and Toshiro Mifune doing in this??"
"nick_jenny4976","2","14","26","28 January 2005"," oh my goodness this is bad
","Wow! being a huge fan of John Belushi, i thought any movie involving him would be at the least tolerable. but this is extremely bad. i would expect more out of Steven Spielberg as well. keeping in mind the date this move was made and the fact that Belushi was dead not long afterwords makes it even harder to stomach. Belushi was more than just a physical comedy actor. He had loads of talent, and seeing him act out goofy slapstick bits mixed in with one-liners that fall well short of funny without taking advantage of his natural comedic skills makes me yearn for the simple brilliance of Animal House. Sure Animal house was a lot of physical comedy and immature humor but it was also funny, original, and all around watchable. Anyway if you stumble across this movie on cable and think ""John Belushi, AND Steven Spielberg were involved? it can't be bad!"" take my word for it, it IS bad."

Seen it several times since and am delighted to see this movie but featuring added scenes not included on the theatrical cut. There are about 5-6 different plot threads which dovetail nicely as the movie progresses but essentially i think it comes down to three main stories. Los Angeles, 1941 and in the wake of Pearl Harbour Americans are coming to terms with the paranoia and fear of a possible Japanese invasion. There's Army Captain Tim Matheson desperate to get Nancy Allen up in an airplane where she will be sexually responsive to his advances. Then you have civilian Ned Beatty discovering the Army want to put an AA gun in his yard. In the mean time, Beatty's daughter is being wooed by two men, civilian dancer Bobby DiCicco and aggressive soldier Treat Williams who fight for her against the backdrop of a fabulously arranged swingdance sequence. All this whilst a Japanese submarine is submerging off the Californian coast. Throw in a dozen other wonderful characters and performances and you've got a terrific ensemble cast.

","Possible spoilers...<br/><br/>This movie is actually pretty good when seen in the right context.  'Blues Brothers' doesn't need the context, but this requires a little thinking to get through it.  Audiences in '79 couldn't because Spielberg hadn't given us enough of his brain to work with.  He created a giant behemoth and we were wondering what it was about.<br/><br/>Comedy works only when you can take something the audience can understand and relate to, then taking some spins with it.  In this regard, it's one of the hardest genres to win in.  Scott got his right the first time ('Matchstick').  If this film had worked long ago, Spielberg would've been changed for the better...maybe.<br/><br/>Let's see how '1941' becomes interesting:<br/><br/>--Spielberg's World War II obsession.  He understands the time and mood of the film far better than, say, 'Temple of Doom or 'Last Crusade.  The gung-ho soldiers are obviously a variation of 'Private Ryan.<br/><br/>--Suburbia.  Since 'Close Encounters (and even 'Jaws') we have always worked in this environment and given Spielberg money for it.  'E.t', 'Poltergeist', and 'Minority Report' come to mind right away.<br/><br/>--Our writers.  Spielberg has invented his own ""camp"" of filmmakers of which he is Der Fuhrer, visually-speaking.  Zemeckis is probably the cleverest of the campers, but only with the layered 'Future' series and 'Death Becomes Her'.  Since then he's been disappointing all along.  Milius is not of this camp and his inserts here (and in 'Jaws') stick out like Tarantino in 'Crimson Tide'.<br/><br/>--Comedy.  Of all Spielberg's comedy efforts, this is his best that doesn't try being sentimental.  Think of it, since 'Minority Report' Spielberg has been trying to make us laugh and hasn't had any luck.  Look at the miserable 'Terminal' if you don't believe me.<br/><br/>See this in conjunction with 'Hook' and 'Empire of the Sun'.  With these three you can see the Spielberg machine doing some interesting things without too many commercial trappings.  Once you're familiar with the rest of Spielberg's work, then watch this.  A premature satire of himself.  If he made it today, we'd know what he was doing.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Learn from this..."

It's a shame that director Steven Spielberg said that this is his worst movie and it only got three Oscar nominations.  I mean, at least ""1941"" is better than some of his more overrated tripe like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Jaws(not too overrated, but too many people draw comparisons) and the completely idiotic E.T.  Don't get me wrong.  Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors and he's made some pretty good movies like Saving Private Ryan(the best war movie), Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, I haven't seen A.I. yet but it looks good, the criminally underrated Amistad and the almost completely forgotten The Color Purple(his best movie)."

Nor am I usually critical of perceived racist behavior in a film if it's done within the context of the times in which the story took place, but the blatant expressions of racism in this picture was a bit too much. Painting a white stripe on Pvt.Ogden Johnson Jones (Frank McRae) was probably the most egregious example, but there were others leveled at the Germans and the Japanese as well. Okay, they were the enemy in World War II, but the attempt at humor felt more like a way to denigrate. John Belushi was fully hitting his stride in the late Seventies as a comic actor, so it's a shame he wound up in a clunker like this. Brilliant as he was as a 'Saturday Night Live' cast member, he never really achieved his potential in film before succumbing to his addictions. As Wild Bill Kelso here, he gets limited screen time in bits that are more raucous than funny; pairing him in some way with Dan Aykroyd might have served the story line better. But the story line, if there is one, is all over the place while loosely exploring what might have happened if the Japanese followed up Pearl Harbor with an attack on mainland California.

"barnabyrudge","3","11","22","6 August 2006"," The poorest film Steven Spielberg has ever directed  a colossal mish-mash that has only curiosity value going for it.
","Steven Spielberg has spent the past three decades directing one successful movie after another. A look down his list of work would throw up titles like Duel, Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, E.T, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom, Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, Jurassic Park, plus many other box office goliaths. What is more impressive still is the fact that many of his films are very good too. Not just box office successes, but genuinely well-made and well-crafted films. It is hard to think of many Spielberg films that are truly bad  some might mention Always, a somewhat soppy and forgettable love story from 1989, while others would opt for Hook, a rather over-glamorised revisit of the Peter Pan story made in 1991. But neither of these movies is actually BAD in the true sense of the word - just disappointingly average when compared to the director's better works. There is, however, one Spielberg film that fails in a spectacular way, one film so overblown, disorganised and clumsily structured that there might be proper reason to regard it a disaster. That film is 1941.<br/><br/>America is thrown into panic when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbour shortly before Christmas, 1941. On the Californian coast, people suddenly brace themselves for the possibility of a Japanese attack against their great coastal cities such as San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco. It is around this time that various people get caught up in adventures during one hectic night in LA. First, there's family man Ward Douglas (Ned Beatty), whose house overlooks the Pacific Ocean  he spends the entire evening engaged in a gunfight with a Jap submarine that surfaces in the bay opposite his home. Hollis Wood (Slim Pickens) is captured by the same Japanese submariners and swallows a compass so that they cannot easily navigate their way back out to sea. Then there's crazy pilot Wild Bill Kelso (John Belushi), who single handedly patrols the sky in his battered fighter plane, searching for enemy planes approaching the American coast. Meanwhile, young fast-food chef Wally Stephens (Bobby Di Cicco) spends the entire evening trying to win the affections of a young beauty, but faces stiff competition from the horny soldier Sitarski (Treat Williams); womanising army man Birkhead (Tim Matheson) lies his way into danger in order to impress a sexy female named Donna (Nancy Allen); and a couple of nitwits (Murray Hamilton, Eddie Deezen) spend the night on a fairground ferris wheel looking out for enemy planes and submarines in a foolhardy attempt to protect their country from an invasion.<br/><br/>It's obvious just from the plot synopsis that 1941 is a cluttered, unfocused mess of a movie. There's too much going on  too many unrelated subplots and too many big actors in preposterously brief guest roles  for the film's own good. To further confound matters, Spielberg opts to present the film, in his own words, as a ""stupidly outrageous celebration of paranoia"". In other words, he has turned this plot in the unlikeliest of comedies. However, Spielberg's idea of comedy in this film is to throw as much broad slapstick and expensive destruction at the audience as he can. The non-stop obliteration of streets, buildings, vehicles and even fairground rides loses its ability to provoke laughter through sheer unrelenting repetition. Throughout his career Spielberg has often been criticised for being too sentimental, but in this film he goes completely the other way and creates a film that is, if anything, excessively destructive and anarchic. 1941 is a spectacular failure  worth seeing on a curiosity level, but certainly not interesting in any other way."

","I can't imagine how anyone, even Steven Spielberg, can make a movie like this and call it `Spectacular.'  1941, a so-called comedy that depicts events in California after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, is not even close to passable and is one of the worst movies ever.  The hilarity isn't there, the performances are all lame and the special effects are as dumb as ever.  Even the JAWS parody at the beginning is turkey material.  This is Spielberg's absolute lowpoint, a big budget bomb that fails so miserably that it makes the awful film EARTHQUAKE look like a masterpiece.  A real fiasco.<br/><br/>0 out of 5"
"ejonconrad","1","5","8","16 May 2017"," Even worse than I remember
","I remember really looking forward to this movie when it came out. It was hyped like crazy and it starred pretty much everyone I thought was funny at the time. I also remember sitting there trying to will myself to laugh as it sunk in what a terrible movie it was.<br/><br/>I recently re-watched it, and it's even worse than I remembered, because even the stuff that was mildly entertaining 40 years ago hasn't aged well.<br/><br/>Where to start? One word: cocaine. That's the only thing that can possibly explain the frenetic misfire that is this movie. First of all, there's an absurd number of characters in an absurd number of subplots. On top of that, the subplots have bizarre details thrown in. For example, Treat Williams' ""hilarious rapist"" (rape is funny, right?) character has a weird phobia of eggs. What does this have to do with anything? Absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>The movie relies excessively on Three Stooges-style spit takes and prat falls. There's also a lot of screaming: ""Japs!"", ""Invasion!"", ""Someone help! (this guy is trying to rape me)"".<br/><br/>This time, I watched the extended version, and even at 2 1/2 hours (!!), it seemed like a lot of stuff was left out. A couple of the threads are wrung out in excruciating details while others seem to have missing chunks. There's a big build up to Warren Oats' appearance, but then it just comes and goes. Did he have more scenes on the cutting room floor? One guy has a ventriloquist's dummy for....some reason. Did they plan to do something more with it? like, something funny? How exactly did John Belushi end up flying around alone ""looking for Japs""? <br/><br/>So much of the humor is badly misplaced. I mentioned the attempted rape. We're not talking Brutus chasing Olive oil. We're talking Treat Williams dragging a woman under a car as she screams for help - and this is basically played for laughs, with another woman disappointed he's not trying to rape her. Also, the big fight is clearly supposed to be the zoot suit riots (which actually happened in 1943). There was absolutely nothing funny about those. Soldiers and white civilians were straight up assaulting Mexican-American youths while the authorities looked the other way, or even joined in. <br/><br/>A solid half of the movie is devoted to destruction of property. In fact, I'm pretty sure Spielberg started with a list of who he wanted in the move and another list of the things he wanted to destroy and just sort of wrote the movie around them. All this destruction was impressive when the movie was made, but now the whole thing literally looks like a Universal Studios tour.<br/><br/>I can't think of another example of this much talent being wasted in a single movie. There was all the hot comic talent at the time: Dan Ackroyd, John Candy, John Belushi, Tim Matheson, etc, and classic stars like Slim Pickens, Christopher Lee, and Japanese star Toshiro Mifune, and lots of other big names at the time, like Nancy Allen and Treat Williams. Not to mention a few characters recycled form Spielberg's other movies. Everyone was tripping over themselves to be in a Spielberg movie. It took real work for that cast of characters to turn in something this awful.<br/><br/>Weirdly, John Williams' score is quite good. Too bad it wasn't used for a better movie."

It is the only thing that is Elegant in this Gaudy, Loud, Unfunny Comedy.<br/><br/>There are so Many Stars here that maybe, but Doubtful, is an Homage to MGM (""More Stars than In the Heavens""). The frames in this Film are so Full and the Pacing so Manic and the Laughs so Infrequent, that it doesn't take the breath away, it Suffocates the Viewer into a Coma.<br/><br/>The Cinematography looks Great. But it tries and Fails to be a Spicy Spoof of ""Haw-wee-wood"" Excess, maybe, but who knows?

","Okay, so Jaws, the Indiana Jones trilogy, Close Encounters, Jurassic Park, etc. etc. etc. gave me great respect for Steven Spielberg. This movie made me want to punch him in the jaw. I mean, I still have the respect, but I'd just like to give him a quick jab to even things out.<br/><br/>A ""comedy"" in the loosest term of the word. So my friend and I were talking a while back about whether any comedies about war had ever been made, and then we saw that there was this movie. Hey, and it was directed by Steven Spielberg. Cool! Then, of course, we actually saw the movie.<br/><br/>In the vein of Airplane! and The Naked Gun! except not funny; that's probably the best way to describe it. The plot revolves around an ensemble of people during a fictional Japanese invasion of Los Angeles in WWII. To those who think it was wrong and insulting to do a comedy during a war: 1) it wasn't funny anyway, and 2) what's the difference between doing a comedy set during a war and doing a romance set during a war?<br/><br/>Sorry, just ranting about Pearl Harbor. I mean, think of if they made a romance movie based around 9/11... anyway, stay away from this movie unless you laugh at anything. Krog out."

","Steven Spielberg's brand new take on comedy might be effective at times, considering how risky his use of over-the-top slapstick turns in the end, escalating until concluding in a extravagant and exaggerated third act, also including a compellingly funny cast, but with a certain use of absurdity in its humor, this could result in either a love it-or hate it- entry in the director's filmography, also considering its profane themes towards a sensitive subject as World War II."

","I have a sneaking suspicion that Steven Spielberg must have seen and loved It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World as a sixteen year old kid and resolved that if he became as big a movie name as Stanley Kramer he'd do a film just like it. In 1979 Spielberg succeeded admirably creating a chaotic classic about a very serious time.<br/><br/>I doubt we're ever going to be ready for decades for a film like this about the days following the Twin Towers. Those were pretty scary days, especially on the Pacific coast where our fleet with the remarkable exception of the carriers was at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and who really knew where and how many the Japanese were following the attack in Hawaii. <br/><br/>It should give you cold chills to think that if it was more than Toshiro Mifune lost submarine with German observer Christopher Lee on it that they would have been met with what we see in 1941. At the time our home defense on the Pacific Coast was commanded by Major General Joseph L. Stillwell known to all as Vinegar Joe. But he could be moved as we see as he takes in a screening of Dumbo which did come out around that time. <br/><br/>Like It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World the cast it populated with some of the great comedians and comic players of the time. At some point or other they all intersect in their comic defense of California under attack from the Japanese as surely as the world was under attack from Orson Welles's broadcast of War Of The Worlds.<br/><br/>There are a lot of memorable performances where some serious players got to show a comic side and really get unrestrained. One example would be crazy National Guard colonel Warren Oates meeting up with equally crazy would be air ace John Belushi. Slim Pickens saves California by his Faux constipation, he really goes unrestrained. Tim Matheson as Stilwell's aide is as horny as he was in Animal House as he maps out a campaign to nail aviation buff Nancy Allen and winds up midair in a plane he knows not how to fly.<br/><br/>Robert Stack plays Vinegar Joe Stilwell the only true character in 1941 and he plays it straight as a string. If he survived this bunch of lunatics, how come he couldn't get Chiang Kai-Shek off his duff and fight those Japanese who were really invading his country? Maybe duty in the Far East was a welcome relief for Stilwell, but not for long.<br/><br/>Be eternally grateful that this was NOT the way it was in 1941 and sit back and enjoy."

With an unbelievable collection of actors, and probably a film that Spielberg would like to forget he made, 1941 ranks up there with Caddyshack and other classic comedies."

","At the time he made this colossal turkey, Steven Spielberg was the new wunderkind on the block and after the massive successes of ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters..."", it seemed he couldn't miss. Armed with a massive budget (and trust me, you can see every dollar spent on the screen), with pet writer Robert Zemeckis on scripting duties he must have thought he couldn't go wrong. Unfortunately it's more a case of what could go right in this unfunny monument to excess, so bad is it, in fact, that the director has never attempted a full-out comedy ever since.<br/><br/>The premise of a rogue Japanese submarine, unaccountably with a German staff officer on board too, invading Hollywood is dumb, while the side by side, I hesitate to call them stories of a bullying tough-guy soldier terrorising a young jitterbugging couple, an out-of-his-box fighter pilot seeking a dog-fight every time he gets in the cockpit and lastly the misadventures of a frigid beauty who only gets turned on when in the vicinity of a plane are hackneyed and infantile. The U.S. teenage magazine ""Mad"" I think had to be an inspiration for this mess, hardly the basis for screen comedy (c.f. ""Howard The Duck"").<br/><br/>There are no characters worthy of the description in the entire movie, no central person to follow and most importantly no worthwhile jokes to make the viewer smile, never mind laugh. Spielberg's idea of the punch-line to a scene is to offer up a cast of thousands and a lot of bangs, crashes and explosions.<br/><br/>With mediocre acting too, this really is a plane-crash of a movie, once seen, instantly forgotten, as unfunny a comedy as the later ""Pearl Harbour"", on a similar subject was an unintentionally funny drama, these two wrongs not making a right!<br/><br/>War really is hell, as the saying goes - ditto this awfully bad movie."

Well you get 1941, a truly awful movie. Everything is cranked up to 11 so much that it makes for a painful ordeal to watch at times, and with no main character to focus the story on (there is one in there somewhere I think) things just happen at what feels like pure random. The script is aimless, pointless, childish, crude and underdeveloped and the big set pieces just feel like a big waste of money. Belushi is hardly in the movie and was either drunk or stoned whenever he was, his part is pointless anyway, John Candy looks genuinely bored at times and he's hardly in it either. Dan Aykroyd is the only one with more than five lines, but his talent is hardly pushed to the limit, and most of the other cast members just goof around, shout, fight, dance and argue with each other, its really tiring to watch. And poor Christopher Lee probably wished he'd stuck to playing mute vampires rather than a pointless nazi part with only a few lame lines. A massive headache of a movie. Avoid at all costs."
"RiffRaffMcKinley","10","7","13","30 August 2007"," Why ""1941"" is one of my 20 all-time favorite films
","Here's the short list: it has a lot of epic-scale slapstick humor; it sounds great; it looks great; and I greatly admire Steven Spielberg for doing a comedy instead of his run-of-the-mill fare (and just in time... with ""CE3K,"" he really lost his touch).<br/><br/>Here's the long list.<br/><br/>With a mammoth cast, a few characters are going to get lost somewhere in the shuffle. Thank heavens Spielberg knew which ones were the right ones to spend less time on-- for example, the shtick with Madman Maddox would have grown very repetitious, given time. I think people's complaints about cast members like Bobby DiCicco, Nancy Allen, and Lorraine Gary are totally unfounded. After all, DiCicco is really the main character of the film, and yet he doesn't even get top billing (try finding his name, say, on a DVD box) in favor of Belushi and Aykroyd, who are terrific in the movie. But even they are considered as ""gone to waste"" here, for no reason whatsoever-- Belushi's Wild Bill Kelso is one of the best maniacs in cinematic history, and Aykroyd is playing a man named Sgt. Frank Tree (need I say more?).<br/><br/>Thanks to John Williams' stirring musical score (one of his best and most underrated works) and William A. Fraker's breathtaking cinematography, the film achieves a feel of real substance and grandeur. Throw in a sexually aggressive USO girl (the late and marvelous Wendie Jo Sperber), a whiny Nazi (Christopher Lee), a redneck lumberjack named Hollis Wood (Slim Pickens), and a ""Dumbo""-loving general (Robert Stack)-- not to mention a spectacular dance scene that morphs into one of the greatest spectacles ever-- and you've got yourself one doozy of a movie.<br/><br/>If people don't like this movie, it's because it's different more than anything else. This is one of the best movies of all time, and it would be nice if more people could realize that. A word to the wise: watch this in widescreen and uncut. Then, when you're done, if you're using the Collector's Edition DVD, go back and watch with the isolated music score. It's terrific... all of it."
"slokes","3","10","21","25 April 2003"," Superstar comedy falls flat
","""1941"" was a film that carried great expectations when it was released at the end of 1979. The two most versatile stars of the season's biggest TV comedy hit, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of ""Saturday Night Live,"" were brought together for the first time on the big screen. The subject, LA panic in the days right after Pearl Harbor, promised trendy iconoclastic fun at the expense of the War Years generation and their uptight, stuffy values in a ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" meets ""Animal House"" kind of way. And the director, one Steven Spielberg, was coming off two of the biggest films of this, or any other, decade: ""Jaws"" (1975) and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1978). What could go wrong?<br/><br/>Everything.<br/><br/>Like ""Casino Royale"" the previous decade, ""1941"" is the sort of comedy that defines the excesses and exaggerated stereotypes of its audience. It also manages the same ratio of one decent joke per name actor. Aykroyd does okay in the role of a tank crew commander, with his big spiel about whether a crowd of maniacs want to put Tojo in the White House. Belushi is just embarrassing in a bigger role with no laughs, as a pilot who smokes a never-extinguishing cigar stump and can't seem to sit in his cockpit for five seconds without going ass over feet. Aykroyd and Blutto don't even meet, a bit of a cheat.<br/><br/>The whole gimmick of the War Years gone loco seems just stupid. You could probably make good fun at the expense of the Greatest Generation if you had a decent script, but this is a hackneyed slog through the Big Muddy with pointless crashes; monotonous explosions; and strange, mid-punchline editing and pumped-up orchestration that positively screams flailing desperation. Consider that Americans had every right to feel war nerves as they recovered from the gut kick of Dec. 7, and the forced laughs of ""1941"" feel doubly inappropriate. The Japanese weren't Nazis, but the distinction would have been lost on a number of U.S. and Allied POWs in Bataan and other places, not to mention countless Chinese and Koreans. Yet this film treats them as if they are the best kind of people on the planet, Pearl Harbor or not. Simply put, I hope I'm not around by the time someone decides to make a movie with Al-Queda operatives in the role of cute, fuzzy Ewoks running rampant through Seattle.<br/><br/>Which leads to Spielberg. Yes, you get the famous director from such films as Jaws (self-referential opening), Always (fascination with planes), Empire of the Sun (fascination with the Japanese warrior spirit), along with the suffused lighting (Close Encounters, ET, Saving Private Ryan) and nasty Germans (entire opus) that, among other things, distinguishes Spielberg's work. His work isn't just subpar here, it's bad, strangely so given he obviously put real heart into it, and that, despite his commercial success, he's a truly great director worth knowing and celebrating for the whole of his work, even crap like ""The Color Purple"" and ""Jurassic Park II.""<br/><br/>I guess what annoyed me most about the movie, as an American, was the moronic treatment of my own (and Spielberg's) nationality, especially as it is contrasted with the noble Japanese (whose quest for honor is about the only thing this film sees fit to honor). In a very good documentary that accompanies the DVD, Spielberg reveals that both John Wayne and Charlton Heston declined the role of Joseph Stilwell, complaining the movie was anti-American. Bless those boys. Having my country bashed around isn't so awful in itself, it's a strong nation that's withstood worse, but if you want to take on Old Glory, the material better be a mite better than the likes of ""My name's Wild Bill Kelso, and don't you forget it"" or a house falling into the Santa Monica coastline.<br/><br/>Hey, I did like the dummy, however."

","Director Steven Spielberg's first theatrical misfire has bombastic humor and amped-up energy to spare--all it needs is a sharp, merciless editor to eliminate its excesses. Made up of equal parts ""I Wanna Hold Your Hold"" and ""Animal House"", the film opens with a spoof of ""Jaws"" that is funny and well done. The USO sequence is alive and crackling (any of the scenes with Bobby DiCicco and Dianne Kay are good), however John Belushi's Captain Wild Bill Kelso is a nuisance (perhaps recasting Belushi in Treat Williams' role of Corporal Sitarski might have saved some time). Buried under the morass is a fitfully funny spoof of wartime, although I tired easily of Ned Beatty running around with a shotgun. Robert Stack is wonderful, and the scenes between Tim Matheson and Nancy Allen in the airplane are fine if overextended, just like most of the bits and pieces in ""1941"". It has gloppy cinematography, messy comic staging and unconvincing sets. Spielberg's hopes for a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad War surely include isolated moments of inspiration--even brilliance--but those moments get trampled in the traffic. ** from ****"

","THIS REVIEW IS ON THE THEATRICAL CUT OF THE FILM<br/><br/>Spielberg, what horror have you wrought?<br/><br/>Buoyed by the success of 'Jaws' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (both films that I consider to be somewhat overrated), the young auteur Steven Spielberg decided that the time was right for a vanity project. The project? A screwball WWII film littered with numbing spectacles straight out of Cecil B. Demille's period epics.<br/><br/>On paper, such a project boasts great potential. One cannot deny that, amid all the atrocities and horrors of the Second World War, there was an underlining sense of heightened and morbidly hilarious tragedy that, in the right hands, would be the perfect fodder for farce. It also has the added benefit of attracting the adoration of critics for it's gutsy agenda and subject matter. Yet, through the lens of one of Earth's most naturally gifted filmmakers, it is an unparalleled abomination of comedy.<br/><br/>If one wanted to summarise in a mere four words just what is wrong with this film, I would humbly suggest that you use these so ordained vocables: 'IT NEVER SHUTS UP!' Every single second of '1941' is filled with explosions, car crashes, plane crashes, brawling, and gun fights. I gathered that the film was supposed to be a farce, but farces only really work when one has a sense of escalating catastrophe. With '1941', there is no sense of escalation because nothing really escalates; it's uninhibitedly mad from the get-go and it's uninhibitedly mad by the end. Indeed, the only vaguely quiet scenes in this film are those featuring the villains (Toshiro Mifune and the great Christopher Lee deserve to have their name associated with a better Spielberg picture than this), and even they are sullied by a grating cameo by Slim Pickens. <br/><br/>The controlled and demonstrably contrived anarchy of '1941' made the hour and fifty minutes it took to watch this film feel like the longest and most grueling one hour and fifty minutes of my life. It's not that I have a distaste for screwball shenanigans, considering that almost all of my favourite comedies in some shape or form incorporate such pantomimic elements of that titanic arena of absurdity that we call farce; it's more that I dislike comedies that have almost no concept of the constitutions of a good joke. Though such a thing is considered subjective, I dare you to deny that my definition is an all-encompassing one. The constitutions, or rather constitution, of a good joke is a sharp contrast. Take any joke, good or bad, and you'll find that the reason it is either good or bad is because the contrast between two separate ideas is either elegantly or poorly highlighted.<br/><br/>Well, the contrast in '1941' is very, very poorly highlighted. I'm guessing, from the film's narrative, that it was something along the lines of 'War is a serious business, but the participants are adult children'. Well, it gets the 'adult children' aspect right, what with the crew of a Japanese submarine emerging from the water with a naked night swimmer on their periscope and fighter pilots blowing up the petrol stations of innocent, elderly citizens to the sound of heroic themes by John Williams; and what with US military personal rioting in Hollywood Boulevard whilst a Benny Hill sex romp ensues between a zoot suit wearing dancer and a sex-crazed soldier (that culminates in what appears to be a rape... charming) and an officer having sex with a girl he fancies as the two pilot an aeroplane over a crowded city with reckless abandon; aaannnndddd what with a platoon shooting out lights in Hollywood Boulevard whilst people are still standing beneath them just because an air raid siren has sounded and a black out has not gone into immediate effect... AND WHAT WITH civilian patrolmen stationing themselves in Ferris Wheels that can somehow roll perfectly down peers just in case any 'Japs' show up on the horizon (which of course they do).<br/><br/>What it doesn't do is highlight anything resembling the reality of war, something the film sorely needed to do if it wanted to get a laugh out of us during the many elaborately choreographed slapstick sequences that I'm sure cost more money than the United States presently owes to China to film. Instead, we get innumerable scenes of intricate physical comedy that seems uncertain about whether it wants to emulate Jacques Tati or 'The Three Stooges'.<br/><br/>Perhaps I wouldn't mind so much if the film had some colourful dialogue that I could endlessly quote to befuddled acquaintances. But it doesn't. In fact, the film has so little wit that I'd swear it was a big-budgeted 'Death at a Funeral', but then I would be doing that film a disservice for failing to acknowledge it's ability to recognise a need for contrast. The only vaguely witty jokes in this film are the ones about ethnicity, and it's a bit of a sad thing when the best jokes that a big-budget film like this can cough up are to do with such a pedestrian topic.<br/><br/>And it's almost pitiful that the man responsible for such brilliant films as 'Duel', 'Schindler's List', and 'Minority Report' can produce something so obnoxiously unfunny. And I thought 'The Terminal' was bad..."

But it takes more than a catalog of explosions and creative destruction to make a funny movie. The odd thing is, it is hard to stop watching it. You can't help thinking that with this much talent it just has to get better at some point - but it doesn't. I can't help thinking that with a smaller budget and a tighter focus on fewer characters this could have been a much more entertaining movie. Steven Spielberg might have taken a lesson from ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" - throwing a lot of big names and wads of money on the screen does not guarantee a good time."

","Forget ""Jurassic Park."" This was Steven Spielberg's first true ""disaster movie,"" albeit it a more literal one. Yes, ""1941"" is a pretty bad film and probably deserves its reputation. It was such a flop in 1979 that advance teasers for ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" boasted ""from the director of..."" and listed all of Spielberg's previous films -- except this one.<br/><br/>Keep in mind Stevey was new to the game. ""JAWS"" had been a breakthrough in '75 and grossed more than a Columbian drug dealer would make at a party with Robert Downey Jr., Edward Furlong and Scott Weiland.<br/><br/>""Close Encounters"" came next in 1977 and broke more records. The critics were just waiting for Spielberg to bomb; he wasn't solidified as the world's most popular director of all-time yet, and much like today's M. Night Shyamalan, he had a large enough reputation that was fresh enough to fall apart.<br/><br/>""1941"" almost ended it. The movie went phenomenally over budget, ended up being some three hours long, the editors hacked it apart and as a result no one could follow it. The DVD features a 2 and a half hour director's cut that is, surprisingly, no better than the original version. ""Once Upon a Time in America"" this is not -- Spielberg's editors didn't destroy the movie. BOTH versions sucked! The cast, at the time, was another reason it was hyped up so much. Get this: John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton, Ned Beatty, John Candy, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Lee, Tim Matheson, Warren Oates, Robert Stack, Treat Williams, Slim Pickens, Joe Flaherty, Michael McKean, Dick Miller, Penny Marshall and James Caan.<br/><br/>Nowadays only a few really stand out but back then Gary, Hamilton, Beatty, and Matheson were very popular. Belushi and Matheson had both starred in the smash hit ""Animal House"" a year before so considering this too was a slapstick comedy, obviously people were expecting a sequel of sorts.<br/><br/>The film is split up so each story has at least one famous face. That's part of the reason it fails I think -- too many celebs can wreck a movie sometimes because it's just way too showy and over-packed, trying to make equal room for each person. Sacrificing names for story might have been a better idea.<br/><br/>This doesn't seem like a Spielberg film and yet at the same time it represents everything he is known for. It tries to come across as a low-key silly comedy like ""Animal House"" (which it was very much cashing in on) but the problem is Spielberg was so high at this point (not literally, of course, but maybe that too) he couldn't handle anything mildly. Every scene plays like a silly slapstick comedy a la ""Airplane!"" but it's glamorous, expensive and over-the-top -- betraying slapstick's roots. It's too choreographed and glossy to be a stupid movie. It doesn't click together at any point.<br/><br/>Belushi is pretty much wasted and doesn't get many funny scenes. Aykroyd gets a better dealing but his team (mainly the hilarious John Candy) all get underplayed and I didn't even understand what the point of Candy's character actually was, generally speaking.<br/><br/>This movie is frantic, wild and all over the place. It's surprisingly raunchy and slapstick for a Spielberg film but maybe that's just because he's avoided making another disaster like this ever since. It's not a terrible movie and it's not as bad as ""Pearl Harbor"" but as a war movie it's just so-so, and as a comedy it really misses its mark because it's too big, bloated and spectacular to find funny -- always aiming for the big stuff instead of the genuine laughs. I think that's a problem Spielberg has had to face his entire career, and even his greatest films can be accused of similar errors in judgment.<br/><br/>It's worth seeing just for its reputation's sake, but it's not underrated by any means and certainly a struggle to sit through at times. Spielberg says on the DVD (which I unfortunately purchased as a blind buy) that Americans just don't get the film, but it's always greeted with warm welcome in Europe, and they seem to ""get it"" there. I don't know if that's true, though, because every European I've talked to who's seen this seems to hate it more than Americans I know!"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Comedy is hard. When someone can't do it, it indicates that they are not really masters of their craft. Some of the bastions of Hollywood are embarrassed by this. Harrison Ford for instance, and here the widely worshiped Spielberg. Most of the failures at comedy are simple failures -- uninteresting. (Or they just work with an adolescent audience.) But this one is interesting.<br/><br/>Spielberg is famous for his notion that films are not like books. They are not supposed to be intelligent and complex, but simple. He promotes the much studied theory of `high concept.' The idea is that any film should be comprehensibly described in 25 words. Further, in his own version of HC, the film is not only storyboarded, but is EXPLICABLE by the storyboards. In other words, the film exists first as a comic book, so MUST be without depth.<br/><br/>The good news is that he can focus, focus, focus, and the product is heavily cinematic. You can understand his successes in these terms: `Jaws,' `Close Encounters,' `Raiders,' `Jurassic,' even his so-called `serious' films: `Schindler,' `Amistad,' the first 20 minutes of `Ryan.' I appreciate the fact that he can create a single vision and sustain it through the work in terms of an image vocabulary. So many directors seem to lack this skill. But his effect is always cheap, and its success in implanting itself in our minds and culture cheapens us.<br/><br/>It is harder to see this flaw with films that we like, for instance the Indiana films. That's why failures like this and `Hook' are so important. It helps to remind us why we like stupid stuff when we think we are being serious. But most of us -- if the thing is at root supposed to be funny -- it has to be smart underneath. <br/><br/>And it is why Spielberg isn't important to the history of film, except in adding some visual slang. Zemekis, the collector of the gags which comprise this film, is a lesser Spielberg. This same mentality is the core of `Gump.'<br/><br/>John Williams does another of his shameless ripoffs of Bernstein, specifically `The Great Escape.'"

","This is easily Spielberg's worst film... loud and overbearing, obnoxious, devoid of intelligence (let alone plot), and unpleasant. There's not a single likeable character among the 3 dozen or so whom we are forced to follow around for 150 minutes-- as they scream at, hit, kick, and shoot at each other. I'm amazed that so many people on this site seem to love it-- I could sort of understand liking it if you're really into explosions and wanton destruction and that sort of thing, but even on that level, it is not remotely funny-- just big and loud and annoying.<br/><br/>""1941"" can provoke a few guffaws of disbelief from me every half hour or so, in an ""I can't believe that so many people in charge of so much expensive, destructive equipment are all so stupid"" kind of way. But not in a ""ha, ha"" kind of way. If this movie were made during World War II, I can picture it being made by the Germans as a kind of anti-American propaganda film to demonstrate how dumb Americans were.<br/><br/>
I remember seeing this in the theaters when I was 7 and being freaked out by all the noise and so-called ""cartoon"" violence, especially Ned Beatty gradually wrecking his home. Watching it again over 20 years later, I thought maybe it would grow on me, that I was just an impressionable kid...<br/><br/>Nope, I still don't see what's funny about a man losing everything he has, right before Christmas, with a war beginning, and a wife and 4 kids to take care of. Maybe if we really HATED Ned Beatty's character, okay, but we don't and we're not supposed to, so why is it funny again, Mr. Spielberg? I can at least understand why it's ""funny"" when asshole Treat Williams repeatedly gets kicked in the balls, splattered with egg, etc. (poetic justice, just desserts), but the house-collapsing humor eludes me.<br/><br/>I think this is why, aside from this board, the general consensus is that this film pretty much sucked. Comedies are not, by definition, depressing. And if Spielberg was aiming for black comedy, well, he pretty much missed the boat on that too.<br/><br/>Good effects and action sequences? Yes. But humorous? No."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","2","3","5","29 August 2014"," Spielberg's demolition film
","Strange projects are common among popular directors. There's always that one oddball of the whole group that stands out from the rest. The thing is, this isn't the good kind of notoriety. These individual ugly ducklings reign supreme of being the film that doesn't fall in the same line as the rest of the director's efforts. Although Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) wasn't at all written as effectively as Jaws (1975), it had smart visuals and an interesting concept to back it up. That still didn't make it entertaining though. It was a far cry from being good. But, after viewing this, Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) at least has a plot in some respects. Here, director Steven Spielberg goes all out with the quality of his production and totally ignores the narrative aspect to this movie. It truly is a bad movie.<br/><br/>Shockingly, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, the two who would make the ever-popular Back to the Future (1985) trilogy, carried out the writing. It's just baffling though to how here bad the story telling is. The problem is that there is no story. Throughout the entire running time, viewers just follow random events of different groups of individuals until all of their story lines collide at the climax. The only thing connecting them altogether is that it's the year 1941 - that's a very weak connection. Even worse is the grand magnitude of the casting that was done for this movie. You have Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, John Belushi, Murray Hamilton, Christopher Lee, Treat Williams, Nancy Allen, John Candy, Slim Pickens, Michael McKean, Dick Miller, Mickey Rourke and the list goes on and on. Yet, not one character has any sort of development. Not a shred. They are all just randomly placed characters in a period piece with no exposition to their background or contain much humanity.<br/><br/>Speaking of period piece, who's idea was it to make this a comedy? There were only about three times I chuckled...forget laughing. Was this film supposed to parody that of what America went through during World War II? It wasn't memorable nor did it feel respectful for the people who gave their lives (on either side). What's even more disrespectful is that none of the scenes connect very well or make much sense. There's a city brawl scene that goes on for minutes on end. There are scenes where viewers watch John Belushi fly his plane with little to no reason until much later. Come on guys, make a story. Spielberg's direction is also very questionable this time around. I'm not sure what his angle was but in every scene something is being demolished. It's as if Spielberg was testing to see how many perfectly good-looking set pieces he could destroy. In some ways it feels like the 70s version of a Michael Bay explosion extravaganza. It never stops.<br/><br/>Plus with the editing, the running time, which is only 2 hours, feels like an eternity. Michael Kahn, an editor for several famous movies must've been off his rocker for this one. How did he not think there weren't any scenes to trim? The cinematography isn't very special because majority of the movie is in the dark. Not a very visual experience. The practical effects are good but again with everything else a miss, it's not much praising over. Even John Williams' score was mehh. It definitely had the classic Williams listening experience but for a film that was so hodge-podge it barely makes up for the problems. Plus, I heard no memorable theme. Williams can do better than that.<br/><br/>It has good practical effects, a large cast of famous actors and acceptable music. However, with scenes that barely connect with one another, thin characters, questionable humor and a transparent plot, this is by far Steven Spielberg's worst movies. What was he thinking?"

","While I have a middle of the road attitude about this movie, like others I respond more often to individual scenes rather than whole movies, of which there were a few here. One that sings in my memory is General Stillwell (Robert Stack)discovering that ""Dumbo"" is playing in in the theater of the town that he has just entered, then seated we see him reacting to the song ""When I See and Elephant Fly"" by mouthing the words, then looking around a little sheepishly to see if anyone has seen him doing this.

"dl-82226","2","1","1","21 January 2019"," Interesting failure
","This is a bad movie. Don't watch it for an enjoyable viewing experience. But it's actually enjoyable to analyze the reasons for the failure - 1941 fails, but fails in a somewhat interesting way that is worth discussing, especially for industry people.<br/><br/>First, it fails because of a lack of any appealing main characters. The most compelling characters are Belushi's crazed pilot and the character of General Stilwell. Robert Stack's onscreen portrayal of Stilwell is actually reasonably faithful to the real man, who was a much more interesting personality than he appears to be in this strange film. The fact that 1941 treated Stilwell with respect is one of the very few things I liked about it. That said, audiences need an appealing main protagonist to root for and this movie doesn't have any. From the first moments we see bizarre and apparently very stupid people running around, getting into fights, and generally behaving badly.<br/><br/>That gets to the second point, which is that the movie is just tonally off from the very beginning. I get the humorous allusion to Jaws, but it's very discordant to see that in this historical setting. Fundamentally, although the panic in California after Pearl Harbor certainly had its humorous aspects, the fact is that the Pearl Harbor attack killed thousands of people by drowning, fire and other very cruel ways, not to mention that it was the opening phase of a war that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and ultimately literally tens of millions of other people. I think Spielberg on some level realized that doing WWII as a comedy just didn't work and his serious treatments of the war, especially Empire of the Sun, have been some of his greatest successes as a director. There is actually more effective comedy in ""Empire"" and in ""Saving Private Ryan"" than there is here, and the reason it's more effective is because it doesn't deny the seriousness and suffering of the war.<br/><br/>Third, the movie is obsessed with craft and effects. Of course everyone knows now that Spielberg is an effects master and he was developing his skills here, but it just feels wrong for a silly film like this, it makes everything look overdone, like the nightclub fight scene that becomes ridiculously elaborate and goes on way too long. Actually, there is incredible costume and hair work in these scenes; the 1940s look is dead on. The cinematography and sequencing is good too. But none of this matters because the actors are all cardboard cutouts that we don't care about. There's no heart, no humanity.<br/><br/>Fourth, the writing is remarkably bad. Zemeckis, Gale, Milius: these are big names with big credits. How did they mess this up so badly? Were they on drugs? Were they too inexperienced to know what they were doing? Everything about it is just cliched and an insult to the intelligence from the very first scene. Hell, I've never written a screenplay and everyone has to learn somehow, but I'm pretty confident that if I sat down to write one today I could do better than this. At least I know that you have to establish sympathetic characters, and just having actors scream at the camera isn't inherently funny - the montage of screaming actors in the end credits must be one of the most cringey sequences ever put on film. Just why, Stephen? Why?<br/><br/>Fifth, without question the worst kind of movie for audiences is the unfunny comedy. Laughter is wonderful and one of the best parts of being alive, and it's worth a ticket price just to escape our problems for a couple of hours. But the unfunny comedy doesn't deliver, and the disappointment is like a kick in the stomach. 1941 isn't funny, and the harder it tries to be the less it is. I watched this film with a completely open mind and no preconceptions; I'd heard it was bad but I love many films that were critically panned so I really had no idea what to expect. There was no relief. The comedy scenes just flop lifelessly, like a dead horse blown up with compressed air. Belushi and Aykroyd try their best but can't breathe any energy into the mess.<br/><br/>Personally I only laughed one time - for some reason, the scene where Aykroyd's character gets hit in the head and starts babbling about refrigerators did strike me as funny in an absurdist way. But that was literally the only time. The rest of the run time I was just marveling at how awful the film was and wondering how such a fiasco could happen with so many talented people involved.<br/><br/>Sixth, there are some clumsy political points here that seem shoved in to neutralize what is, by 2018 standards, some pretty jaw-dropping racism and sexism. The women in the film are basically plastic dolls and the minority characters seem to be just shoved in for political correctness points (although nobody thought in those terms in the early 80s). There is a halfhearted narrative about the zoot suit riots (chronologically incorrect), but it comes across so flat and artificial that you end up with less sympathy for the zoot suiters than you had before watching the film.<br/><br/>The movie also can't decide how it feels about the military; there is a lot of late 60s gratuitous military bashing, where military people are basically stupid apes who can't do anything right. At the same time though, the movie wants to be patriotic, but in the late 60s counterculture sense where show business hippies somehow love their country more than the Army, despite their very evident self-indulgence. In that sense it reminds the viewer of Stripes, which conveyed the same kind of views but with infinitely more comedic success.<br/><br/>In addition, the Japanese and Germans are ridiculous cartoon villains, but there isn't any comedy to be found there either, and how the heck did Toshiro Mifune get talked into taking part in this train wreck?<br/><br/>At times when watching 1941 you feel that you are watching a filmed comic book, and not a very well written comic book at that - the characters are equally shallow, and the humor is similar.<br/><br/>It's hard to find good points, but as an aviation buff I did enjoy the aircraft photography. And John Williams' score work, contrary to what others have said, is just as excellent here as in many other Spielberg films.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I wanted to see this because of the people involved and because of curiosity; like almost everyone else on the planet, I'm well familiar with the better Spielberg films and just wanted to know about this one. But I wasn't missing anything. For most people, 1941 isn't worth your time; feel free to give this epic fail a miss."
"movies-109","Null","1","1","4 June 2002"," Spectacular - Love it or Hate it
","I've liked this movie since I first saw it in the theater, and I like the extended version as well although it does move a bit more slowly.  I am not sure I can classify 1941 as a comedy.  It's not really funny.  Not in a belly-laugh sort of way.  It doesn't hit me the way a Marx Brothers film does... or even a Farrelly Brothers film.  It doesn't have a lot of laughs unless you think people screaming and getting clobbered is funny.  What it does have is some spectacular, over-the-top scenes that are extremely entertaining.  Mad Mad Mad Mad World is to me a fabulously entertaining film, I love to watch it over and over, but it is not a belly laugh film either.  1941 is not quite in the same class as Stanley Kramer's classic though.  Its the kind of film that if you miss a minute, you won't know what's happening - but it doesn't matter anyway, because trying to watch too closely will give you quite a headache.  1941 is a monstrous boatload of cliche's - think of every war movie cliche' and every slapstick cliche' you ever heard of, packed into 2 or 2.5 hours depending on the version, and you'll be in the ballpark.  In some cases it's just Three Stooges ornery violence, or the kind of unfunny punches in the jaw that make me dislike most Adam Sandler movies.  If you try to find some greatness in the whole movie you probably won't.  If you want some real entertainment just fast forward to the USO dance portion.  From the moment it starts, and then into the jitterbugging, it's fabulous.  Of course its filled with the same slapstick and cliche's as the rest of the movie, but backed by a pounding rhythm and unbelievable dance/fight choreography.  This part of the film is where the Spielberg-ism really shines through, the kind of mayhem that uniquely identifies his style.  Also near the beginning there is a scene of a couple of cooks dancing in the kitchen of a greasy spoon joint, throwing dishes and food in time to ""In The Mood"".  And the scene when Robert Stack steps out of the theater, cool as a cucumber, while a car flips upside-down behind him which he completely ignores.  I wish there had been more of this kind of stuff in the film, and less screaming.  Ok, one scream is pretty good - Warren Oates screaming ""let me hear your guns!!"" at Belushi, with his glasses broken, looking every bit the cliche' madman.  I can't explain why I like a movie that is so hard to come up with good things to say about it, but like it I do.  It is worth watching just for the USO portion, just skip the rest and don't worry about the characters - the film has no sympathetic characters, with the possible exception of Stack playing General Stillwell straight, in a ""Green Acres"" sort of way.  Take a couple aspirin, don't turn the sound up too loud, and don't expect too much, you might be pleasantly surprised."

","The reason I think this motion picture was not popular is the film was too spectacular in its appearence that many audiences felt they were bombarded with wasted noise.  Now if the film was released today there would be a different response from the audience because they would love the film more. Today the film would be a box office smash.  Look at films like Independence Day(1996) and Armegeddon(1998) and realize that they are no different from 1941 in the way they were done.  The film is alright but might have been great if the story was as impressive as the cast.  Would be one of the last films that would have a true all star cast until the late 1990s.  I have never seen an excellent cast wasted on a film as I've seen on this feature.<br/><br/>
John Candy shows his presence with the kind of charm that became his trademark.  John Belushi steals the show as Captain Wild Bill Kelso.

For instance, its many plot-lines don't mesh together the way they should which results in a big sprawling mess of a film.<br/><br/>However, 1941 does have some wonderful moments;Robert Stack weeping his way through Dumbo, the Army vs.Navy brawl and the inspired Jaws parody opening sequence.<br/><br/>The huge cast each get their opportunities to shine, however brief.  In particular, Toshiro Mifune sending himself up as the incompetent submarine commander is a treat, as is Christopher Lee's petty, nit-picking, bickering Nazi liason officer.  Add to this some choice one-liners, stunning visuals and a fantastic score from John Williams and you end up with a film that is a great deal of fun which certainly did not deserve the roasting from the critics that it did receive.<br/><br/>Okay, so it doesn't add up to a completely satisfying whole, but its one hell of a funny collage."

","Many people praise or trash this film as a comedy, which is a limiting idea because humor is so subjective. You laugh or you don't. It's correct to compare this movie's humor with ""Blues Brothers"" and ""Mad Mad World"" as some have done--and that tells you whether you'll think it's funny or not. (When I was about eight, I thought ""Mad Mad World"" was a comic masterpiece, and I might have thought the same of ""1941"" at the same age.) So I didn't laugh at this movie, but I was glad to see it for various other reasons. I agree with everyone that the USO dance-donnybrook was amazing. It seems to be a manic spoof of real-life events: war hysteria, zoot suit riots--I'm surprised they didn't throw in the relocation of Japanese-Americans, except they might have been hard-pressed to make that seem funny. But the movie has it both ways: Americans fight Americans, as Dan Aykroyd says, because they're paranoid and seeing enemies that aren't there (his anti-Jap and anti-Kraut speech, with its absurd Santa Clause rhetoric, could have been lifted out of any WWII movie) and this leads to miles of chaos and destruction, yet at the same time there really IS a Japanese sub offshore preparing to fire on Americans. The Japanese seem ""honorable"" (thanks to Toshiro Mifune) but their comic fixation on Hollywood, their slapstick antics and satisfaction with firing on an empty fairgound undercuts this. Ned Beatty destroys his own house in order to defend it, but this foolishness is undercut by the fact that he clearly regards it as a victory. The presence of Slim Pickens reminds us of the satiric intent of ""Dr. Strangelove"" (a much sharper movie). A fascinating movie and the first of Spielberg's WWII trilogy (followed by the fantasy ""Always"" and the more complex ""Saving Private Ryan"", which is not the simplistic flag-waver some people think it is.) This film ONLY makes sense in the letterboxed director's cut."

I laugh at some parts of it.  I cringe at most parts of it.  The bit about Dan Aykroyd becoming shell-shocked is inspired.  The bit with Belushi's pants constantly squeaking because of his hidden toy is tedious.  The final motorcycle chase is finely choreographed mayhem.  The dance showdown is a chaotic, and worst of all BORING, mess.  The Japanese submarine crew is almost an insult to intelligent audiences everywhere, especially to those of Asian descent. The unnecessary toilet jokes with Slim Pickens.  The spectacular tracking shots with Belushi's fighter flying just yards above the city streets.  I love it. I hate it.

Impressive array of actors fail to lift a silly parody of the Japanese attacking Los Angeles after their success at Pearl harbour. A case of too many cooks spoiling the broth.

"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","3","6","23 September 2007"," Geez, what do people have against this movie?
","I was really excited to see 1941 when it turned out to be on Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies, not to mention that when I looked at the cover at Hollywood Video, this movie had Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, John Belushi, among some of Hollywood's greatest actors. Now the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the movie got me more excited. When I checked out the rating for 1941, I got scared, I mean 5.5 isn't that exciting. Especially for a Spielberg film, usually most people get excited and love the film. Now granted, Spielberg was never the king of comedies, but 1941 is a decent film that gives you a few laughs, it's just a screw ball comedy, I admit some jokes are a little random, but over all this is a film that works and is just plain fun. Yes, it's a bit long and sometimes a little odd, the story though was something that was fun because sometimes we just need a little fun with history.<br/><br/>It's 6 days after the Pearl Harbor bombing and now the Japenese are coming after United State's pride and joy, Hollywood, lol. Basically, we just go through California citizen's lives and what they are going through. We have the wacky couple who can't seem to stay together. A silly guy with huge pride for his country. An army who seems to have a hard time getting how to actually fight. A crazed air pilot, crazy German captains, along with the Japenese who invaded the country are dressed up as Christmas trees. Well, let's just hope that they'll be alright with this silly invasion.<br/><br/>1941 is at times very random and doesn't know wither to be a mental comedy or a screwball comedy, but it still delivers a good laugh to those who are just looking for a fun movie. Don't go by the rating here on IMDb, I actually had fun watching this film and I'm not sure why people are giving it a hard time. But it looks like the cast had a genuinely good time making this film. The story is a bit much to follow, but it's worth a watch at least. 1941 is all in good fun, so just grab the popcorn and have a few laughs, I'm sure you'll get it with at least John Belushi's character.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Quinoa1984","7","3","6","1 February 2007"," even a Spielberg mess has a lot of excellent bits; it's his craziest effort yet, flawed, BIG, and proud of its longevity
","I'm not sure I'll want to sit too soon again through 1941, directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale and John Milius, but I wouldn't trade the experience. Unlike directors nowadays who go BIG and HUGE with action and cheesy comedy and thrills, and their movies end up possibly leaving a really lousy residue from a kind of soulessness (Michael Bay comes immediately to mind), Spielberg may go way over the top, and in the DVD version I saw it goes on far too long (whether or not the special edition solves the problems left in the original 2 hour cut boggles my mind just to think about it), but it never loses a sense of giddy excitement, like a 12 year old boy given free reign over the controls of a nose-thumbing, immature-yet-intelligent big-budget Hollywood action-war-comedy. For more than a few moments watching it, I thought of what Francis Ford Coppola said regarding the making of Apocalypse Now, when he said ""we had too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane."" I wondered how much Spielberg decided to shoot- and shoot and shoot- from the script, though whatever mishaps occur in the picture (and for the most part goes on in the latter half of the film), yet he somehow pulls out a few really extraordinary sequences, and more than few deserved laughs.<br/><br/>It's chaos, basically, when less than a week after the bombing of Pearl Harbor the threat of an attack from the Japanese seems imminent. Everybody's up in arms, or at least up in arms with one another (again, the 12 year-old aspect, both with plenty of explosions, weapons firing off, and more than a bit of innuendo), and we're given practically an Altman-esquire view of Los Angeles in this time of wacky despair, even if oddly enough most of what really makes of LA is left away. Then again, any big mash of reality would compact the escapist madhouse Spielberg and his writers intend. Only in a flick like 1941 would you get a bat-s*** pilot (a hilarious John Belushi), a timid but ready average guy with a gigantic machine gun in his backyard (Ned Beatty), a doubting Thomas General who cries when he watches Dumbo (Robert Stack), two army personnel (Tim Matheson and Nancy Allen) who have a deranged courtship involving air travel, and the actual (yet more-so potential) threat to the LA area, a Japanese submarine headed by Colonel Mikamura (Toshrio Mifune, who in a limited role gets to do what he does best- look down-right perturbed). It all leads up to a gigantic- and I do mean gigantic- climax that goes on and on and on with the crazed, war-seeking Americans finally finding their sights at the sub.<br/><br/>Perhaps if Spielberg and his editors decided to try and tighten it up (and again I say this after the extended version, perhaps this is maybe a tad different with the shorter theatrical cut), it would be a much greater rush of insanity in wartime comedy. A topic like the delirium of Americans on the cusp of war is good for a variety of broad styles (if that makes sense), and the cast assembled here is more hit than miss (where else will you get Christopher Lee as a Nazi on a sub who can somehow have no problem communicating with the Japanese speaking Japanese!), with the goofy parts still retaining moments of levity. And the madness that usually unfolds on screen, be it small-time or large scale, gets the right treatment at least on the directorial front. There's a dance-hall sequence involving the main romantic love triangle (I forget all the names, though I remember Treat Williams being involved), where the fighting blends with the dancing and completely absurd homaging to a point of delirious genius, and it's one of Spielberg's greatest single sequences from the 70s. I even got a couple of chuckles at his blatant, irrevocable homages to his previous films (the opening with Jaws, certain shots right from Close Encounters, even a few unintentional allusions to future films).<br/><br/>But again that frigging script, and the abandonment to pull back from the crazily cartoonish atmosphere, sort of damns it in the last section, where more seems to mean better, even when what might be expected (more explosions) doesn't quite come off. It ended up becoming almost an act of annoying the viewer, where already there's been so many scenes of hundreds of people in single shots, stretched into sequences, and grand-standings (Aykroyd's part) and wild flights of fancy, that even the best parts end up becoming mired in the thick of it all. I guess maybe it's meant to almost feel like a war in and of itself, but unlike the Coppola picture I mentioned previously, there isn't a lot of art to come out of the sensationalism, just some fun times to have with friends and a very good sense of humor (mostly a forgiving one). This all being said, however, I wouldn't tell you not to see it, most likely if you're a fan of Spielberg and Zemeckis, and I end up recommending it against my better judgment, or rather I don't recommend if as much as the MUCH better works of the filmmakers, but for a certain comic sensibility it might be real gold. I will remember the zany brilliance, but I also won't be able to shake off the fact that it is the sort of midway minor blunder of a filmmaker right in an awe-inspiring stretch of films. 6.5/10"

","This poor, misunderstood, under-rated, comedy has a little bit of just about everything. I cannot, cannot, understand why this thing was panned the way it was.<br/><br/>Okay - it isn't ""Life With Father"" or ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" but it's so far above, better, funnier, slicker, more cleverly written, and socially acceptable than 9 out of 10 comedies of these days or those days. Okay, so ""Doctor Strangelove"" is just as funny and if you watch it carefully enough ""Catch 22"" may be funnier. . . but let's compare this to ""Stripes."" I own both, like both, think both are funny, love the timing. . . but after about the fifth go-around on ""Stripes,"" no matter how many years it's been, it can't compete with a fifth go-around of ""1941."" I like ""Caddyshack,"" too, and ""1941"" is funnier. No, people aren't passing gas and throwing up in cars. If juvenile misbehavior is your thing, ""1941"" probably isn't your movie. . . not to say there aren't adults acting like juveniles behaving badly. . .<br/><br/>What were people comparing it to in 1979/1980?"
"curtis-8","Null","3","6","24 February 2002"," A Terrific Failure
","Except for a small following of fanatics, Spielberg's ""1941"" is almost universally regarded as an utter failure. Well, I have to admit that, while I am no fanatic, I do count ""1941"" as one of my guilty pleasures. I'll come right out and say it, though--the film is indeed a failure. But it is a spectacular one. And I must say that the full length version shown on TV, and currently available on DVD, is much better than the original theatrical version. At least the story makes more sense, in any case. And I believe that the folks who like it enjoy it for the film it could have been. Because, you see, the screenplay was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>There is really only one reason why this film was a failure: Stephen Spielberg was the wrong man to direct it. Anyone can point out that his visual style at the time was wrong for the film--too hazy and ""flossy"", like ""Close Encounters."" What it needed was an easy to read cartoonish look--kind of like the look Stanley Kramer gave this film's closest ancestor, ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.""<br/><br/>Also, for a film renowned for it noise and action, it is in reality very slowly paced.  There are many spots to be bored.<br/><br/>This was due in most part to Spielberg's misunderstanding of how to handle comedy as an art form. It is obvious that he abdicated his directorial command when it came to the actors, concentrating his skills on the visuals and effects (and even much of that effort was inappropriate to the task at hand). He had no idea why any of the material was supposed to be funny, so he just let the actors run wild in hopes that they knew. So, each of them tried desperately to be funny, all in totally different--and sometimes conflicting--styles. And, in almost every case-they failed.<br/><br/>
A much better choice would have been to have all the actors play their parts ""straight."" As George Roy Hill supposedly told a confused Paul Newman during the filming of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"": ""You don't need to be funny. The story is funny. You just act."" What joy there is in ""1941"" come from the huge spectacle and tiny intricacies of the screenplay. Ned Beatty, Tim Mattheson, Nancy Allen, that other blonde chick, etc--none of them are naturally funny people--and it is painful to watch them try to be so. The overacting and mugging drags out scenes which should have been played super fast and snappy, like the real screwball comedies of the 1940s. The dialog scenes should have been kept at a minimum, because, by design of the screenplay, the actors are only interesting as props in the Rube Goldbegian plot they inhabit.<br/><br/>It is ironic that ""1941"" is the rare film that actually would have been improved if the dialog and ""characterizations"" had been cut to a minimum so we could get to the explosions and noise more quickly. I mean, do we really care to see and hear the lame interactions between Tim Mattheson and Nancy Allen as they each try to ""be funny""? Hell no! Just let us know enough to make it somewhat believable when they end up screwing in a pilotless plane over Hollywood as a crazed John Belushi attempts to shoot them out of the sky! The situation is what is funny--the people are just bogging it down.<br/><br/>The only natural comic in the bunch--and the only actor who should have been given free reign to be wild--was John Belushi. The rest of the cast should have followed the leads of Toshiro Mifune and Robert Stack and the wildness of what was going on around them would have been much funnier.<br/><br/>Too bad the studio didn't trust Zemeckis, now a famous director, to begin his filmmaking career with this movie."
"stagemom-2","9","3","6","10 July 1999"," A Master's Thesis On Comedy
","This picture is Steven Spielberg's most overtly comic work, and it is hilarious. In fact it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. It is at the same time, a live action cartoon, a brilliantly choreographed musical, an action packed war movie complete with an airplane chase through downtown Los Angeles, a biting attack on Los Angeles culture and an over the top Zucker brothers style gag movie. It also showcases the comedic talents of SCTV and SNL stars John Candy, Dan Aykroyd, Joe Flaherty and the late, great John Belushi. Spielberg throws in everything including the kitchen sink and the result is an entirely entertaining 2 hrs. The script by escapist masters Zemeckis & Gale is masterpiece of popcorn prose. This film is way under-rated and too often knocked. But then again it's always the gifted people who get picked on. If you feel like sitting back and enjoying a really cool movie, rent 1941."
"cutter-12","9","3","6","21 March 1999"," Totally underrated
","It's always been a mystery to me why this picture has received such a bashing over the years as it is one of the most well choreographed, completely manic and FUNNY broad comedies ever made. In fact, under Spielberg's masterful direction, this picture tops its more immediate rivals ""It's a mad mad mad mad world"" and ""The Russians are Coming The Russians are coming.""  Although some of the humor seems to be straining itself at times to achieve more than<br/><br/>just one laugh, the picture nevertheless features some<br/><br/>perfectly timed comedic moments and spot on jokes and sequences that seem to breeze over most non film buff's heads. How could you not love that tribute to John Ford for instance and his own brand of slapstick when the brawl breaks out between the sailors, soldiers and marines in the USO and spills out into Hollywood boulevard.  A movie just oozing 40's detail and familiar Spielbergian elements.  I hope he regards it secretly  with some affinity and not as the failure most critics have painted it.  We all who love it KNOW it's a GREAT piece of comedy and worthy of classic status."
"Blade_Runner86","10","5","13","23 August 2001"," A Classic!
","I first was this movie when I was 15 and i've loved it ever since!<br/><br/>Steven Spielbreg has created a classic film that makes fun out of the most depressing period of American history, WW2! The story is set a week after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. A Japanese submarine is off the cost of Los Angeles. The want to blow up something but they don't know what. So the choose Hollywood. Hysteria grips Hollywood and that's when this movie COMES ALIVE! The jokes and gags deliver the laughs. There are many sub-plots in the movie which keeps it going. The special effects are very well done, that's because nearly every set gets blow up in some form or another.<br/><br/>
What makes this movie so great is the star-studded cast. John Belishi steals the show as the crazy maniac pilot, Captain Wild Bill Kelso, Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack as Major General Joseph W. Stillwell. Warren Oats is spectacular as the crazy Colonel ""Madman"" Maddox (My favorite character ""Let me here your guns! Yam-yam-yam-yam-yam!"")John Candy has one of his first big screen appearances as Private Foley. The music is something amazing, it sets the mood perfectly, and its done by the best, John Williams.<br/><br/>

"TOMASBBloodhound","6","3","7","19 November 2006"," Many funny little moments that don't quite add up.
","Though it's not quite the disaster that many would claim, 1941 is certainly not one of Steven Spielberg's finest moments. The film is a grand scale collection of bit parts and physical humor that just don't quite add up to a winner.<br/><br/>The film centers around the paranoia of the people of southern California in the days immediately following the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor. The characters in this film all seem to think that an attack on the US mainland is inevitable. Some of the characters even think the Japs are already here! Maybe this wasn't such a good idea for a comedy from the outset. The attack at Pearl Harbor was a terrifying and devastating day in the country's history. It would be understandable if it put the citizens on the west coast on edge to some degree. It hardly matters however. The laughs this film generates mostly come from the continuous and at time extremely elaborate physical gags and property destruction. There are a lot of things that get destroyed as this film plays itself out. Gas stations, cars, planes, houses; even an amusement park gets destroyed. The ferris wheel actually goes rolling down a pier and into the ocean! There are too many characters and subplots to list. Most generate at least a few chuckles. The one involving Slim Pickens is probably the best. The crew of a Japanese submarine sneak ashore and take him prisoner. He swallows the only working compass on board, and their attempts to get it out of him are truly hilarious. Robert Stack, as a general whose biggest concern is making sure nobody disturbs him while he's attending a screening of Dumbo, is also very good. Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi pretty much play themselves, but unfortunately share little screen time together! The musical score by John Williams is terrific, though. It's too bad that since this movie failed at the box office, many people have probably never heard it. The director's cut that Netflix sent me is almost two and a half hours long, and that's just too long for a comedy. There are some good visual payoffs, but the story just takes too long to get where it needs to go.<br/><br/>Call this one a ""nice try"" from Spielberg. Much better things would come in the years immediately following this film for him. I would not for a moment discourage anyone from seeing this film, but you will probably not consider it a classic in any way. If you want a great comedy involving property damage, stick with the Blues Brothers instead! 6 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","I have always considered ""1941"" to be a misunderstood masterpiece. Stevie tapped into the madcap comedies of the 1930's and captured that amazing frenetic energy wonderfully. The inter-cut, naturally delivered but wholly contrived dialog is pure Howard Hawks while the sight gags, non requiters, and puns seem like the Marx Brothers. We have mistaken identity (a few times!), a dangerously-crazy villain, a humorously crazy hero, the local schlub turned hero, epic quests that are ultimately meaningless, and befuddled fathers.<br/><br/>OK, its not ""Bringing Up Baby"" (which was considered a terrible bomb in its own day), but it carries on the same traditions. Watch ""Duck Soup"", ""Bringing Up Baby"", and ""Sons of the Desert"", then watch ""1941"" with that same outlook."
"lee_eisenberg","8","3","7","10 May 2005"," Why do some people hate this movie?
","""1941"" shows what war should be: a lot of destruction, but no killing. In fact, most of the destruction is caused by Americans on their own territory. Happening a few days after the Japanese army has bombed Pearl Harbor, the the people of Los Angeles are paranoid that the ""Japs"" are going to invade. Wild Bill Kelso (John Belushi) is a crazy pilot who can't tell an American plane from a Japanese one, Lt. Frank Tree (Dan Aykroyd) does not like it when Americans fight Americans (""You want Yamamoto to end up in the White House?!""), the Douglases (Ned Beatty and Lorraine Garry) involuntarily get a giant gun placed in their front yard, a dimwitted soldier (Tim Matheson) keeps trying to come on to Gen. Stilwell's secretary (Nancy Allen), two incompatible men (Murray Hamilton and Eddie Deezen) are in a Ferris wheel to keep an eye on the coast, and two macho soldiers (Bobby DiCicco and Treat Williams) battle over Betty Douglas (Dianne Kay).<br/><br/>All the while, a Japanese submarine is stationed off the coast. The captain (Toshiro Mifune) wants to bomb Hollywood, while Col. Von Kleinschmidt (Christopher Lee), a Nazi with the Japanese, says that they should let the Third Reich deal with America. They take garbage man Hollis ""Holly"" Wood (Slim Pickens) hostage, hoping to get some info, but it ends up leading to a rather childish situation, to say the least.<br/><br/>Probably the funniest scene is a free-for-all between the army and navy at a USO party. Picture it: the army and navy beating the stuffings out of each other on the faces of Hitler and Tojo (painted on the floor). While this is happening, Gen. Stilwell (Robert Stack) is getting all teary-eyed watching ""Dumbo"".<br/><br/>Either way, the whole thing is a laugh riot from beginning (a spoof of ""Jaws"") to end (we've all heard of a house divided, but here a house gets more than divided). It may be completely silly, but among other things, ""1941"" shows how both sides in World War II were crazy (the Japanese want to attack come hell or high water, and the Americans turn into trigger-happy wackos every time something even slightly unusual happens). I recommend it to anyone and everyone."

","At least that's what we all said when ""1941"" hit theaters in December of 1979. After ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters"" expectations were very high. The ad campaign made sure to headline John Belushi, who was as hot as they come, as the star. The plethora of fine actors in the cast had anticipation high. ""1941"" is a crashing disappointment. The problem is simple and it's the script. Trying to borrow from ""Mad Mad World"" we get several stories told at once. The problem is there is no central character to really identify with. Ned Beatty's everyman might have been had his part been bigger. Belushi comes closest to a central character and he seems to be basically re-hashing Bluto from ""Animal House"". Note the scene where he is flying and cracks open a coke bottle and let's it all spill out on his face (with cigar in mouth). He's practically winking at the camera.<br/><br/>The film is a chaotic mess. When in doubt the characters scream LOUDLY and often (note the ending credits where most of the actors are shown screaming). Did Spielberg think this was funny? Most of the fine supporting cast is wasted. Dan Aykroyd is given little to do. Warren Oates is on and off screen before you know it. Tim Matheson is playing his Otter character in uniform. The best bits belong to Slim Pickens who is taken hostage on a Japanese sub piloted by the great Toshiro Mifune. Also on board is Christopher Lee as a German soldier who can inexplicably communicate with Mifune even though he is speaking German and Mifune speaks Japanese.<br/><br/>The film is not without merit though. The special effects are terrific. John Williams' rousing score is one of his best and most underrated. The opening scene is a takeoff on ""Jaws"" that is truly inspired and VERY funny. A dance hall contest is beautifully choreographed and probably the best moment in the film.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say this is Spielberg's worst film (my vote goes to ""Hook"") but it's a huge misfire for one of our best directors. Thankfully he moved on from this bomb and went on to make ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and we all know what happened there."

The two Bobs obeyed of course, probably being awestruck by Spielberg as well as being keenly aware of their lack of clout in Hollywood. When Spielberg nabbed John Belushi, immensely popular at the time, the two Bobs were ordered to give JB scenes, give him scenes!<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's first indication that the movie was a disaster, according to ""The Making Of,"" was at the film premiere in Dallas. Sitting in the back, he noticed audience members covering their ears halfway through the movie. He also noticed studio executives huddled together with the ""hangdog"" look they get when they know they're going to have to write off a loser.<br/><br/>Now in Millennium Three, people no longer swoon at the fact that John Belushi is in the movie. For me, Belushi brings the movie to a complete halt and so I fast-forward through all his scenes, an option not available to that poor Dallas preview audience.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint with the movie is that I lost the narrative thread -- who is the movie supposed to be about? Is it about the kid who wants to win the dance contest? Is it about General Stillwell and his horny aide? Is the movie about John Belushi's psycho pilot (as the movie posters would have you believe)?<br/><br/>What Spielberg should have done is make one movie about the dancer boy and a same-time, different-place sequel with General Stillwell, and cut Belushi out of the movie entirely.<br/><br/>Mr. Spielberg, instead of cutting into your free time to make _1941_, you should've taken a nice long beach vacation. And since _Jaws_ had come out recently, you would've had the whole beach to yourself."
"ecarle","Null","3","7","5 May 2004"," Dashed Expectations
","(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>Excitement and expectations were high about ""1941"" when it went into production for Xmas 1979 release.<br/><br/>It would be Spielberg's newest film after the blockbusters ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""  And it would be Spielberg's first comedy: an all-star spectacular in the ""Mad, Mad, World"" tradition about Los Angeles coastal panic when a Japanese submarine surfaces off the coast soon after Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Spielberg had cast the two funniest leads from the blockbuster ""National Lampoon's Animal House"":  John Belushi (Bluto) and Tim Matheson (Otter).<br/><br/>
Belushi's Saturday Night Live buddy Dan Ackroyd agreed to make his major film debut.   The two were extra hot on TV, records, and concert stages as ""the Blues Brothers"" and would make that movie after ""1941.""<br/><br/>
These key elements were surrounded by an all-star cast that included such iconic greats as Toshiro Mifune (as the Japanese officer whose submarine surfaces off Santa Monica), Christopher Lee (as a Nazi officer on board the sub),  Slim Pickens (from ""Dr. Strangelove"" and doing a reprise of one of his scenes from that film in this one),  ""Jaws"" cast members Murray Hamilton (the Mayor in Jaws) and Lorraine Gary (Mrs. Brody in Jaws) and Susan Backlinie (first shark meal in Jaws) and even Laverne, Lenny, and Squiggy from ""Laverne and Shirley."" Plus John Candy in an early role. And Warren Oates. And Robert Stack as General Vinegar Joe Stilwell, tearing up at ""Dumbo"" in a Hollywood Blvd. theater as riots rage outside.<br/><br/>
All systems were ""go"" for the biggest and funniest comedy epic of all time -- and it flopped.<br/><br/>Why?  Simple reason:  not funny.  Slightly more complex reason: the irritatingly huge budget buried everg gag under a ton of extras and effects (""Animal House"" had been ten times funnier on a 1/10th of the budget.)<br/><br/>Look more carefully, though. Other problems.  The script is haywire and Spielberg uses his cast wrong.   The hilarious Belushi, Ackroyd, and Matheson are kept apart from each other for the whole movie, and none of them get that much screen time even by themselves.<br/><br/>Instead, Spielberg insanely wastes much more footage on near-unknown Bobby DeCiccio and not-terribly-funny Treat Williams, Dianne Kay, and Wendie Jo Sperber in the film's worst subplot: about a romantic quadrangle involving two civilian lovers, the near-rapist soldier buly who comes between them, and the big mama who saves them all.  Not funny.<br/><br/>Incredibly, every time ""1941"" gets some comic momentum going with Belushi or Ackroyd or Matheson (seducing sultry Nancy Allen while flying a plane he can't fly because that's the only way she gets hot), he cuts back to the extremely boring and irritating nobodies in the love quadrangle. Why?<br/><br/>The film simply takes forever getting started, and bogs down in a long USO dance hall dance-fight-riot in downtown LA.<br/><br/>Then, a miracle: the last half hour is pretty funny, thanks to these visually spectcular and funny Spielbergian set-pieces:<br/><br/>1. Belushi chasing Matheson and Allen in planes down a wonderfully mintaturized Hollywood Boulevard at night, with Xmas decorations all over the street.<br/><br/>2.  Coastal homeowner Ned Beatty trying to open fire on a Japanese submarine using the anti-aircraft gun near his house -- crashing it through his house, over and over, in a live-action Bugs Bunny cartoon.<br/><br/>3.  At Pacific Ocean Amusement park and ocean pier at the Santa Monica ocean, a plane, a tank, a motorcycle, a Ferris Wheel, the Mayor from Jaws, a crummy comedy actor named Eddie Deezen and a funny ventriloquist's dummy all come together for a Spielbergian riot of special effects and well-timed comedy set to exciting John Williams music.<br/><br/>Spielberg finally finds his mojo for these last scenes, and then lets the movie peter down in an overlong final scene to a ridiculously heavy-handed final gag.<br/><br/>But wait:  stick around for the credit sequence, in which Spielberg reveals what REALLY went wrong.  The credits show every single member of the all-star cast, one after the other, SCREAMING.  (With occasional calm remarks by some cast members as punctuation.)  Spielberg reveals his essential lack of humor with his own final credits.<br/><br/>Spielberg's enemies smacked him hard over his failure, and he came back two years later with the tight, exciting blockbuster ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to make up for it.   He's been OK ever since.<br/><br/>But ""1941"" was something else.<br/><br/>P.S. I like John Williams rousing ""1941"" overture.  THIS should have been the theme for Indiana Jones."

","This film is good fun. Period. Not SS's best but I think he took the right vein in making a lighthearted WWII film. I consider it part I of his WWII 'quadrilogy' including, ""Empire of the Sun"", ""Schindler's List"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"". All of which are much better films but they might not be so good if not for ""1941"". <br/><br/>The special effects are baby steps compared to what we have seen from SS since then. And the sets were fun to see also. This film has the look and feel of a classic film made in modern times. The only difference was that it was shot in color and not black and white. <br/><br/>But maybe it was the fact that this was one of John Belushi's last roles.

This is the type of film we don't get enough of now in the comedy genre. It's all about how many swear words we can get in and scenes which are out and out disgusting - this is slapstick pure and simple and that's why I love it."
"gab-14712","7","2","4","16 February 2019"," My Least Favorite Spielberg Film!
","Every filmmaker has their own flops or mediocre movies, no matter how great the directors are. Martin Scorsese has New York, New York, Francis Ford Coppola has Jack, and the list goes on. In this instance, the great Steven Spielberg has 1941. It was crushing for critics and audiences because Spielberg wowed them with Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, so everyone was eagerly anticipating his next project. I liked the idea behind the movie, but I felt it to be a misfire. The movie, of course, satires World War Two and the military, but it was not funny at all and that is the biggest failure of all. Jokes are thrown at you at the speed of light, but everything feels so forced. I merely chuckled from time to time, but I wonder if I did that out of respect. In addition to poorly-written jokes, the movie is loud, obnoxious, and has way too many explosions for this type of movie.<br/><br/>Well, I had to get the bad stuff out of the way first. However, there were some redeemable qualities within the film. The film has a large cast filled to the brim with outstanding actors. Granted, many of them were not used to the best of their abilities, but the performances were still good enough. Spielberg did continue to prove himself as a capable director, as I thought his direction was good enough. Finally, the best part of the movie is the music by Spielberg's usual collaborator, John Williams. Spielberg always said that William's theme was his favorite out of all the movies they did together. High praise!<br/><br/>The film was written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale both of whom would gain fame in the mid 1980's with Back to the Future. Needless to say, the script they wrote was not their finest hour. The central idea they came up with is brilliant though. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor just happened and the state of California is on their toes since they are supposedly the next victims. When a rogue Japanese submarine appears just off the coast, we must ask whether or not Hollywood is ready for war.<br/><br/>The cast has many great names and it was a pleasure to see these actors even if they did not live up to their full potential. Check out these names. Dan Aykroyd, James Belushi, Murray Hamilton, Christopher Lee, Ned Beatty, Warren Oates, Robert Stack, and the list goes on. Plus, there are some rather intriguing cameos by James Caan and Penny Marshall. Plus, John Candy and Mickey Rourke have minor roles. Some have more screen time than others. If there were to be a central character, it would be the character of James Belsuhi. If you liked his Animal House performance, then you will like this performance.<br/><br/>I was quite disappointed with the movie especially with all the talent involved. This film was meant to be a slapstick satire, but I cannot help if this movie would have been received better if this was more dramatic. After all, Stanley Kubrick did suggest the same thing to Spielberg before it was released. Spielberg did later admit that after the enormous success of his previous two movies, he became a little arrogant and took this film as a lesson. That shows because his next two movies were Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial, two of the most popular movies of all time. Unfortunately, 1941 is an uneven movie with unfunny jokes. Everything is thrown at you for two hours, and it's hard to make out what is going on. The visual effects are cool and the score is amazing, but I wanted to truly like this movie as a Spielberg fan and a World War 2 buff. It's watchable, but only just.<br/><br/>My Grade: C-"
"twhiteson","4","2","4","30 August 2017"," It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World meets Animal House
","Steven Spielberg's ""1941"" ranks as one of that legendary director's artistic nadirs. His first and only pure foray into comedy was derided by critics as a bloated, unfunny mess, and due to its massive budget it failed to meet its studio's financial expectations in stark contrast to Spielberg's previous efforts.<br/><br/>Set on the California coast prior to Christmas 1941, the plot is inspired by the real paranoia and fear of an imminent Japanese attack that gripped the U.S. West Coast in the immediate aftermath of Pearl Harbor. Even in 1979, this was questionable material for a slapstick comedy and some of the WW2 generation objected including some older Hollywood stars who passed on roles in the film. To make it even more questionable, the film also has a full-fledged violent riot based upon the infamous 1943 Los Angeles Zoot Suit Riots which were racially motivated between white servicemen and Mexican-American youths wearing ""unpatriotic"" Zoot Suits. War induced paranoia and race riots are not exactly the stuff of knee-slapping comedy. Yet, Spielberg, who allegedly couldn't stop laughing while he read the screenplay, soldiered-on.<br/><br/>One can definitely see what Spielberg was aiming to accomplish. He wanted to make a late 70's version of 1963's ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,"" a very frantically paced, broad, and slapstick comedy with an all-star cast, combined with the cheeky sexual/fratboy humor of 1978's ""Animal House."" He even got John Belushi and Tim Matheson to reprise their ""Animal House"" roles except ""Bluto"" and ""Otter"" are respectively re-named: ""Captain 'Wild Bill' Kelso"" and ""Captain Loomis Birkhead"" in ""1941.""<br/><br/>Sadly, the ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World""/""Animal House"" combo didn't work. ""1941"" is essentially a who's who of late 1970's comedic talents frantically running around and shouting their lame dialogue while stuff explodes and falls apart about them as they deal with both imagined and real Japanese air and naval attacks. It just tries way too hard to garner its few tepid chuckles. The spectacle can be amusing at times, but it's mostly just exhausting, annoying, and tiresome. Even Spielberg has referred to ""1941"" as his ""unfunny comedy.""<br/><br/>The film does have some decent stuff:<br/><br/>1) John Williams' rousing score.<br/><br/>2) Slim Pickens' small role as ""Hollis Wood.""<br/><br/>3) The choreography of the USO dance and ensuing riot.<br/><br/>4) Nancy Allen and Dianne Kay (the hot blonde sister from ""Eight is Enough"") in 1940's outfits are very nice eye-candy.<br/><br/>However, overall, it's a just a very loud, overlong, not particularly funny, and indulgent mess that fortunately Spielberg was able to dust himself off from and move-on."
"jmillerdp","2","2","4","7 June 2015"," ""1941"" = ""9/11: The Comedy!""
","Apparently, Spielberg and Zemeckis think it's hilarious! to have a ""comedy"" mocking Californians who would understandably be scared after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Would Spielberg think that it would also have been hilarious! to have a comedy mocking New Yorkers who were understandably scared after the Muslim attacks of 9/11?<br/><br/>As out of it as Spielberg is, I am guessing so. Many of his fellow Jews ranged from confused to horrified when he used Nazis as cartoon villains in the Indiana Jones movies.<br/><br/>Maybe ""Schindler's List"" was Spielberg's way of trying to regain credibility among his fellow Jews. But, here with ""1941,"" he's clearly oblivious.<br/><br/>** (2 Out of 10 Stars)"

The poke-ees do not come out on the short end. Maybe Spielberg knows that he did a poor job on this; so what, it is still funny.<br/><br/>If you like The Three Stooges, you should try 1941.

We then get introduced to some more interesting characters, Dan Aykroyd's performance is definitely the highlight of the film for me, it is one of those films I can rewatch over and over and never get bored of it because it is so goddamned entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>The word underrated for this film is definitely an understatement, in fact, I'd consider this film to be over-hated.

","Just after the attack on Pearl Harbour, hysterical erupts in America and a small coastal town. As they believe that the Japanese are going to bomb America next, which causes a lot of havoc in the Californian town by the incompetent military and the eager locals.<br/><br/>This is an over-the-top and quite noisy broad comedy by director Steven Spielberg. I wouldn't class this a great or smart parody on the anxiety and fear of war. This extravaganza was leaning more towards clunky stupidity, but it had enough enjoyable moments and ''some'' fair performances to keep you riveted. Though, actually the opening scene in the film does have a great spoof on ''Jaws'', but mostly they are far and in between many unfunny scenes. The film just came across as overblown nonsense.<br/><br/>Quite an expensive budget was given to Spielberg for this film and you can tell. With the in-your-face special effects, the raging destruction, loud explosions and a stack of stars from the era. Well, some of these stars were wasted in obscure and humourless roles or actually lack of a role because there was probably too many involved. Though Aykroyd, Pickens (the best two parody performances), Allen, Lee, Stack, Betty and Belushi (definitely the worst performance) try to make the most of their characters, but they just can't make up for flat and uninspiring direction, inept script and story. <br/><br/>The film kind of limped along in the last hour and the slapstick humour started to wore thin. It was lacking wit and satire to make entirely entertaining. The direction lacked execution and the plot is nothing more than a mess of skits and gags. With some comical situations being dragged on for far too long, becoming a bit tiresome (especially Belushi's gags). As well the two hour running time of the film doesn't help the plodded pace and lack of story. <br/><br/>The many stars that appear ranged from Dan Aykroyd as the informative and quite spirited Sgt. Frank Tree and his tank, John Belushi as the daft Capt. Wild Bill Kelso, Christopher Lee as the demanding Nazi Capt. Wolfgang Von Kleinschmidt, Nancy Allen as the exquisite Donna Stratton with a airplane fetish, Tim Matheson as the desperate Capt. Loomis Birkhead desperately trying to get laid by Stratton, Ned Betty as the obsessed gun-ho local Ward Douglas, Lorraine Grey as Mrs. Douglas, Robert Stack as the down-to-earth Maj. Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, Warren Oates as the whack-out Col. 'Madman' Maddox who believes he is under attack by the Japanese, Slim Pickens as the hilarious Hollywood and the under-used John Candy as the bumbling Pvt. Foley.<br/><br/>While the look of the film is an added plus. Not bad location setting and the special effects are eye candy, with some superb action scenes. The sound effects also has good amount of impact and the score was fair. Though, overall all of it just doesn't gel together and so it becomes quite a botch.<br/><br/>For me it ranks along aside 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park '97' as his weakest film.<br/><br/>This is a truly uneven film by one of the greatest directors, but still worth a look if you're a fan of his."

","This is Spielberg's big homage to the golden days of Hollywood and big comedies. Set in a little-known period of US history, it utilizes the backdrop of hometown America caught up in the turbulent and frightening days when Americans living on the West Coast expected to be invaded at any moment by hordes of crazed attackers, as a canvas on which to craft a glorious ode to his favorite movies.<br/><br/>He proceeds with tongue in cheek to lovingly skewer countless cliches and conventions, such as Hollywood's sappy WW2 heroic quasi-propaganda films, the myth of an invincible US military, and our-country-right-or-wrong patriotism. You can see how he blends his worship of the movie genre with a desire to make the ultimate over-the-top parody.<br/><br/>While he falls a little short on character development and other fine points, this is overshadowed by his enthusiasm and his gleeful weaving of many unabashedly wild character spoofs and in-jokes into otherwise pompously serious situations. Misunderstandings, mis-communications, overreactions, overenthusiasm, and just plain recklessness are skillfully blended to create a nearly complete hysteria that is scarily almost believable. This movie is meant to be enjoyed first on a surface level for the physical comedy, and secondly as a non-stop parody.<br/><br/>The result is a wacky, frenetic, slapstick spoof of Spielberg's boomer upbringing in front of the tube, spent doting on late-night and Saturday afternoon movies. Having breathed and dreamed the best that Hollywood had to offer from the 20's through the 60's, Spielberg stirs it all together and splashes it on to film with a giant brush. This movie must be seen more than once to appreciate the comedic timing and the uproarious references to the American movie legacy.<br/><br/>It is the obvious precursor to the big, yet subtler and more carefully crafted homage to movie serials, Raiders of the Lost Ark, yet another movie in which Spielberg re-lives and repays his love of Hollywood creations and the movie genre.<br/><br/>1941 has thus far been misunderstood and under-appreciated.

","I originally had this movie rated as a solid B (8 out of 10) but I just upgraded to a 9 (A-). This is really Steven Spielberg having fun - it's a movie, a LOUD movie, a movie that could have been thought up by boys in some back yard sandbox playing with their army men and had a large budget for special effects like an A-Bomb to drop on them. It has a LOT of laughs. Belushi is a cartoonish over the top pilot. In fact, everyone is cartoonish and zany, and in the heart of it all is the one voice of reason, General Stillwall, who wanders through all this. Gale and Zemeckis (the screenwriters) actually based a lot of the story on historical events and did their homework - there really was a blackout in CA one night where someone possibly reported an enemy plane was flying above, there really was a Japanese Sub that got off the coast of Cali, there really were Zoot Suit Riots. This movie has more history in 5 minutes than Pearl Harbor does in it's whole 3 hr entirety. A whole mess of stars show up and it's fun seeing them have fun. I loved seeing this when I was 8 years old when it was relased and I think I love it more now. Watch it usually once a year and like it more each time. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed if you are looking for a ""movie"" (fun) and not a ""film"" (serious). The laserdisc and the DVD have the director's cut, which is worth the extra scenes.... Speilberg recognizes this as his first mistake after his two big hits, I disagree -- I wish he'd do another slam-bang-comedy-action flick like this rather than the childish-dumbed down tripe that was A.I. -- at least 1941 didn't try to  make a statement and insult the audience's intelligence.

""Great"" meaning not that it had a lot of hidden depth (you probably CAN write a treatise or two about paranoia and panic in times of war, as they are portrayed in this film, which is ever more important these days) or oh so much heart (like Spielberg's recent ""Terminal"" pretended to have) or anything. Fact is, it makes me laugh. An awful lot.<br/><br/>Spielberg just came off the success of ""Jaws"" and right the first scene plays with the audiences expectations regarding this director everyone was talking about. Once chaos takes hold of the Californian coast line, everything is possible, nothing that could not happen to make the next event more unpredictable, screams, explosions, belly-laughs. Aykroyd is typecast as a know-all sergeant who treats every situation as routine, Williams is delightfully menacing as psychotic ""Stretch"", Belushi somewhat unfathomable as ultra-macho lunatic ""Wild Bill"" Kelso. It all comes together to one big ruckus of a movie that turns every other thing upside down and always has me up in tears (of laughter) in the end.<br/><br/>Throw anything you think know about Spielberg today over board.

"Anonymous_Maxine","4","2","6","23 April 2005"," What form of lunatic is that?
","In an early attempt at a war film, Steven Spielberg, as I remember one critic describing it, has laid his first multi-million dollar egg. Which is odd because short war films are some of the first kinds of films that he started making when he was a kid. Maybe it was just a mistake to make it a comedy, because it comes off as this weird mishmash of a war film that crashed into a slapstick comedy and came out bouncing along on three wheels. Sadly, the most fascinating thing about the movie to me is that it stars Slim Pickens and Toshiro Mifune, two giants in film history, and is directed by Steven Spielberg, one of the greatest directors ever, and is still this bad. <br/><br/>I can accept that Spielberg wanted to do something like this for fun and I lose no respect at all for him for making this movie, but there are parts that are so astoundingly bad that it makes me wonder what the original intentions of the film were. It's clear that it was meant to be a spoof not only of old WWII films but also of the hysteria that followed the Pearl Harbor attacks which was generated by a fear that the Japanese were going to strike the mainland. This was not an unreasonable concern at the time, I should think, maybe someday will make a movie about the ridiculous fear that al Qaeda is going to hit America again, although who knows how long it will be until we know whether or not that's an unjustified concern. I don't think it is.<br/><br/>I suppose in retrospect such a worry can be poked fun at, but are we to believe that the Japanese didn't know where Hollywood is located? That they had to send an elite team on land to dress up like Christmas trees to find it? I imagine this was meant to lead into one of the best scenes in the movie, where the Japanese shoot LAND off of the HOLLYWOODLAND sign, a hilarious addition to the movie, since the sign really did say HOLLYWOODLAND originally.<br/><br/>Dan Aykroyd's ""I am a bug"" scene is good, and the movie opens with a clever spoof on Jaws, and there certainly are some great lines in the movie (""This is the craziest son of a bitch I ever saw. How many more do you think are up there?""), but like so many other movies the diamonds are not able to shine very brightly through the rough. On the DVD, it's interesting to see Spielberg talking about the movie, because he expresses some disappointment that it was not as appreciated in America as he had hoped it would be, although they love it in Europe. I wonder what the meaning of that might be"

","Stephen Spielberg's 1941 bombed when first released in late 1979. But the movie really isn't all that bad, honest.  But the only problem is that it suffers from overkill. Just too many story lines going on at once and that makes the movie increasingly difficult to follow.  But then again, it's something not to be taken seriously. People who take it seriously may not find it funny at all, since the whole thing is played for laughs.<br/><br/>As for the plot, if no one knows, let me try to explain a little. 1941 is set during one long day (and night) of December 13, 1941 one week after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. One part centers on a hostile Japanese submarine, the I-19, which surfaces near the California coast where the commander Mitamura tries to find an inviting target to attack. Also on board is a Nazi advisor Capt. Von Kleinschmidt (Christopher Lee) always bickering about Mitamura's tactics.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in war-crazed Los Angeles the action mostly centers on two young men, Wally and Dennis. Wally is a recent parolee from prison and wants to get the affections of his girl Betty Douglas, which her dominering father Ward (Ned Beatty) tries to prevent. Then there's this tank crew led by Sgt. Tree (Dan Ackroyd) who's crew Sitarski (Treat Williams), Foley (John Candy), Hinshaw and Reese place a 40mm AA gun in the front lawn of Ward Douglas's house, where Sitarski, a local bully, takes a liking to Betty and an instant dislike to Wally. Wally then spends the rest of the movie trying to get into the new USO club where Betty and her frumpy friend Maxine work as USO girls while Sitarski tries to starve off the advances from Maxine.<br/><br/>Also, there's this wild-eyed army pilot named Wild Bill Kelso (the late great John Belushi) spending most of the movie flying around in a stolen P-40 fighter plane looking for a nonexistent Japanese air raid squadron. A mad army colonel, Maddox, protecting Barstow army airport from a nonexistent Japanese landing force. Two dim-wited, bickering air raid spoters, named Herby and Claude, who spend the movie stuck on top of a carnival ferris wheel looking for Japanese aircraft. A hapless drunkard named Hollis Wood (Slim Pickens) who gets captured by Mitamura's crew to learn the directions to Hollywood, al la ""Who's on First"" joke. A neurotic U.S. Army general Stilwell (Robert Stack) trying to hold the city together, while his secretary Donna (Nancy Allen) is persued by airman Birkhead (Tim Matheson) who learns that Donna will only put out when airborne in a moving plane.<br/><br/>Lost you? That's only half of the movie as the rest of it gets increasingly chaotic and noisy.  Many other familar faced character actors make cameo appearances, too many to name them all here.  But for those who want some time passing movie watching this is the one to see and worth a look. Note: this review is for the 146 minute director's cut, not the theatrical 119 minute print which omits some characters and subplots.  The longer director's cut is the one to see."

"anamorph-3","5","1","2","19 August 1999"," Spielberg's (Slightly) Misunderstood Comedy of Destruction
","Discussing the virtues and failings of Spielberg's personal albatross, ""1941"", is a daunting task indeed--mainly because there are a multitude of both to be found in this sprawling, convoluted, monstrosity of a comedy film.  Viewers who had come to love the wunderkind director for his tours de force, ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", certainly didn't know what to make of this splashy, goofy spectacle, and largely passed on the movie.  Critics pounced hungrily on the film as the inevitable (or was it hoped for?) downfall of a director who had quickly become ""too big for his britches"".  Now, 20 years later, a new Director's Cut DVD/Laser Disc provides viewers a fresh chance to see whether ""1941"" is an unrecognized classic, or whether it is the horrible, worthless drivel critics of the 1970s made it out to be.  The answer?  It is neither.<br/><br/>As far as its much-touted flaws are concerned, the main characters (and they are abundant!) aren't particularly engaging and, at their worst, are downright annoying.  The plot is paper-thin, and Spielberg forces the movie to move in a mind-numbingly frenetic pace seemingly to cover up this glaring fact.  Worst of all, the film just isn't funny--well, not very funny, at least.  What few genuine laughs there are do not warrant the film's staggering production values and 2 1/2 hour running time (it is interesting to note that John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd would repeat this formula of laughs via annihilation a year later and, in the process, create a comedy masterpiece--""The Blues Brothers"").  To his credit, on the DVD's/Laser Disc's ""Making of 1941"" documentary, Spielberg tries to address these concerns, stating that he never had a strong vision for the film (a significant no-no for a director) and that he thinks that co-writer Robert Zemekis' talent for chaotic pacing (as evidenced in his films ""Back to the Future, Part II"", ""Death Becomes Her"", and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"") would have been better suited for directing the film.<br/><br/>Interestingly though, upon a recent viewing of the film, numerous virtues become evident.  The film is graced with William Fraker's exquisite cinematography (though the heavy-handed use of smoke and fog effects leads to a occasionally murky image on home video, even in as superior a format as DVD).  The film is buoyed along by a broad and bold (is there any other kind?) score by John Williams.  The set pieces and choreography are breathtaking, and the visual effects (utilizing some of the finest miniatures in cinematic history) are nothing short of phenomenal.<br/><br/>Looking at the film in context with the rest of Spielberg's career, the over-the-top characters, situations, and events seem to be the director's way of highlighting the insanity, and ultimate immaturity, of war, but it is a difficult view to contextualize with the man who would later bring us the highly patriotic and respectful ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>In the final equation, it seems that for every misstep in the film, a little gem can be found, as well.  So, even in retrospect, does the film deserves its position as the worst film in Spielberg's career?  Well...yes; however, the film is still likely to have appeal to die-hard Spielberg afficionados, as well as fans of top-notch visual effects.  The general comedy film fan, on the other hand, will surely walk away from ""1941"" feeling he/she has just wasted 2 1/2 hours of his/her time."

It's from the bigger is funnier school of humor--Spielberg's only big comedy.  There's lots of gunfire, lots of fights, lots of screaming (in full stereo) and tons of destruction (an entire amusement park is destroyed, a few city blocks of Los Angeles and a big beautiful house).  As for the acting--it varies wildly.  Tim Matheson plays a lt. who has the hots for Nancy Allen who only gets excited in moving planes--they're both cute and funny.  Dan Aykroyd is wasted.  John Belushi is annoying.  Robert Stack is amusing.  Ned Beatty and Lorraine Gary are funny, but underused.  Treat Williams is violent and very unfunny.  And where else can you see Christopher Lee play a German?  The film is too long (I saw the 2 1/2 director's cut) and it doesn't always work...but when it does, it's hilarious!  A definite highlight is the jitterbug sequence--unfortunately, it has a violent conclusion in which a very likable character is punched out three times.  Terrific John Williams score too.

A lot of the time you think you know exactly what's about to happen and the story ends up changing it up on you. I think that the fact that the Japanese decided that Hollywood was the best way to provoke the US into engaging in the war was so funny, as was the scene with them all listening in on Slim Pickens as he ""tried"" to pass the compass. There are a large number of different personality types, so the probability of a person liking any one character is pretty good. Anyone that doesn't like this movie just need to get the pole out of their.... butt and appreciate some classic comedy.

And whilst she has a nice bum, its in poor taste. You can check it out on youtube.<br/><br/>There are plenty of familiar faces Christopher Lee, Murray Hamilton (Jaws) John Belushi playing the same guy he always plays, Lorraine Gary (Jaws) Ned Beatty (Deliverance) Dan Aykroyd (making his American feature film debut) Warren Oates (Wild Bunch) and John Candy but it feels like he has just shot a bunch of sketches together. We have no reason to care if any of the characters lived or died. <br/><br/>Spielberg said ""I'll spend the rest of my life disowning this movie.""<br/><br/>1941 grossed $31 million dollars at the domestic box office against a $35 million dollar budget. It was a modest hit though, as it made almost $95 million worldwide."
"ashishagupta","8","1","3","5 November 2017"," Great allegorical satire disguised as screwball comedy
","1941 is excellent comedy. It is funny, if you understand the references to social, cultural, and political statements disguised as a screwball comedy. There are also several references to other famous movies here. Like any allegory, the true narrative is buried under the depicted story and therefore the movie cannot be viewed literally.<br/><br/>1941 is a big budget movie with a stellar cast of comedy heavy hitters. For fans of Beluschi, Candy, Akroyd, and many more, you can't go wrong with this movie.<br/><br/>The overt story is set in and around the city of Los Angeles in California, shortly after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. The backdrop of public hysteria due to fear of an impending Imperial Japanese attack on mainland US is used to set the stage for over-the-top farce. The implicit story is really just a narrative of cultural and social perceptions in US.<br/><br/>The movie has several political statements to make. Watching the movie should be a fun Easter egg hunt for these references. The speech by Dan Akroyd's character on top of the tank is priceless. Whenever hysteria grips the national imagination, this speech rings true. There are numerous mentions of race relations through out the movie.<br/><br/>For those watching this movie, like me in 2017, will likely instantaneously recognize the prescience of this movie in its uncanny similarity to the Donald Trump administration. It is incredibly hilarious to watch Akroy'd character wrongly mention '... now lets get those Nazis' instead of saying Japanese and then watching Donald Trump in news saying, '... I sent those Tomahawk cruise missiles to Iraq' instead of saying Syria.<br/><br/>This movie is excellent catharsis for Americans experiencing a world with Trump administration. There is another dialogue on this: Pvt. Foley: Isn't this the same fool we saw earlier this morning? Sgt. Frank Tree: Yes, but he is wearing the stripes now. So he is in command.<br/><br/>Incredibly and unbelievably, real life in 2017 has reached the dizzying levels of this farcical movie.<br/><br/>I could go on with the list of great jokes in this movie, but it would be best if you watched it. Comedy fans will not be disappointed."

","I suppose that every great director has to have at least one movie that tests the patience of the audience. For Spielberg, that was a comedy misfire known simply as 1941. Perched uncomfortably in his filmography between Close Encounters and Raiders of the Lost Ark, it was a bizarre free-for-all that started at level 10 and never never dropped for a moment. This was a noisy, relentless, overbearing bit of comedy tripe so obnoxious that Spielberg would later claim that audience members at the first test screening were holding their hands over their ears.<br/><br/>Set amid the paranoia of the Pearl Harbor attacks, the focuses a group of misfits in Southern California, 1941 doesn't really have a plot structure so much as a gaggle of insane characters let loose on each other to do apparently whatever they like within the span of 90 minutes. The problem, I discovered, is that none of the comedy sticks. It's just a series of nutty people allowed to say and do whatever they please in a sort of war-time version of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. The comic invention is to gather together all sorts of wonderful actors, both serious and comic, and let them run around like idiots and make a lot of noise. This, a comedy does not make.<br/><br/>Comedy has to have rules, it has to have structure, it has to have set up and payoff. Even the Marx Brothers' brand on insanity was written and rewritten, rehearsed and re-rehearsed. It was perfected down to the last detail so it seemed to come from their guts. That's not the case here.<br/><br/>The movie has a cult status that I don't understand. I sat stone-faced through this whole production. Not just stone-faced, but also frustrated as I watch a bilious amounts of comic invention burn on the screen. It is one of those movies where you sense that it might have been funny in the moment, on the set, or in the screen writing sessions. But when you're sitting there watching joke after joke fall over and die, you are left with the inevitable question, ""what's the point of all this?"""

","After the release, John Belushi wore to a party a button reading ""John Belushi: 1949 - 1941."" That's how much of a failure this story of the Los Angeles panic in the wake of Pearl Harbor is.<br/><br/>It's all done with brio but if Spielberg missed on opportunity for low-brow humor anywhere along the way, I missed it. If someone tosses eggs to a cook, the eggs miss and splat on the counter. If someone pours coffee into a cup, most of it sloshes onto the table. Belushi is piloting his P-40 through the Grand Canyon. When he gets a yen for a Coke, he smashes off the top of the bottle and most of it gets on his face, although a bit of it dribbles into his mouth, drowning the cigar stub implanted there.<br/><br/>There are fights, flights, jitterbug dances, mockery of a Japanese submarine, beautiful young women wearing stockings and garter belts, an abundance of socks in the jaw, collapsing towers, crazed motorcyclists, and all of it thrown at the viewer at a frenzied pace.<br/><br/>It was all done at least as well, if more deliberately, by Laurel and Hardy. Some comedies, especially those with big budgets, seem to fail for similar reasons. ""It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" and ""What's New Pussycat"" seem to equate energy and speed with humor, and the two are just not necessarily the same. A genuinely fast comedy can be funny -- ""His Girl Friday"" or ""One Two Three"" -- but speed can't be substituted for well-designed gags. It's just not especially amusing when two men boost Belushi up onto the wing of his airplane and he rolls off the other side. We've seen it a dozen times, though most often with horses.<br/><br/>And as I watched this for the second time, my mind drifting a little, I began wondering exactly how many of the period references and spoofs would register with younger viewers. They'll undoubtedly get the opening allusion to ""Jaws"", but will they know that the zoot suit riots were real, or recognize the musical tribute to the score of ""Patton"", or get the incarnation of the Andrew Sisters? The funniest scenes are those in which a firm declaration is immediately contradicted by events. ""I'll have no guns in this house,"" declares a housewife -- and the barrel of a 40 mm. cannon comes crashing through the front door. ""There will be no bombs dropped on this airfield!"", General Robert Stack announces during a speech, and a bomb accidentally dropped from a parked B-17 rolls toward the stand and explodes. But that's the height that subtlety reaches in this comedy.<br/><br/>Great cast caught up in a pointless whirlwind of lunacy."
"aramis-112-804880","4","1","3","5 December 2012"," Overblown and Dull
","Whether Stephen Spielberg is or is not an overrated director, his popularity is undeniable. So is his obsession with World War II. I can list a half-dozen of his movies that are set in various theaters of the war, including the disastrous ""1941"" which pokes less-than-kindly fun at the folks back at the home front.<br/><br/>""1941"" has problems on many levels, but it suffers principally from a severe lack of focus, with six or seven subplots all vying for the viewer's attention, that never satisfactorily converge. ""1941"" is also very loud. Even the trailer is comprised mainly of cast members screaming their heads off. ""1941"" is one of those movies, like the worst live-action 1970s Disney affairs, that mistake wanton destruction for humor.<br/><br/>Three things lift ""1941"" from utter boredom. First is John Williams' brilliant score. His wacky inside-out march, with its beat on the upbeat, weaves through the movie as a constant delight. What stars this movie earns from me are due to Williams.<br/><br/>Less delightful, but still welcome, is John Belushi. While as boorish and loud as everyone else in the movie, Belushi at least invests his character with zest. Though the best that can be said for Belushi's ""Wild Bill"" Kelso is that he never bores, that's saying a lot in this flick.<br/><br/>Finally, while the veteran actors come across comparatively better than the rising stars, Robert Stack's General Stilwell is a standout. Reportedly, motion picture icons John Wayne and Charlton Heston declined the role (showing, if that is true, show-biz savvy). Stack's General Stilwell gives ""1941"" its only glimmer of humanity. And while Stack's character, being based on a real person, is a more serious peg to anchor the movie's wildness, Stack himself displays flashes of the comedic timing that would serve him and other -- until then po-faced -- actors well in 1980's ""Airplane!"" By and large, ""1941"" is worth seeing once for the full horror at witnessing how Hollywood can waste money and resources, with all the starving people in the world. While I am no Spielberg fan (I have seen nine of the movies he has directed, and have watched only two of those more than once), ""1941"" is a particular disappointment because of all the potential talent involved. Kudos to Wayne and Heston for bypassing this mess."
"tml_pohlak_13","4","1","3","11 June 2009"," An air raid without bombs
","1941 is often considered to be Steven Spielberg's weakest film, and it is simple to see why. Critics had been looking for an opportunity to bash Spielberg since Jaws became a phenomenon, and they finally got their chance with 1941. It was savagely attacked and has earned the reputation of a box-office disaster (although it did gain some money). It is actually slightly better than its reputation would suggest, but not by much.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg opens the film with a reference to Jaws, which is a treat. The film, unfortunately, quickly degenerates into a ridiculous slapstick routine, where so much goes on, it's hard to laugh at any of it. Too many different subplots circle around each other constantly. The result is that we are left with a comedy about strangers. The extremely limited character development transforms certain characters into mere sketches, and others into shadows.<br/><br/>1941 is one instance where the director's cut of the film is far better than the original theatrical release. For instance, the Japanese crew of a submarine plan to attack Hollywood. To do this, they kidnap a man named Hollis Wood and try forcing him to tell them Hollywood's location. In the original release, he appears at random, his scene awkwardly placed. In the director's cut, the audience is first treated to an excellent scene where some of the crew go to the mainland disguised as Christmas trees, taking photos of themselves. Hollis Wood, who is in the Christmas tree business, attempts to cut what he thinks are trees down, and is kidnapped in the process.<br/><br/>Visually and comically, the film's best scene is the jitterbug scene, where Wally tries dancing with his girlfriend at the USO (where he isn't supposed to be, as he is a civilian), trying to win the jitterbug contest, all while avoiding getting pummelled by the furiously jealous Sitarski. The complicated camera movement in this scene are a visual miracle, and, in addition, this is the film's strongest scene. Although Sitarski is successfully avoided several times, he eventually throws a punch, which soon evolves into a full-out brawl. The (presumably) club owner begins commenting on the fight into a microphone, reminiscent of a sports broadcast. It briefly seems that the film may become hilarious: the frantic, wild pace that infects the rest of the movie is not seen here. The scene finds its own pace somehow, and it's really effective. But soon after the fighting goes out into the streets, the comedy rapidly declines.<br/><br/>The film ""scores"" comically in its most subtle, small touches: patriotic, very American music plays as a couple is told their house is strategically advantageous for an anti-aircraft gun; a general sheds tears as mother and son are separated in Dumbo; an airplane lands at a gas station (one Spielberg used in Duel), and the pilots expects the service to fill it up; a ventriloquist's dummy spots a Japanese sub from atop a Ferris Wheel before its human counterparts do; Wynowski kicking Birkhead in the shins to make sure he's not a Japanese infiltrator on stilts<br/><br/>Although the list of comedic touches is considerably long, someone has to take the blame for the overblown, frenetic, overdone scenes that assume they will turn out to be funny: for some unexplained reason, Hollis Wood is forced to poop at gunpoint, escaping the Japanese sub by pretending he's constipated; an overblown special-effects driven scene as aircraft battle over Los Angeles; a homeowner shoots his anti-aircraft gun at a Japanese sub— through his house; the Japanese attack an amusement park, mistaking it for an industrial centre, causing the Ferris wheel to roll into the water; Loomis Birkhead constantly attempts to have sex with a plane-crazy secretary, Donna Stratton, by getting up in a plane with her (finally achieving this goal in a plane that barely seats the two of them); a woman, thinking she hears an air raid siren, shrieks ""Japs!"" over and over again, but it is really the hero's plot to steal a zoot suit. The crude, poor excuse for comedy permeates practically the entire film, and is not funny at all.<br/><br/>However, John Williams deserves a lot of credit for his music, which embodies the spirit of the comedy 1941 was intended to be. True, it is not his most brilliant score (it doesn't even make the Top 15 list), but it's one of the film's highlights. In particular, the music that accompanies the jitterbug riot makes the entire scene purely amusing. The music was a valiant effort to save the film from disaster, but it wasn't enough: the disaster still happened.<br/><br/>The Verdict: In short, Steven Spielberg's 1941 is actually funnier than its reputation suggests, but not by that much. Critics lashed out at 1941 simply because it is a Steven Spielberg film, whereas other movies with less than half of 1941's imagination were not nearly as ridiculed. In the end, however, 1941 feels like it is a beached whale struggling to get back to the water. It has its moments, but is not a strong film in general.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 4/10"

It's obvious that many actors are not motivated. Too many actors in too many scenes dial in their performances. Oh, and this is the worst of John Belushi's performances. He is not funny and too often goes for the cheap laugh...and does a poor job. Dan Aykroyd is typically annoying and unfunny, so no surprises there.<br/><br/>If you ignore the acting and concentrate on the dialog, which is not hard to do because this is darker than an overcooked turkey, it's easier to understand the appeal this has for some.

","This is one of those movies I keep coming back to, hoping I've been too hard on it.  I'm always disappointed.  I like the idea of this movie and some of the performances are fantastic, notably John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and Treat Williams (watch that bipolar psycho trick when he wipes the frown off his face).  But overall it's a mess.  There are too many subplots that don't pay off (the longer DVD version helps a little) and too many scenes bustling with performers mugging desperately for ""big comedy"".  The biggest problem may have been the timing of the film's production.  The 1940s sensibilities clash with the '70s irreverence (it compares quite unfavorably with Bob Clark's ""A Christmas Story"", which was set in the same era).  The (ill-advised)effort to make this a WWII Animal House is further impeded by weak performances by Bobby deCicco and Tim Matheson as the ""wacky"" free spirits."

","Ah yes, the infamous Steven Spielberg ""flop"" that chronicled the antics, shenanigans and misadventures of crazed Californians following the Pearl Harbor attack. What can I say - it is a noble failure, a well meaning attempt to make fun of both the 1940s films and World War II films in general with their America #1 and contrived romances. Perhaps, if a more comically inclined director like Robert Zemeckis (who coined the story with Bob Gale) or John Landis (who appears as the dirt covered motorcycle corporal) had been at the helm it might have worked. As it is, the film has a brilliant idea but it never quite takes off.<br/><br/>It does not have so much a central plot but is more a series of subplots loosely strung together. They are in no particular order - <br/><br/>1) The Japanese sub commanded by the late great Japanese film legend Toshiro ""The Wolf"" Mifune, off the coast of California looking for something ""honorable"" to destroy, with Christopher Lee by his side as a German general. When the Japanese get stuck interrogating Slim Pickens (the mad bomb riding pilot in ""Dr. Strangelove"") in the most unpleasant manner, Mifune grumbles ""This has not been honorable..."" <br/><br/>2) Crusty Maj. General Joseph W. Stilwell (Robert Stack, who, in make up/glasses/uniform, actually does bear an uncanny resemblance to the real General Stilwell) tries to keep the people of California calm while trying to put time aside to kick back and watch Dumbo, which brings him to tears.<br/><br/>3) A wild, drunken, comically intense/volatile, sloppy man child pilot known as Wild Bill Kelso (John Belushi) flies all over the place looking for enemy fighter pilots to down. These kind of sloppy man children were typical canon of Belushi, and in particular this one is very similar to his Bluto character from ""Animal House"" (again, Jake Blues was his best role).<br/><br/>4) General Stilwell's aid, Captain Loomis Birkhead (Tim Matheson, basically reprising his Otter character from ""Animal House""), a tall, dark, stereotypically oversexed pretty boy and failed fighter pilot, spends the majority of the film comically pursuing General Stilwell's beautiful young secretary, the nicely round, shapely Donna Stratton (Nancy Allen, in a role far removed from the hooker of ""Dressed to Kill"" and the rough and tumble policewoman Anne Lewis in ""Robocop""). The only problem aside from Donna's apprehensions of Loomis, is that she can't get aroused unless she's in a high flying airplane.<br/><br/>5) Downtrodden minority and would be Hispanic Zoot Suiter Wally Stephens (Bobby De Cicco) battles the evil, lecherous, egg hating Cpl. Chuck 'Stretch' Sitarski (a much younger Treat Williams) for his one true love Betty Douglas (Dianne Kay).<br/><br/>6) Sgt. Frank Tree (Dan Aykroyd) and his not so howling commandos move into Betty Douglas's home, much to the chagrin of her mother Joan (Lorraine Gary), but her dad Ward (Ned Beatty) is more than willing to assist. Among Frank's troops is the late John Candy. Frank is very fond of saying ""If there's one thing I can't stand, it's Americans fighting Americans."" Seriously, if it weren't for Dan Aykroyd's delivery, the line wouldn't work nearly as well. <br/><br/>Over the course of the film, Wally and 'Stretch' fight each other for Betty at an inner city dance, which leads to a brawl among marines, sailors, etc (based on the real life 1940s riots between visiting soldiers and local Hispanic Zoot Suitors - proof that when you put white authoritarian soldiers in the same room with minorities you're asking for trouble). Loomis manages to get Donna in an airplane, which transforms her into a walking, 5'6"" orgasm, but their airborne tryst is interrupted by Wild Bill Kelso, who mistakes them for the enemy. Frank gets bonked on the head and suffers shell shock, leaving Wally - who's not even an enlisted man - in charge of his team. Toshiro Mifune throws Christopher Lee overboard and orders his men to destroy a beach side amusement park. Chaos, mayhem, and lots of property damage ensues.<br/><br/>Some of this is very funny, some of it is just overkill. Perhaps if things like Slim Pickens character and the guys on the ferris wheel with the dummy had been left on the cutting room floor it might have been more fun. But it's not completely uninteresting. There's is a funny opening the strapping blonde skinny dipper from Spielberg's ""Jaws"" clinging in a rather phallic manner to the Japanese sub periscope.<br/><br/>Nancy Allen and Dianne Kay are great eye candy - and Nancy's airplane orgasm is pretty funny.<br/><br/>""What's wrong?! You're not air born yet!""<br/><br/>""What are you talking about?! Look out the window, of course we're air born!""<br/><br/>""We are, but... *you're* not."" - Nancy Allen and Tim Matheson."

","Steven Spielberg had never failed on this level before. In fact, he'd never really failed before.<br/><br/>He'd been given some advice about the movie from John Wayne, who had declined to act in it due to ill health. Spielberg would recall that the Duke ""said he felt it was a very un-American movie, and I shouldn't waste my time making it. He said, ""You know, that was an important war, and you're making fun of a war that cost thousands of lives at Pearl Harbor. Don't joke about World War II."" Charlton Heston also turned down a role in the movie. They were the lucky ones.<br/><br/>While only the fifth full-length film Spielberg would release theatrically, he was already growing self-referential, with Susan Backlinie getting nude and reprising her role as the first victim (just like Jaws), the gas station from Duel showing up and reusing Lucille Benson in a similar role.<br/><br/>Spielberg would later cede that personal arrogance is why the movie failed. That and the fact that he gave up control over the second unit and effects shots would be lessons he'd take with him for the rest of his career.<br/><br/>The movie begins six days after Pearl Harbor, as a Japanese submarine surfaces off the coast of Califonia. This is somewhat based in fact, as there was an event that has come to be referred to as the Great Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942. The commander of that sub, Commander Mitamura ( Toshiro Mifune, in the only Western movie where he used his real voice and wasn't dubbed by Paul Frees) and Nazi general Wolfgang von Kleinschmidt (Christopher Lee!) have come to America to destroy Hollywood.<br/><br/>Later that morning, the 10th Armored Division M3 Lee tank crew, consisting of Sergeant Frank Tree (Dan Aykroyd), Corporal Chuck Sitarski (Treat Williams) and Privates Foley and Reese (John Candy and Mickey Rourke) are having breakfast where Wally and Dennis (Bobby Di Cicco and Perry Lang, who was in The Hearse) work as dishwashers. They all get into a fight, which Sitarski breaks up, because he can't stand Americans fighting Americans.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the maniacal United States Army Air Forces Captain Wild Bill Kelso (John Belushi, who fell off his plane at one point and was in the hospital for a while; it was so funny that it's in the movie) lands his Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter near that aforementioned Duel gas station and blows it up real good. And, if you're still paying attention, Major General Joseph W. Stilwell (Robert Stack) is trying to calm the public who is convinced that World War II has come to America. Because, well, it is, a point hammered home when the romantic hijinks of Captain Loomis Birkhead (Tim Matheson) and press agent Donna Stratton (Nancy Allen) releases a bomb on the stage.<br/><br/>There's a lot to keep track of.<br/><br/>While all this is happening, Ward Douglas (Ned Beatty) and his wife Joan (Lorraine Gary, also of that shark blockbuster) are allowing the military to install a gigantic gun on their front lawn. His daughter Betty dates Walter, who we met before, but now she's only allowed to dance with soldiers. Oh yeah -- Wendi Jo Sperber shows up as well, as she did in nearly every movie after 1979 that had a curvy best friend role.<br/><br/>Of course, all hell breaks loose, ending with a house going into the ocean as Robert Stack intones, ""It's going to be a long war."" Dude. It was a long movie and I've only summarized part of it.<br/><br/>This movie is overloaded with actors, like Murray Hamilton (are you sick of actors who were in that shark film yet?), Warren Oates, Eddie Deezen, Slim Pickens, Patti LuPone, Penny Marshall, Frank McRae (who pretty much invented the angry police captain role that every 80's movie stole), Lionel Stander from Hart to Hart, Lenny and Squiggy as Willy and Joe (better known as Michael McKean and David Lander), Iggie Wolfington (who is also in Hex, a movie I love that no one remembers), Count Floyd himself Joe Flaherty, Lucille Benson (Mrs. Elrod!), Elisha Cook Jr. (Rosemary's Baby), directors Samuel Fuller and John Landis, Robert Houston (who not only was in The Hills Have Eyes, but also made the bootleg Lone Wolf and Cub remix Shogun Assassin), frequent Clint Eastwood co-star Jack Thibeau, Andy Tennant (who would go on to direct Ever After and Fools Rush In), an uncredited James Caan, Jerry Hardin (Deep Throat from The X-Files) and, of course, Dick Miller.<br/><br/>The Japanese submarine crew was made up of laid-back Southern California dudes who were hired just because they were Asian. Mifune was infuriated by their attitudes, so he asked Spielberg if he could speak to them. An actual Japanese World War II veteran and one of the greatest actors of all time, Mifune spoke to them about getting in line before he became screamed and slapping them around, Needless to say, he was in charge from then on.<br/><br/>Spielberg even wrote the intro to the comic, in which he said, ""Columbia and Universal forced me to spend $30 million on 1941. The film's actual cost was $12.5 million. The rest of the budget was spent on prostitutes and drugs. I can see 1941 more as a cleansing experience. The one possible way I can make you forget all the good things I've done in motion pictures. Be merciful."" You can still buy it directly from Heavy Metal.<br/><br/>So was it a bomb? Not according to co-screenwriter Bob Gale: ""It is down in the history books as a big flop, but it wasn't a flop. The movie didn't make the kind of money that Steven's other movies, Steven's most successful movies have made, obviously. But the movie was by no means a flop. And both Universal and Columbia have come out of it just fine.""<br/><br/>That's true -- it made $92 million on a $35 million dollar budget. That seems like a success to me, at least financially. For his part, Belushi found the whole thing hilarious and was seen wearing a t-shirt that said, ""Steven Spielberg 1946-1941.""<br/><br/>Perhaps the best review of the film came from Kubrick, who said that the movie was great. But it really wasn't funny. Spielberg would agree and say that it would have been better marketed as a drama.<br/><br/>If this movie gave us anything, it's this: Robert Stack remarked, after meeting Belushi for the first time, ""That's the craziest SOB I've ever met."""
"davidmvining","7","0","1","10 February 2020"," Manic , anarchic, and entertaining
","Watching this almost back to back with Postal (completely coincidentally, by the way) is interesting. They're both rather structureless comedies that aim for constant funnies, but one succeeds rather well where the other fails utterly and miserably. They're both anarchic in spirit, but one is made by a witless idiot while the other is made by a technically expert creative. Anyway...just for the record, this review is based on the longer special edition, which is a full half hour longer than the original theatrical cut<br/><br/>Japan has just bombed Pearl Harbor and the people of Southern California are besides themselves with worry. Some prepare for a land invasion by taking out old shotguns and cleaning them. Others sit atop Ferris Wheels to inspect the waters off the coast. Others concern themselves fully with a jitterbug contest that could get them a seven year deal from RKO. Wally couldn't care less about the war or the men signing up for the effort, because he's going to win his girl's heart and steal her away from her father by winning that contest. He's so committed, that he dances throughout his shift at a trashy little diner where he works, getting into a fight with Treat, an army captain, by getting a bit of egg on his jacket. Fired, without any money, and sans sweet zoot suit for the night, he goes into a department store and cranks up an air raid signal to inspire panic and get out with the suit he's trying on without paying.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Major General Stilwell is trying to use his post has head of the army in the area to calm the people down. His aide, Captain Loomis, is far more concerned with getting lucky with the general's new secretary, Donna. The only way she'll got that far with a guy, though, is by going in an airplane into the air. He got kicked out of the air corps after a couple of days, but that's not going to get between him and his time with the goddess (probably the best Nancy Allen ever looked, to be honest).<br/><br/>There also is a Japanese submarine just off the coast, captained by Mitamura with the Nazi Captain Kleinschmidt along to observe. Mitamura's objective is to hit America right after Pearl Harbor and strike fear, so he chooses to land an attack on Hollywood, except their compass broke and they don't know where they are. They send a group of ninja trained sailors on shore to kidnap Slim Pickens who won't give up any information, going so far as to swallow a compass taken from a Cracker Jack box they found on his person.<br/><br/>Through all of this is Captain Wild Bill Kelso, a pilot in the air corps that's intent on finding a group of Japanese Mitsubishi planes he knows are flying over American airspace (there aren't).<br/><br/>There's a lot going on, following a lot of characters, and I find it all rather delirious in some of the best ways. I would have been happier with a cleaner movie overall, but then it would have lost its anarchic appeal. Would we have gotten the magnificent jitterbug dance competition that morphs into a fist fight and then into a giant riot between all three branches of the military and the zoot suiters? All while General Stilwell was sitting across the street in a theater tearfully and joyously enjoying Dumbo? Seriously, this is one of the most purely entertaining spectacles Spielberg ever made, and I don't think it would have happened if the movie was more straightforward.<br/><br/>No, this movie is special. It's manic and chaotic, but I never felt overwhelmed or lost. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It's really a Frankenstein's monster of four different visions (Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, and John Milius), but they gel rather well into one bulging at the seams whole. It spills out in every direction, cheerfully desperate to entertain. I really enjoyed this movie, and I look forward to revisiting it in years to come."
"uvahoos","9","0","1","18 January 2020"," Unpopular opinion on 'SNLesque' flick
","1941 is not a masterpiece, and does not strive to be so. A comedy by the illustrious Steven Spielberg isn't what movie goers and comedy seekers think, and be warned that thought in the humor is required for the movie to make sense. The movie includes corny puppetry on a ferris wheel, tanks, aircraft, Christopher Lee, Slim Pickens, Dan Ackyroyd, and John Candy. Drawing from Animal House, John Belushi delivers an awkward, American hero persona that makes the common sense American see military involvement in the San Francisco Bay Area as an overreaction to the threat of Japanese attack. Racist? Possibly (given the time it was filmed and produced, and the Western worldview of Imperial Japanese) - hilarious definitely. Watching 1941 illicits a strange Oscar baiting comedy that ultimately self serves its own self deprecation of award winning movies Spielberg has directed and produced. Be warned: it is not Jackass and it is not Airplane. It is an historical drama-com dedicated to historical hilarity and poking fun at American reactionsim."

","Just had the pleasure of watching this film with my dad, who said he hadn't watched this film in well over twenty years, and we both highly enjoyed it! If I had not researched it beforehand and I didn't know who the director was, you would be very hard-pressed to convince me this wasn't a film by John Landis instead by Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>There's some great humor in this film that doesn't pull any punches. It felt like I was watching a WWII film meets The Blues Brothers, Animal House, and It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. The acting is surprisingly good, though John Belushi and Dan Akroyd are slightly underused. The young love story is a little over-the-top, but it just adds to 1941's looney-tune comedic value.<br/><br/>However, I did find some of the racial comments a tad bit insensitive, and not just towards the Japanese and German people. If you can handle the frequent negative racial commentary, though, this film is quite good. I recommend it."

","If you approach this film looking for the loftiness of a Close Encounters of the Third Kind or an E.T. you are going to hate it. If you are a humorless, hard-core military supporter who views any kinds of jabs at the armed forces as an affront, you will hate it. If you didn't grow up in the 1970s, again, there's a good chance you will hate it.<br/><br/>1941 is a farce-not accidentally, but on purpose. It's a film in the repertoire of a director who established himself as a producer of high quality, often deeply reflective cinema who just wanted to let his hair down and have some fun. I don't think Spielberg ever wanted this film to be taken seriously, and it may have been that he made it to keep from taking himself seriously. Who knows? What I do know is that it's fun and funny and disarmingly irreverent-three traits that pretty much defined the comedy of the 1970s. In other words, it's a movie only Generation X can wholly appreciate.<br/><br/>I will never say this is a great film. But it is a good, fun film and not deserving of the bad ink that's been written about it. The only bad ink it should get is about the bloated Collector's Edition DVD release that throws in unnecessary deleted scenes that either kill the comedic timing or try to force us to take the whole thing more seriously with pointless backstory and plot exposition. The original theatrical release was the better version.<br/><br/>So, check you expectations at the door and simply embrace it for what it is."

There's some pretty weird slapstick in this movie. You'd think a film based on World War II wouldn't have the disclaimer that any similarities to real people would be included. Well, I guess the story is pure fiction.<br/><br/>A lot of the characters just come off as mean in this. They just randomly have soldiers and sailors fight each other. The fights don' even make sense. Still, it's definitely a big nice looking film. It's great to see an all star cast of John Belushi, John Candy, Dan Aykroyd and Christopher Lee in this.

"ofpsmith","7","0","1","14 July 2017"," By no means a perfect film, but it's a real wild ride.
","After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor paranoia swept across the nation as the United States was swept into World War 2. One of the most prominent areas of paranoia following December 7th was the West Coast, in particular California cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. Nothing like the films events occurred in real life, but at the time it was a real concern. The plot of 1941 is in the context of this paranoia. While the film isn't great (especially by Steven Spielberg standards), to say the film is boring would be false. One of the best things about the movie is the characters. There are a few throw away characters but those played by Dan Akroyd, John Belushi, Toshiro Mifune, Christopher Lee, Ned Beatty, John Candy, Warren Oates, and Slim Pickens are a lot of fun to watch, even if some of them aren't in the movie very long. There's also a bunch of great gags. But the flaws are pretty prevalent as well. As funny as some of the jokes are, there's also other ones that are just painful or awkward. In conclusion, the film is relatively enjoyable but the flaws can leave you imagining how it could have been a better movie. I do recommend it as it is very entertaining, but the flaws exist."

It takes place just after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Californians are worried about an attack on the west coast by the Japanese. So everyone comes to arms to defend the West coast. Including local folk, the armed forces, and everyone inbetween. John Belushi is hilarious as the crazy fighter pilot who is tracking a Japanese fighter group who has supposedly set up a base in California. Dan Akroyd plays a devote army fighter uniting all the different service units to fight the enemy and not fight each other. There's a love story in there too. Lot's of chaos. Lot's of action.

","Okay all you One-Star Wallys, you Gloomy Guses, you Debbie Downers, I'm going to explain this for the umpty-umpth time in thirty-five years: ""1941"" is slapstick comedy. It's a big, noisy mess. It's warped fun and nothing more. ""1941"" is not -- I repeat NOT -- your mature sophisti-comedy with Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn with pithy nuances and lessons for the heart. <br/><br/>You've got Eddie Deezen on a Ferris wheel, Ned Beatty on an artillery cannon, John Belushi on a P-40 Tomahawk, and Bobby Di Cicco on the make! You've got Slim Pickens reprising Major Kong, Robert Stack as a resolute General Stillwell, and Lorraine Gary as an hysterical housewife. There are soldiers, sailor, zoot-suiters, submarines, tanks, toilet jokes, paint factories, machine guns, rockets, explosions, and wild-eyed screaming close-ups. There's John Williams' bombastic orchestral score, there's boogie-woogie, swing, and close-harmony. There are rude ethnic stereotypes and sophomoric sex jokes. There are kicks in the shins and punches in the nose. <br/><br/>There is no subtlety. None. If you're looking for any of that Woody Allen stuff, you might as well watch the Three Stooges for the character development and ""Hamlet"" for the pie fight. <br/><br/>If you took ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" and siphoned off the clever plot, you might get something like ""1941."" ""1941"" retains the riotous excitement Spielberg brought us with ""Sugarland Express,"" but burns off the sorrow of ""Sugarland,"" leaving pure intoxicated joy!<br/><br/>I don't advocate substances either way, but you can still follow ""1941"" no matter how stoned or drunk you are.

","If you like war-themed comedies like ""Kelly's Heroes"", ""MASH"" and sitcoms like ""Hogan's Heroes"" didn't tickle your funny-bone, maybe Steven Spielberg has the key to find your sense of humour. When it came out in 1979, ""1941"" was custom made for fans who want to avoid subtle comedy and love their comedy to be loud, punchy and over-the-top. Sadly, this movie failed at the box office, But when I got the DVD, I actually enjoyed it, not like in a life-changing perspective, sort of like a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>There was once a rumour that went on the before Robert Stack (""Unsolved mysteries"") took the role of General Stilwell, dramatic actors like John Wayne and Charlton Heston were considered for the part. But they rebuffed at the request because of their military background, they thought this movie was irreverent to the real Pearl Harbor incident.<br/><br/>However, setting of the story is real and the details were very accurate. In the year 1941, Americans had a look of concern after they bombed the Japanese, fearing that the Japanese would retaliate by bombing the United States, particularly California as the entire city of Los Angeles was abuzz with fear, paranoia and it showed America at war with a different perspective in their emotional stances. Not to offend anyone, but Americans have made us think that they were brave, fearless and practically laughed in the face of danger. But here we see a refreshing look that proves otherwise. American soldiers were no different from other nations as fear, insecurity and uncertainty was manifesting through the minds of millions of Americans. Japan actually got their revenge, but it was in Washington State, but it didn't last long. Americans protected themselves by setting up concentration camps towards Asian-Americans.<br/><br/>And yet, Spielberg had succeeded to take the time to actually find reason to laugh at all the hysteria. No wonder Wayne and Heston refused to participate in the movie. Sadly for them, this movie was absolutely hilarious in a slapstick manner that works on many levels. the plot was quite narrow thin, just a plethora of gags and spoofs that carry the film in its two hour duration. It may not be for everyone, but before you make any judgments, see it for yourself, even if its for a rental.<br/><br/>The DVD extras feature some very special tidbits, but one of my favourite feature is the ""making of"" and the cast interviews. There's a cornucopia of details in that relates to the scenes featured and scenes they attempted, but didn't quite work including the torpedo coming after civilians. Mr. Spielberg takes the liberty to showcase some home movies that he filmed himself as an inspiration for the making of his project.<br/><br/>The cast is filled with top notch comical actors including the late John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, John Candy, Slim Pickens among others. Not to mention lesser comical performers like Christopher Lee, Robert Stack, Tosiro Mifune and Treat Williams.<br/><br/>The interface can at times be quite troubling. For instance when selecting a scene, it shows sets of six per scene. Unlike other DVD's in this movie, choices are not featured unless you press ENTER. Unless you remember the scene options you will likely be lost. It's unorthodox that they refrained from automatic switching like on every other DVD. It may not be anamorphic, but it's still in letterbox.<br/><br/>If you're into comedy especially the crazy antics of John Belushi and company as it spoofs a weak point in American history during WWII. And if you're all good sports about a comedy poking fun at a time when there was little to laugh about, then you might enjoy this movie. Even if this movie is not your cup of tea, at least check it out before you start to cast the first stone."

","Spielberg cranks things up to about a 14 out of 10, with this overstuffed lunacy about California thrown into hysterics at the notion of a Japanese attack. This gargantuan piece of wretched excess was Spielberg's grand blunder, a director's ego and complete creative control ('creative control' are two words at such odds to what's on screen) that turned a production into a nightmare and doesn't show the slightest sign of discipline. The result is a fantastic mess, that, so help me, I found funny. It's a shapeless film, with characters so broad, Spielberg can barely contain them in the frame and so relentless and aggressive in its destructive zany comedy, that you'll have either submitted to these shenanigans or have a giant question mark stamped onto your face while watching. Looney Tunes creator Chuck Jones was an uncredited creative assistant and seeing how this is basically a live action madcap cartoon, his influence is not surprising and he also was put in charge of a runaway torpedo sequence, that was never filmed. Belushi's character feels like a weird afterthought and forced into this cluttered series of episodic events. While the ice cold reception 1941 received was a sobering experience for the director, its go for broke mayhem style of filmmaking is a real sight to behold. The visuals are fantastic, including some of the best model work, which helped add a troubling amount of shooting days and expense to an already expensive film - and the choreography of numerous scenes involving large crowds are technical marvels. Ambition and ego collide to make one of the great missteps in film history and the result is a glorious mess."

","One more time, Spielberg proves that he is an all around director because his first try at comedy is indeed funny. Faraway of today comedy based a lot on spoofs, here's the humor comes from the situation and the characters. If you add that the production and sets are really top notch, this movie seems to be to Spielberg's what ""Mars attacks"" is to Tim Burton: a big expensive toy that's also a severe punch to role models: all soldiers, Japanese or American, are crazy, their command is stupid and the average people not very bright either. Thus it was interesting to see who were behind this and I was surprised to see that Zemeckis and Gale had written it. In an other hand, it's as fast and past loving as their other production. But what I remember most of that movie, it's his nostalgic power, almost like turning the pages of a family album: Sure there are a lot of young faces that will become more famous in the 80. But, the plane romance takes me back to my teens fantasy and beyond i got stuck with Dianne Kay's casting. I was certain that i had seen her before but was unable to pick up the production. Back home, IMDb told me that she was a daughter in the ""Eight and a half"" show that I watched indeed as a kid. Now, i have absolutely no idea of any episodes but seeing the pics, all the members of that family is familiar. <br/><br/>Pairing: ""Saving Private Ryan"": two sides of the same coin: war"

","i really don't know what to say about war movies much. mostly i hate war, mostly. but i'm fascinated by it because i'm fascinated by history and war is often a important part of history. but i'm against war, and i'm not even sure our so called ""good"" wars, aren't just a bunch of gut reactions by a whole lot of insane and stupid people driven mad with power.<br/><br/>i always thought this movie was pretty funny. much of it is overdone in to overkill, and it eventually doesn't warrant the expense and hullabaloo of it's humungo budget because of it's persistently low brow humour and irreverent silliness. but i have to admit it's pretty damn funny and it actually seems funnier now than it did some thirty something years ago. like the John Landis comedy spectacle, 'The Blues Bros. Movie', they just don't make em quite like this anymore. especially when they totaled a real house in Pacific Pallisades at the end.<br/><br/>i suppose it also helps to like dumb humour on a 'Three Stooges Level'. there is lots of wacko antics here and a basic conviction that basically all people are hopeless idiots and pretty much deserve to be ""hoisted by their own petards"".<br/><br/>strangely even though this movie doesn't seem to be big on much commentary except that war is funny. a dubious observation if any. but it does have somewhat of a anti-war statement. hey it even features a hilarious Slim Pickens from 'The Dr. Strangelove' comedy. it also makes a good statement that comes from Dan Ackroyd when he states that ""it sickens me to see Americans fighting other Americans"" when he observes a pointless ""zoot suit"" riot.<br/><br/>much of the humour is done for goofy laughs mostly. like a the volunteer citizen on top of a ferris wheel doing night watch with a obnoxious, idiot kid with a ventriloquist dummy. or like the housewife who knocks on the window of her kitchen as her nit wit, half blind husband almost shoots a missle launcher at the house.<br/><br/>a lot of the humour can also be kind of scary and unsympathetic with people. i doubt it's strange detachment to war comes from it's screen writer John Milius, who was known for extreme jingoistic right wing values as in his screenplay for 'Red Dawn'. but this film seems strangely hostile to it's protagonist and their feverent patriotism. at times it almost seems too hate them in a scathing way as it sneers at their folly and lunacy. this movie even makes funny light of a rape attempt on the teenage girl by Treat Williams Army officer. it also seems to think old, fashioned southern racism is funny. which it kind of is.<br/><br/>for me personally, the high point of the film was when Gen. Stillwell, who was a real person, ignores the outside events as he sits in a movie theatre happily watching Disney's 'Dumbo', which was released a few weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor in 41.<br/><br/>this film does make a staement ""about Americans fighting other Americans"" that seems even more profound and relevant in these hopelessly partisan times.<br/><br/>mostly played for goofy guffaws, this is a pretty funny film comedy with lots to recommend it it terms of American history and a certain amount of war statement. at least i thought it was pretty funny."

","Outlandish, out-of-control farce takes place post-Pearl Harbor, as American forces prepare for the next Japanese invasion. While the Japs spend most of the time searching for Hollywood as their next target, the streets of Los Angeles are rampant with scattered, goofball antics, making this more slapstick than satire. It draws inspiration from National Lampoon's Animal House, in which nothing is comprehensible, focus continues to shift between multiple characters, and the jokes are really hit-or-miss. Despite a likable cast and great John Williams score, the soft cinematography hinders the experience. It's hard to tell what was intentional and what was experimental. Faults aside, it is a more unique undertaking for director Spielberg, and certainly a far call from your traditional WWII epic; nothing memorable, but somewhat enjoyable."

","1941 is Steven Spielberg's take on comedy thrust upon the war nerves experienced by Californians following the first few days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. This brings in an all-star comedy cast to deliver the fast and furious jokes that are almost non-stop. Unfortunately, the movie falls short of either comedic masterpiece, or cohesive storytelling. This is not to say the movie was a total washout, because there are some very funny moments, but that is not enough to save 1941 from itself. The all-star cast includes Tim Matheson, John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, Nancy Allen, Bobby DiCicco, Treat Williams, John Candy, Robert Stack and a slew of other Hollywood legends. The movie's comedy does work in many instances. One of the best scenarios developed well was Murray Hamilton trapped on a Ferris Wheel with Eddie Deezen and a dummy. Another was the tank group under the command of Sgt. Frank Trees played by Dan Akroyd. Probably the best was John Belushi as Wild Bill Kelso, a dimwitted Army Air Corpse pilot looking for Japanese in his P40 Tomahawk. And of course, there is a lost Japanese Submarine that wants to inflict damage on Hollywood. There are good performances, too. Belush is genius, conveying the lunacy and determination of someone who isn't all there. The communication in his eyes, and the way he thrust himself into the role is fantastic. Tim Matheson pulls off a great job, too, being a guy who wants to score with Nancy Allen on a plane. However, the comedy and performances are for naught. For the most part, the plot is too scattered and not focused. Let's see, Wally wants to dance with Betty, while Treat Williams tries to steal her away. Matheson is the horny guy who wants to score with Nancy Allen who has planes on the brain. A Japanese Submarine is lost while two guys are stuck in a Ferris Wheel and a tank team is trying to suppress a riot. Just who is the main character? There is no focus or cohesion to this story. It finally comes together towards the end, but it is too late for the lost audience who has to follow too many story lines. The other problem is the comedy, that does misfire. Spielberg gives us too many close-up shots of people screaming and yelling, somehow thinking this is funny. Moreover, the destruction is so overblown it becomes boring. Does Dan Akroyd have to shoot out every light? Again, this is not a total washout. It does have it's moments. Unfortunately, 1941 is one that is hard to fully dis, or fully recommend."

Sorry to say that the story was really bad though and the movie wasn't as funny as I would like to see. It was directed by Steven Spielberg, so you get to see a lot of action and damage. So the action plus the fun to watch characters is what made this movie OK since it was so bad other wise. Now out of all the characters, there were two that really made me laugh. First was Dan Aykroyd. He didn't have the biggest part and in the beginning he was not too amusing. Later though he gets hit in the head and gets crazy. That is what made me laugh. Then you have John Belushi. His character was funny no matter what he was doing. So overall again, it was just an OK movie.

","This film is not considered one of Steven Spielbergs greatest movies, in fact it is usually considered one of his most disappointing flicks on his resume. Me, I actually enjoyed this movie for what it was. Its main problem from me stems from the fact it is rather long and comedies that tend to go beyond the one hour 45 minute mark are getting a tad to long. The film is basically about a Japanese submarine that causes the residents of Hollywood to get very paranoid. In their paranoia they do some wild and crazy things. Featuring Saturday Night alum Dan Akroyd and John Belushi and a whole slew of other actors this movie sends one on a crazy ride. Though to me John Belushi steals the show as he makes an immediate impression as a pilot who stops at a gas station to gas up his plane. Also making a bit of a humorous impression is fellow alum Dan Akroyd who was very funny near the end during the tank ride. Also of note in this film is Robert Stack who is not the funniest person in the film, but still manages some good laughs as he sits watching the Disney film ""Dumbo"". A lot of the film though is just things blowing up which is not necessarily a good thing in a comedy film. The story at times is here and there and I was not overly happy with the ending mainly because as a kid I wanted to know if John Belushi's character somehow got out of the situation he was in. Still, I enjoyed this film and do not understand why people dislike it so much."

","""1941"" was a brave attempt (and only one to date) at slapstick comedy from Steven Spielberg's part. He already said years ago that when he first read the Gale and Zemeckis script, he couldn't stop laughing. So, how come this promising comedy with a #1 director at the helm was coldly received by audiences and reviewers alike as ""unfunny"" in 1979? Clearly, the major problem with this film was that the way Spielberg created this movie in 1979 was not in phase with the standards of the time.<br/><br/>One remark that was often used in many '70s reviews of ""1941"" was that it was too loud! Too noisy!! People felt the need to put their hands on their ears while watching it. Everybody in that film was screaming!!... The sometimes fast paced editing was VERY intense too for audiences who were almost scandalized by such attack on their senses. Remember, we were in 1979. Disco was at its peak and worst, WWII movies were as outdated as the western genre back in those days. At the box-office, Grease was still the big picture.<br/><br/>In 1979, comedy was mainly on TV with shows like ""Three's company"", ""M*A*S*H, All in the family, etc... In fact, one of the last successful comedy at the box office before ""1941"" was the smooth 1978 ""Heaven can wait"" with Warren Beatty. It is not hard to understand that within this context, the enormous and noisy ""1941"" could not find its place. This film would have been much more successful in the late 90's or early 2000's with the video game generation. The proof is that it has now reach a cult status much deserved.<br/><br/>Full of wonderful actors with plenty of references about the golden age era of Hollywood slapstick comedies, ""1941"" was truly a labor of love from Spielberg, who I wish had not disavowed his own creation and should have stand by it over the years."

","To begin with, I consider Spielberg to be one of Hollywood's most overrated film-makers; thankfully, every so often, a dud effort such as this one comes along to remind us just how erratic his talent really is! For the record, I had watched the released 118-minute version on Italian TV as a kid but, checking out the longer ""Director's Cut"", I recalled precious little of it – so that I could not tell what constituted the new footage; frankly, I am glad I did not rush out to purchase the ""Collector's Edition"" DVD, since I was pretty much let down by the whole thing. The idea of treating the fear of further attacks on American soil after Pearl Harbor as a comedy was certainly sound – and typical of the freewheeling 1970s – yet I cannot help feeling that Spielberg was the wrong choice for it; the result (reliant on ""Saturday Night Live""-type routines) is grossly self-indulgent that, in view of an overall lack of structure and heavy-handed approach, becomes increasingly tiresome and ultimately uninvolving! Given my harsh judgment so far, one might be forgiven in wondering why I rated it the way I did rather than opt for an even lesser evaluation; well, the eclectic all-star cast does lend the film some weight – with Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi (in one of his signature roles as a gung-ho but inept fighter pilot), Christopher Lee (speaking exclusively in German throughout!), Toshiro Mifune, Slim Pickens and Robert Stack (as an American General displaying child-like enthusiasm at a screening of Walt Disney's DUMBO [1941]!) coming off best; for the rest, we get references to (and three cast members from) Spielberg's own JAWS (1975) – including an inspired semi-recreation/spoof of that film's memorable opening sequence! Still, most of the youngsters (who, alas, take up much of the running-time) prove merely bland, while a number of would-be star cameos (notably Samuel Fuller's) fall resoundingly flat!; for what it is worth, I did not catch director John Landis' appearance, the ubiquitous Dick Miller is on hand, and Mickey Rourke makes his debut here too! One last thing: I wonder what American audiences – or, for that matter, the people who made it – think of the film nowadays in view of 9/11..."

I also thought that John Belushi was incredible as Wild Bill Kelso. Another scene that I like was were Dan Aykroyd put a pair of nylons over his head and put two oranges inside and over his eyes, and he describes it as: ""I'm a bug!""

The comedic performances of the numerous stars involved were all top rate. And above it all, Spielberg kept the action true to the time! OK, maybe it is not the deepest of comedies but I rank it up there with 'Animal House' and 'Caddyshack' when it comes to outstandingly funny movies.

","I originally had this movie rated as a solid B (8 out of 10) but I just upgraded to a 9 (A-). This is really Steven Spielberg having fun - it's a movie, a LOUD movie, a movie that could have been thought up by boys in some back yard sandbox playing with their army men and had a large budget for special effects like an A-Bomb to drop on them. It has a LOT of laughs. Belushi is a cartoonish over the top pilot. In fact, everyone is cartoonish and zany, and in the heart of it all is the one voice of reason, General Stillwall, who wanders through all this. Gale and Zemeckis (the screenwriters) actually based a lot of the story on historical events and did their homework - there really was a blackout in CA one night where someone possibly reported an enemy plane was flying above, there really was a Japanese Sub that got off the coast of Cali, there really were Zoot Suit Riots. This movie has more history in 5 minutes than Pearl Harbor does in it's whole 3 hr entirety. A whole mess of stars show up and it's fun seeing them have fun. I loved seeing this when I was 8 years old when it was released and I think I love it more now. Watch it usually once a year and like it more each time. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed if you are looking for a ""movie"" (fun) and not a ""film"" (serious). The laserdisc and the DVD have the director's cut, which is worth the extra scenes.... Spielberg recognizes this as his first mistake after his two big hits, I disagree -- I wish he'd do another slam-bang-comedy-action flick like this rather than the childish-dumbed down tripe that was A.I. -- at least 1941 didn't try to make a statement and insult the audience's intelligence. It's dumb, loud and proud and a hell of a lot of fun. Grade A- (9 out of 10). ""Lemmie hear your guns! Na-na-na-na-na-na!"""

Its not awful per say it just doesn't work as a comedy. The script by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is peppered with good ideas but the resulting film is a mess - incoherent in places, meandering and unsure of its focus. Spielberg well and truly loses his grip on the thing very early on and some imaginative sequences aside, generally doesn't know who its about or where they all fit into the directionless escapade. You can watch it in a neutral kind of way but most of it falls flat and after 90 minutes or so you just want to shut half the cast up. Luckily for Spielberg and the two Bobs they were more than talented enough to bounce back but this movie ALMOST scuppered Back to the Future and for that alone you may want to look at it like the celluloid equivalent of a the friend who tired to run off with your girlfriend and destroy your relationship.

I give this film the big 4 even though it deserves a two but the last hour pumped the score up a little. But that does not save 1941, skip the film unless you rewind the film to it's last hour."
"ignatz928","5","0","1","16 June 2005"," Spielberg's would-be comedy
","Spielberg's famously disastrous comedy is kind of like the Heaven's Gate of comedies. Not because it was one of the expensive debacles that came out at around the same time (which it was), nor because it's as bad as Heaven's Gate (it isn't). The main link between these two otherwise dissimilar films is how they are both overwhelmed by the scale of their productions. Though Michael Cimino and Spielberg both produced films that were undeniably impressive as spectacles, somewhere along the way they forgot to also make films that would be, respectively, exciting or funny. Of course, Cimino had probably decided that it was beneath him to make a movie that would be ""merely"" exciting. Obviously making a Western was just too lowbrow for the maker of The Deer Hunter. 1941 doesn't possess anything close to the suffocating pretentiousness of Heaven's Gate; in fact the opposite is true. Both movies are equally stupid, but at least 1941 knows that it's stupid. Spielberg does actually try to fulfill the requirements of the genre he is working in, unlike Cimino. The problem with 1941 is how clearly you can see Spielberg trying to be funny. Comedy is like dance; it doesn't work if you can see the effort. The filmmakers' (especially Spielberg's) mistake was in thinking that physical destruction on its own is funny. Because of this approach, we are treated to the sights of: a tank crashing through a paint factory (and then a paint-thinner factory); a Japanese sub shelling an amusement park; a man trying to hit the sub with an anti-aircraft gun blowing apart his own house; the whole house falling into the ocean; and much, much more. What Spielberg and his collaborators seem to have forgotten is that destruction, however absurdly over-scaled, generally only works as the punch line to a gag. In Used Cars, which shares with 1941 the same writing team, Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, one of the funniest scenes involves one of the used-car salesman wrecking cars on his rival's lot. The scene works because of the salesman's demented spiel, while the destructiveness serves only to cap off the scene. In 1941, however, the human element gets lost amid the epic scale. The cast is impressive, but the actors seem to have been selected on a sort of rabbit's foot-type theory- hey, if we cast famous comedy stars or character actors, their talent will sort of rub off on the movie! John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd appear as, respectively, a crazed pilot and a pompous tank commander. Both of them seem to have been hired on the assumption that anything they did would be funny, without much thought as to how they might fit into the movie. Belushi, who is particularly out of place, does his shtick from Animal House but not nearly as funnily. Tim Matheson is also called on to reprise his role in Animal House, but not to much effect. John Candy plays a racist sergeant, which is apparently supposed to be funny in itself. In addition to then-current comedy stars, Spielberg also enlists a gallery of famous character actors. Warren Oates plays a Dr. Strangelove-type commander, and does not display any previously untapped knack for comedy. Elisha Cook Jr. shows up for about thirty seconds to get shot at by John Belushi. Slim Pickens is put to better use, as a drunken lumberjack who, in the movie's funniest scene, encounters a group of Japanese sailors and tries to chop them down with his ax. (Ironically, and incredibly, this scene was cut from the theatrical version, perhaps on the basis that what audiences really wanted was more scenes with Bobby Di Cicco). Robert Stack and Toshiro Mifune as, respectively, General Stilwell and a Japanese sub commander, are the only actors who emerge with any dignity intact. Stack also gets the movie's second funniest scene, tearfully watching Dumbo as a riot rages outside. The movie's visual scope is undeniably impressive. The sets are huge, while the costumes and props are characteristically impeccable. And I can't deny that part of me thoroughly enjoyed seeing all of this luxurious period detail get systematically trashed and destroyed, not to mention wasted on such a gleefully moronic movie. However, even on the visuals Spielberg and his collaborators shot themselves in the foot. Spielberg and his cinematographer, William Fraker, chose a fuzzy, smoke-filled visual style which generally just makes the movie look out of focus, when 1941 should have looked as bright and sharp as a Looney Tunes cartoon."
"gftbiloxi","5","0","1","9 April 2005"," Typical Spiellberg
","In the documentary that accompanies this director's cut version, now available on DVD, Spielberg makes the comment that he agreed to direct 1941 for the simple reason that he didn't have anything better to do at the time. It was an attitude that didn't bode well for the film, and the final result was one of the most horrific critical and box office disasters of the late 1970s: a film that opened with tremendous hype one night and all but vanished from theatre screens the next.<br/><br/>I did not see the original release, which I understand was quite a bit different from this director's cut, so I can't say if I find the present version better or worse. But I can say it isn't as bad as you may have heard. (Indeed, in some respects it is better than most Spielberg films, for it generally lacks the ham-handed sentimentality so typical of his work.) All the same, I can also say that it isn't as good as some would have you believe. As slapstick comedies go, it is only incidentally funny.<br/><br/>The premise is intriguing. In the wake of Pearl Harbor, Californians have fallen prey to the fear that they will be the next attacked--and that fear spawns an increasing paranoia. If the writers (and Spielberg himself, who apparently egged them on) had focused on this, 1941 might actually have been a truly memorable comedy... but instead the film rips and snorts in every direction imaginable in an effort to cram in everything from riffs on DR. STRANGELOVE to the Los Angeles ""Zoot Suit Riots"" to expensive special effects pratfalls that are only mildly amusing at best.<br/><br/>The plot inevitably splits into several different directions, and the result is rather like IT'S MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD meets ANIMAL HOUSE and the two do a belly flop into a bucket of Hollywood gloss--but without making much of splash. Many of the individual performers are quite good (Slim Pickens, Ned Beatty, and Treat Williams particularly so), and many of the situations have tremendous potential. But in the final analysis, 1941 is the sort of film that you don't bother to pause when you go to the bathroom.<br/><br/>That said, the DVD package is quite nice: the film looks good, and I was particularly impressed with the sound. There isn't a director's commentary track, but there is a rather lengthy ""making of"" documentary that includes extended interviews and home-movies taken of the set that provide behind-the-scenes glimpses of the cast, most particularly of the late great John Belushi. Fans of the Spielberg style will likely adore the whole thing, but for rest of us... this is a rental you won't mind returning the next day. Whether you finished watching it or not.<br/><br/>Gary F.

","I saw this movie as a kid and thought is was funny. As an adult, I really enjoyed the way the movie makes fun of the hysteria of a very scary time. My father was a little kid in Los Angeles during WWII. He said he would have nightmares of Japanese soldiers parachuting into his neighborhood when he was just 6 years old. It was a unique time in our history and despite the fact this movie is a comedy, it really explores how various characters react to that reality. It's a great movie to watch for it's special effects. This movie was made pre-CGI, and makes use of excellent model miniatures and stunt work. That creates a look that you don't really see anymore in films. Even though the models of cities don't look realistic, they create a look that seems like a child's dream like imagination - like when you were a kid playing with toys:<br/><br/>The toys soldiers weren't really soldiers, but your imagination made them so.

"mechmaniac","7","0","3","4 January 2004"," For Spielberg, a turn for the better.
","I think that in history there has always been a fine line between a great success and a great flop in film. Especially when it involves comedy. For instance... when ""The Producers"" first came out in the late 1960's, it had been a fledgling director's first film, to us today he is known as the legendary Mel Brooks, perhaps the only director capable of out-doing nemesis director Woody Allen's wit. But this was a treacherous first step for Brooks to make, as it turned out, because of its bold humor about Nazi Germany that made many critics think it was one step away from being a ""love letter to Hitler himself"", as one character himself explains the plot to another. It was overshadowed by well-accomplished films of the period, such as ""The Graduate"" which actually opened on the same night. ""The Producers"" would have all but disappeared forever, if not for a very well written and widely published positive review by Peter Sellers, years after the film arrived in theaters which applauded the film for its audacity and for a rare genius which was something new in a world of slapstick humor. Today, after renewed interest, Mel Brooks has re-written it for Broadway and has become a smash-hit. Ironically, it has been a story which wins the audience of millions of Broadway-show goers with a story about two men trying to defraud Broadway, and the movie is redeeming itself today with the tremendous of sales its' made. I believe the same treacherous first step has occurred with 1941. Many people feel that it hits too close to the tragedy at Pearl Harbor and pokes fun at the competence of the ability of our determined soldiers that held the fort in our country during a time of war and paranoia of further Japanese attack. I am now waiting for the day when one well-known and very respected critic takes the time to give the film a fresh look, and will acknowledge Spielberg's great gumption at attempting a comedy about so sensitive a subject to many, and that the movie employs a plethora of legendary actors who gets their best product while in their prime here, while STILL allowing World War II veterans to retain their dignity. Until that day, I will be the one to say that I knew it was a great movie all along."

"ColeSear","3","0","1","14 August 2002"," Hard to Believe It's Spielberg (Spoilers)
","Here is concrete proof that comedy is unquestionably the hardest genre to succeed in. Without trying to get inside Spielberg's head and trying to determine exactly what it was that he was trying to do with this film, one can look at it as is and be left scratching their head. It is at best funny in small patches and most definitely a humongous waste of talent both on and off camera. I applaud Spielberg for not only making a huge departure from his big successes (Close Encounters and Jaws) but also for poking fun at the latter in the opening sequence of the latter film. This stands out as one of the few truly comic sequences throughout a film that is plagued by many difficulties. This film especially pales in retrospect considering that I've laughed much more during his action/adventure and sci-fi films and this film doesn't seem to make any sincere satirical jabs at the paranoia in the United States following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, nor does it really succeed at being a farce. In its better moments, which were few and far between, 1941 is hysterical. More often than not, however, 1941is poorly executed slapstick, ham-handed, off-the-wall nonsense that follows the wrong characters and actors. So that this isn't a complete diatribe there are some wonderful performances to be found here but as I've mentioned above these people make their exit from the film much too early. Probably the best performance in this ""all-star"" cast was that of Slim Pickens. He delivered not only some of the best lines of the film but delivered them only as he could with that imitable voice of his. Elisha Cook was also there but that's about all what strikes me as really being odd is how ill-utilized these actors were. Most of the cast was a mish-mash of SCTV and Saturday Night Live stars who really didn't do anything noteworthy. Dan Aykroyd got to do some of his shtick but his performance was undermined by some stupid writing, when towards the end for no reason known to man he went bonkers and exclaimed, ""I'm a bug,"" while he had wrapped oranges over his eyes with pantyhose. It got worse though John Candy, one of the funniest people who ever lived was just there for seemingly no reason, it was as if the casting director went amuck knowing that Spielberg could get any actors he wanted and got big names to do meaningless roles. Another under used player was Joseph P. Flaherty who provided the film with one of its best lines following the USO riot (""Maybe in the future we could have some Negroes come in and we'll have a race riot."") was also hardly there. Then there was Belushi, who I've always found overrated, doing an annoying version of the Penguin from Batman. He was occasionally funny in this and in other roles but overall I was unimpressed. The big problem this film had was that it was more likely to lose its audience before tying all the storylines together. The additional factor of having the last 45 minutes of the film being one explosion, crash or pratfall after another didn't help much at all. Another factor that didn't help this film was that on home video (apparently this version is somewhat different than the theatrical release) it is 2 hours long, it's very difficult to do a comedy that lasts more than 90 minutes long. About the only thing that made me realize that this was a Spielberg film was the inclusion of the Dumbo screening, which was both fitting to the story and helped me make it through that part of that performance because it is one of Disney's finer works. The score was also a non-entity and I didn't even think Spielberg worked with John Williams. The writing was also schizophrenic, spotty and unusually unfunny most of the time and I was almost shocked to find that Robert Zemeckis had a hand in writing it. It's as if everyone was embarrassed with the end result so that there were no opening credits only closing ones."

","At some point, every film maker has his off days.  Steven Spielberg is fortunate enough that he's had only two films like that (the other being HOOK).  But ""1941"", being made when it was, in the wake of JAWS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, almost destroyed his career.  Having seen this film a number of times, I can see why.<br/><br/>This is a high-budget farce about the hysteria that gripped Los Angeles after a Japanese sub was spotted off the coast (which actually happened in February 1942, but the story backdates it to a week after Pearl Harbor).  A lot of great comic actors--Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, John Candy, Tim Matheson, Treat Williams--are on hand here.  Robert Stack delivers a somewhat skewed but faithful impersonation of General Joseph Stilwell.  And three members of Sam Peckinpah's stock company--Warren Oates, Slim Pickens, and Dub Taylor--are also thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>But given all this talent and the story's potential, ""1941"" still falls flat, because for all the sight gags, explosions, and comic mugging, the film rarely delivers on the laughs.  There are moments that are hysterically funny, but those are only MOMENTS.  Part of this has to do with the Bob Gale/Robert Zemeckis screenplay (they would later make the ultra-superior BACK TO THE FUTURE for Spielberg), but much of the blame must be put on Spielberg's shoulders.  Even HE admitted that this film was a mistake, stating once ""Comedy is not my forte.""  And it wasn't.  Critics and audiences hated it, and it's all too easy to see why.  When you've got a lot of sound and fury in a comedy but you neglect to get the audience to laugh constantly (as in AIRPLANE!), all you've got is a lot of sound and fury. John Williams' jaunty martial music may be the best thing about ""1941"". Otherwise, this film would be a total waste--and as a longtime fan of Spielberg's, it isn't easy for me to say that."
